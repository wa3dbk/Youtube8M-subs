subscribers<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.700> year<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.060> it's<00:03:47.150> very<00:03:47.360> slow

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
subscribers in a year so it's very slow

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.509 
subscribers in a year so it's very slow
next<00:03:48.440> year<00:03:48.620> was<00:03:48.769> about<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:48.980> thousand

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.090 
next year was about a thousand
subscribers<00:03:49.750> again<00:03:50.750> quite<00:03:51.019> slow<00:03:51.320> then<00:03:51.920> the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
subscribers again quite slow then the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.740 
subscribers again quite slow then the
following<00:03:52.519> year<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.730> hundred<00:03:52.970> thousand<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:53.720> I

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
following year a hundred thousand so I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.199

DLC<00:04:42.830> was<00:04:43.039> nicely<00:04:43.550> done<00:04:43.850> because<00:04:44.509> you<00:04:44.600> got

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
DLC was nicely done because you got

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.719 
DLC was nicely done because you got
something<00:04:45.139> every<00:04:45.500> single<00:04:45.680> month<00:04:46.039> so<00:04:46.669> you

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
something every single month so you

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.100 
something every single month so you
could<00:04:46.970> look<00:04:47.120> forward<00:04:47.389> to<00:04:47.539> something<00:04:47.750> every

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
single month and but it wasn't quite as

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.900 
single month and but it wasn't quite as
epic<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:51.889> know<00:04:52.009> people<00:04:52.280> didn't<00:04:52.460> get<00:04:52.550> quite<00:04:52.820> as

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.040 
year so about every two to three months
I<00:05:03.020> prefer<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:04.160> big<00:05:04.370> launches<00:05:05.330> of<00:05:05.570> black<00:05:05.840> ops

ops 2 in all honesty I know it's the
latest<00:05:20.570> one<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.169> probably<00:05:21.320> a<00:05:21.470> lot<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.590> people

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
latest one and probably a lot of people

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.100 
latest one and probably a lot of people
would<00:05:21.919> say<00:05:22.099> that<00:05:22.340> but<00:05:22.639> I<00:05:22.849> really<00:05:23.509> like<00:05:23.810> the

all my friends at school had one I only
bought<00:06:21.470> on<00:06:21.590> xbox360<00:06:22.400> because<00:06:22.610> over<00:06:22.849> DLC<00:06:23.300> comes

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
bought on xbox360 because over DLC comes

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.760

out<00:06:23.780> on<00:06:23.900> their<00:06:24.110> first<00:06:24.320> and

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
out on their first and

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.460 
out on their first and
so<00:06:26.479> there's<00:06:27.479> honestly<00:06:27.930> very<00:06:27.960> little

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
so there's honestly very little

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.740 
so there's honestly very little
difference<00:06:28.889> I<00:06:29.130> mean<00:06:29.310> maybe<00:06:29.729> if<00:06:30.030> you<00:06:30.240> prefer

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750

the exclusives on one console go for

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.350
