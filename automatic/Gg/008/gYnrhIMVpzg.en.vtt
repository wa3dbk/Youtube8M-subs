00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:19.839 
but actually it worked very well I think
it's<00:02:08.479> terrific<00:02:08.629> yeah

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.750 

I'm<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.019> new<00:02:21.140> film<00:02:21.439> yes<00:02:22.249> I<00:02:22.430> think<00:02:22.489> that's

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
I'm the new film yes I think that's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.239 
I'm the new film yes I think that's
smashing<00:02:23.120> -<00:02:23.299> I'm<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:24.019> was<00:02:24.499> against<00:02:24.889> that<00:02:25.010> for<00:02:25.219> a

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:25.249 
smashing - I'm I was against that for a

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:37.200 
smashing - I'm I was against that for a
few<00:02:25.489> decades<00:02:25.900> but<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.950> water

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.270 

so<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:39.110> fact<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.410> somebody's<00:02:39.800> created

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
so the fact that somebody's created

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.120 
so the fact that somebody's created
something<00:02:40.840> absolutely<00:02:41.840> no<00:02:42.350> genre<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.950> you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130
