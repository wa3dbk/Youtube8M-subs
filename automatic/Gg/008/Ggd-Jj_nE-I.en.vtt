brand new anime studio 10 tutorials so I

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.440 
brand new anime studio 10 tutorials so I
hope<00:00:13.950> you're<00:00:14.130> ready<00:00:14.280> because<00:00:14.550> we're<00:00:15.120> about<00:00:15.300> to

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
hope you're ready because we're about to

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.700 
hope you're ready because we're about to
get<00:00:15.570> started

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.900 

sometimes<00:00:21.710> we<00:00:21.920> can<00:00:22.040> work<00:00:22.220> with<00:00:22.250> some<00:00:22.670> pretty

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
sometimes we can work with some pretty

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.360 
sometimes we can work with some pretty
complicated<00:00:23.570> stuff<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:24.110> anime<00:00:24.710> studio<00:00:24.920> and

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
complicated stuff in anime studio and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.690 
complicated stuff in anime studio and
this<00:00:26.090> can<00:00:26.270> refer<00:00:26.570> to<00:00:26.600> both<00:00:27.050> objects<00:00:27.770> and<00:00:27.950> bones

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
this can refer to both objects and bones

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.840 
this can refer to both objects and bones
so<00:00:29.660> sometimes<00:00:29.960> like<00:00:30.890> in<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.070> example<00:00:31.190> here

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
so sometimes like in the example here

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.300 
so sometimes like in the example here
let's<00:00:32.510> say<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:32.720> have<00:00:32.960> two<00:00:33.230> shapes<00:00:33.620> on<00:00:33.860> a<00:00:33.920> layer

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
let's say you have two shapes on a layer

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.869 
let's say you have two shapes on a layer
that<00:00:34.850> are<00:00:35.000> intersecting<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.489> we<00:00:37.489> have<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> nose

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
that are intersecting so we have a nose

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.560 
that are intersecting so we have a nose
here<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:38.540> then<00:00:38.720> we<00:00:38.840> have<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:39.950> eye<00:00:39.980> right<00:00:40.129> here

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
here and then we have the eye right here

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.510 
here and then we have the eye right here
so<00:00:41.570> this<00:00:41.809> is<00:00:41.840> just<00:00:42.170> for<00:00:42.350> an<00:00:42.530> example<00:00:42.590> just<00:00:43.070> for

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
so this is just for an example just for

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.700 
so this is just for an example just for
demonstration<00:00:43.730> purposes<00:00:44.600> but<00:00:45.260> let's<00:00:45.470> say

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
demonstration purposes but let's say

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.790 
demonstration purposes but let's say
that<00:00:46.340> you're<00:00:47.120> trying<00:00:47.450> to<00:00:47.570> click<00:00:47.900> on<00:00:48.080> a<00:00:48.440> point

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
that you're trying to click on a point

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.850 
that you're trying to click on a point
for<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:49.220> nose<00:00:49.660> but<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:50.720> keep<00:00:51.110> accidentally

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
for the nose but you keep accidentally

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.950 
for the nose but you keep accidentally
grabbing<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:52.400> point<00:00:53.090> because<00:00:53.480> if<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.720> look

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
grabbing the I point because if you look

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.310 
grabbing the I point because if you look
right<00:00:54.950> here<00:00:55.360> they're<00:00:56.360> very<00:00:56.750> close<00:00:57.020> together

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
right here they're very close together

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.930 
right here they're very close together
so<00:00:57.590> let's<00:00:57.950> say<00:00:58.040> you're<00:00:58.190> trying<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.670> get<00:00:58.820> in

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
so let's say you're trying to get in

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.160 
so let's say you're trying to get in
there<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.210> you're<00:00:59.450> just<00:00:59.570> trying<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.930> find

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
there and you're just trying to find

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.660 
there and you're just trying to find
tune<00:01:00.500> things<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.040> you're<00:01:01.100> having<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.460> hard

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
tune things and you're having a hard

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.079 
tune things and you're having a hard
time<00:01:01.730> grabbing<00:01:02.270> that<00:01:02.570> point<00:01:02.960> well<00:01:03.860> with<00:01:04.460> anime

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
time grabbing that point well with anime

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.530 
time grabbing that point well with anime
studio<00:01:05.270> 10<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.320> can<00:01:06.500> now<00:01:06.710> hide<00:01:07.220> points<00:01:07.940> when

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
studio 10 you can now hide points when

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.570 
studio 10 you can now hide points when
you<00:01:08.570> are<00:01:08.810> working<00:01:08.990> which<00:01:09.800> can<00:01:10.009> make<00:01:10.130> things<00:01:10.190> a

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
you are working which can make things a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.060 
you are working which can make things a
lot<00:01:10.729> easier<00:01:11.000> when<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:11.990> comes<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.440> grabbing

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
lot easier when it comes to grabbing

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.030 
lot easier when it comes to grabbing
objects<00:01:13.520> or<00:01:13.700> animating<00:01:14.570> things<00:01:14.780> out<00:01:15.040> so

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
objects or animating things out so

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.260 
objects or animating things out so
there's<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.280> couple<00:01:16.430> ways<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:16.729> could<00:01:17.060> go<00:01:17.180> about

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
there's a couple ways you could go about

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.990 
there's a couple ways you could go about
this<00:01:17.690> first<00:01:18.470> let's<00:01:18.830> say<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.009> want<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.460> grab

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
this first let's say you want to grab

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.170 
this first let's say you want to grab
the<00:01:20.660> point<00:01:20.990> on<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.290> eye<00:01:21.910> well<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:23.060> could

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
the point on the eye well you could

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.029 
the point on the eye well you could
select<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.630> nose<00:01:23.810> like<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.229> have<00:01:24.440> here<00:01:24.890> and

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
select the nose like I have here and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:31.800 
select the nose like I have here and
then<00:01:25.910> go<00:01:25.940> up<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.569> draw<00:01:28.270> hide<00:01:29.270> selected<00:01:29.690> points

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
then go up to draw hide selected points

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.660 
then go up to draw hide selected points
you<00:01:32.810> can<00:01:32.990> see<00:01:33.200> now<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:33.440> those<00:01:33.979> points<00:01:34.520> are

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
you can see now that those points are

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.010 
you can see now that those points are
hidden<00:01:35.030> from<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:37.190> nose<00:01:37.429> and<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:38.539> can<00:01:38.720> continue

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
hidden from the nose and I can continue

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.529 
hidden from the nose and I can continue
now<00:01:39.289> to<00:01:39.350> come<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.250> here<00:01:40.459> and<00:01:40.520> adjust<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.119> if

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
now to come in here and adjust the I if

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.949 
now to come in here and adjust the I if
I<00:01:41.660> wish<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.440> points<00:01:42.950> are<00:01:43.130> still<00:01:43.429> there<00:01:44.179> on<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
I wish the points are still there on the

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.710 
I wish the points are still there on the
nose<00:01:45.110> they're<00:01:45.920> just<00:01:46.190> hidden<00:01:46.369> now<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.330> thing

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
nose they're just hidden now the thing

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.589 
nose they're just hidden now the thing
about<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.289> if<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.670> decide<00:01:50.030> then<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.450> do

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599 
about this is if you decide then to do

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.080 
about this is if you decide then to do
some<00:01:50.840> point<00:01:51.080> animation<00:01:51.709> you<00:01:52.220> won't<00:01:52.490> have<00:01:52.819> any

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
some point animation you won't have any

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.150 
some point animation you won't have any
of<00:01:53.330> those<00:01:53.450> points<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:54.110> are<00:01:54.229> hidden<00:01:54.410> show<00:01:54.950> up

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
of those points that are hidden show up

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.089 
of those points that are hidden show up
on<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.580> timeline<00:01:55.929> so<00:01:56.929> this<00:01:57.590> can<00:01:57.740> be<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.890> great

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
on the timeline so this can be a great

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.980 
on the timeline so this can be a great
way<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.280> isolate<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.119> then<00:01:59.360> animate<00:01:59.780> things

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
way to isolate and then animate things

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.740 
way to isolate and then animate things
out<00:02:00.259> while<00:02:01.130> not<00:02:01.429> worrying<00:02:01.880> what<00:02:02.119> will<00:02:02.270> happen

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
out while not worrying what will happen

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.529 
out while not worrying what will happen
to<00:02:03.110> other<00:02:03.289> points<00:02:03.590> with<00:02:04.550> other<00:02:04.849> shapes<00:02:05.270> in

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
to other points with other shapes in

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.010 
to other points with other shapes in
your<00:02:06.110> lair<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:07.640> there's<00:02:07.910> one<00:02:08.209> way<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.479> do<00:02:08.780> that

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
your lair so there's one way to do that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.860 
your lair so there's one way to do that
and<00:02:09.349> if<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.190> want<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.729> bring<00:02:11.000> your<00:02:11.150> points

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
and if you want to bring your points

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.059 
and if you want to bring your points
back<00:02:12.340> simply<00:02:13.340> go<00:02:13.459> back<00:02:13.640> up<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.030> draw<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:15.069> show

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
back simply go back up to draw and show

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.309 
back simply go back up to draw and show
all<00:02:16.370> points<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.810> will<00:02:17.959> bring<00:02:18.080> your

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
all points and that will bring your

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.220 
all points and that will bring your
points<00:02:18.709> back<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> nose<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.870> let's<00:02:21.050> say

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
points back for the nose so let's say

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.470 
points back for the nose so let's say
you're<00:02:21.470> having<00:02:21.860> another<00:02:21.950> issue<00:02:22.390> let's<00:02:23.390> say

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
you're having another issue let's say

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.390 
you're having another issue let's say
you<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.750> gain<00:02:24.020> access<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.470> one<00:02:24.770> shape<00:02:25.099> but

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
you can gain access to one shape but

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.670 
you can gain access to one shape but
maybe<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.270> have<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> lot<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.780> shapes<00:02:27.170> going<00:02:27.560> on

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
maybe you have a lot of shapes going on

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.460 
maybe you have a lot of shapes going on
at<00:02:27.860> once<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.580> hard<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.120> isolate<00:02:29.470> exactly

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
at once and it's hard to isolate exactly

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.470 
at once and it's hard to isolate exactly
the<00:02:30.590> points<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.100> want<00:02:31.460> what<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.330> could

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
the points that you want what you could

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.420 
the points that you want what you could
do

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
do

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.869 
do
you<00:02:33.819> can<00:02:33.939> click<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.450> shape<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:36.430> you

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
you can click on that shape and then you

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.729 
you can click on that shape and then you
could<00:02:37.060> go<00:02:37.180> up<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.859> edit<00:02:39.120> select<00:02:40.120> inverse<00:02:40.739> you

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
could go up to edit select inverse you

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.890 
could go up to edit select inverse you
can<00:02:41.890> see<00:02:42.129> now<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.310> will<00:02:42.700> select<00:02:43.120> all<00:02:43.359> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
can see now that will select all the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.130 
can see now that will select all the
points<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.409> you<00:02:44.530> don't<00:02:44.799> have<00:02:45.040> selected<00:02:45.640> on

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
points that you don't have selected on

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.589 
points that you don't have selected on
that<00:02:47.219> particular<00:02:48.219> layer<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.359> case

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
that particular layer so in this case

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.629 
that particular layer so in this case
the<00:02:50.019> left<00:02:50.260> eye<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:50.950> nose<00:02:50.980> are<00:02:51.489> now

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
the left eye and the nose are now

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.420 
the left eye and the nose are now
selected<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.930> original<00:02:53.439> I<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.620> selected<00:02:54.280> is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
selected the original I I selected is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.399 
selected the original I I selected is
now<00:02:54.579> deselected<00:02:55.359> and<00:02:55.569> then<00:02:55.989> from<00:02:56.200> there<00:02:56.379> you

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
now deselected and then from there you

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.039 
now deselected and then from there you
can<00:02:56.560> go<00:02:56.739> up<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.040> draw<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.700> then<00:02:58.480> hide<00:02:58.750> selected

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
can go up to draw and then hide selected

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.229 
can go up to draw and then hide selected
points<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.280> can<00:03:00.430> see<00:03:00.609> now<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.790> points

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
points and you can see now the points

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.539 
points and you can see now the points
are<00:03:01.359> hidden<00:03:01.569> from<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.139> I<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:03.040> only<00:03:03.069> points

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
are hidden from that I the only points

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.610 
are hidden from that I the only points
that<00:03:03.760> are<00:03:03.879> visible<00:03:04.180> are<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.290> right<00:03:05.590> i

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
that are visible are on this right i

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.059 
that are visible are on this right i
right<00:03:06.040> here<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:07.299> those<00:03:07.810> are<00:03:07.840> two<00:03:08.409> things<00:03:08.439> you

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
right here so those are two things you

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.099 
right here so those are two things you
can<00:03:09.400> do<00:03:09.609> when<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.180> comes<00:03:10.359> to<00:03:10.510> hiding<00:03:10.780> and

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
can do when it comes to hiding and

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.009 
can do when it comes to hiding and
showing<00:03:11.139> points<00:03:12.069> now<00:03:12.639> as<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.180> said<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.989> can

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
showing points now as I said you can

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.470 
showing points now as I said you can
also<00:03:14.319> do<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.769> for<00:03:14.980> bones<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.970> let's<00:03:16.180> click<00:03:16.359> on

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
also do this for bones so let's click on

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.259 
also do this for bones so let's click on
this<00:03:17.290> bone<00:03:17.709> layer<00:03:18.459> here<00:03:18.760> for<00:03:18.969> this<00:03:19.090> character

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
this bone layer here for this character

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.640 
this bone layer here for this character
and<00:03:19.829> zoom<00:03:20.829> out<00:03:21.299> now<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.359> can<00:03:22.629> see<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.560> we

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
and zoom out now you can see that we

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.250 
and zoom out now you can see that we
have<00:03:23.680> some<00:03:24.480> animation<00:03:25.480> already<00:03:25.840> here<00:03:26.109> in<00:03:26.139> the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
have some animation already here in the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.670 
have some animation already here in the
timeline<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:27.129> just<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.549> simple<00:03:28.060> animation

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
timeline it's just a simple animation

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.670 
timeline it's just a simple animation
for<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.909> the<00:03:30.939> character<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:32.319> let's<00:03:32.500> say

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
for the for the character but let's say

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.860 
for the for the character but let's say
for<00:03:32.980> whatever<00:03:33.250> reason<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:34.359> comes<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.659> point

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
for whatever reason that comes a point

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.849 
for whatever reason that comes a point
where<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.439> only<00:03:35.650> want<00:03:36.159> to<00:03:36.669> work<00:03:37.479> on<00:03:37.629> or<00:03:38.079> show<00:03:38.560> a

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
where you only want to work on or show a

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.619 
where you only want to work on or show a
certain<00:03:39.430> bone<00:03:39.760> group<00:03:40.260> well<00:03:41.370> we<00:03:42.370> could<00:03:42.669> take

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
certain bone group well we could take

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.460 
certain bone group well we could take
the<00:03:43.810> select<00:03:44.139> bone<00:03:44.440> tool<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.269> highlight<00:03:46.470> some

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
the select bone tool and highlight some

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.819 
the select bone tool and highlight some
bones<00:03:47.739> here<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:49.720> like<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.079> so<00:03:50.560> let's<00:03:50.709> say

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
bones here just like that so let's say

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.849 
bones here just like that so let's say
you<00:03:50.859> want<00:03:51.099> to<00:03:51.159> work<00:03:51.310> on<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.729> arm<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.859> what

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
you want to work on that arm and what

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.170 
you want to work on that arm and what
you<00:03:53.949> could<00:03:54.099> do<00:03:54.250> then<00:03:54.519> is<00:03:54.959> go<00:03:55.959> up<00:03:56.109> here<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.180> you

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
you could do then is go up here and you

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.929 
you could do then is go up here and you
could<00:03:58.389> do<00:03:58.629> the<00:03:58.659> select<00:03:59.500> inverse<00:04:00.010> thing<00:04:00.639> again

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
could do the select inverse thing again

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.449 
could do the select inverse thing again
so<00:04:01.419> that<00:04:01.449> all<00:04:02.109> the<00:04:02.560> other<00:04:02.739> bones<00:04:03.099> are<00:04:03.340> then

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
so that all the other bones are then

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.710 
so that all the other bones are then
selected<00:04:03.669> and<00:04:04.290> then<00:04:05.290> go<00:04:05.409> up<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.709> bone<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.720> then

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
selected and then go up to bone and then

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.780 
selected and then go up to bone and then
hide<00:04:07.959> selected<00:04:08.379> bones<00:04:09.449> you<00:04:10.449> can<00:04:10.599> see<00:04:10.840> now<00:04:11.019> that

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
hide selected bones you can see now that

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.280 
hide selected bones you can see now that
all<00:04:12.790> those<00:04:13.060> bones<00:04:13.329> are<00:04:13.540> hidden<00:04:13.720> they're<00:04:14.079> still

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
all those bones are hidden they're still

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.689 
all those bones are hidden they're still
there<00:04:14.319> they're<00:04:14.889> just<00:04:15.069> hidden<00:04:15.250> for<00:04:15.549> right<00:04:15.669> now

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
there they're just hidden for right now

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.479 
there they're just hidden for right now
and<00:04:16.060> then<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:16.840> could<00:04:16.959> work<00:04:17.229> on<00:04:17.409> that<00:04:17.949> certain

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
and then you could work on that certain

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.689 
and then you could work on that certain
group<00:04:18.789> if<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.659> wanted<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.259> now<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.099> cool

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
group if you wanted to now the cool

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.790 
group if you wanted to now the cool
thing<00:04:21.729> about<00:04:21.970> this<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.479> you<00:04:23.349> can<00:04:23.380> really

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
thing about this is you can really

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.730 
thing about this is you can really
isolate<00:04:24.009> your<00:04:24.610> bones<00:04:24.909> so<00:04:25.870> only<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.470> bones

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
isolate your bones so only the bones

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.860 
isolate your bones so only the bones
visible<00:04:27.310> right<00:04:27.490> now<00:04:27.639> will<00:04:27.880> be<00:04:28.030> affected<00:04:28.690> by

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
visible right now will be affected by

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.439 
visible right now will be affected by
what<00:04:29.199> you<00:04:29.349> do<00:04:29.680> meaning<00:04:30.610> all<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:30.970> other<00:04:31.150> bones

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
what you do meaning all the other bones

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.719 
what you do meaning all the other bones
while<00:04:31.840> they're<00:04:32.020> still<00:04:32.199> there<00:04:32.259> won't<00:04:33.159> have<00:04:33.490> any

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
while they're still there won't have any

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.420 
while they're still there won't have any
key<00:04:34.060> frames<00:04:34.449> applied<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.259> them<00:04:35.530> when<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.400> are

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
key frames applied to them when you are

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.460 
key frames applied to them when you are
working<00:04:36.699> this<00:04:37.030> way<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:38.050> good<00:04:38.259> way<00:04:38.409> to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
working this way and a good way to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.290 
working this way and a good way to
demonstrate<00:04:38.710> this<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.820> keep<00:04:40.000> an<00:04:40.150> eye<00:04:40.270> on

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
demonstrate this is to keep an eye on

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.290 
demonstrate this is to keep an eye on
the<00:04:40.599> time<00:04:40.810> line<00:04:40.870> right<00:04:41.740> now<00:04:41.950> those<00:04:42.639> bones<00:04:43.029> I

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
the time line right now those bones I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.080 
the time line right now those bones I
just<00:04:43.599> hid<00:04:43.960> are<00:04:44.169> still<00:04:44.620> hidden<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.219> if<00:04:45.849> I<00:04:45.940> go

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
just hid are still hidden and if I go

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.080 
just hid are still hidden and if I go
back<00:04:46.240> up<00:04:46.479> to

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
back up to

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.600 
back up to
and<00:04:47.449> then<00:04:48.020> show<00:04:48.260> all<00:04:48.470> bones<00:04:48.800> keep<00:04:49.310> an<00:04:49.460> eye<00:04:49.550> on

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
and then show all bones keep an eye on

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.120 
and then show all bones keep an eye on
the<00:04:49.820> timeline<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:51.080> can<00:04:51.110> see<00:04:51.440> now<00:04:51.620> all<00:04:51.889> those

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
the timeline you can see now all those

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.310 
the timeline you can see now all those
keyframes<00:04:52.730> come<00:04:53.000> back<00:04:53.240> because<00:04:53.750> that's

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
keyframes come back because that's

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.010 
keyframes come back because that's
showing<00:04:54.770> all<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.040> bones<00:04:55.550> going<00:04:55.970> on<00:04:56.120> so<00:04:56.870> not

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
showing all the bones going on so not

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.750 
showing all the bones going on so not
only<00:04:57.199> is<00:04:57.410> this<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.889> good<00:04:58.100> way<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.310> reduce

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
only is this a good way to reduce

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.909 
only is this a good way to reduce
clutter<00:04:59.110> it's<00:05:00.110> a<00:05:00.260> good<00:05:00.410> way<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.620> isolate

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
clutter it's a good way to isolate

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.430 
clutter it's a good way to isolate
certain<00:05:01.430> elements<00:05:02.150> when<00:05:02.570> you<00:05:02.750> are<00:05:02.870> animating

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
certain elements when you are animating

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.670 
certain elements when you are animating
more<00:05:03.650> complicated<00:05:04.280> projects<00:05:05.500> now<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.590> think

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
more complicated projects now I think

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.680 
more complicated projects now I think
when<00:05:07.220> it<00:05:07.310> comes<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.760> working<00:05:08.030> with<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.419> bones

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
when it comes to working with the bones

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.830 
when it comes to working with the bones
you'll<00:05:09.139> definitely<00:05:09.710> find<00:05:09.919> this<00:05:10.070> to<00:05:10.220> be<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.520> use

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
you'll definitely find this to be of use

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.969 
you'll definitely find this to be of use
especially<00:05:11.840> now<00:05:11.990> with<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.290> combined<00:05:12.680> bone

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
especially now with the combined bone

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.490 
especially now with the combined bone
tools<00:05:13.370> because<00:05:13.820> sometimes<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:14.930> may<00:05:15.110> find

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
tools because sometimes you may find

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.200 
tools because sometimes you may find
when<00:05:16.130> you're<00:05:16.250> trying<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.610> grab<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:16.820> certain

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
when you're trying to grab a certain

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.840 
when you're trying to grab a certain
bone<00:05:17.479> with<00:05:18.350> your<00:05:18.680> handles<00:05:19.160> if<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:19.580> have

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
bone with your handles if you have

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.570 
bone with your handles if you have
certain<00:05:20.240> bones<00:05:20.660> closer<00:05:21.200> together<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.950> might

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
certain bones closer together it might

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.570 
certain bones closer together it might
be<00:05:22.760> harder<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.120> grab<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:24.229> exact<00:05:24.860> handle<00:05:25.430> you

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
be harder to grab the exact handle you

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.330 
be harder to grab the exact handle you
want<00:05:25.850> when<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.020> bones<00:05:27.229> are<00:05:27.440> so<00:05:27.740> close

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
want when the bones are so close

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.400 
want when the bones are so close
together<00:05:28.550> so<00:05:28.970> now<00:05:29.419> you<00:05:29.479> can<00:05:29.750> just<00:05:29.900> simply<00:05:30.200> hide

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
together so now you can just simply hide

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.560 
together so now you can just simply hide
a<00:05:30.440> bone<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:30.950> then<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.790> can<00:05:31.970> work<00:05:32.210> with<00:05:32.540> that

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
a bone and then you can work with that

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.530 
a bone and then you can work with that
other<00:05:32.900> bone<00:05:33.169> without<00:05:33.350> issue<00:05:34.210> so<00:05:35.210> anyway

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
other bone without issue so anyway

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.480 
other bone without issue so anyway
definitely<00:05:36.260> check<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.470> out<00:05:36.650> if<00:05:36.889> you<00:05:37.250> are

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490
