liberation when you use this her

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.130 
liberation when you use this her
reaction<00:04:11.910> time<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.270> much<00:04:12.420> faster<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.990> her

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
reaction time is much faster and her

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.800 
reaction time is much faster and her
attacks<00:04:13.470> are<00:04:13.650> stronger<00:04:14.280> over<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.330> does<00:04:15.600> more

damage<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:16.260> this<00:04:16.380> as<00:04:16.590> well<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.280> can<00:04:17.400> do<00:04:17.489> a

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
damage in this as well and you can do a

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.699 
damage in this as well and you can do a
power<00:04:17.790> shot<00:04:18.090> with<00:04:18.209> your<00:04:18.330> pistols<00:04:18.810> here's<00:04:19.620> a

power shot with your pistols here's a
look<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:24.570> downfall<00:04:25.140> is<00:04:25.170> that<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.620> take<00:04:25.890> more

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
look the downfall is that you take more

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.980 
look the downfall is that you take more
damage<00:04:26.430> if<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.940> do<00:04:27.180> get<00:04:27.390> hit<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.780> there's

damage if you do get hit and there's
some<00:04:28.230> recovery<00:04:28.680> time<00:04:28.710> afterward<00:04:29.520> the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
some recovery time afterward the

love<00:06:56.790> the<00:06:57.000> music<00:06:57.150> the<00:06:57.600> game<00:06:57.780> effects<00:06:58.169> were

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
love the music the game effects were

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.469

very<00:06:58.530> good<00:06:58.710> as<00:06:58.860> well<00:06:59.040> once<00:06:59.580> again<00:06:59.760> I<00:06:59.940> really

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
very good as well once again I really

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.360 
very good as well once again I really
like<00:07:00.690> the<00:07:00.870> /<00:07:01.110> dive<00:07:01.320> and<00:07:01.560> the<00:07:01.620> cutscenes<00:07:02.130> stood

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
like the / dive and the cutscenes stood

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.409 
like the / dive and the cutscenes stood
out<00:07:02.490> from<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.700> rest

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419

dialogue<00:07:04.260> was<00:07:04.500> kind<00:07:04.740> of<00:07:04.830> weak<00:07:05.010> and<00:07:05.250> but<00:07:05.700> I

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729 
dialogue was kind of weak and but I

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:07.219 
dialogue was kind of weak and but I
think<00:07:05.970> the<00:07:06.060> voice<00:07:06.240> actors<00:07:06.660> did<00:07:06.840> the<00:07:06.900> best<00:07:07.080> with

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
think the voice actors did the best with

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.020 
think the voice actors did the best with
what<00:07:07.290> they<00:07:07.530> could<00:07:07.590> cannot<00:07:08.250> be<00:07:08.430> acting<00:07:08.820> just

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
what they could cannot be acting just

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.620 
what they could cannot be acting just
the<00:07:09.150> writing<00:07:10.040> overall<00:07:11.120> really<00:07:12.120> like<00:07:12.419> this

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
the writing overall really like this
