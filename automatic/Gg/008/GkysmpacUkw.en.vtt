00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.750
 throat my bell jumps and jumps and 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.090

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.370

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.890

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.480
 higher because I believe nothing is impossible 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.489
 if with the heart I see tired of this 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.879
 world where the dreamer is signaled with 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.440
 the finger I believe in me I believe as a child in 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.659
 the recreation chewing his snack 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.580
 believing in what he has ignoring all 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.379
 that shit where girls are girls and 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.269

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.150

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.710
 it's complicated to say no to the past 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.750
 I'm still tied those days where the day 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.909
 It was improvised with music by my side 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.860
 I walk carefully kicking that 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.540
 stone with which she has stumbled for 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.280
 some I'm not sorry and I'm so sorry 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.020
 more than they keep sharp rhymes 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.420
 so much that it slits in my neck 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.250
 I do not know why I put so much effort not 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.799
 rime for work rhythm for fulfilling a 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.869
 sleep lifts the body of the cycle bed 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.969

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.490

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.049
