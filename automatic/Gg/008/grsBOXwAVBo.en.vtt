00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
notice also I've got two sets of keys

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.499 
notice also I've got two sets of keys
here<00:02:03.049> highlighted<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.290> orange<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.799> purple<00:02:05.509> we

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
here highlighted in orange and purple we

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.660 
here highlighted in orange and purple we
type<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.049> Z<00:02:07.380> we're<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> move<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.340> C

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
type the Z we're going to move this C

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.869 
type the Z we're going to move this C
down<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.899> octaves<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.280> these<00:02:11.489> notes<00:02:11.760> can

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
down in octaves so all these notes can

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.760 
down in octaves so all these notes can
be<00:02:12.090> moved<00:02:12.330> down<00:02:12.750> lower<00:02:13.050> with

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
be moved down lower with

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.000 
be moved down lower with
Ziqi<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:14.850> up<00:02:15.600> higher<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.200> next<00:02:16.560> octave

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
Ziqi or up higher to the next octave

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
Ziqi or up higher to the next octave
with<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> X<00:02:17.580> key<00:02:17.880> let's<00:02:18.360> take<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> look<00:02:18.780> at<00:02:18.870> that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
with the X key let's take a look at that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.170 
with the X key let's take a look at that
now<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:20.460> when<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.700> first<00:02:20.970> launch<00:02:21.740> this

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
now and when you first launch this

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.940 
now and when you first launch this
setting<00:02:24.180> turn<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.570> on<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.050> should<00:02:25.710> come<00:02:25.920> up

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
setting turn this on it should come up

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.770 
setting turn this on it should come up
so<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.580> down<00:02:27.000> here<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.240> status<00:02:27.570> bar<00:02:27.750> you

so that and down here in status bar you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.860 
so that and down here in status bar you
can<00:02:28.020> track<00:02:28.320> as<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.590> type<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.010> X<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.640> should<00:02:30.390> come

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
can track as I type in X it should come

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.110 
can track as I type in X it should come
up<00:02:30.990> with<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.140> setting<00:02:31.530> c5<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.220> d6<00:02:32.700> as<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
up with a setting c5 to d6 as the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.940 
up with a setting c5 to d6 as the
default<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.750> when<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.380> play<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:36.950> it's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
default so when I play the a now it's

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.880 
default so when I play the a now it's
very<00:02:38.250> high<00:02:39.020> all<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.410> do<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> make<00:02:40.770> it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
very high all you have to do to make it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.720 
very high all you have to do to make it
lowers<00:02:41.160> type<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.610> Z<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.090> watch<00:02:42.300> here<00:02:42.830> C<00:02:43.830> 4<00:02:44.070> C<00:02:44.700> 3

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
lowers type of Z and watch here C 4 C 3

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.900 
lowers type of Z and watch here C 4 C 3
C<00:02:45.480> 2<00:02:45.510> C<00:02:46.500> 1<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> lowest<00:02:47.280> note<00:02:47.460> on<00:02:47.670> most

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
C 2 C 1 is the lowest note on most

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.850 
C 2 C 1 is the lowest note on most
mid-size<00:02:48.420> keyboards<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.290> I'll<00:02:49.410> play<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.680> now

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
mid-size keyboards so I'll play that now

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.450 
mid-size keyboards so I'll play that now
and<00:02:50.660> we're<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.810> bass<00:02:51.960> range<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:53.130> need<00:02:53.310> that

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
and we're in the bass range we need that

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.300 
and we're in the bass range we need that
sometimes<00:02:54.350> if<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.500> want<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.710> be<00:02:55.770> higher<00:02:55.980> again

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
sometimes if you want to be higher again

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.120 
sometimes if you want to be higher again
typing<00:02:56.730> X<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:57.510> track<00:02:57.780> your<00:02:57.810> X<00:02:58.260> X<00:02:58.830> X

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.590 
typing X and you can track your X X X
moves<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.240> up<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.920> zze<00:03:01.920> moves<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.370> down<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.420> get

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
moves it up and zze moves it down so get

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:12.740 
moves it up and zze moves it down so get
a<00:03:04.640> WS<00:03:05.640> e<00:03:07.460> D<00:03:08.460> F<00:03:10.220> etc<00:03:11.220> let's<00:03:12.030> take<00:03:12.210> one<00:03:12.420> more<00:03:12.450> look

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
a WS e D F etc let's take one more look

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.140 
a WS e D F etc let's take one more look
at<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.960> keyboard<00:03:13.670> let's<00:03:14.670> talk<00:03:14.820> about<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
at the keyboard let's talk about the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.140 
at the keyboard let's talk about the
purple<00:03:15.480> ones<00:03:15.630> C<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.440> V<00:03:16.890> these<00:03:17.850> are<00:03:17.970> going<00:03:18.060> to

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
purple ones C and V these are going to

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.970 
purple ones C and V these are going to
increase<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.630> strength<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.350> note<00:03:19.830> that

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
increase the strength of the note that

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.710 
increase the strength of the note that
you're<00:03:20.130> playing<00:03:20.370> which<00:03:20.910> can<00:03:21.120> alter<00:03:21.360> most

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
you're playing which can alter most

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.470 
you're playing which can alter most
sounds<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.530> as<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.740> type<00:03:23.010> C<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:24.270> going<00:03:24.330> to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
sounds so as I type C it's going to

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.810 
sounds so as I type C it's going to
subtract<00:03:24.959> velocity<00:03:25.590> by<00:03:25.860> 20<00:03:26.220> points<00:03:26.400> from<00:03:26.640> that

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
subtract velocity by 20 points from that

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.390 
subtract velocity by 20 points from that
note<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.240> as<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.990> type<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.410> letter<00:03:28.620> V<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.220> will

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
note and as I type the letter V it will

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.300 
note and as I type the letter V it will
add<00:03:29.700> 20<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.440> velocity<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:31.980> any<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.220> these

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
add 20 to the velocity of any of these

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.860 
add 20 to the velocity of any of these
notes<00:03:32.520> I<00:03:32.730> might<00:03:32.910> play<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.330> my<00:03:33.450> computer

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
notes I might play on my computer

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.110 
notes I might play on my computer
keyboard<00:03:34.100> just<00:03:35.100> go<00:03:35.310> back<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:35.670> take<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.820> look<00:03:36.000> at

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
keyboard just go back and take a look at

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.660 
keyboard just go back and take a look at
that<00:03:36.590> now<00:03:37.590> again<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:37.950> can<00:03:37.980> see<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.459> down

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
that now again you can see this down

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.930 
that now again you can see this down
here<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:40.200> type<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:40.740> an<00:03:40.980> A<00:03:43.010> now<00:03:44.010> as<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.250> type<00:03:44.490> a<00:03:44.640> V

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
here the type of an A now as I type a V

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.600 
here the type of an A now as I type a V
we<00:03:45.570> can<00:03:45.720> see<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.020> going<00:03:46.200> up<00:03:46.470> 20<00:03:47.190> points<00:03:47.459> at<00:03:47.550> a

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
we can see it going up 20 points at a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.180 
we can see it going up 20 points at a
time<00:03:47.850> up<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> maximum<00:03:48.660> 120<00:03:49.320> again<00:03:49.950> I'm

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
time up to a maximum 120 again I'm

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.430 
time up to a maximum 120 again I'm
typing<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.730> C<00:03:51.060> now<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.600> subtracting<00:03:52.260> down

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
typing this C now and subtracting down

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.910 
typing this C now and subtracting down
to<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.770> lowest<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.250> 20<00:03:54.230> now<00:03:55.230> play<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> again

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
to the lowest of 20 now play a again

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.699 
to the lowest of 20 now play a again
that's<00:03:56.160> very<00:03:56.459> soft<00:03:57.290> we<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.440> see<00:03:58.620> that

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
that's very soft we can see that

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.370 
that's very soft we can see that
registering<00:03:59.250> here<00:03:59.430> soft<00:03:59.730> let's<00:04:00.600> type<00:04:00.810> V<00:04:01.080> until

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
registering here soft let's type V until

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.110

up our imaginary keyboard see decreases
the<00:04:31.500> strength<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.949> every<00:04:32.100> note<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.580> V<00:04:33.120> adds

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
the strength of every note and V adds

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.640 
the strength of every note and V adds
velocity<00:04:35.070> or<00:04:35.220> increases<00:04:36.120> its<00:04:36.300> strength<00:04:36.650> so

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
velocity or increases its strength so

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.300 
velocity or increases its strength so
that's<00:04:37.949> how<00:04:38.070> we're<00:04:38.160> going<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.310> use<00:04:38.370> this
