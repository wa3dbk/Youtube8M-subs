when<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.360> pushing<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.780> kid<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.229> don't

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
when you're pushing your kid you don't

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.900 
when you're pushing your kid you don't
know<00:01:16.560> how<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> pedal

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
know how to pedal

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.600 
know how to pedal
the<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.930> pedals<00:01:21.260> don't<00:01:21.500> turn<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.100> they<00:01:22.430> put

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
the the pedals don't turn so they put

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.080 
the the pedals don't turn so they put
their<00:01:22.760> feet<00:01:22.940> here<00:01:24.640> notice<00:01:25.640> how<00:01:25.760> they<00:01:25.940> don't

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
their feet here notice how they don't

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.330 
their feet here notice how they don't
turn<00:01:26.330> as<00:01:26.480> you<00:01:26.510> move<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.620> that<00:01:27.650> allows<00:01:27.980> them<00:01:28.220> to

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
turn as you move so that allows them to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.860 
turn as you move so that allows them to
just<00:01:28.550> kind<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.760> rest<00:01:28.970> your<00:01:29.120> feet<00:01:29.330> there<00:01:29.570> that's

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
just kind of rest your feet there that's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.400 
just kind of rest your feet there that's
nice<00:01:30.080> but<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.440> wish<00:01:30.650> there<00:01:30.860> was<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.700> mode<00:01:32.450> for<00:01:32.750> you

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
nice but I wish there was a mode for you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.380 
nice but I wish there was a mode for you
to<00:01:33.560> force<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.280> wheels<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.700> turn<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.150> that<00:01:35.270> they

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
to force the wheels to turn so that they

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.060 
to force the wheels to turn so that they
can<00:01:35.540> actually<00:01:35.660> learn<00:01:35.990> how<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.170> pedal<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.740> little

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
can actually learn how to pedal a little

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.650 
can actually learn how to pedal a little
bit<00:01:37.190> faster<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.590> back<00:01:39.830> of<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.100> has<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.510> bit<00:01:41.510> of<00:01:41.540> a

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
bit faster the back of it has a bit of a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.250 
bit faster the back of it has a bit of a
container

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
container

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.350 
container
you<00:01:42.890> can't<00:01:43.160> fit<00:01:43.310> much<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.670> there<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.120> it's

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
you can't fit much in there but it's

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.210 
you can't fit much in there but it's
nice<00:01:44.900> maybe<00:01:45.140> put<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.410> few<00:01:45.590> toys<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:45.980> there<00:01:46.100> when

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
nice maybe put a few toys in there when

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.290 
nice maybe put a few toys in there when
you<00:01:46.280> go<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.520> park<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:49.190> play<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.180> really

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
light stick one of the things I want to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.520 
light stick one of the things I want to
show<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.150> this<00:01:53.330> little<00:01:53.660> seat<00:01:54.470> belt<00:01:54.740> here

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
show you is this little seat belt here

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.770 
show you is this little seat belt here
it<00:01:57.530> depends<00:01:57.890> from<00:01:57.950> how<00:01:58.250> big<00:01:58.850> or<00:01:59.120> well<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.570> size

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
it depends from how big or well the size

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.020 
it depends from how big or well the size
of<00:01:59.930> your<00:02:00.080> kit<00:02:00.320> is<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.310> not<00:02:01.610> very<00:02:01.790> well

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
of your kit is but this is not very well

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.600 
of your kit is but this is not very well
designed<00:02:02.360> because<00:02:02.720> this<00:02:02.900> goes<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:04.220> know<00:02:04.340> left

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
designed because this goes you know left

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.520 
designed because this goes you know left
on<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.119> left<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.660> then<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.020> right<00:02:06.050> on<00:02:06.410> the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
on the left and then the right on the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.139 
on the left and then the right on the
right<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:06.950> then<00:02:07.070> they<00:02:07.220> just<00:02:07.430> slip<00:02:07.729> right<00:02:08.090> off

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
right and then they just slip right off

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.630 
right and then they just slip right off
the<00:02:08.420> shoulder<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.140> what<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:09.950> do<00:02:10.070> is<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.429> end<00:02:10.550> up

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the shoulder so what I do is I end up

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.460 
the shoulder so what I do is I end up
doing<00:02:10.729> crisscross<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.900> left<00:02:12.080> goes<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
doing crisscross so the left goes to the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.930 
doing crisscross so the left goes to the
right<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.920> right<00:02:13.070> goes<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> left<00:02:13.700> and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
right and the right goes to the left and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.680 
right and the right goes to the left and
it<00:02:14.540> makes<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.780> bit<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.170> knot<00:02:15.410> here<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:17.180> make

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
it makes a bit of a knot here but I make

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.180 
it makes a bit of a knot here but I make
sure<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.080> she's<00:02:18.320> not<00:02:18.470> going<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.620> slip<00:02:18.860> out<00:02:19.070> of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
sure that she's not going to slip out of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.390 
sure that she's not going to slip out of
the<00:02:19.310> seat<00:02:19.790> belt<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> first<00:02:20.690> few<00:02:20.810> times

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
the seat belt for the first few times

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.280 
the seat belt for the first few times
Eclair<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.709> first<00:02:24.920> few<00:02:25.099> times<00:02:26.049> she<00:02:27.049> fell

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
Eclair in the first few times she fell

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:56.330 
Eclair in the first few times she fell
