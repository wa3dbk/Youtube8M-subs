molded in color this is one chunk of
polycarbonate<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:48.170> then<00:01:48.319> his<00:01:48.470> machine<00:01:48.860> and

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
polycarbonate that then his machine and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.740 
polycarbonate that then his machine and
polished<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.819> it<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:50.060> feels<00:01:50.240> really<00:01:50.479> nice

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
polished and it just feels really nice

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.809 
polished and it just feels really nice
and<00:01:51.500> then<00:01:51.710> everything's<00:01:52.009> everything<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.700> can

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
and then everything's everything you can

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.149 
and then everything's everything you can
see<00:01:52.969> is<00:01:53.090> sort<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.619> squished<00:01:54.619> into<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.979> phone

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
see is sort of squished into the phone

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.109 
see is sort of squished into the phone
this<00:01:55.310> way<00:01:55.490> it's<00:01:55.670> really<00:01:55.880> tough<00:01:56.090> to

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
this way it's really tough to

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.240 
this way it's really tough to
manufacture<00:01:56.929> but<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.649> think<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:57.979> end<00:01:58.100> result

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
manufacture but I think the end result

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.309 
manufacture but I think the end result
is<00:01:58.429> totally<00:01:58.729> worth<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.090> everything<00:02:00.049> sort<00:02:00.289> of

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
is totally worth it everything sort of

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.139 
is totally worth it everything sort of
hidden<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:00.709> off<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.039> top<00:02:01.250> push<00:02:01.729> right<00:02:01.909> here

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
but that's where the sim card would

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.500 
but that's where the sim card would
slide<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:08.690> out<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.079> it<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.319> a<00:02:09.349> micro<00:02:09.799> sim

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
slide in and out and it is a micro sim

that<00:03:45.290> we<00:03:45.379> should<00:03:45.410> look<00:03:45.650> going<00:03:45.950> up<00:03:46.069> original

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
that we should look going up original

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.170 
that we should look going up original
sub-20<00:03:46.970> big<00:03:47.239> can<00:03:48.079> we<00:03:48.200> see<00:03:48.349> some<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.940> or<00:03:49.940> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
sub-20 big can we see some of the or the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.460 
sub-20 big can we see some of the or the
apps<00:03:50.359> that<00:03:50.510> were<00:03:50.690> announced<00:03:50.930> yeah<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.319> think

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
apps that were announced yeah I think

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.050 
apps that were announced yeah I think
the<00:03:51.620> big<00:03:51.739> one<00:03:51.769> being<00:03:52.040> nokia<00:03:52.370> drive<00:03:52.579> let's<00:03:52.940> see

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
the big one being nokia drive let's see

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.400 
the big one being nokia drive let's see
what<00:03:53.180> comes<00:03:53.420> up<00:03:53.660> here<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:53.989> i<00:03:54.019> think<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.260> last

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
what comes up here so i think the last

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.710 
what comes up here so i think the last
time<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:54.739> loaded<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.220> up<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:56.090> maps<00:03:56.329> that<00:03:56.599> were

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
time I loaded this up the maps that were

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.690 
time I loaded this up the maps that were
on<00:03:56.810> board<00:03:57.049> were<00:03:57.410> probably<00:03:57.890> east<00:03:58.340> coast

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
on board were probably east coast

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.640 
on board were probably east coast
somewhere<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.810> I'm<00:03:59.870> not<00:03:59.989> sure<00:04:00.049> how<00:04:00.200> my<00:04:00.410> soon

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
somewhere so I'm not sure how my soon

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.229 
somewhere so I'm not sure how my soon
come<00:04:00.829> up<00:04:00.950> but<00:04:01.040> there<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.910> graph<00:04:02.090> that

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
come up but there is the the graph that

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.449 
come up but there is the the graph that
should<00:04:02.450> probably<00:04:02.930> load<00:04:03.590> in<00:04:03.799> its<00:04:03.919> not<00:04:04.040> others

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
should probably load in its not others

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.000 
should probably load in its not others
actually<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.299> would<00:04:05.480> be<00:04:05.569> DC<00:04:05.959> so<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:06.769> is<00:04:06.859> by

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
actually this would be DC so this is by

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.909 
actually this would be DC so this is by
the<00:04:07.069> airport<00:04:07.549> DC<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:08.180> obviously<00:04:08.810> not<00:04:09.019> here<00:04:09.319> but

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
the airport DC so obviously not here but

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.349 
the airport DC so obviously not here but
again<00:04:10.160> what's<00:04:10.459> really<00:04:10.579> cool<00:04:10.819> about<00:04:10.880> is<00:04:11.209> you

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.590 
again what's really cool about is you
have<00:04:11.510> these<00:04:11.660> neat<00:04:12.049> graphics<00:04:12.709> that

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
have these neat graphics that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.120 
have these neat graphics that
and<00:04:13.810> this<00:04:14.380> helped<00:04:14.620> me<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.740> lot<00:04:14.890> when<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.100> was
