00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.199 
and to upload the videos to the computer
this<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> battery<00:02:08.369> right<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
this is the battery right here on the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.999 
this is the battery right here on the
back<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.319> battery<00:02:10.709> life<00:02:10.979> is

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
back and I think the battery life is

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.860 
back and I think the battery life is
about

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
about

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.350 
about
hours<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:13.280> just<00:02:13.489> charge<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.000> right<00:02:14.030> on

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
hours and you just charge it right on

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.570 
hours and you just charge it right on
the<00:02:14.540> camera<00:02:14.810> unlike<00:02:15.680> my<00:02:15.890> Canon

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
the camera unlike my Canon

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.949 
the camera unlike my Canon
point-and-shoot<00:02:17.239> where<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.540> have<00:02:17.629> to<00:02:17.750> pull

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
point-and-shoot where you have to pull

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.199 
point-and-shoot where you have to pull
the<00:02:18.080> battery<00:02:18.409> out<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.700> stick<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.819> in<00:02:19.909> a<00:02:20.000> wall

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
the battery out and stick it in a wall

the battery out and stick it in a wall
charger<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.830> that's<00:02:22.010> kind<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> basics<00:02:22.909> of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
charger so that's kind of the basics of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.190 
charger so that's kind of the basics of
this<00:02:23.180> camera<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:25.360> $200<00:02:26.360> it's<00:02:26.540> hard<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.840> find<00:02:27.110> a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
this camera for $200 it's hard to find a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.380 
this camera for $200 it's hard to find a
camera<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.769> has<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> microphone<00:02:28.370> jack<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.360> it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
camera that has a microphone jack on it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.720 
camera that has a microphone jack on it
I<00:02:29.690> have<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.290> little<00:02:30.470> samsung<00:02:31.129> I<00:02:31.310> paid<00:02:31.489> about

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
I have this little samsung I paid about

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.600 
I have this little samsung I paid about
a<00:02:31.790> hundred<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.239> fifty<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.530> these<00:02:34.430> two

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
a hundred and fifty for and these two

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.610 
a hundred and fifty for and these two
cameras<00:02:35.030> are<00:02:35.180> about<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.540> same<00:02:35.720> size<00:02:36.019> but<00:02:36.440> this

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
cameras are about the same size but this

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.680 
cameras are about the same size but this
one<00:02:36.799> doesn't<00:02:37.010> have<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.250> microphone<00:02:37.610> jack<00:02:38.090> on<00:02:38.360> it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
one doesn't have a microphone jack on it

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.009 
one doesn't have a microphone jack on it
so<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:40.280> get<00:02:40.430> outside<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.329> wind<00:02:41.510> or<00:02:41.930> you

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
so you get outside and the wind or you

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.750 
so you get outside and the wind or you
get<00:02:42.140> too<00:02:42.349> far<00:02:42.620> away<00:02:42.709> from<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.159> camera<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.670> you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
get too far away from the camera and you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.330 
get too far away from the camera and you
just<00:02:43.910> can't<00:02:44.239> hear<00:02:44.599> so<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.470> didn't<00:02:45.950> work<00:02:46.069> myself

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
just can't hear so I didn't work myself

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.900 
just can't hear so I didn't work myself
up<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.180> wireless<00:02:47.870> mic<00:02:48.470> set<00:02:48.859> for<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.340> but<00:02:49.879> I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
up a wireless mic set for this but I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.900 
up a wireless mic set for this but I
haven't<00:02:50.180> got<00:02:50.329> it<00:02:50.359> yet<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:51.220> I'm<00:02:52.220> excited<00:02:52.609> to<00:02:52.760> try

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
haven't got it yet so I'm excited to try

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.670 
haven't got it yet so I'm excited to try
that<00:02:53.000> out<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.840> hopefully<00:02:54.140> it'll<00:02:54.260> work<00:02:54.440> good

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that out so hopefully it'll work good

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.319 
that out so hopefully it'll work good
and<00:02:54.890> I'll<00:02:55.010> probably<00:02:55.220> do<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.519> video<00:02:55.790> review<00:02:56.299> of

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
and I'll probably do a video review of

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.920 
and I'll probably do a video review of
that<00:02:56.540> as<00:02:56.690> well<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:58.329> think<00:02:59.329> what<00:02:59.450> I'll<00:02:59.569> do<00:02:59.720> now

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
that as well so I think what I'll do now

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.920 
that as well so I think what I'll do now
is<00:02:59.959> just<00:03:00.590> try<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.980> find<00:03:01.730> some<00:03:02.060> footage<00:03:02.720> I've

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
is just try to find some footage I've

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.500 
is just try to find some footage I've

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
filmed outside and put a little bit of

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.240 
filmed outside and put a little bit of
that<00:03:05.659> in<00:03:05.870> there<00:03:06.019> it's<00:03:06.260> raining<00:03:06.590> right<00:03:06.769> now<00:03:06.980> so

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
that in there it's raining right now so

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.460 
that in there it's raining right now so
