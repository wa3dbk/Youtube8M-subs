00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.180
 we initially started a 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.640
 small group has had some departures 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.490
 of recognition of some areas of 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.320
 some farms and we have to the extent 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.960
 after the experience that we have gone 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.210
 acquiring knowing many people who 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.730
 they know more about cÃºcuta they know the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.780
 geography the idea is that we live a 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 riding experience 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.350
 very rich that we stay like that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.969
 feeling of happiness that initially 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.550
 one thinks he 's going to suffer that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.100
 because many pylons suffered but it is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.530
 more like how is the satisfaction of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.059
 have complied with a route the exit of 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.430
 we are 80 100 120 people and each 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.010
 day grows more because because it is a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.580
 sport that like that allows 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.420
 exercise and achieve goals 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.590
 personal not necessarily have to 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.870
 meet a group to get out 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.870
 can perfectly go out alone and achieve 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.300
 your goal day by day and at the same time is 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.380
 a sport that demands and if one wants 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.470
 really have some level you have to 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.210
 do it constantly at least three times 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.690
 a week so you can really see 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.950
 the effort then is something that 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.620
 demands the mountain biking has the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.400
 xc mobility of the competitive in 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.160
 fast track is the mountain that is 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.090
 a mountain a little more hostile with 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.000
 sectors the hardest the enduro that already 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.770
 happens to be more more more hostile more 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.460
 difficult and the 2000 that is totally 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.460
 decline 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.830
 totally low and low thick 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.650
 stones trunks all people 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.740
 regardless of who the lawyer is 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.350
 from the mason the watchman I do not know the 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.600
 political when we are on the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.220
 bicycle we are at the same level and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.220
 they are like soldiers when this woman 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.890
 to start an entertaining family is 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.250
 he does a very good exercise he works in 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:42.250
 Spanish team has a technical mishap 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.250
 pricked 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.860
 we arranged exciting friendship the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.870
 camaraderie that has formed in the 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.010
 group as more than 100 people that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:01.510
 weekly maintains physical 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.510
 also things like me too 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.420
 as a complement we have runners and 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:17.690
 national friends where the titles but 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.250
 yes very very good track record for those 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.450
 runners 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.000
 and they were forming more than all that 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.760
 there are also very good runners and we 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.840
 We are training to take them to 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.580
 now the departmental ones and already 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.050
 come and the other national year 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.310
 we always demand that 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.580
 people who will accompany us 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.170
 wear a helmet and in their gloves on 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.230
 night outings that carry their lights 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.820
 it's like the paramount thing that they bring in the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.440
 moment of departure to your bicycle 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.050
 ready for the exit to avoid 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.790
 inconveniences but let's say we do not have 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.470
 no type of requirement or registration 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.540
 or anything and then everyone who wants 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.120
 accept the welcome the idea after 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.320
 create more and more community as 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.470
 important that you must have a bicycle 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.580
 of ciclomontaÃ±ismo is the suspension 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.510
 front suspension maintenance 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.610
 general should be done at least every 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.380
 two or three months depending on the use 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.360
 if it has a daily use it can be 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.640
 recommended that every two months without 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.560
 However, it must be reviewed before each 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.260
 output that your brakes are in optimal 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.730
 conditions that your chain is lubricated 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.730
 that is well adjusted 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.030
 Y 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.030
 yes
