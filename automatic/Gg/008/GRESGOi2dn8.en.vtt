be a cool idea to do a Q&amp;A with everyone

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.979 
be a cool idea to do a Q&amp;A with everyone
if<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.700> were<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.120> do<00:04:07.239> something<00:04:07.269> like<00:04:07.570> that<00:04:07.840> it

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
if I were to do something like that it

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.840 
if I were to do something like that it
might<00:04:08.140> be<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.410> few<00:04:08.709> weeks<00:04:08.769> until<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.310> can<00:04:09.550> find<00:04:09.730> a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
might be a few weeks until I can find a

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.250 
might be a few weeks until I can find a
date<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.209> everyone<00:04:10.510> wants<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.720> get<00:04:10.900> on<00:04:11.050> and

for you guys if that's something you're
interested<00:04:21.350> in<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.100> maybe<00:04:22.790> we<00:04:22.910> can<00:04:23.060> talk

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
interested in and maybe we can talk

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.180 
interested in and maybe we can talk
about<00:04:23.510> how<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.690> crew<00:04:23.930> first<00:04:24.139> met<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.800> we

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
about how the crew first met and we

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.620 
about how the crew first met and we
cannot<00:04:25.400> we<00:04:25.580> argue<00:04:25.880> about<00:04:25.910> that<00:04:26.210> all<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.419> time

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
cannot we argue about that all the time

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.659 
cannot we argue about that all the time
by<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.870> way<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.260> know<00:04:27.650> that's<00:04:27.919> probably<00:04:28.400> one<00:04:28.639> of

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
by the way I know that's probably one of

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.340 
by the way I know that's probably one of
the<00:04:28.790> biggest<00:04:28.970> questions<00:04:29.419> I<00:04:29.510> ever<00:04:29.630> get<00:04:29.810> and

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
the biggest questions I ever get and

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.659 
the biggest questions I ever get and
I've<00:04:30.470> explained<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:30.919> in<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.100> past<00:04:31.340> but<00:04:31.610> I

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.040 
I've explained it in the past but I
don't<00:04:31.910> think<00:04:32.060> I've<00:04:32.210> explained<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.660> too<00:04:32.840> well

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
prank call is hilarious but in my

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.469 
prank call is hilarious but in my
opinion<00:05:46.550> that<00:05:46.580> wasn't<00:05:46.970> even<00:05:47.060> some<00:05:47.330> of<00:05:47.419> the

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
opinion that wasn't even some of the

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.790 
opinion that wasn't even some of the
best<00:05:47.600> stuff<00:05:47.870> we<00:05:47.990> had<00:05:48.139> that<00:05:48.350> night<00:05:48.530> I
