see these ultra books in before what's
not<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.899> great<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.440> tell<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
not so great is that you can tell that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
not so great is that you can tell that
there<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> couple<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.910> design<00:00:48.270> corners

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.869 
there are a couple of design corners
that<00:00:49.620> were<00:00:49.739> chopped<00:00:50.100> off<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> try<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> make

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that were chopped off to try to make

this<00:00:51.000> thing<00:00:51.180> more<00:00:51.390> affordable<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.230> certainly

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
this thing more affordable it certainly

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.170 
this thing more affordable it certainly
looks<00:00:52.949> attractive<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.879> little<00:00:54.059> more

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
looks attractive but it's a little more

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
looks attractive but it's a little more
plasticky<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.379> certainly<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.100> sleek

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
plasticky it's certainly not the sleek

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.270 
plasticky it's certainly not the sleek
blade<00:00:57.149> design<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:58.109> all<00:00:58.440> metal<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> you

you're gonna be thinking about getting

you're gonna be thinking about getting
this<00:01:21.869> laptop<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.740> highly<00:01:23.100> recommend<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
this laptop I would highly recommend you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
this laptop I would highly recommend you
wait<00:01:23.880> maybe<00:01:24.180> about<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> month<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.380> see

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
wait maybe about a month and just see

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
wait maybe about a month and just see
what<00:01:26.040> comes<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.490> maybe<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> same<00:01:27.330> price

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
what comes out maybe at the same price

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.910 
what comes out maybe at the same price
that<00:01:27.840> gives<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> little<00:01:28.320> more<00:01:28.500> bang<00:01:28.680> for

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that gives you a little more bang for

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.359 
that gives you a little more bang for
the<00:01:28.979> buck

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the buck

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
the buck
the<00:01:29.970> 14-inch<00:01:30.509> version<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> totally

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the 14-inch version is a totally

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
the 14-inch version is a totally
different<00:01:31.740> laptop<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> an<00:01:33.090> ultrabook<00:01:33.450> as

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
different laptop it is a an ultrabook as

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
different laptop it is a an ultrabook as
well<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.439> fits<00:01:34.829> more<00:01:35.159> into<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
well but it really fits more into that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.940 
well but it really fits more into that
looks<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> regular<00:01:36.689> thicker<00:01:37.320> laptop

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
looks like a regular thicker laptop
