00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 these tomatoes 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 before landing the ground 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 somewhere week do 3 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.069
 I have been hardened 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.579
 i.e 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.800
 doctor already in greenhouses 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 if medic these birds are a little heated 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.409
 and there they got used 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.970
 direct sunlight 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.399
 hryvnia branch 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.040
 light day 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.310
 we will connect 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.700
 at the meeting 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
 I have already mentioned glasses and always 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.080
 Kuybida 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.950
 in general, like this 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.150
 here on the sides aegean it 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
 and these 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.440
 in match with Germany 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 and here are these tomatoes 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.730
 were grown 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.550
 only in room conditions 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.550
 no hardening they did not pass 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.570
 here and labels different square sky and 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.850
 lands here 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.240
 in the right lane 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.820
 not left here for example 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.560
 these are mostly early grades they should be 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.850
 undersized 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.480
 N. Asadov as you can see they have stretched 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 between universities 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.350
 a long 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.590
 and so 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.560
 stock whose sun the boat if you see that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.320
 with foxes done 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 they get burned 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.520
 here are all these leaves will die off well of course 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.110
 crown 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.770
 green will not grow 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.740
 intend to repeat it earlier 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.230
 Sartana 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.900
 do not have time so with 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.910
 give selected tomatoes 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.890
 but I want to emphasize the recipe 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.020
 hardening seedlings to have 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.900
 eat fine
