with<00:02:01.789> those<00:02:01.939> 24<00:02:02.479> foot<00:02:02.779> throws<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.529> went<00:02:04.039> with

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
with those 24 foot throws I went with

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.859 
with those 24 foot throws I went with
this<00:02:04.249> cold<00:02:04.639> steel<00:02:04.939> sure<00:02:05.270> bounce<00:02:05.539> thrower

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
this cold steel sure bounce thrower

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.569 
this cold steel sure bounce thrower
which<00:02:06.139> is<00:02:06.259> still<00:02:06.529> being<00:02:06.770> sold<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.429> not

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
which is still being sold so it's not

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.440 
which is still being sold so it's not
discontinued

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
discontinued

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.500 
discontinued
however<00:02:09.229> they<00:02:09.560> are<00:02:10.060> slightly<00:02:11.060> unwieldy<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
however they are slightly unwieldy and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.140 
however they are slightly unwieldy and
if<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:13.049> just<00:02:13.260> me<00:02:13.470> being<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.159> girl<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.790> don't

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
if it's just me being a girl I don't

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.360 
if it's just me being a girl I don't
know<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.720> know<00:02:15.930> they're<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.560> slightly

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
know and you know they're just slightly

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.460 
know and you know they're just slightly
a<00:02:17.519> little<00:02:17.579> too<00:02:17.909> big

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
a little too big

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.039 
a little too big
however<00:02:19.470> at<00:02:20.000> farther<00:02:21.000> distances<00:02:21.750> they're

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
however at farther distances they're

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.380 
however at farther distances they're
pretty<00:02:22.319> solid<00:02:22.799> I<00:02:22.950> mean<00:02:23.189> they're<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.489> going<00:02:24.329> to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
pretty solid I mean they're not going to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.860 
pretty solid I mean they're not going to
snow<00:02:25.170> swing<00:02:25.829> around<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> wind<00:02:26.670> or<00:02:27.209> from

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
snow swing around in the wind or from

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.050 
snow swing around in the wind or from
far<00:02:28.200> away<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.650> still<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:29.819> rid<00:02:30.030> of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
far away you still have to get rid of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.750 
far away you still have to get rid of
that<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.599> sharp<00:02:31.079> edge<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.799> order<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.340> for

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
that that sharp edge in order them for

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.280 
that that sharp edge in order them for
them<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.030> be<00:02:33.120> safe<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.450> throw<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.049> was

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
them to be safe to throw and I was

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.610 
them to be safe to throw and I was
training<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:35.040> Jack<00:02:35.340> dagger<00:02:35.610> um<00:02:36.409> he<00:02:37.409> was

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
training with Jack dagger um he was

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.470 
training with Jack dagger um he was
saying<00:02:37.829> like<00:02:38.069> wow<00:02:38.310> these<00:02:38.489> are<00:02:38.549> like<00:02:38.790> spatulas

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
saying like wow these are like spatulas

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.479 
saying like wow these are like spatulas
and<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:39.690> thought<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.409> like<00:02:40.680> spatulas

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
and I thought they are like spatulas

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.339 
and I thought they are like spatulas
which<00:02:41.700> made<00:02:41.939> me<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.239> like<00:02:42.269> them<00:02:42.720> as<00:02:42.840> much<00:02:42.870> if

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
which made me not like them as much if

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.050 
which made me not like them as much if
you<00:02:43.590> are<00:02:43.769> going<00:02:44.159> to<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> cold<00:02:44.640> still<00:02:44.819> throwing

you are going to the cold still throwing

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.849 
you are going to the cold still throwing
challenge<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.629> mean<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.810> would<00:02:46.019> say<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.440> one<00:02:46.709> is

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
challenge I mean I would say this one is

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.190 
challenge I mean I would say this one is
the<00:02:46.950> best<00:02:47.209> compared<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.450> pro<00:02:48.750> balance

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the best compared to the pro balance

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.460 
the best compared to the pro balance
which<00:02:50.010> has<00:02:50.250> those<00:02:50.549> handles<00:02:51.090> my<00:02:51.840> friend<00:02:52.170> had

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
which has those handles my friend had

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.289 
which has those handles my friend had

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
the pro balance and eyes and his handles

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.789 
the pro balance and eyes and his handles
broke<00:02:54.510> off<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.959> then<00:02:55.049> he<00:02:55.139> had<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.260> duct<00:02:55.560> tape

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
broke off and then he had to duct tape

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.710 
broke off and then he had to duct tape
them<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.639> was<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.120> what's<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.389> use<00:02:57.540> of

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
before a sharp knife if you are a

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.000 
before a sharp knife if you are a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
beginner then you have to worry about

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.339 
beginner then you have to worry about
and<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.669> have<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.060> use<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> bench<00:03:37.230> grinder

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
and that you have to use a bench grinder

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.369 
and that you have to use a bench grinder
to<00:03:37.829> duel<00:03:38.010> them<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.430> only<00:03:38.760> downside<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.720> that

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
to duel them the only downside is that

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.830 
to duel them the only downside is that
because<00:03:40.889> of<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.190> type<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.549> Steel<00:03:41.879> that<00:03:42.180> it's

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
because of the type of Steel that it's

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.030 
because of the type of Steel that it's
made<00:03:43.349> from<00:03:43.620> its<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:45.030> bends<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.019> bent<00:03:46.500> when<00:03:47.010> I

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
made from its it bends it bent when I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.680 
made from its it bends it bent when I
first<00:03:47.340> got<00:03:47.730> them<00:03:47.940> that's<00:03:48.120> our<00:03:48.239> first<00:03:48.449> four

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
first got them that's our first four
