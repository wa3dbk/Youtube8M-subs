00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.190
 new Year 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.779
 I hope you are all well purely 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.849
 slipped and stands with full 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.650
 did penetrated 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.019
 at the beginning of the new year would be 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.769
 I say start here with the beauty 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.379
 favorites 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.300
 the avis bloody all that is called 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.220
 is only a video with beauty favorites 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.750
 and then there is a video with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 easier favorites that we will too 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.310
 the days I want to come say - and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.359
 although with product number one and that is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.590
 of race 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.899
 this is a main care brand where questions 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.000
 do not whence also well 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.920
 prepared in any case is the last 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 To buy at Douglas I have to be super 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.730
 super good and I think so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.800
 first pale in the team control 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.950
 Kensington you will not buy me 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.180
 so great fan of cleaning gel because it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.100
 but always very beautiful and very 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.480
 drying out is that's where but even 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.989
 not the case because simply no sodium 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.239
 includes nation father there are generally 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.530
 translated with good ingredients 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.359
 a bit, but not like that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.550
 Look at these baths 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.220
 face refreshed as cleansing 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.200
 superplus smells of lavender what I have 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.090
 also hug scary and and good 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.070
 I really like the smell 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.250
 the skin does not stretch after that i have 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.650
 the feeling this properly cleaned and yes 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.860
 I enjoy the product I will 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:25.500
 first buy the clay clever too 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.259
 from the race series but I'm totally 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.329
 satisfied that is now for mixed skin 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.390
 is synonymous with me on the agenda 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.310
 especially dry skin but in the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.590
 t zone I am already prone to oily skin 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.509
 So that's logical, so to speak 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.860
 he does not combine parabens like that 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.049
 father me just miss a table to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.399
 does not share so extreme and no 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.229
 mineral oil or getting out of the very good 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.799
 finds and my skin likes very much something 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.720
 good is 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.360
 just when you catch up with files 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.240
 then number two is from clarence 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.979
 that is the lotus oil, too 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.280
 100 percent from plants 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.869
 plant substances 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.729
 the whole thing looks like it comes with one 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.620
 pipette there comes my little medicine 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.090
 Lover 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.090
 I love everything with pipettes 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.340
 medical touch but I stand there 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.190
 on it and it smells a bit like 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.860
 the children's bath from my childhood so also 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.540
 very strong after rosemary so that's all 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.280
 Herbaceous I like it scary 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.720
 also like a very little for 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.000
 whole face I do it all two 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.710
 days and then have so every two days 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.840
 My little spa feels like skin 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.390
 thereafter by suggesting but not it 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.000
 There are three different oils from Clarence 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.590
 and the logo is just for 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.060
 mixed skin well suited so do not be afraid 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.780
 have previously looked back at me 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.220
 or skin that pink would be in 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.900
 something very very good is me 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.960
 would also like jojoba oil or 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.790
 Rosehip oil, for example, is very good 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.200
 So for the wound healing is just when 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.730
 for the name nike i have too 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.190
 you can tell that you are a bit 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.660
 Smoother is something scary for me 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.010
 beautiful also to experience and to experience 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.420
 that sounds much a 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.770
 a little stupid when you hit it so bad 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.980
 tends to be happy about each one 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.330
 improvement and definitely decisive 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.950
 It helped to make you feel so 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.959
 feels a little better right now 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.570
 winter then product number three is from 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.250

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.270
 I really like her, it gives me this 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.520
 healthy gloss under the very very same 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.739
 strong foundation I do almost every day 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.300
 used and I have thereby the feeling 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.040
 that my skin as I said 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.410
 It would definitely look fresher 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.730
 also in full size with me 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.190

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.320
