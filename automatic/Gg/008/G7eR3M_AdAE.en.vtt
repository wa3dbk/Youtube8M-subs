ma<00:02:08.620> but<00:02:09.520> yeah<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.250> it's<00:02:12.610> actually<00:02:12.880> really

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
ma but yeah so this it's actually really

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.440 
ma but yeah so this it's actually really
easy<00:02:13.810> bit<00:02:14.380> yeah<00:02:14.830> as<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.610> see<00:02:15.760> now<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:16.150> doesn't

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
easy bit yeah as you see now it doesn't

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.800 
easy bit yeah as you see now it doesn't
look<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.660> cool<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:18.550> will<00:02:18.880> start<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.600> look

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
look that cool but it will start to look

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.530 
look that cool but it will start to look
awesome<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:21.300> yeah<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.730> decided<00:02:25.180> to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
awesome and yeah but I just decided to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.390 
awesome and yeah but I just decided to
like<00:02:25.750> paint<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.200> edges<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.620> bit<00:02:26.740> more<00:02:27.130> lighter

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
like paint the edges a bit more lighter

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.790 
like paint the edges a bit more lighter
because<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:28.570> it<00:02:28.690> didn't<00:02:28.930> look<00:02:29.050> nice<00:02:29.410> but

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
because but it didn't look nice but

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.230 
because but it didn't look nice but
because<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.310> can't<00:02:30.520> actually<00:02:30.700> see<00:02:31.120> it

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
because you can't actually see it

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.590 
because you can't actually see it
through<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.230> black<00:02:32.440> contrast<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.640> yeah<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
through the black contrast so yeah and I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.440 
through the black contrast so yeah and I
use<00:02:37.600> like<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.860> turquoise<00:02:39.790> color<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.240> made

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
galaxy so yeah that's what you have to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.220 
galaxy so yeah that's what you have to
do<00:04:01.170> which<00:04:02.170> i'm<00:04:02.350> doing<00:04:02.590> now

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
do which i'm doing now

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.420 
do which i'm doing now
my<00:04:03.830> thumb<00:04:04.190> is<00:04:04.220> blocking<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:06.620> yeah<00:04:06.980> pretty

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
my thumb is blocking it that yeah pretty

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.670 
my thumb is blocking it that yeah pretty
much<00:04:07.580> after<00:04:08.000> you've<00:04:08.330> done<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.930> step<00:04:09.379> and

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
much after you've done this step and

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.369 
much after you've done this step and
finish<00:04:10.610> sticking<00:04:11.120> out<00:04:11.299> you<00:04:11.540> think<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.930> think
