to go in these corners there's a bit of

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.160 
to go in these corners there's a bit of
a<00:01:19.250> break<00:01:19.700> there<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:20.390> still<00:01:20.630> attached<00:01:20.870> to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
to started doing in here is taking out

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.410 
to started doing in here is taking out
this<00:04:01.680> wood<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.489> really<00:04:02.820> hard<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.120> see<00:04:03.300> in

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
this wood this is really hard to see in

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.260 
this wood this is really hard to see in
here<00:04:03.630> but<00:04:04.130> if<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.340> can<00:04:05.520> see<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:05.880> there's<00:04:06.209> a

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
here but if you can see that there's a

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.770 
here but if you can see that there's a
strip<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.570> wood<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.959> goes<00:04:07.080> down<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.440> seam<00:04:07.800> and

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
strip of wood it goes down that seam and

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.410 
strip of wood it goes down that seam and
I've<00:04:09.780> taken<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.350> out<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.940> I've<00:04:12.090> got<00:04:12.120> it

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
I've taken that out and I've got it

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.199 
I've taken that out and I've got it
tacked<00:04:12.780> right<00:04:13.560> now<00:04:13.800> on<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.459> outside<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.120> a

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
tacked right now on the outside and a

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.630 
tacked right now on the outside and a
few<00:04:15.420> spots<00:04:15.690> just<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.980> whole<00:04:17.130> thing<00:04:17.489> together

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
few spots just the whole thing together

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.159 
few spots just the whole thing together
until<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.180> could<00:04:18.359> get<00:04:18.480> some<00:04:18.630> metal<00:04:18.930> in<00:04:19.020> there

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
until I could get some metal in there

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.650 
until I could get some metal in there
I'm<00:04:19.290> going<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.500> put<00:04:19.680> some<00:04:19.890> square<00:04:20.310> tubing<00:04:20.760> up

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
I'm going to put some square tubing up

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.780 
I'm going to put some square tubing up
that<00:04:21.989> seam<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:23.150> bolt<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.270> on<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.740> then<00:04:26.580> do<00:04:26.700> the

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
that seam and bolt it on and then do the

that seam and bolt it on and then do the
same<00:04:27.000> thing<00:04:27.180> on<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.360> other<00:04:27.419> side

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
same thing on the other side

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.390 
same thing on the other side
did<00:04:29.070> ever<00:04:29.220> get<00:04:29.520> those<00:04:29.700> seams<00:04:30.230> secured<00:04:31.310> then<00:04:32.310> I

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
did ever get those seams secured then I

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.180 
did ever get those seams secured then I
can<00:04:32.580> start<00:04:32.820> pushing<00:04:33.090> out<00:04:33.479> this<00:04:33.870> back<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
can start pushing out this back in the
