you look at the folks who have no
predisposing<00:01:03.120> illness<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.530> there's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
predisposing illness you know there's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.450 
predisposing illness you know there's
not<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:07.220> pointer<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.369> going

not a lot going on my pointer is going

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.760 
not a lot going on my pointer is going
out<00:01:08.820> here

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.460 

okay<00:01:12.910> but<00:01:13.910> on<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.180> top<00:01:14.480> you<00:01:14.780> know<00:01:14.900> they<00:01:15.110> they

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
okay but on the top you know they they

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.610 
okay but on the top you know they they
drew<00:01:15.830> blood<00:01:16.130> at<00:01:16.370> 30<00:01:16.700> minutes<00:01:17.120> eight<00:01:17.420> hours<00:01:17.810> 24

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
drew blood at 30 minutes eight hours 24

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.420 
drew blood at 30 minutes eight hours 24
and<00:01:19.070> 48<00:01:19.790> hours<00:01:19.970> out<00:01:20.620> it<00:01:21.620> doesn't<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.280> don't

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
and 48 hours out it doesn't you don't

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.310 
and 48 hours out it doesn't you don't
even<00:01:22.700> have<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:23.060> know<00:01:23.090> what<00:01:23.270> they're<00:01:23.600> doing<00:01:23.660> to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
even have to know what they're doing to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.390 
even have to know what they're doing to
look<00:01:24.560> at

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
look at

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.960 
look at
they<00:01:25.700> have<00:01:25.790> middle<00:01:26.150> line<00:01:26.360> with<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.750> CFS

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
they have middle line with the CFS

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.640 
they have middle line with the CFS
fibromyalgia<00:01:28.970> folks<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.600> say<00:01:29.780> whoa<00:01:30.050> you<00:01:30.500> know

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
fibromyalgia folks to say whoa you know

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.910 
fibromyalgia folks to say whoa you know
look<00:01:30.980> at<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.280> inflammation<00:01:32.410> look<00:01:33.410> at<00:01:33.680> what's

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
look at the inflammation look at what's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.390 
look at the inflammation look at what's
happening<00:01:34.490> with<00:01:34.730> things<00:01:35.270> like<00:01:35.480> hurt<00:01:35.840> weights

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
happening with things like hurt weights

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.320 
happening with things like hurt weights
look<00:01:37.400> at<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.570> sensory<00:01:39.110> includes<00:01:39.740> things<00:01:40.070> like

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
look at the sensory includes things like

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.480 
look at the sensory includes things like
heat<00:01:41.330> response<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.530> things<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:43.010> that<00:01:43.070> so

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
heat response and things like that so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.020 
heat response and things like that so
you<00:01:44.300> know<00:01:44.450> everything<00:01:45.260> is<00:01:45.530> out<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.860> whack<00:01:46.220> when

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
you know everything is out of whack when

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.010 
you know everything is out of whack when
you<00:01:47.180> look<00:01:47.420> at<00:01:47.570> them<00:01:47.720> 24<00:01:48.350> hours<00:01:48.380> 48<00:01:49.340> hours<00:01:49.760> after

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
you look at them 24 hours 48 hours after

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020 
you look at them 24 hours 48 hours after
activity<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.920> start<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.400> understand

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
activity so then you start to understand

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.540 
activity so then you start to understand
that<00:01:53.240> post<00:01:53.570> exertional<00:01:54.140> malaise<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:55.460> you

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
that post exertional malaise that you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.520 
that post exertional malaise that you
can<00:01:55.700> fix<00:01:56.000> them<00:01:56.300> because<00:01:57.050> look<00:01:57.260> what's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
can fix them because look what's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.440 
can fix them because look what's
happening<00:01:58.010> on<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.340> cellular<00:01:58.940> level<00:02:01.450> also

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
happening on the cellular level also

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.469 
happening on the cellular level also
retouched<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.380> little<00:02:03.620> bit<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:04.010> brain

mecfs<00:03:12.580> by<00:03:13.150> looking<00:03:13.630> at<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:14.320> know<00:03:14.440> brain

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
mecfs by looking at you know brain

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.300 
mecfs by looking at you know brain
perfusion<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.940> what's<00:03:16.180> happening<00:03:16.660> there

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
perfusion and what's happening there

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.590 
perfusion and what's happening there
they<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.600> distinguish<00:03:19.600> on<00:03:19.900> EEG<00:03:20.970> mecfs<00:03:21.970> from

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
they can distinguish on EEG mecfs from

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.410 
they can distinguish on EEG mecfs from
depression<00:03:23.230> which<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> huge<00:03:24.880> thing<00:03:25.180> because

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
depression which is a huge thing because

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.930 
depression which is a huge thing because
my<00:03:26.260> daughter<00:03:26.560> had<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.040> pediatrician<00:03:27.910> looked

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
my daughter had a pediatrician looked

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.490 
my daughter had a pediatrician looked
her<00:03:28.150> straight<00:03:28.270> in<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.690> eye<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.870> tell<00:03:29.290> her<00:03:29.410> it

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
her straight in the eye and tell her it

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.740 
her straight in the eye and tell her it
was<00:03:29.620> all<00:03:29.800> in<00:03:29.950> her<00:03:30.040> head<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.550> then<00:03:31.240> turned<00:03:31.540> to

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
was all in her head and then turned to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.990 
was all in her head and then turned to
me<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:31.959> said<00:03:32.350> well<00:03:32.890> your<00:03:33.190> son<00:03:33.430> turned<00:03:33.640> out<00:03:33.820> all

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
right you know that was after two years

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.040 
right you know that was after two years
of<00:03:37.300> tests<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.959> no<00:03:38.080> answers<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.750> know<00:03:40.990> to

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
of tests and no answers so you know to

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.190 
of tests and no answers so you know to
me<00:03:41.320> it's<00:03:41.860> huge<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.670> have<00:03:42.880> things<00:03:43.209> like<00:03:43.450> EEG<00:03:44.140> s

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
me it's huge to have things like EEG s

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.590 
me it's huge to have things like EEG s
where<00:03:44.560> we<00:03:44.590> can<00:03:44.980> distinguish<00:03:45.430> because<00:03:46.090> it's

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
where we can distinguish because it's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.840 
where we can distinguish because it's
just<00:03:47.019> too<00:03:47.290> easy<00:03:47.320> to<00:03:47.950> say<00:03:48.160> it's<00:03:48.340> all<00:03:48.550> in<00:03:48.580> your

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
just too easy to say it's all in your

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.970 
just too easy to say it's all in your
head<00:03:49.090> because<00:03:49.390> we<00:03:49.750> don't<00:03:49.930> know<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.680> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
head because we don't know and the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.920
