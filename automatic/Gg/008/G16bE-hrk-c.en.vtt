00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
some resistance so now we got to do is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:49.690 
some resistance so now we got to do is
pull<00:01:37.569> this<00:01:43.479> okay<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:46.149> here<00:01:47.149> we<00:01:47.479> go<00:01:48.549> it's<00:01:49.549> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
whole session comes off the splines just

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.089

this front one was 90 and I got it held
up<00:02:04.009> by<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.189> bungee<00:02:04.399> cord<00:02:04.549> there<00:02:04.999> so<00:02:05.599> now<00:02:06.609> simply

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
up by a bungee cord there so now simply

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:13.230 
up by a bungee cord there so now simply
flipped<00:02:08.060> down<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:11.090> axle<00:02:11.750> caliper<00:02:12.320> holding

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
flipped down this axle caliper holding

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.350 
flipped down this axle caliper holding
mechanism<00:02:14.240> dealio

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
mechanism dealio

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.870 
mechanism dealio
and<00:02:16.260> blew<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.700> axle<00:02:18.270> out<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.680> top<00:02:19.950> okay<00:02:20.820> so

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
and blew the axle out the top okay so

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.330 
and blew the axle out the top okay so
I'd<00:02:21.120> finished<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:22.350> side<00:02:22.680> with<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.160> boot

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
I'd finished this side with the boot

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.910 
I'd finished this side with the boot
that's<00:02:23.790> all<00:02:24.060> complete<00:02:24.570> now<00:02:25.470> I'm<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.800> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
that's all complete now I'm going to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.490 
that's all complete now I'm going to
explain<00:02:26.280> what<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.580> did<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.150> side<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:30.500> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
explain what I did on this side so the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.650 
explain what I did on this side so the
message<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:31.980> I'm<00:02:32.070> using<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:33.120> does<00:02:33.510> not

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
message that I'm using you does not

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.750 
message that I'm using you does not
require<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.140> take<00:02:34.350> off<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.560> brake<00:02:34.950> or<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
require you to take off the brake or the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.460 
require you to take off the brake or the
chain<00:02:36.150> mechanism<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.950> remain<00:02:38.790> on

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
chain mechanism so I can remain on

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.020 
chain mechanism so I can remain on
instead<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.590> pulling<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:41.010> whole<00:02:41.070> axle<00:02:41.790> out

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
instead of pulling this whole axle out

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.550 
instead of pulling this whole axle out
which<00:02:43.020> requires<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.650> unscrew<00:02:44.400> this

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
which requires you to unscrew this

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
part of the axle off which is actually

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.090 
part of the axle off which is actually
pretty<00:03:08.700> easy<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:09.239> take<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.440> clamp<00:03:10.830> off

pretty easy to do take this clamp off

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.479 
pretty easy to do take this clamp off
this<00:03:11.489> clamp<00:03:11.850> off<00:03:12.060> pull<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.570> boot<00:03:12.720> up<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.489> then

this clamp off pull the boot up and then
simply<00:03:15.239> hit<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:16.260> end<00:03:16.530> part<00:03:16.800> off<00:03:17.010> directly

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
simply hit this end part off directly

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.750 
simply hit this end part off directly
straight<00:03:18.540> off<00:03:18.750> with<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> hammer<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:20.519> want<00:03:20.700> to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
straight off with a hammer you want to

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.850 
straight off with a hammer you want to
use<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.880> soft<00:03:21.330> mallet<00:03:21.870> hammer<00:03:22.200> like<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.650> black

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
use a soft mallet hammer like that black

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.479 
use a soft mallet hammer like that black
one<00:03:23.040> back<00:03:23.190> there<00:03:23.930> because<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:26.010> will<00:03:26.220> damage

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
one back there because you will damage

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.340 
one back there because you will damage
your<00:03:26.760> bearings<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.360> what<00:03:27.510> not<00:03:27.690> if<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.930> use<00:03:27.959> a

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
your bearings and what not if you use a

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.280 
your bearings and what not if you use a
real<00:03:29.070> hammer<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.180> reason<00:03:30.480> why<00:03:30.600> I'm<00:03:30.900> for

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
real hammer so the reason why I'm for

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.140 
real hammer so the reason why I'm for
this<00:03:31.470> method<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.980> because<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.640> forces<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.120> to

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
this method is because it forces you to

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.080 
this method is because it forces you to
check<00:03:33.450> these<00:03:33.600> boots<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.200> forces<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.280> re

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
check these boots and forces you to re

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.699 
check these boots and forces you to re
grease<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.720> inside<00:03:37.049> which<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.470> good

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
grease on the inside which is a good

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.430 
grease on the inside which is a good
thing<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.950> do<00:03:38.070> anyways<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.480> let's<00:03:39.510> get<00:03:39.840> started

so I'm going to take off this clamp and
this<00:03:42.540> clamp<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:43.110> little<00:03:43.170> bit<00:03:43.530> tight<00:03:43.799> on<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
this clamp a little bit tight on the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.520 
this clamp a little bit tight on the
vice<00:03:45.269> grips<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.410> push<00:03:46.980> up<00:03:47.130> clamp<00:03:48.410> there<00:03:49.410> you

vice grips you push up clamp there you

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.300 
vice grips you push up clamp there you
go<00:03:49.910> all<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.150> stuff<00:03:51.420> pops<00:03:51.660> off<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.220> then<00:03:53.220> you

go all that stuff pops off and then you

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.560 
go all that stuff pops off and then you
just<00:03:53.519> take<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.570> vise<00:03:54.750> grip<00:03:55.019> off<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.730> the

just take the vise grip off and the

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.479 
just take the vise grip off and the
clamp<00:03:57.840> comes<00:03:58.049> off<00:03:58.320> with<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.709> see<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.630> yay

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
clamp comes off with it see that yay

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.900 
clamp comes off with it see that yay
progress<00:04:02.489> alright<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:04.590> comes<00:04:04.830> off<00:04:05.040> we're

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
progress alright so that comes off we're

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.789 
progress alright so that comes off we're
going<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.090> use<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.360> later<00:04:06.690> this<00:04:07.140> boot<00:04:07.470> peels

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
going to use that later this boot peels

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.970 
going to use that later this boot peels
back<00:04:08.090> okay<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.150> reveal<00:04:09.600> a<00:04:09.630> bunch<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.049> grease

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
back okay to reveal a bunch of grease

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.860 
back okay to reveal a bunch of grease
probably<00:04:11.730> grease<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.180> needs<00:04:12.329> to<00:04:12.420> be<00:04:12.510> changed

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
probably grease that needs to be changed

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.960 
probably grease that needs to be changed
most<00:04:13.739> people<00:04:14.040> don't<00:04:14.160> ever<00:04:14.340> do<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:14.790> in<00:04:14.910> the

most people don't ever do this in the
lifetime<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.450> their<00:04:15.540> being<00:04:15.780> excellent<00:04:16.400> so

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
lifetime of their being excellent so

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.560 
lifetime of their being excellent so
let's<00:04:19.019> do<00:04:19.229> this<00:04:19.410> clamp<00:04:19.739> now<00:04:19.979> same<00:04:20.880> method<00:04:21.299> and

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
let's do this clamp now same method and

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
preventing it from falling off so I

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.210 
preventing it from falling off so I
might<00:04:51.360> have<00:04:51.390> to<00:04:51.600> stop<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.530> camera<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.070> do

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
might have to stop the camera and do

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:01.970 
might have to stop the camera and do
this<00:05:00.020> after<00:05:01.020> beating<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.320> crap<00:05:01.560> out<00:05:01.740> of<00:05:01.800> it

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
this after beating the crap out of it

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.290 
this after beating the crap out of it
that's<00:05:02.940> what<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.180> looks<00:05:03.360> like<00:05:04.400> your<00:05:05.400> spline

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
that's what it looks like your spline

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.410 
that's what it looks like your spline
clamp<00:05:06.900> is<00:05:07.230> right<00:05:07.440> there<00:05:08.030> case<00:05:09.030> we're<00:05:09.270> going<00:05:09.360> to

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
clamp is right there case we're going to

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.870 
clamp is right there case we're going to
clean<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:09.780> up<00:05:10.010> pull<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.130> boot<00:05:11.430> right<00:05:11.730> out

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
clean this up pull this boot right out

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.980 
clean this up pull this boot right out
of<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.030> bottom<00:05:12.390> so<00:05:14.390> using<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.450> flat<00:05:15.720> blade

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
of the bottom so using a flat blade

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.960 
of the bottom so using a flat blade
screwdriver<00:05:16.350> we're<00:05:17.040> going<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.340> take<00:05:17.520> this

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
screwdriver we're going to take this

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:29.060 
screwdriver we're going to take this
seal<00:05:19.460> inner-workings<00:05:20.720> thing<00:05:21.720> all<00:05:27.800> there<00:05:28.800> we

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
seal inner-workings thing all there we

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:36.530 
seal inner-workings thing all there we
go<00:05:30.020> alright<00:05:31.020> now<00:05:31.890> I<00:05:31.920> just<00:05:32.040> got<00:05:32.340> to<00:05:32.370> pull<00:05:35.540> yeah

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
go alright now I just got to pull yeah
and<00:05:37.470> it<00:05:37.620> comes<00:05:37.830> out<00:05:38.070> come<00:05:39.060> on<00:05:39.500> voila

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.610 

here<00:05:43.560> is<00:05:43.920> the<00:05:44.130> axle<00:05:44.640> with<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.360> boot<00:05:45.540> off<00:05:45.870> okay

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
here is the axle with the boot off okay

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.090 
here is the axle with the boot off okay
and<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:48.060> put<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.360> chain<00:05:48.690> mechanism<00:05:49.620> back

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
and I put the chain mechanism back

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.670 
and I put the chain mechanism back
together<00:05:50.280> because<00:05:50.970> it's<00:05:51.210> in<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.420> way<00:05:51.600> if<00:05:52.500> you

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
together because it's in the way if you

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.310 
together because it's in the way if you
take<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:52.950> off<00:05:53.040> so<00:05:53.220> don't<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.430> it<00:05:53.550> off<00:05:53.780> so<00:05:54.780> in<00:05:54.990> here

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
take it off so don't a it off so in here

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.630 
take it off so don't a it off so in here
we're<00:05:55.530> going<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.680> clean<00:05:55.950> that<00:05:56.130> out<00:05:56.160> I<00:05:56.310> did

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
we're going to clean that out I did

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.980 
we're going to clean that out I did
pretty<00:05:56.880> good<00:05:57.090> job<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:57.540> far

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
taking all most of that crease we need a

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.370 
taking all most of that crease we need a
little<00:05:59.940> bit<00:06:00.030> better<00:06:00.150> out<00:06:00.390> of<00:06:00.480> there<00:06:00.600> and<00:06:00.750> then

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
little bit better out of there and then

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.900 
little bit better out of there and then
we're<00:06:01.560> going<00:06:01.680> to<00:06:01.710> stick<00:06:01.950> our<00:06:02.070> brand-new<00:06:02.640> boot

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
we're going to stick our brand-new boot

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.640 
we're going to stick our brand-new boot
on<00:06:03.150> so<00:06:03.840> there's<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.110> grease<00:06:04.290> in<00:06:04.470> there<00:06:04.620> I

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
on so there's the grease in there I

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.870 
on so there's the grease in there I
tried<00:06:04.890> to<00:06:04.980> shove<00:06:05.160> it<00:06:05.280> in<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.460> bearings<00:06:05.760> as

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
tried to shove it in the bearings as

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.140 
tried to shove it in the bearings as
much<00:06:06.030> as<00:06:06.150> possible<00:06:07.340> and<00:06:10.490> alright<00:06:11.490> so<00:06:12.000> now<00:06:12.090> I'm

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
going to put this boot back in shove it

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
going to put this boot back in shove it
in<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.450> then<00:06:15.600> clamp<00:06:16.200> it<00:06:17.270> super<00:06:18.270> alright<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:18.960> I

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
got the ring on as well which is a big

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
got the ring on as well which is a big
pain<00:06:21.270> in<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.480> butt

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
pain in the butt

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.050 
pain in the butt
barely<00:06:23.010> slips<00:06:23.280> in<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.430> hole<00:06:24.230> so<00:06:25.230> yeah<00:06:26.100> that's

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
barely slips in the hole so yeah that's

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.040 
barely slips in the hole so yeah that's
the<00:06:27.270> thing<00:06:27.600> and<00:06:29.000> you<00:06:30.000> got<00:06:30.120> a<00:06:30.150> pound<00:06:30.450> in<00:06:30.720> your

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
the thing and you got a pound in your

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.620 
the thing and you got a pound in your
ring<00:06:31.470> with<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.680> screwdriver<00:06:31.920> in<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:33.270> mallet

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
ring with the screwdriver in the mallet

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.070 
ring with the screwdriver in the mallet
just<00:06:34.050> make<00:06:34.230> sure<00:06:34.410> it<00:06:34.500> seals<00:06:34.910> correctly<00:06:36.080> which

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
just make sure it seals correctly which

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.570 
just make sure it seals correctly which
I<00:06:37.260> believe<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.830> have<00:06:38.130> successfully<00:06:38.940> done<00:06:39.570> um

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
I believe I have successfully done um

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
I believe I have successfully done um
now<00:06:41.580> it's<00:06:41.790> clamping<00:06:42.300> this

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
now it's clamping this

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.640 
now it's clamping this
first<00:06:43.230> part<00:06:44.210> so<00:06:45.210> the<00:06:45.390> clamp<00:06:45.630> on<00:06:45.810> there

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
first part so the clamp on there

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.890 
first part so the clamp on there
I<00:06:46.680> put<00:06:47.220> the<00:06:47.430> slid<00:06:47.940> the<00:06:48.030> boot<00:06:48.180> back<00:06:48.360> on<00:06:48.600> have

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
I put the slid the boot back on have

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.650 
I put the slid the boot back on have
them<00:06:49.050> tighten<00:06:49.380> that<00:06:49.560> clamp<00:06:50.150> right<00:06:51.150> there

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
them tighten that clamp right there

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.360 
them tighten that clamp right there
can<00:06:52.050> we<00:06:52.200> grease<00:06:52.470> out<00:06:52.740> because<00:06:53.040> I'm<00:06:53.160> going<00:06:53.310> to

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
can we grease out because I'm going to

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.330 
can we grease out because I'm going to
regress<00:06:53.820> this<00:06:54.390> end<00:06:54.630> of<00:06:54.750> the<00:06:54.810> axle<00:06:55.260> uh<00:06:55.440> but

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
regress this end of the axle uh but

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.820 
regress this end of the axle uh but
first<00:06:56.640> we're<00:06:57.030> going<00:06:57.270> to<00:06:57.450> hammer<00:06:57.990> this<00:06:58.500> end

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
first we're going to hammer this end

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.100 
first we're going to hammer this end
back<00:06:59.100> on<00:06:59.370> do<00:06:59.880> it<00:07:00.000> without<00:07:00.150> greasing<00:07:00.900> it<00:07:01.020> at

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
back on do it without greasing it at

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.510 
back on do it without greasing it at
first<00:07:01.320> because<00:07:01.590> then<00:07:01.860> it<00:07:01.950> makes<00:07:02.130> it<00:07:02.250> harder

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
first because then it makes it harder

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.000 
first because then it makes it harder
and<00:07:02.970> your<00:07:03.180> bearings<00:07:03.510> pop<00:07:03.720> out<00:07:03.960> if<00:07:04.650> you<00:07:04.770> do<00:07:04.890> it

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
and your bearings pop out if you do it

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.830 
and your bearings pop out if you do it
wrong<00:07:05.220> so<00:07:05.730> we're<00:07:06.180> going<00:07:06.270> to<00:07:06.360> pound<00:07:06.480> this<00:07:06.630> back

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
wrong so we're going to pound this back

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.240 
wrong so we're going to pound this back
on<00:07:07.080> the<00:07:07.290> same<00:07:07.470> mallet<00:07:07.950> and<00:07:08.070> then<00:07:08.790> grease<00:07:09.570> it<00:07:09.750> up

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
on the same mallet and then grease it up
