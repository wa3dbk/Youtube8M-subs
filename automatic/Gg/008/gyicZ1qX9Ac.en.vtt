00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
hey guys joe here and I've got team

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.910 
hey guys joe here and I've got team
deathmatch<00:00:14.759> game<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.299> invasion<00:00:15.800> I'll<00:00:16.800> be

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
deathmatch game on invasion I'll be

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.840 
deathmatch game on invasion I'll be
using<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.279> tar<00:00:17.580> 21<00:00:18.570> with<00:00:19.529> bling<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.580> has<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
using a tar 21 with bling it has a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.980 
using a tar 21 with bling it has a
silencer<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.650> has<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.039> red<00:00:23.460> dot<00:00:23.670> sight<00:00:23.990> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
silencer and it has a red dot sight the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630 
silencer and it has a red dot sight the
reason<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:25.410> using<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.800> red<00:00:25.920> dot<00:00:26.130> sight<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
reason I'm using a red dot sight is

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.120 
reason I'm using a red dot sight is
because<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.420> wanted<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> holographic<00:00:28.740> scope

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
because I wanted the holographic scope

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.080 
because I wanted the holographic scope
and<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:31.040> don't<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> red<00:00:32.550> dot<00:00:32.730> sight<00:00:32.940> on

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and I don't like the red dot sight on

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.959 
and I don't like the red dot sight on
this<00:00:33.210> weapon<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:34.380> weapon<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> f2000<00:00:35.880> I

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
this weapon this weapon and the f2000 I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
this weapon this weapon and the f2000 I
just<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.420> can't<00:00:36.989> really<00:00:37.140> use<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
just I can't really use it the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
just I can't really use it the
holographic<00:00:38.579> sight<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> great<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.629> this

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
holographic sight is great on this

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.750 
holographic sight is great on this
weapon<00:00:40.260> though<00:00:40.760> it's<00:00:41.760> nutty<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.420> good<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
weapon though it's nutty how good it is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.150 
weapon though it's nutty how good it is
so<00:00:44.760> yeah<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:46.710> haven't

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
so yeah if you have if you don't haven't

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
so yeah if you have if you don't haven't
really<00:00:47.340> tried<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.670> gun<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.899> like

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
really tried this gun and you don't like

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.049 
really tried this gun and you don't like
the<00:00:49.170> silencer<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> should<00:00:50.850> try

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the silencer on it then you should try

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
the silencer on it then you should try
the<00:00:51.780> holographic<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.070> it's

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the holographic I really like it it's

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
the holographic I really like it it's
pretty<00:00:53.969> good<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.789> next<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.300> next<00:00:57.570> game<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
pretty good and next up my next game I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.950 
pretty good and next up my next game I
should<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.789> think<00:00:59.789> I'm<00:01:00.149> gonna<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
should do I think I'm gonna do the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
should do I think I'm gonna do the
classes<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.890> an<00:01:02.039> updated<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
classes with an updated one because a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
classes with an updated one because a
lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> people<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.750> asked<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.229> now

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
lot of people have asked for that now

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
that I'm 10th prestige now that i have
10<00:01:06.240> classes<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.890> games<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
10 classes now that the games kind of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
10 classes now that the games kind of
developed<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.360> people<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> clue

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
developed more and people have a clue

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.740 
developed more and people have a clue
what<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> better<00:01:11.970> classes<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.600> they

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
what what the better classes are they

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
what what the better classes are they
want<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> know<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.320> i'm<00:01:13.409> using<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.610> i'm

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
five of them partied up I just changed

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
five of them partied up I just changed
my<00:01:44.340> client<00:01:44.759> tag<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.090> their<00:01:45.210> clan<00:01:45.450> tag<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:45.899> fun

you<00:01:46.460> know<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.939> throw<00:01:48.210> them<00:01:48.270> off<00:01:48.420> maybe<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020

real<00:02:38.700> quick<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:40.889> two<00:02:41.099> bullets

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
real quick and I think it's two bullets

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.399 
real quick and I think it's two bullets
that<00:02:41.519> can<00:02:41.639> take<00:02:41.819> someone<00:02:42.120> out<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
that can take someone out and the

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.289 
that can take someone out and the
magnums<00:02:43.829> are<00:02:44.040> way<00:02:44.280> better<00:02:44.519> than<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.879> D<00:02:45.060> goals

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
magnums are way better than the D goals

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.690 
magnums are way better than the D goals
in<00:02:45.590> my<00:02:46.590> opinion<00:02:46.829> in<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.220> game<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:49.489> still<00:02:50.489> use<00:02:50.609> a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
in my opinion in this game I still use a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.509 
in my opinion in this game I still use a
beagle<00:02:51.000> though<00:02:51.120> because<00:02:52.049> it's<00:02:52.409> it's<00:02:52.919> a<00:02:53.099> desert

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
beagle though because it's it's a desert

eagle<00:02:53.760> what's<00:02:54.629> not<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.019> about<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.489> it's

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
eagle what's not to like about that it's

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.520 
eagle what's not to like about that it's
like<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:56.760> AK<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.239> can't<00:02:57.480> really<00:02:57.629> hate<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.409> in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
like the AK you can't really hate it in

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.539 
like the AK you can't really hate it in
real<00:02:58.680> life<00:02:58.969> it's<00:02:59.969> just<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:01.109> gun<00:03:01.409> that<00:03:02.129> does

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
real life it's just that gun that does

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:09.470 
real life it's just that gun that does
work<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:06.409> yeah<00:03:07.409> I<00:03:07.889> was<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.700> little<00:03:09.000> surprised

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
work and yeah I was a little surprised

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.099 
work and yeah I was a little surprised
at<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.780> end<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.049> video<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:11.599> was<00:03:12.599> I<00:03:12.840> was

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
at the end of this video I was I was

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.110 
at the end of this video I was I was
pretty<00:03:13.349> stoked<00:03:13.590> when<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.859> got<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.400> wish<00:03:14.639> I

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
pretty stoked when I got it I wish I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.190 
pretty stoked when I got it I wish I
could<00:03:15.269> have<00:03:15.329> finished<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.689> game<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:15.870> it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
could have finished the game with it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.280 
could have finished the game with it
that<00:03:16.889> would<00:03:17.069> be<00:03:17.189> really<00:03:17.430> nice<00:03:17.989> but<00:03:18.989> that's

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
that would be really nice but that's

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.020 
that would be really nice but that's
just<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.590> way<00:03:19.709> she<00:03:19.739> goes<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:22.340> I've<00:03:23.340> semtex

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
just the way she goes and I've semtex

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.770 
just the way she goes and I've semtex
all<00:03:24.239> instead<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.629> a<00:03:24.720> frag<00:03:24.989> or<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.319> claim<00:03:25.889> where

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
all instead of a frag or a claim where

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.330 
all instead of a frag or a claim where
some<00:03:27.780> text<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.169> better<00:03:28.379> than<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.650> frag<00:03:28.919> in<00:03:29.189> my

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
some text is better than a frag in my

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.879 
some text is better than a frag in my
opinion<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.989> can't<00:03:30.989> really<00:03:31.169> use<00:03:31.319> frags<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.739> this

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
opinion I can't really use frags in this

frag I can't do those like I I don't

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.149 
frag I can't do those like I I don't
know<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:51.060> nate<00:03:51.329> is<00:03:51.569> just<00:03:51.810> normal<00:03:52.620> frag<00:03:52.949> it's

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
know the nate is just normal frag it's

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.429

not<00:03:53.310> good<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.819> my<00:03:54.540> opinion<00:03:54.569> I<00:03:55.079> can't<00:03:55.290> really

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
not good in my opinion I can't really

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.039 
not good in my opinion I can't really
use<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.739> semtex<00:03:55.949> seems<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.579> much<00:03:56.699> better

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
use it the semtex seems so much better

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.990 
use it the semtex seems so much better
so<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.079> can<00:03:58.139> stick<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.709> walls<00:03:58.949> to<00:03:59.519> ceilings

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
so you can stick it to walls to ceilings

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.949 
so you can stick it to walls to ceilings
to<00:04:00.389> people<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.939> I<00:04:02.939> find<00:04:03.329> that<00:04:03.449> it<00:04:03.569> has<00:04:03.689> like<00:04:03.930> a

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
to people and I find that it has like a

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.580 
to people and I find that it has like a
better<00:04:04.229> book<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:05.000> can't<00:04:06.000> talk<00:04:06.180> better<00:04:06.780> blast

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
better book I can't talk better blast

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.849 
better book I can't talk better blast
radius<00:04:07.859> maybe<00:04:08.400> I'm<00:04:08.909> not<00:04:09.150> sure<00:04:09.419> I<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:10.620> get<00:04:10.739> my

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
radius maybe I'm not sure I just get my

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.120 
radius maybe I'm not sure I just get my
kills<00:04:11.129> with<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.810> tar<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.560> really

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
kills with it and the tar is a really

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.640 
kills with it and the tar is a really
good<00:04:17.250> weapon<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:18.169> said<00:04:19.169> earlier<00:04:19.320> with

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
good weapon I said earlier with

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.760 
good weapon I said earlier with
holographic<00:04:20.070> it's<00:04:20.370> good<00:04:20.579> but<00:04:20.789> it's<00:04:21.380> not<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
holographic it's good but it's not the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.000 
holographic it's good but it's not the
most<00:04:23.729> accurate<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.300> guns<00:04:24.510> long<00:04:25.469> range<00:04:25.650> but<00:04:25.889> it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
most accurate of guns long range but it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.440 
most accurate of guns long range but it
makes<00:04:26.219> up<00:04:26.460> for<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.849> with

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
makes up for it with

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.710 
makes up for it with
power<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:29.070> kills<00:04:29.340> people<00:04:29.700> real<00:04:29.970> quick<00:04:32.540> I'm<00:04:33.540> not

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
power it kills people real quick I'm not

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.200 
power it kills people real quick I'm not
sure<00:04:33.930> how<00:04:34.110> many<00:04:34.170> bullets<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.970> pretty

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
sure how many bullets but it's pretty

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.780 
sure how many bullets but it's pretty
nasty<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.950> f2000<00:04:38.790> however<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:41.610> has<00:04:41.760> a

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
nasty the f2000 however I it has a

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.300 
nasty the f2000 however I it has a
really<00:04:42.120> fast<00:04:42.390> rate<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.750> fire<00:04:42.950> but<00:04:43.950> it's<00:04:44.130> got

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
really fast rate of fire but it's got

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.550 
really fast rate of fire but it's got
that<00:04:44.460> recoil<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.240> too<00:04:45.420> which<00:04:46.410> is<00:04:46.500> really

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
that recoil to it too which is really

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.040 
that recoil to it too which is really
annoying<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.670> holographic<00:04:48.150> on<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.750> think

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
annoying the holographic on it I think

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.190 
annoying the holographic on it I think
it<00:04:49.230> kind<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.650> reduces<00:04:49.770> recoil<00:04:50.250> up<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:51.200> don't

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
it kind of reduces recoil up I don't

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.840 
it kind of reduces recoil up I don't
know<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.440> seems<00:04:52.650> like<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.950> for<00:04:53.100> me<00:04:53.220> sometimes

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
know it seems like it for me sometimes

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.180 
know it seems like it for me sometimes
the<00:04:54.030> read<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.590> recoil<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.650> reduced<00:04:55.950> when<00:04:56.040> i

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
the read the recoil is reduced when i

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.970 
the read the recoil is reduced when i
use<00:04:56.340> holographic<00:04:56.880> on<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.500> i'll<00:04:58.500> have<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.740> test

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
use holographic on it i'll have to test

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.330 
use holographic on it i'll have to test
that<00:04:59.070> out<00:04:59.160> some<00:04:59.490> more<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:01.560> i<00:05:01.770> got<00:05:01.920> double<00:05:02.190> team

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
that out some more and i got double team

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.810 
that out some more and i got double team
there<00:05:03.200> that<00:05:04.200> sounds<00:05:04.440> pretty<00:05:04.530> gay<00:05:04.800> hey<00:05:05.370> I<00:05:05.520> mean

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
there that sounds pretty gay hey I mean

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.040 
there that sounds pretty gay hey I mean
I<00:05:06.060> got<00:05:06.270> ganged<00:05:07.200> up<00:05:07.350> on<00:05:08.210> hi<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.270> people<00:05:09.630> using<00:05:09.870> a

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
I got ganged up on hi to people using a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.020 
I got ganged up on hi to people using a
UMP<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:12.320> that's<00:05:13.320> kind<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:14.130> think<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:14.970> could

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
UMP and that's kind of I think I could

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.790 
UMP and that's kind of I think I could
have<00:05:15.240> killed<00:05:15.450> at<00:05:15.870> least<00:05:16.020> one<00:05:16.260> of<00:05:16.290> them<00:05:16.500> if<00:05:16.620> I

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
have killed at least one of them if I

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.460 
have killed at least one of them if I
had<00:05:16.950> slight<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.400> hand<00:05:17.430> on<00:05:17.790> but<00:05:18.780> unfortunately

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
had slight of hand on but unfortunately

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.280 
had slight of hand on but unfortunately
i<00:05:19.500> have<00:05:19.680> bling<00:05:19.920> on<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.750> was<00:05:21.750> trying<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:22.020> get<00:05:22.110> the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
i have bling on I was trying to get the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.510 
i have bling on I was trying to get the
pro<00:05:22.590> prick<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:22.950> guess<00:05:25.220> you<00:05:26.220> don't<00:05:26.400> really

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
pro prick I guess you don't really

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.030 
pro prick I guess you don't really
realize<00:05:26.790> how<00:05:27.060> much<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:29.640> quicker<00:05:30.680> like<00:05:31.680> slept

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
realize how much the quicker like slept

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.200 
realize how much the quicker like slept
when<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.280> have<00:05:32.430> sleight<00:05:32.610> of<00:05:32.640> hand<00:05:32.850> pro<00:05:32.940> you

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
when you have sleight of hand pro you

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.900 
when you have sleight of hand pro you
can<00:05:33.300> bring<00:05:33.510> up<00:05:33.600> your<00:05:33.750> site's<00:05:33.990> faster<00:05:34.910> that

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
can bring up your site's faster that

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.880 
can bring up your site's faster that
helps<00:05:36.270> so<00:05:36.480> much<00:05:36.660> especially<00:05:36.870> in<00:05:37.320> search<00:05:37.590> when

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
helps so much especially in search when

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.550 
helps so much especially in search when
you<00:05:38.010> want<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.220> get<00:05:38.310> that<00:05:38.370> first<00:05:38.670> shot<00:05:38.910> off<00:05:39.560> so

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
you want to get that first shot off so

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.560 
you want to get that first shot off so
if<00:05:41.250> you're<00:05:41.340> playing<00:05:41.520> search<00:05:41.820> i'd<00:05:42.000> recommend

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
if you're playing search i'd recommend

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.450 
if you're playing search i'd recommend
sleight<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.840> hand<00:05:43.170> instead<00:05:44.130> of<00:05:44.280> like

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
sleight of hand instead of like

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.150 
sleight of hand instead of like
scavenger<00:05:45.240> bling<00:05:45.660> or<00:05:45.870> something<00:05:46.230> even<00:05:47.100> if

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
scavenger bling or something even if

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.270 
scavenger bling or something even if
you're<00:05:47.310> not<00:05:47.340> sniping<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.090> know<00:05:48.240> i<00:05:49.280> don't

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
you're not sniping you know i don't

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.250 
you're not sniping you know i don't
really<00:05:50.550> walk<00:05:50.790> around<00:05:51.180> with<00:05:51.390> my<00:05:51.720> left<00:05:52.080> trigger

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
really walk around with my left trigger

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.990 
really walk around with my left trigger
down<00:05:52.560> but<00:05:53.220> if<00:05:53.310> you're<00:05:53.430> one<00:05:53.520> of<00:05:53.550> those<00:05:53.670> people

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
down but if you're one of those people

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.980 
down but if you're one of those people
and<00:05:54.120> I<00:05:54.180> guess<00:05:54.330> it's<00:05:54.510> okay<00:05:54.780> for<00:05:54.840> you<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:56.400> know<00:05:56.550> I

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
and I guess it's okay for you you know I

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.600 
and I guess it's okay for you you know I
like<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.140> be<00:05:58.230> able<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.560> react<00:05:58.890> I<00:05:59.130> react<00:05:59.490> pretty

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
like to be able to react I react pretty

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.950 
like to be able to react I react pretty
quick<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.230> what<00:06:01.230> I'm<00:06:01.320> waiting<00:06:01.650> for<00:06:01.680> my<00:06:02.930> for<00:06:03.930> my

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
quick and what I'm waiting for my for my

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.520 
quick and what I'm waiting for my for my
sights<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.470> come<00:06:04.680> up<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:05.150> usually<00:06:06.150> I'd<00:06:06.390> die<00:06:06.600> if<00:06:06.870> I

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
sights to come up I usually I'd die if I

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.310 
sights to come up I usually I'd die if I
don't<00:06:07.560> have<00:06:07.830> slight<00:06:08.040> of<00:06:08.160> hand<00:06:08.870> so<00:06:09.870> yeah<00:06:10.140> that's

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
don't have slight of hand so yeah that's

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.640 
don't have slight of hand so yeah that's
my<00:06:10.440> opinion<00:06:11.340> on<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.700> first<00:06:11.910> brick<00:06:12.590> and<00:06:13.590> I

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
my opinion on the first brick and I

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.700 
my opinion on the first brick and I
might<00:06:13.980> go<00:06:14.130> more<00:06:14.910> into<00:06:15.060> depth<00:06:15.360> with<00:06:15.600> that<00:06:15.930> in<00:06:16.170> my

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
might go more into depth with that in my

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.260 
might go more into depth with that in my
classes<00:06:17.010> video<00:06:18.560> but<00:06:19.560> for<00:06:19.770> now<00:06:20.060> the<00:06:21.060> game's

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
classes video but for now the game's

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.810 
classes video but for now the game's
racking<00:06:21.690> down<00:06:22.700> we<00:06:23.700> need<00:06:23.910> think<00:06:24.630> 10<00:06:25.020> kills<00:06:25.290> and

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
racking down we need think 10 kills and

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.480 
racking down we need think 10 kills and
I<00:06:26.820> get<00:06:27.510> quite<00:06:28.350> a<00:06:28.380> few<00:06:28.440> we<00:06:28.770> will<00:06:28.920> see<00:06:29.100> right<00:06:29.310> here

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
I get quite a few we will see right here

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.480 
I get quite a few we will see right here
I<00:06:29.700> go<00:06:30.000> on<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.300> little<00:06:30.570> banana<00:06:31.530> terrorist<00:06:32.220> Abe

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
I go on a little banana terrorist Abe
