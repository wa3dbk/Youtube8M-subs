00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
using their whole ten by ten meter so

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.000 
using their whole ten by ten meter so
for<00:03:31.450> individuals<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.290> only<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.860> level

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
for individuals it is only the level

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.750 
for individuals it is only the level
tens<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:34.180> use<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:35.320> whole<00:03:35.530> floor<00:03:35.800> okay

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
tens that we use the whole floor okay

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.800 
tens that we use the whole floor okay
that<00:03:37.300> was<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.450> straddle<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:39.340> why<00:03:39.600> would<00:03:40.600> you

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
that was a straddle so why would you

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.830 
that was a straddle so why would you
just<00:03:41.140> use<00:03:41.350> their<00:03:41.620> ten<00:03:41.980> by<00:03:42.160> ten<00:03:42.670> just<00:03:43.570> for<00:03:43.750> the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
just use their ten by ten just for the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.070 
just use their ten by ten just for the
senior<00:03:44.260> level<00:03:44.769> well<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.630> as<00:03:46.840> you

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
senior level well I think that as you

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.080 
senior level well I think that as you
become<00:03:48.010> more<00:03:48.070> experienced

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
become more experienced

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.570 
become more experienced
and<00:03:49.210> more<00:03:49.720> powerful<00:03:50.230> you're<00:03:50.440> able<00:03:50.770> to<00:03:50.800> utilize

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
and more powerful you're able to utilize

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.520 
and more powerful you're able to utilize
more<00:03:52.030> space<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.600> traveling<00:03:52.990> yep
