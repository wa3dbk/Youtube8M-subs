00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.140
 Hello my dear 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.030
 we do again delicious jam 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.230
 or jam or how that looks 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:46.050
 scolds and indeed from this raised style 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:50.770
 I have apricot and the kiwi recipe 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.300
 from vorwerk they have one now 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.739
 great newsletter sent back over 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.350
 the man on the forward side 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.050
 subscribe or is among others 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.960
 Buy this jam with the and would like 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.410
 I like to try it out today at night 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 but as a precaution, half the time 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.550
 so with a total of 500 grams of fruit 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.080
 because I like to jam but me 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.850
 do not know less constellation 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.130
 kiwi tastes and then I am first 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.490
 careful and watch first as the Sun 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.540
 is 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.540
 So now I have 300 grams 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.870
 and 200 gram is that if we 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.360
 wanted to make a kilo of fruit 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.600
 According to the recipe, you have to have 600 grams 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.930
 take apricots and 400 grams of the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.180
 kiwis the kiwis are quartered the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:59.430
 apricots are halved and the stone 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:02:03.160
 I like it already 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:10.649
 arises here eight seconds stage 5 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.649
 mince four seconds 5 or 3 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.170
 I do not take two too only 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.910
 sugar i dont know i am now 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.459
 ever live like a jam and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.100
 with 1 incisions or somehow better 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.890
 but everyone must own a very 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.870
 individual matter now comes to rest 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.280
 3 I take half would 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.690
 seven and a half grams 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.450
 of this complete offset 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.730
 Of course I never do it now 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:32.290
 a splash of rhine until the 5 appears 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:37.180
 finished and yet we have finished 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.970
 the time every 13 minutes 100 degrees 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.489
 and then is the level 2 I make 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.680
 but always level 3 at all jams 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.070
 make always level 3 because then 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.220
 already funny enough is enough then 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.890
 I do not need it again afterwards 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.150
 puree or what to be too big for me 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:04.209
 should and I do the last time 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:06.940
 not done read that one the 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.470
 Cover should leave so that the 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.560
 moisture escape and that one 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:16.030
 a little better the mass and miner 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.859
 out of stage three drummers pass away 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.160
 to press the button now 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.780
 I already have all heads with people 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.730
 show you the measure so jam 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.680
 rausgeholt 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.030
 it shall establish tell from the address 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.670
 is my dirty top if you the 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.170
 I want to see the number I have here now 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.150
 just filled the jam or 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.130
 then jam or baritone approach 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.970
 It'll make you feel dizzy that way 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.510
 So off 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.070
 Here are these beautiful labels 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.930
 I also got it printed 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.810
 that has that together with the thermomix 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.980
 newsletter given me beautiful look at you 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.080
 nevertheless times to times just my ceiling enough 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.330
 screw it on 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.740
 I 've just had such a piece 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:10.640
 like a man 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:13.640
 finger but I liked it well 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:19.750
 apricot war the rest of my family 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.750
 I was there so no matter 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.210
 6 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:04.210
 my facebook helps together afterwards 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.860
 Everything is arranged here 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.920
 it looks like it was missing a glass 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.000
 I know I like it so much 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.710
 So who is like apricot for the 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.270
 I would say that's what if you are 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.650
 I'll try it if it's one 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.680
 bit of storey have a bit 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.940
 have finer then mashed the am 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.680
 in the beginning a little bit more but so 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.130
 I think that's actually optimal 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.150
 So I like that so okay okay me 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.150
