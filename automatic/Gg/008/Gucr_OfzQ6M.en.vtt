this<00:00:35.329> a<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.660> picture<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.200> I've<00:00:37.380> got

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this a good picture then I've got

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.069 
this a good picture then I've got
beautiful<00:00:37.860> picture<00:00:38.579> day<00:00:41.600> well<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.899> left

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
beautiful picture day well in my left

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.490 
beautiful picture day well in my left
hand<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.770> feather<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:45.750> my<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.110> hand<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
hand I have a feather to my right hand a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.639 
hand I have a feather to my right hand a
hammer<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.010> guess<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> reasons<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.469> got

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
hammer I guess one of the reasons we got

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
hammer I guess one of the reasons we got
here<00:00:49.710> today<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> gentleman

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
here today was because of a gentleman

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.840 
here today was because of a gentleman
named<00:00:51.539> Galileo<00:00:51.629> long<00:00:52.379> time<00:00:52.620> ago<00:00:52.890> who<00:00:53.640> made<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
named Galileo long time ago who made a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
named Galileo long time ago who made a
rather<00:00:53.940> significant<00:00:54.809> discovery<00:00:55.320> about

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
rather significant discovery about

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.580 
rather significant discovery about
falling<00:00:56.160> objects<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.090> gravity<00:00:57.449> fields<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
falling objects and gravity fields and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.560 
falling objects and gravity fields and
we<00:00:58.770> thought<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.609> world<00:01:00.300> would<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
we thought that the world would be a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.990 
we thought that the world would be a
better<00:01:00.629> place<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.890> confirm<00:01:02.309> his<00:01:02.550> findings

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
better place to confirm his findings

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.399 
better place to confirm his findings
than<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> moon<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.020> thought<00:01:07.200> we'd

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
than on the moon and so we thought we'd

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.560 
than on the moon and so we thought we'd
try<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> feather

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
try it here for you and the feather

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
try it here for you and the feather
happens<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.110> appropriately<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.979> falcon

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
happens to be appropriately a falcon

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
happens to be appropriately a falcon
feather<00:01:12.290> for<00:01:13.290> our<00:01:13.350> Falcon<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.460> I'll<00:01:15.030> drop<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
feather for our Falcon and I'll drop the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
feather for our Falcon and I'll drop the
two<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.680> hopefully<00:01:16.860> they'll<00:01:17.729> hit

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
two up here and hopefully they'll hit

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.859 
two up here and hopefully they'll hit
the<00:01:17.880> ground<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> same<00:01:18.600> time<00:01:20.659> about<00:01:21.659> that

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
the ground at the same time about that

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.580 
the ground at the same time about that
mr.<00:01:24.869> Galileo<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.530> correct<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.380> we're

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
mr. Galileo was correct and so now we're

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.230 
mr. Galileo was correct and so now we're
gonna<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.040> we're<00:01:29.130> gonna<00:01:29.189> take<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.729> look<00:01:30.000> at

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
gonna do is we're gonna take a look at

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
gonna do is we're gonna take a look at
the<00:01:30.390> video<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.659> figure<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:30.990> variables<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the video and figure out variables that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
the video and figure out variables that
we<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.790> calculate

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
we know and see what we can calculate

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.340 
we know and see what we can calculate
from<00:01:33.570> there

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
from there

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
from there
so<00:01:34.650> Bobby<00:01:35.070> Jane<00:01:35.400> look<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.850> video<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.210> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so Bobby Jane look at the video which I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.899 
so Bobby Jane look at the video which I
am<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.659> looped<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.530> show<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.430> dropping<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
am a looped to just show the dropping of

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.179 
am a looped to just show the dropping of
the<00:01:39.000> objects<00:01:39.390> tell<00:01:39.900> me<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> variable<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.070> we

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the objects tell me a variable that we

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.170 
the objects tell me a variable that we
know<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:42.720> looks<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:44.520> there<00:01:44.790> initial

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
know it looks like is there initial

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.330 
know it looks like is there initial
velocity<00:01:45.600> zero<00:01:51.439> yes<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.680> initial<00:01:52.979> velocity

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
velocity zero yes the initial velocity

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.160 
velocity zero yes the initial velocity
in<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.729> Y<00:01:53.970> Direction<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.630> equal<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.079> zero

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
in the Y Direction is equal to zero

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.080 
in the Y Direction is equal to zero
because<00:01:55.710> he<00:01:55.829> drops<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.520> hammer<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
because he drops the hammer and the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
because he drops the hammer and the
feather<00:01:57.299> both<00:01:58.110> what<00:01:58.500> else<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
feather both what else we know from the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.890 
feather both what else we know from the
last<00:01:59.850> lecture<00:02:00.180> that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
last lecture that

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.680 
last lecture that
-<00:02:01.320> gravity<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.220> moon<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.640> about<00:02:02.820> one-sixth

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
- gravity on the moon is about one-sixth

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.910 
- gravity on the moon is about one-sixth
of<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.050> here<00:02:04.440> on<00:02:04.530> earth<00:02:04.680> right

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
of what it is here on earth right

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.430 
of what it is here on earth right
correct<00:02:05.850> how<00:02:06.300> we're<00:02:06.480> more<00:02:06.660> specifically<00:02:07.200> it's

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
correct how we're more specifically it's

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.410 
correct how we're more specifically it's
the<00:02:07.650> acceleration<00:02:08.280> due<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> gravity<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:09.150> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
frame rate and what we get for our

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.660 
frame rate and what we get for our
change<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.870> time<00:03:36.470> it's<00:03:37.470> one<00:03:38.190> point<00:03:38.370> two<00:03:38.640> zero

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670

Bobby<00:05:08.919> you<00:05:09.280> have<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.430> question<00:05:09.960> mr.<00:05:10.960> B<00:05:11.199> where

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
Bobby you have a question mr. B where

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.800 
Bobby you have a question mr. B where
did<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.800> negative<00:05:12.039> go<00:05:12.400> oh<00:05:12.610> all<00:05:13.300> right<00:05:13.510> okay<00:05:13.630> so

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
did the negative go oh all right okay so

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.379 
did the negative go oh all right okay so
the<00:05:14.349> Delta<00:05:14.860> Y<00:05:15.039> or<00:05:15.220> displacement<00:05:15.699> has<00:05:16.120> both

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
the Delta Y or displacement has both

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.300 
the Delta Y or displacement has both
magnitude<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.080> direction<00:05:17.320> because<00:05:18.070> the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
magnitude and direction because the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.279 
magnitude and direction because the
hammer<00:05:18.490> hammer<00:05:18.909> and<00:05:19.210> feather<00:05:19.300> were<00:05:19.990> going

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
hammer hammer and feather were going

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.110 
hammer hammer and feather were going
down<00:05:20.560> this<00:05:21.130> means<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.580> displacements

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
down this means that the displacements

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.450 
down this means that the displacements
were<00:05:22.300> negative<00:05:22.900> however<00:05:23.289> I<00:05:23.530> asked<00:05:24.039> for<00:05:24.250> the

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
were negative however I asked for the

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.460 
were negative however I asked for the
height<00:05:24.729> initial<00:05:25.150> above<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.750> ground<00:05:25.960> which<00:05:26.440> is

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
height initial above the ground which is

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.450 
height initial above the ground which is
a<00:05:26.620> positive<00:05:27.190> number<00:05:27.479> any<00:05:28.479> other<00:05:28.720> questions<00:05:29.139> oh

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
a positive number any other questions oh

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.600 
a positive number any other questions oh
cool<00:05:30.460> video<00:05:30.789> in<00:05:31.409> that<00:05:32.409> case<00:05:32.650> realize<00:05:33.190> that<00:05:33.370> we

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
cool video in that case realize that we

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.129 
cool video in that case realize that we
just<00:05:33.820> took<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.210> video<00:05:34.389> that<00:05:34.659> was<00:05:34.750> filmed<00:05:34.780> in

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
just took a video that was filmed in

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.700 
just took a video that was filmed in
1971<00:05:36.099> on<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.820> moon<00:05:37.180> which<00:05:37.810> has<00:05:38.050> almost<00:05:38.470> no

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
1971 on the moon which has almost no

1971 on the moon which has almost no
atmosphere<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:39.849> therefore<00:05:40.539> the<00:05:40.900> hammer<00:05:41.110> the

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
atmosphere and therefore the hammer the

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.439 
atmosphere and therefore the hammer the
feather<00:05:41.470> worked<00:05:41.740> truly<00:05:42.159> in<00:05:42.370> freefall<00:05:42.729> we

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
feather worked truly in freefall we

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.360 
feather worked truly in freefall we
counted<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.020> frames<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.919> figure<00:05:45.130> out<00:05:45.250> how

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
counted the frames to figure out how

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.490 
counted the frames to figure out how
long<00:05:45.400> they<00:05:45.880> were<00:05:45.940> in<00:05:46.060> freefall<00:05:46.449> and<00:05:46.900> using<00:05:47.409> a

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
long they were in freefall and using a

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.040 
long they were in freefall and using a
UAM<00:05:48.250> equation<00:05:48.940> to<00:05:49.270> figure<00:05:49.570> out<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:49.840> height

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050
