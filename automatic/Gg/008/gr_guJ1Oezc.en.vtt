00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.680
 this time we are going to describe the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.260
 external and internal configuration of 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.960
 kidneys to support you I recommend you 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 use your anatomy atlas and 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.329
 Anatomical description of the organs 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.890
 next we will describe the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.219
 Kidney external configuration 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.180
 right we take the right kidney and 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:52.359
 we can point your previous face too 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.869
 we place the back face the pole 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.289
 upper the lower pole the edge 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:01.320
 external and the inner edge as we know 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.909
 that we are in the previous face 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.640
 let's remember that we have structures in 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.149
 the renal thread the structure that leaves the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.460
 kidney wire and having larger diameter 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.170
 corresponds to the renal vein the vein are 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.929
 very elastic therefore they are more 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.600
 great that the arteries themselves can 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.490
 observe then the renal vein and 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.130
 we also observe how the veins come 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.530
 segmentaries to join to form the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.929
 renal vein that will lead to 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.959
 inferior vena cava in the back 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.709
 of the renal vein we will appreciate the 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:39.039
 artery we see the renal artery the 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:41.740
 renal artery enters the renal thread and this 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.020
 artery comes from the abdominal aorta is 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.539
 originates at height 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.359
 the first lumbar vertebra and is a branch 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.939
 visceral pair of the aorta dominates equal 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.729
 this artery when it enters the kidney it 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.119
 divided into segmental arteries and in the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.020
 back we will find the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.740
 renal pelvis 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.170
 this structure leaves the thread reigns and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.259
 shape of the union of the greater chalices 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.599
 and the larger chalices were formed logically 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.489
 of the union of the lesser chalices 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.060
 we can observe then the pelvis 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.579
 the renal and we see that the film 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.099
 renal has a said narrowing 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.739
 narrowing corresponds above all to 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.120
 the union by pelvic hetero we are going to 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.849
 point out the ureter or pelvic junction and 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.160
 this narrowing is a narrowing 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.140
 physiological and anatomical if you get to have 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.110
 a renal clearance of the patient in 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.720
 this area can obstruct the light of the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.720
 ureter another structure that we find 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.239
 in the renal nest is the peri renal fat 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.819
 this fat completely surrounds the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.900
 elements that enter or exit through the thread 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.110
 kidney also 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.090
 we observe dilations of the veins and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.010
 lymph nodes distributed in the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.230
 periphery another important feature 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.989
 that we had already mentioned is the pole 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.360
 superior the upper pole is related 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.010
 with the adrenal gland if it's the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.560
 adrenal gland or the right side 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.670
 It has triangular shape if it is on the side 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.620
 left has semi lunar shape we see 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.620
 the outer edge of the kidney that is 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.319
 slightly convex and that presents 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.260
 some and teething is also we can 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.690
 observe the lower pole of the kidney 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.959
 right side a feature that 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.190
 has the kidney is that is 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.890
 impressed by the viscera that are 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.350
 around him 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.940
 in its upper part it will have in the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.870
 pole superior to the adrenal gland 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.450
 right 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.239
 in its upper part and to the right 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.280
 will have the liver in its portion 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.129
 lower will relate to the colon 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.549
 ascending and the transverse colon and 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.519
 this structure is also related to 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.319
 the first portion of the duodenum we leave 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.310
 to the kidney on the right side and now 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.599
 we take the kidney on the left side with 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.170
 regarding the kidney on the left side 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.930
 let's look at the previous face 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.739
 we also observe the back face the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.410
 upper pole the lower pole and the 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.959
 structures that make up the renal thread 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.329
 an important feature that has 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.850
 this kidney is the relationship with 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.310
 viscera there are seats in the part 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.470
 superior is related to the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.650
 adrenal gland on the left side 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.289
 which has a semi-lunar shape is also 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.590
 relates to the glass with the tail of 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.289
 pancreas and practically related 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.050
 when the transverse colon becomes 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.100
 in descending colon and shape at the angle 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.200
 splenic 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.080
 In this way we have concluded the 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.610
 identification of the kidneys of both 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.280
 right side as the left side 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.260
 a coronal cut was made in the kidney 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.950
 at the left-side 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.890
 we open the front face and this 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.790
 way we observe two portions a 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.850
 anterior portion and a posterior portion 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.010
 we can observe the renal cortex the 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.950
 renal cortex in the structure more 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.680
 peripheral of the kidney we observe that the 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.190
 bark emits prolongation is that they are going to 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.500
 separate the pyramids from malpica this 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.560
 prolongation is called columns 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.260
 we also observe the 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.170
 pyramids of malpica the pyramid of 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.990
 hammer is divided into two portions in 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.570
 an outer marrow and in a medulla 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.420
 internal the outer medulla is the most 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.330
 vascularized the internal medulla in the 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.390
 less vascularized the internal medulla of the 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.780
 vertex has the renal papilla said to 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.000
 stack fits into the smaller chalices the 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.640
 smaller chalices join to form the 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.400
 larger chalices and the larger chalices are 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.950
 join to form the renal pelvis also 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.590
 we can observe the ramifications of 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.440
 the segmental arteries as well 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.710
 as the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.890
 and the fat but and kidney wrapping 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.080
 totally to the structures that come in 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.290
 and leave the renal sinus 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.420
 in this way we identify the bark 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.600
 renal where nephrons are found 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.520
 cortical the limit between the cortex and 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.150
 the bone of this the nephron yusta 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:28.200
 medullar is the pyramid of malpica its 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:31.380
 base its vertex the outer medulla the 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.290
 internal marrow the renal papillae the 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.560
 blood vessels the lesser chalices the 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:42.090
 Larger calyces the renal pelvis the fat 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:45.330
 kidney and the renal sinus in this way 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.470
 we have completed the internal configuration 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.470
 of the left kidney
