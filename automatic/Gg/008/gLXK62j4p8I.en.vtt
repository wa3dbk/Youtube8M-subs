00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.460

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.830
 and well I hope it works for them and it's going to 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.830
 explain briefly 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.930
 and simple how to jailbreak a 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.840
 ipod touch be it first second or 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.820
 third generation or the same for iphone 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 the procedure is the same 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.920
 and no matter what your iPod touch run out 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.579
 to buy and come with the software 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.579
 original 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.809
 or even if they have the original software 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.090
 that you have installed it in a 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.520
 new update from itunes there's no 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.890
 no problem with this new method is 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 very simple then 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.660
 good can you 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.160
 to teach to be brief with the version 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.160
 3.1.2 which is the most current 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.190
 good to see let's start then what 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.190
 first thing to do is 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:16.280
 opening itunes is very important they have 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.979
 have the itunes in a version 9.0 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.580
 with this you will not have any good problem 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:27.710
 The first thing you should do is download a 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:31.299
 application that is called black rain 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.299
 then find on the internet 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.090
 the name of the 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.770
 of the application is black rain 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.220
 well here is the best http diagonal 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.180
 this 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.420
 black rain and good already opening the page 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.370
 they give you here already good whether they have 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.520
 a mac or a pc or in the case you will see here 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.450
 to download 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.450
 automatically 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.850
 the download window and well what 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.290
 I have downloaded 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.810
 they keep it and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.020
 well that would be the most important thing a 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.500
 once had the application 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.620
 [Music] 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.050
 I remind you that it is not important to have 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.230
 I say it does not matter if you have the picture in a 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.040
 original version is not like before 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.140
 you had access to the first method 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.250
 go back to version 3.0 which is the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.409
 only that he got it and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.870
 now it's very easy then like me 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:48.230
 I have the 3.1.2 I have the black the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.569
 jailbreak but you do not have not yet 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.499
 worry 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.629
 all they have to do is 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.650
 connect the ipod touch once 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.900
 connected 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.340
 if they were itunes but they do not have to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.769
 recognize and do not close 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.290
 is my prediction on iTunes to be able 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.370
 do this then 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.370
 and it is vain 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.970
 the application they downloaded 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.970
 a moment ago that is the background 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.230
 they execute it 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.220
 I already have it here 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.220
 they execute it 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.800
 here will appear make it rain 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.200
 this good already made the itunes that is 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.120
 the important thing 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.470
 and it has to be connected in the ipod 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.990
 touch 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.260
 or not 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.140
 so they have then give you here 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.150
 in make the rain and automatically not 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.420
 they have to put it and powerful in mode 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.990
 efe 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.810
 nothing else that is connected 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:00.020
 mike leake wine and automatically goes to 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.050
 detect the ipod and it will restart and 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.450
 will happen to do the good jailbreak myself 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.790
 I do not do it because I already have done it already 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.200
 once this process is over they are going 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.600
 to restart the ipad will take 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.819
 around 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.220
 three minutes so much 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.220
 already once done this vain 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.640
 and learn your ipod and 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.230
 they will appear the applications that 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.230
 usually appear safari 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.180
 and it will not appear automatically if 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.180
 there is no end there 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.490
 the only thing that disappears is in the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.490
 next page in the first icon 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.139
 for people who remove the run 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.720
 they open it and 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.250
 install 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.050
 well there are the options for 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.600
 install rock 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.400
 and cid you can install the ones you want 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.660
 but it is very important to install 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.340
 what is the name of the cydia and the photos are 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.729
 optional but if I recommend you 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.699
 install the cydia because it is essential and 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.130
 well in my case I also rock 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.759
 which is very useful and much faster than 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.820
 still good this would be all already 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.100
 completed 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.129
 in this process and you already have the jailbreak 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.339
 on your ipod or iphone 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:28.479
 and it would be all good, I hope you have
