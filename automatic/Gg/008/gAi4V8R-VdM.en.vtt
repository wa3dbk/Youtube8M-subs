00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.000 
mocking it up to see you know how it
would<00:03:33.870> fit<00:03:34.050> in<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.530> got<00:03:34.620> two<00:03:34.800> nice

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
would fit in there it's got two nice

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.580 
would fit in there it's got two nice
mesh<00:03:35.250> pockets<00:03:35.820> they<00:03:36.600> would<00:03:36.780> probably<00:03:36.990> end<00:03:37.410> up

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
mesh pockets they would probably end up

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.130 
mesh pockets they would probably end up
just<00:03:37.830> having<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.490> me<00:03:38.670> anyway<00:03:39.240> would<00:03:39.540> probably

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
just having for me anyway would probably

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.720 
just having for me anyway would probably
be<00:03:40.290> like<00:03:40.470> wet<00:03:40.710> ones<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.570> then<00:03:43.220> those<00:03:44.220> packets

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
be like wet ones and then those packets

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.660 
be like wet ones and then those packets
of<00:03:44.820> like<00:03:45.030> maybe<00:03:45.360> Tylenol<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:47.310> know<00:03:47.430> just

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
of like maybe Tylenol you know just

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.540 
of like maybe Tylenol you know just
nothing<00:03:48.390> hand<00:03:49.140> sanitizer<00:03:49.740> for<00:03:50.160> work

nothing hand sanitizer for work

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.310 
nothing hand sanitizer for work
you<00:03:50.700> know<00:03:50.820> for<00:03:51.060> sometimes<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.840> do<00:03:51.900> end<00:03:52.200> up

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
you know for sometimes I do end up

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.710 
you know for sometimes I do end up
having<00:03:52.560> these<00:03:52.680> porta-johns<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.910> they<00:03:54.510> don't

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
having these porta-johns and they don't

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.840

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
always have the hand sanitizer in it and

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.300 
always have the hand sanitizer in it and
you<00:03:57.330> know<00:03:57.360> pushes<00:03:58.200> those<00:03:58.350> places<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.980> know<00:03:59.130> I

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
you know pushes those places you know I

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
nitpicky issues you know like the fit

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.710 
nitpicky issues you know like the fit
and<00:04:11.940> finish<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:14.450> middle<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.660> road

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
and finish of it is a middle of the road

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
spent a couple of more dollars and I

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.719 
spent a couple of more dollars and I
maybe<00:04:20.910> got<00:04:21.209> in<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.419> condor<00:04:21.870> bag<00:04:22.280> but<00:04:23.280> else<00:04:23.520> you

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729
