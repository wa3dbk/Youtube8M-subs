three-year lock anniversary I did not
have<00:00:37.060> time<00:00:37.330> to<00:00:37.390> put<00:00:37.960> anything<00:00:38.140> together

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.860

and show you my three-year-olds I just
interlocked<00:00:50.230> yesterday<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:50.739> have<00:00:51.040> not

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
interlocked yesterday I have not

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.640 
interlocked yesterday I have not
interlocked<00:00:51.700> since<00:00:52.000> December<00:00:52.510> 27<00:00:53.110> but<00:00:53.290> I<00:00:53.320> did

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
interlocked since December 27 but I did

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.270 
interlocked since December 27 but I did
interlock<00:00:54.160> yesterday<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.920> kind<00:00:57.190> of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
interlock yesterday I was kind of

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.920 
interlock yesterday I was kind of
struggling<00:00:57.670> with<00:00:57.970> whether<00:00:58.090> or<00:00:58.239> not<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.540> do<00:00:58.690> so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
struggling with whether or not to do so

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.970 
struggling with whether or not to do so
because<00:00:59.080> I<00:00:59.230> had<00:00:59.350> been<00:00:59.470> kind<00:00:59.680> of<00:00:59.770> free-formin

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
because I had been kind of free-formin

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.030 
because I had been kind of free-formin
for<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.489> while<00:01:00.730> semi-free<00:01:01.390> forming<00:01:01.780> but<00:01:02.589> I<00:01:02.830> went

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
for a while semi-free forming but I went

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.649 
for a while semi-free forming but I went
ahead<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.280> did<00:01:03.460> it<00:01:03.519> just<00:01:03.790> so<00:01:03.909> like<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.210> kind<00:01:04.480> of

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
ahead and did it just so like it kind of

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.560 
ahead and did it just so like it kind of
capture<00:01:05.440> where<00:01:06.340> my<00:01:06.550> locks<00:01:06.790> are<00:01:07.030> at<00:01:07.300> three

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
capture where my locks are at three

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.770 
capture where my locks are at three
years<00:01:07.870> as<00:01:08.110> far<00:01:08.320> as<00:01:08.610> growth<00:01:09.610> length<00:01:10.150> that<00:01:10.510> kind

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
years as far as growth length that kind

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.240 
years as far as growth length that kind
of<00:01:10.840> thing<00:01:11.050> and<00:01:11.229> with<00:01:11.380> my<00:01:11.590> new<00:01:11.770> growth<00:01:11.979> all

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
of thing and with my new growth all

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.830 
of thing and with my new growth all
interlocked<00:01:12.909> I<00:01:13.060> think<00:01:13.300> this<00:01:13.450> kind<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:13.690> gives

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
interlocked I think this kind of gives

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.649 
interlocked I think this kind of gives
you<00:01:13.930> more<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.470> true<00:01:15.280> length<00:01:15.520> indicator<00:01:16.210> for

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
you more of a true length indicator for

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.530 
you more of a true length indicator for
not<00:01:17.050> only<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.470> but<00:01:17.500> for<00:01:17.920> me<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:19.360> I'm

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
not only you but for me because I'm

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.860 
not only you but for me because I'm
considering<00:01:20.320> free<00:01:20.680> forming<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:22.330> your<00:01:22.540> four

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
considering free forming for your four

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.380 
considering free forming for your four
so<00:01:23.320> that's<00:01:23.590> why<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:24.220> went<00:01:24.729> ahead<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.150> did<00:01:25.330> this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
so that's why I went ahead and did this

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.990 
so that's why I went ahead and did this
interlocking<00:01:26.080> session<00:01:26.799> but<00:01:27.610> I'm<00:01:27.700> just<00:01:27.880> going

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
interlocking session but I'm just going

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.270 
interlocking session but I'm just going
to<00:01:28.030> briefly<00:01:28.210> show<00:01:28.690> you<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:29.380> came<00:01:29.650> outside<00:01:29.860> so

but yeah so let me show you this is my

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.440 
but yeah so let me show you this is my
interlock<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.670> root<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.060> did<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.270> really

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
interlock the root so I did a really

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.499 
interlock the root so I did a really
good<00:01:37.630> job<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:38.710> thing<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:39.009> can<00:01:39.280> say<00:01:39.539> not<00:01:40.539> having

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
done a whole lot to my roots in six

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.520 
done a whole lot to my roots in six
months<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.579> feel<00:01:46.299> like<00:01:46.450> my<00:01:46.689> hair<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.170> lot

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
months I feel like my hair is a lot

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.510 
months I feel like my hair is a lot
fuller<00:01:47.979> at<00:01:48.219> the<00:01:48.369> roots<00:01:48.579> I<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:50.259> really<00:01:50.649> made

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
fuller at the roots I really really made

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.330 
fuller at the roots I really really made
my<00:01:51.759> route<00:01:52.000> beds<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.390> lot<00:01:52.600> stronger<00:01:53.259> now<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:54.310> I

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
my route beds a lot stronger now that I

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.800 
my route beds a lot stronger now that I
had<00:01:54.520> any<00:01:54.700> weakness<00:01:55.149> but<00:01:55.299> I<00:01:55.359> could<00:01:55.509> just<00:01:55.659> feel

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
had any weakness but I could just feel

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.469 
had any weakness but I could just feel
it<00:01:55.869> there<00:01:56.109> much<00:01:56.380> firmer<00:01:56.740> now<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:58.060> even<00:01:58.210> when<00:01:58.450> I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
it there much firmer now and even when I

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.569 
it there much firmer now and even when I
interlock<00:01:59.079> usually<00:01:59.530> my<00:01:59.679> hair<00:01:59.890> looks<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.219> lot

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
interlock usually my hair looks a lot

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.599 
interlock usually my hair looks a lot
more<00:02:00.880> thinned<00:02:01.570> out<00:02:01.840> just<00:02:02.799> so<00:02:02.950> I'm<00:02:03.100> clear<00:02:03.130> when

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
more thinned out just so I'm clear when

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.940 
more thinned out just so I'm clear when
I<00:02:03.640> say<00:02:04.000> thin<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.780> mean<00:02:05.020> scallop<00:02:05.590> II<00:02:05.679> where<00:02:05.859> you

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
I say thin I mean scallop II where you

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.760 
I say thin I mean scallop II where you
can<00:02:06.130> really<00:02:06.399> see<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.240> parts<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.899> scalp

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
can really see the parts in the scalp

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.230 
can really see the parts in the scalp
not<00:02:09.460> any<00:02:09.640> other<00:02:09.820> way<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.260> me<00:02:11.260> but<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:13.120> looks
