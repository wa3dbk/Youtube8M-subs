new<00:01:44.220> main<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:45.420> there's<00:01:45.659> been<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> bunch<00:01:46.079> of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
new main I know there's been a bunch of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.600 
new main I know there's been a bunch of
three<00:01:46.380> by<00:01:46.530> threes<00:01:46.799> coming<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
three by threes coming out and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
three by threes coming out and
everything<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> three<00:01:49.229> by<00:01:49.380> threes<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
everything but all the three by threes I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.770 
everything but all the three by threes I
have<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.189> quite<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> few<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.149> find<00:01:51.360> myself

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
have which is quite a few I find myself

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840 
have which is quite a few I find myself
playing<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> most<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.340> really

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
playing with this one the most I really

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.460 
playing with this one the most I really
like<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> turnstile<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.899> kind<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
like the turnstile it's kind of like the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
like the turnstile it's kind of like the
mix<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.920> whining<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.610> way<00:01:56.729> long<00:01:56.939> it's

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
mix of a whining and a way long it's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480 
mix of a whining and a way long it's
really<00:01:58.170> smooth<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> way<00:01:58.829> along<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.340> not

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
really smooth like the way along but not

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.819 
really smooth like the way along but not
nearly<00:01:59.790> as<00:01:59.909> fast<00:02:00.299> I'm<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> very<00:02:01.500> fast

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
nearly as fast I'm not a very fast

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.030 
nearly as fast I'm not a very fast
solver<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:03.060> around<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.659> 20<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.170> 25<00:02:04.590> seconds

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
solver I'm around like 20 to 25 seconds

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.340 
solver I'm around like 20 to 25 seconds
so<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.969> way<00:02:06.119> long<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> little<00:02:06.719> bit<00:02:06.930> too<00:02:07.049> fast

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
so the way long is a little bit too fast

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.499 
so the way long is a little bit too fast
for<00:02:07.560> me<00:02:07.680> actually<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.000> want<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.479> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
for me actually if I want to use that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.200 
for me actually if I want to use that
cube<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> solve<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.590> have

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
cube to solve I have

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.720 
cube to solve I have
to<00:02:11.300> actually<00:02:11.650> put<00:02:12.650> more<00:02:12.890> Lube<00:02:13.070> in<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.340> gum<00:02:13.610> it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
to actually put more Lube in it gum it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.340 
to actually put more Lube in it gum it
up<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.330> not<00:02:14.480> as<00:02:14.630> fast<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.230> it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
up so that it's not as fast because it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.560 
up so that it's not as fast because it
causes<00:02:15.530> me<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.920> overshoot<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.700> messes<00:02:17.420> up<00:02:17.540> my

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
causes me to overshoot and messes up my

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.720 
causes me to overshoot and messes up my
look<00:02:17.780> ahead<00:02:18.050> this<00:02:18.860> cube<00:02:19.190> was<00:02:19.280> really<00:02:19.460> nice<00:02:19.580> to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
look ahead this cube was really nice to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.810 
look ahead this cube was really nice to
turning<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.300> really<00:02:20.900> really<00:02:21.050> smooth

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.430 

algorithm<00:02:25.820> just<00:02:26.030> seemed<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.330> flow<00:02:26.570> I'm<00:02:27.110> out<00:02:27.350> of

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
algorithm just seemed to flow I'm out of

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.960 
algorithm just seemed to flow I'm out of
the<00:02:27.530> box<00:02:27.740> was<00:02:27.950> actually<00:02:28.220> pretty<00:02:28.340> good<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.730> did

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the box was actually pretty good I did

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.760 
the box was actually pretty good I did
lose<00:02:29.180> before<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.350> don't<00:02:30.500> think<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.740> even

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
lose before and I don't think I even

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.470 
lose before and I don't think I even
live<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.220> pieces<00:02:31.580> cuz<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.820> just<00:02:32.030> didn't<00:02:32.210> eat<00:02:32.330> it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
live the pieces cuz I just didn't eat it

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.740 
live the pieces cuz I just didn't eat it
and<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:33.740> smooth<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.640> took<00:02:35.480> out<00:02:35.570> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and it's just so smooth and took out the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.890 
and it's just so smooth and took out the
pieces<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.850> an<00:02:38.120> edge<00:02:38.240> piece<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
pieces so this is an edge piece in the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.690 
pieces so this is an edge piece in the
cube<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.620> know<00:02:39.830> based<00:02:40.070> on<00:02:40.250> what<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.490> cube

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
cube you know based on what the cube

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.800 
cube you know based on what the cube
looks<00:02:40.850> like<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.210> just<00:02:41.240> looks<00:02:41.480> like<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.660> really

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
looks like it just looks like a really

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.310 
looks like it just looks like a really
blocky<00:02:42.230> kind<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.800> ugly<00:02:43.370> cube<00:02:43.940> but<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.720> don't

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
blocky kind of ugly cube but I don't

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.570 
blocky kind of ugly cube but I don't
think<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.710> really<00:02:45.740> has<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.070> much<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.490> a

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
think it really has that much of a

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.880 
think it really has that much of a
blocky<00:02:47.000> feel<00:02:47.210> now<00:02:47.870> everybody's<00:02:48.380> partners<00:02:48.800> are

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
blocky feel now everybody's partners are

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.740 
blocky feel now everybody's partners are
different<00:02:49.220> but<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.730> really<00:02:50.390> really<00:02:50.480> like<00:02:50.720> this

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
different but I really really like this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.660 
different but I really really like this
cave<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:51.260> see<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.590> corner<00:02:51.830> pieces<00:02:52.070> so

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
cave you can see the corner pieces so

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.740 
cave you can see the corner pieces so
these<00:02:52.790> are<00:02:52.850> kind<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.240> similar<00:02:53.510> things

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
these are kind of the similar things

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.540 
these are kind of the similar things
that<00:02:53.930> have<00:02:54.020> been<00:02:54.050> saying<00:02:54.440> as<00:02:54.860> far<00:02:55.100> as<00:02:55.250> other

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
that have been saying as far as other

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.920 
that have been saying as far as other
companies<00:02:55.970> using<00:02:56.120> something<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:56.900> a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
companies using something of it like a

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.710 
companies using something of it like a
torpedo<00:02:57.230> here<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.790> whining<00:02:59.210> has<00:02:59.510> that

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
torpedo here and the whining has that

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.930 
torpedo here and the whining has that
big<00:02:59.990> giant<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.740> like<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.610> does<00:03:01.760> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
big giant and like that and so does the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.340 
big giant and like that and so does the
way<00:03:02.030> long<00:03:02.240> here's<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.290> corner<00:03:05.140> one<00:03:06.140> thing<00:03:06.290> i

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
way long here's a corner one thing i

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.880 
way long here's a corner one thing i
have<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.500> admit<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.980> um<00:03:07.340> my<00:03:08.150> friend<00:03:08.560> had<00:03:09.560> asked

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
have to admit is um my friend had asked

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.830 
have to admit is um my friend had asked
me<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.220> know<00:03:10.250> did<00:03:10.550> I<00:03:10.610> find<00:03:10.820> any<00:03:11.030> modifications

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
me you know did I find any modifications

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.050 
me you know did I find any modifications
for<00:03:12.020> this<00:03:12.170> cube<00:03:12.470> yet<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:13.280> told<00:03:13.340> him<00:03:13.670> you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
for this cube yet and I told him you

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.760 
for this cube yet and I told him you
know<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.210> didn't<00:03:14.630> think<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.020> needed<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.500> but<00:03:15.650> as

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
know I didn't think it needed it but as

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.020 
know I didn't think it needed it but as
I'm<00:03:15.920> looking<00:03:16.220> sit<00:03:16.580> down<00:03:16.700> looking<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
I'm looking sit down looking at the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.080 
I'm looking sit down looking at the
pieces<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:18.140> real<00:03:19.100> in-depth<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.640> talking<00:03:20.030> to

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
pieces a real in-depth and talking to

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.940 
pieces a real in-depth and talking to
you<00:03:20.180> guys<00:03:20.330> about<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.810> oh<00:03:20.930> there's<00:03:21.770> almost

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
you guys about it oh there's almost

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.530 
you guys about it oh there's almost
nothing<00:03:22.310> sharp<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.090> cube<00:03:23.360> like

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
nothing sharp on this cube like

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.900 
nothing sharp on this cube like
everything<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.170> just<00:03:24.320> rounded<00:03:24.890> like<00:03:25.400> here<00:03:25.880> you

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
everything is just rounded like here you

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.880 
everything is just rounded like here you
can<00:03:26.150> see<00:03:26.270> on<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.480> corner<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.620> all

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
can see on the corner that is all

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.880 
can see on the corner that is all
rounded<00:03:28.730> there's<00:03:29.030> nothing<00:03:29.600> sharp<00:03:30.050> I<00:03:30.290> mean

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
rounded there's nothing sharp I mean

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.160 
rounded there's nothing sharp I mean
there<00:03:31.250> might<00:03:31.460> be<00:03:31.520> a<00:03:31.670> little<00:03:32.150> something<00:03:32.660> but

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
there might be a little something but

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.810 
there might be a little something but
not<00:03:33.290> enough<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.560> mod<00:03:33.830> even<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.340> this<00:03:34.550> part

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
not enough to mod even on this part

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.460 
not enough to mod even on this part
right<00:03:34.880> here<00:03:35.030> even<00:03:35.900> this<00:03:36.020> part<00:03:36.320> is<00:03:36.440> really

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
right here even this part is really

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.740 
right here even this part is really
really<00:03:37.160> smooth<00:03:37.460> so<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.090> think<00:03:38.240> that's<00:03:38.510> one

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
really smooth so I think that's one

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.840 
really smooth so I think that's one
thing<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:38.990> I'm<00:03:39.440> usually<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:39.860> 3<00:03:40.100> by<00:03:40.220> 3<00:03:40.250> we<00:03:40.640> see

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
thing that I'm usually on 3 by 3 we see

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.120 
thing that I'm usually on 3 by 3 we see
some<00:03:41.570> kind<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.840> sharp<00:03:42.110> point<00:03:42.410> or<00:03:42.650> something

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
some kind of sharp point or something

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.910 
some kind of sharp point or something
but<00:03:44.030> on<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.270> cube<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:45.260> really<00:03:45.590> don't<00:03:45.770> sit<00:03:45.860> on

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
but on this cube you really don't sit on

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.500 
but on this cube you really don't sit on
the<00:03:46.010> piece<00:03:46.160> another<00:03:46.340> audience<00:03:46.670> sharp<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.300> cut

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
the piece another audience sharp is cut

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.120 
the piece another audience sharp is cut
right<00:03:47.750> here<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:48.110> don't<00:03:48.680> know<00:03:48.740> if<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:48.890> good<00:03:49.070> to

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
right here I don't know if you good to

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.950 
right here I don't know if you good to
see<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.280> or<00:03:49.490> not<00:03:49.550> but<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.420> can<00:03:50.570> see<00:03:50.810> like

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
see that or not but you can see like

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.240 
see that or not but you can see like
where<00:03:51.080> this<00:03:51.230> comes<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.710> a<00:03:51.740> point<00:03:51.800> right<00:03:52.220> here

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
where this comes to a point right here

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.520 
where this comes to a point right here
that<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.270> kind<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.570> sharp<00:03:53.840> but<00:03:54.020> honestly<00:03:54.410> I

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
that is kind of sharp but honestly I

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.500 
that is kind of sharp but honestly I
don't<00:03:54.740> think<00:03:54.920> it's<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.310> bad<00:03:55.610> where<00:03:56.330> you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
don't think it's that bad where you

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.120 
don't think it's that bad where you
would<00:03:56.660> need<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.930> actually<00:03:57.110> mind<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.800> can<00:03:57.920> kind

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
would need to actually mind you can kind

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.660 
would need to actually mind you can kind
of<00:03:58.190> see<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.580> they're<00:03:59.410> also<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.650> core<00:04:01.100> is<00:04:01.310> the

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
of see that they're also the core is the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.240 
of see that they're also the core is the
blue<00:04:01.910> core<00:04:02.240> which<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.690> nice<00:04:02.930> I'm<00:04:03.920> used<00:04:04.130> to

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
blue core which is nice I'm used to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.340 
blue core which is nice I'm used to
seeing<00:04:04.460> you<00:04:04.670> know<00:04:04.790> done<00:04:05.060> Q<00:04:05.510> cores<00:04:05.840> or<00:04:06.080> white

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
seeing you know done Q cores or white

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.740 
seeing you know done Q cores or white
clear<00:04:06.650> course<00:04:06.950> but<00:04:07.520> this<00:04:07.610> core<00:04:07.880> is<00:04:08.000> blue<00:04:08.300> it

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
clear course but this core is blue it

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.600 
clear course but this core is blue it
looks<00:04:09.110> really<00:04:09.560> nice<00:04:09.710> and<00:04:09.770> their<00:04:10.130> stock<00:04:10.430> you

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
looks really nice and their stock you

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.630 
looks really nice and their stock you
see<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:10.880> anyway<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:12.590> cube<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.070> easy<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.490> lube

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
see it anyway this cube is easy to lube

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.310 
see it anyway this cube is easy to lube
and<00:04:13.880> pretty<00:04:14.480> easy<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.900> put<00:04:15.020> back<00:04:15.050> together

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
and pretty easy to put back together

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.430 
and pretty easy to put back together
that's<00:04:16.130> another<00:04:16.400> plus<00:04:17.060> down<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.390> this<00:04:17.510> on<00:04:17.720> the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
that's another plus down on this on the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.470 
that's another plus down on this on the
centerpieces<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.250> center<00:04:19.730> cap<00:04:19.910> stand<00:04:20.239> it's

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
centerpieces the center cap stand it's

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.430 
centerpieces the center cap stand it's
not<00:04:20.600> something<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:20.900> have<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.109> worry<00:04:21.200> about

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
not something you have to worry about

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.560 
not something you have to worry about
the<00:04:22.040> center<00:04:22.340> cap<00:04:22.580> actually<00:04:23.120> this<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.480> pretty

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
the center cap actually this is pretty

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.910 
the center cap actually this is pretty
like

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
like

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.890 
like
tall<00:04:25.220> I<00:04:25.550> guess<00:04:25.730> is<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:25.910> good<00:04:26.000> way<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.270> put<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.600> but

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
tall I guess is a good way to put it but

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.410 
tall I guess is a good way to put it but
this<00:04:27.830> is<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:28.040> pretty<00:04:28.340> actually<00:04:28.850> kind<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.150> snaps

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
this is a pretty actually kind of snaps

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.720 
this is a pretty actually kind of snaps
down<00:04:29.660> pretty<00:04:30.020> deep<00:04:30.110> in<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.650> center<00:04:30.950> cap<00:04:31.130> so

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
down pretty deep in the center cap so

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.490 
down pretty deep in the center cap so
you<00:04:31.820> can<00:04:31.940> see<00:04:32.060> any<00:04:32.210> center<00:04:32.540> cap<00:04:32.720> here<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.080> it

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
you can see any center cap here and it

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.110 
you can see any center cap here and it
snaps<00:04:33.740> in<00:04:33.950> really<00:04:34.220> firm<00:04:34.490> which<00:04:34.700> is<00:04:34.880> good

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
snaps in really firm which is good

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.330 
snaps in really firm which is good
because<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.540> hate<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.530> my<00:04:36.650> center<00:04:36.920> caps<00:04:37.130> fall

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
because I hate on my center caps fall

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.070 
because I hate on my center caps fall
off<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.640> I<00:04:37.730> I<00:04:37.970> have<00:04:38.210> like<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.690> little<00:04:38.840> bit<00:04:38.990> of

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
off and I I have like a little bit of

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.520 
off and I I have like a little bit of
longer<00:04:39.470> nails<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.040> I<00:04:40.370> tend<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.730> pop<00:04:40.970> out<00:04:41.530> my

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
longer nails and I tend to pop out my

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.500 
longer nails and I tend to pop out my
Center<00:04:42.860> cast<00:04:43.070> when<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.340> solve<00:04:43.580> I'm<00:04:44.240> doing

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
Center cast when I solve I'm doing

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.940 
Center cast when I solve I'm doing
certain<00:04:44.660> algorithms<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:45.320> don't<00:04:45.620> really<00:04:45.740> know

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
certain algorithms I don't really know

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.990 
certain algorithms I don't really know
why<00:04:46.220> but<00:04:46.640> it<00:04:46.730> just<00:04:46.760> seems<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.270> happen<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.660> way

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
why but it just seems to happen that way

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.230 
why but it just seems to happen that way
go<00:04:50.000> ahead<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.240> put<00:04:50.360> this<00:04:50.510> back<00:04:50.780> together<00:04:52.240> as

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
go ahead and put this back together as

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.320 
go ahead and put this back together as
you<00:04:53.360> can<00:04:53.510> see<00:04:53.660> this<00:04:53.840> cube<00:04:54.110> cuts<00:04:54.460> 45<00:04:55.460> no<00:04:55.880> problem

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
you can see this cube cuts 45 no problem

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.260 
you can see this cube cuts 45 no problem
very<00:04:57.290> easy<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.860> visit<00:04:58.280> my<00:04:58.370> attentions<00:04:58.820> my

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
very easy to visit my attentions my

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.490 
very easy to visit my attentions my
attentions<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.780> guess<00:04:59.960> might<00:05:00.200> be<00:05:00.320> a<00:05:00.350> little

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
attentions I guess might be a little

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.610 
attentions I guess might be a little
loose<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:01.300> would<00:05:02.300> say<00:05:02.480> that<00:05:02.510> this<00:05:02.750> cube<00:05:03.080> you

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
loose I would say that this cube you

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.530 
loose I would say that this cube you
need<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:03.860> have<00:05:03.950> attention<00:05:04.130> like<00:05:04.820> just<00:05:05.300> right

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
need to have attention like just right

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.990 
need to have attention like just right
so<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.650> feels<00:05:07.100> like<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.490> turning<00:05:07.700> is

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
so that it it feels like the turning is

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.420 
so that it it feels like the turning is
even<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.450> all<00:05:08.660> sides<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.590> emphasis<00:05:10.160> are<00:05:10.280> also

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
even on all sides the emphasis are also

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.230 
even on all sides the emphasis are also
very<00:05:10.790> very<00:05:11.060> smooth<00:05:15.580> well<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:16.610> just<00:05:16.670> completely

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
very very smooth well I just completely

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.290 
very very smooth well I just completely
badger<00:05:17.540> that<00:05:20.770> this<00:05:21.770> is<00:05:21.920> just<00:05:22.730> really<00:05:22.880> smooth

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
badger that this is just really smooth

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.410 
badger that this is just really smooth
turning<00:05:23.780> it<00:05:24.200> kind<00:05:24.380> of<00:05:24.470> just<00:05:24.620> flows<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:25.420> think

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
turning it kind of just flows I think

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.640 
turning it kind of just flows I think
that<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:26.690> don't<00:05:26.900> know<00:05:27.050> if<00:05:27.140> this<00:05:27.200> will<00:05:27.320> be<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.470> lot

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
that I don't know if this will be a lot

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.530 
that I don't know if this will be a lot
of<00:05:27.680> people's<00:05:27.980> main<00:05:28.190> cube<00:05:28.580> but<00:05:29.060> I<00:05:29.090> think<00:05:29.420> that

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
of people's main cube but I think that

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.780 
of people's main cube but I think that
it<00:05:29.930> would<00:05:30.050> be<00:05:30.290> a<00:05:30.530> good<00:05:30.800> practice<00:05:31.370> queue<00:05:31.580> for

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
it would be a good practice queue for

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.310 
it would be a good practice queue for
sure<00:05:31.940> for<00:05:32.330> six<00:05:32.540> bucks<00:05:32.600> you<00:05:32.900> can't<00:05:33.110> beat<00:05:33.290> it

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
sure for six bucks you can't beat it

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.230 
sure for six bucks you can't beat it
absolutely<00:05:34.280> love<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:34.430> I<00:05:34.580> just<00:05:34.760> like<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:34.970> ton

absolutely love it I just like a ton

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.300 
absolutely love it I just like a ton
style<00:05:35.570> it's<00:05:35.750> like<00:05:35.900> snappy<00:05:36.380> but<00:05:36.830> it's<00:05:36.980> really

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
style it's like snappy but it's really

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.490

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
this cube let me just scramble it up

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.440 
this cube let me just scramble it up
here<00:05:41.600> so<00:05:42.230> you<00:05:42.320> guys<00:05:42.470> can<00:05:42.620> see<00:05:42.680> that's<00:05:43.430> 45<00:05:44.000> it's

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
here so you guys can see that's 45 it's

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.590 
here so you guys can see that's 45 it's
cheap<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.740> turns<00:05:46.040> smooth<00:05:46.400> a<00:05:46.820> little<00:05:47.330> bit<00:05:47.420> of<00:05:47.510> a

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
cheap it turns smooth a little bit of a

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.410 
cheap it turns smooth a little bit of a
snappiness<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.440> it<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:48.830> it<00:05:49.820> doesn't<00:05:50.210> i<00:05:50.270> have

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
snappiness to it and it doesn't i have

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.330 
snappiness to it and it doesn't i have
had<00:05:50.600> it<00:05:50.720> pop<00:05:50.900> either<00:05:51.140> and<00:05:51.470> center<00:05:51.830> caps<00:05:52.070> down

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
had it pop either and center caps down

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.370 
had it pop either and center caps down
so<00:05:52.970> i<00:05:53.000> really<00:05:53.390> don't<00:05:53.480> have<00:05:53.780> to<00:05:54.020> anything

so i really don't have to anything

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.780 
so i really don't have to anything
negative<00:05:54.680> only<00:05:55.010> negative<00:05:55.340> thing<00:05:55.370> i<00:05:55.520> think<00:05:55.580> i
