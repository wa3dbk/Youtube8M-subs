00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
since I'm mostly going to be doing it

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.599 
since I'm mostly going to be doing it
and<00:02:23.780> creative<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.859> don't<00:02:25.549> really<00:02:25.730> mean<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.140> so

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
and creative I don't really mean that so

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.009 
and creative I don't really mean that so
yeah<00:02:28.609> it<00:02:28.819> just<00:02:28.850> has<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> hop<00:02:29.510> o'clock<00:02:29.840> right

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
yeah it just has a hop o'clock right

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.690 
yeah it just has a hop o'clock right
here<00:02:30.260> which<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.829> triggering<00:02:31.130> this<00:02:31.400> which

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
here which is triggering this which

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.229 
here which is triggering this which
keeps<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.890> seeing<00:02:33.890> if<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.940> anybody<00:02:35.680> with

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
keeps on seeing if there is anybody with

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.830 
keeps on seeing if there is anybody with
regeneration<00:02:38.239> which<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.590> ok<00:02:40.430> um<00:02:40.840> so

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
regeneration which is that ok um so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.750 
regeneration which is that ok um so
pretty<00:02:42.200> much<00:02:42.260> what<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.500> will<00:02:42.709> do<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.220> will

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
pretty much what it will do is it will

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.059 
pretty much what it will do is it will
take<00:02:44.180> away<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.569> regeneration<00:02:45.290> if<00:02:45.560> anyone<00:02:45.889> has

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
take away the regeneration if anyone has

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.120 
take away the regeneration if anyone has
it<00:02:46.280> so<00:02:46.940> if<00:02:49.030> everyone<00:02:50.030> has<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.620> will<00:02:51.859> trigger

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
it so if everyone has it it will trigger

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.020 
it so if everyone has it it will trigger
this<00:02:53.139> which<00:02:54.139> will<00:02:54.319> trigger<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.880> which<00:02:55.880> is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
this which will trigger this which is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.539 
this which will trigger this which is
the<00:02:56.180> main<00:02:56.359> thing<00:02:56.389> but<00:02:57.290> let's<00:02:57.950> just<00:02:58.190> go<00:02:58.340> back<00:02:58.370> a

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
the main thing but let's just go back a

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.050 
the main thing but let's just go back a
little<00:02:58.790> bit

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
little bit

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.050 
little bit
and<00:03:00.470> so<00:03:01.470> when<00:03:01.590> does<00:03:01.860> have<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.760> clears

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
and so when does have it it just clears

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.839 
and so when does have it it just clears
this<00:03:03.390> once<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.170> then<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.890> makes<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.760> you

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
this once and then it makes it so you

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.260 
this once and then it makes it so you
don't<00:03:05.970> have<00:03:06.270> regeneration<00:03:06.870> anymore<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.280> this

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
don't have regeneration anymore and this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.140 
don't have regeneration anymore and this
is<00:03:09.569> off<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:13.069> okay<00:03:14.069> sorry<00:03:14.340> about<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.640> all
