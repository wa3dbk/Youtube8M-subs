00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
myself to you so how important is a

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.870 
myself to you so how important is a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
community for natural you know I think

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.270 
community for natural you know I think
it<00:02:42.180> depends<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.050> natural<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.830> know<00:02:43.860> some

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
it depends on the natural you know some

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.730 
it depends on the natural you know some
women<00:02:44.850> are<00:02:45.030> natural<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.810> they're<00:02:46.080> fine<00:02:46.350> like

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
women are natural and they're fine like

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.560 
women are natural and they're fine like
they<00:02:46.950> don't<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.520> need<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.790> support<00:02:48.360> system

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
they don't really need a support system

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.110 
they don't really need a support system
but<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.320> think<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.590> lot<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.800> women<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.580> scary

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
but I think a lot of women it is scary

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.330 
but I think a lot of women it is scary
for<00:02:51.240> them<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.320> new<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.800> it's<00:02:52.920> exciting

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
for them it's a new and it's exciting

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.900 
for them it's a new and it's exciting
but<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:53.940> also<00:02:54.150> intimidating<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.590> they<00:02:55.740> do

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
but it's also intimidating so they do

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.280 
but it's also intimidating so they do
rely<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.209> community<00:02:57.630> but<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.840> also<00:02:57.990> meet
