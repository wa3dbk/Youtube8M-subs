00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.259
 one is with adrian today that the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.370
 guys bryant to Lille it's going very well 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.170
 thank you 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.880
 so how a little where do you come from 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 what do you do in life how old are you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.100
 all that so I'm 21 years old 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.449
 paris I am a student in master 2 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.560
 of art and visual culture of the countries 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.270
 anglophones so these two formations in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.100
 English but it scares the miss 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.150
 yeah it's long but it's actually 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.439
 really well its angles to history 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.060
 of art story of the photo and the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.320
 art market all this but focused on 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.929
 English-speaking countries, not American 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.910
 bath and so face a master 2 and access 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.880
 is a photographer and so the idea is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.680
 to do that full time okay after 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.149
 the bet and you want to be a photographer 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.829
 after all, it's already what I do 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.879
 but good their time since I have them 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.879
 from the coast and I do not either 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.289
 time to savor it is pretty 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.510

 prevent them from sending them to the heat wave 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.229

 a lot hesitated before buying them 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.790
 because already the farts have to assume them 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.810
 what final me it was worth almost all and 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.860
 because I was afraid it would make 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.239
 big feet the docks but that makes 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.010
