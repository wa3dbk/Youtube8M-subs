00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
GoBot which is still tall and I'll go to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.350 
GoBot which is still tall and I'll go to
my<00:02:20.110> go<00:02:20.380> bot<00:02:20.590> collection<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.550> by<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.090> way<00:02:22.330> I

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
my go bot collection and by the way I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.890 
my go bot collection and by the way I
will<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.780> showing<00:02:24.480> my<00:02:25.480> collection<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:26.170> here

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
will be showing my collection on here

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.120 
will be showing my collection on here
soon<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.290> guess<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.830> pieces<00:02:31.500> if<00:02:32.500> anyone<00:02:32.860> cares

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
soon I guess in pieces if anyone cares

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.700 
soon I guess in pieces if anyone cares
there's<00:02:33.460> already<00:02:33.700> about<00:02:34.180> 3,000<00:02:35.110> people<00:02:35.290> with

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
there's already about 3,000 people with

their toys but can't get enough of
looking<00:02:38.620> at<00:02:38.710> toys<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:41.110> last<00:02:41.140> well<00:02:42.040> one

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
looking at toys so and the last well one

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.410 
looking at toys so and the last well one
the<00:02:42.760> last<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.540> old<00:02:43.990> Marx<00:02:45.240> looks<00:02:46.240> like<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
the last this is a old Marx looks like a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.840 
the last this is a old Marx looks like a
had<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.110> zip<00:02:47.950> cord<00:02:48.280> or<00:02:48.430> something<00:02:48.820> in<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:50.850> but

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
had a zip cord or something in it but

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.890 
had a zip cord or something in it but
this<00:02:52.090> was<00:02:52.330> five<00:02:52.870> dollars<00:02:54.270> which<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.450> figured<00:02:55.780> it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
this was five dollars which I figured it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.400 
this was five dollars which I figured it
was<00:02:55.959> worth<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.820> if<00:02:57.820> anyone<00:02:58.239> knows<00:02:58.450> any<00:02:59.020> time

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
was worth that if anyone knows any time

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.990 
was worth that if anyone knows any time
period<00:02:59.890> for<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:00.280> would<00:03:00.489> be<00:03:00.610> great<00:03:00.760> it's

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
period for this would be great it's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.240 
period for this would be great it's
missing<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.680> steering<00:03:02.680> wheel<00:03:02.860> than<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
missing the steering wheel than the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.670 
missing the steering wheel than the
little<00:03:03.520> window<00:03:03.910> thing<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:05.290> goes<00:03:05.470> across

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
little window thing that goes across

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.140
