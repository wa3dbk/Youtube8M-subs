through over

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.960 
through over
beasts<00:02:49.910> see<00:02:50.810> if<00:02:50.870> there's<00:02:51.080> any<00:02:51.400> any<00:02:52.400> unique

that's<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.170> good<00:02:57.440> idea<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:58.190> I've<00:02:58.310> kind<00:02:58.580> of

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
that's a good idea so I've kind of

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.120 
that's a good idea so I've kind of
gotten<00:02:58.790> bitten<00:02:59.120> by<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.450> rare<00:02:59.960> hunting<00:03:00.440> bug<00:03:00.710> so

for<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.390> special<00:03:09.230> golden<00:03:09.770> worm<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.550> it<00:03:11.420> comes

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
for a special golden worm and it comes

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.320 
for a special golden worm and it comes
in<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.840> form<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:12.260> ooze<00:03:12.920> worm<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.580> grub<00:03:14.030> Thor

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
in the form of ooze worm and grub Thor

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.590 
in the form of ooze worm and grub Thor
are<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.780> only<00:03:14.930> two<00:03:15.290> tamable<00:03:15.940> worms<00:03:16.940> which

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
are the only two tamable worms which

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.290 
are the only two tamable worms which
have<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.080> golden<00:03:18.470> color<00:03:18.770> so<00:03:19.550> it's<00:03:20.120> going<00:03:20.240> to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
have the golden color so it's going to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.140 
have the golden color so it's going to
take<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.600> through<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.990> and<00:03:21.820> hopefully<00:03:22.820> you

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
take you through that and hopefully you

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.110 
take you through that and hopefully you
can<00:03:23.240> get<00:03:23.360> one<00:03:23.540> too<00:03:24.010> okay<00:03:25.010> first<00:03:25.340> stop<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.880> just

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
can get one too okay first stop is just

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.360 
can get one too okay first stop is just
