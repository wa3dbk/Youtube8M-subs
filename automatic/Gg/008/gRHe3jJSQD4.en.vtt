do<00:04:58.410> morally<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:58.920> guess<00:05:01.040> he's<00:05:02.040> not<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:02.370> wasn't<00:05:02.520> a

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
do morally I guess he's not it wasn't a

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.420 
do morally I guess he's not it wasn't a
terribly<00:05:03.090> athletic<00:05:03.270> guy<00:05:03.830> what<00:05:04.830> was<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.160> he

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
terribly athletic guy what was it he

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.250 
terribly athletic guy what was it he
wasn't<00:05:05.670> specifically<00:05:06.360> good<00:05:06.720> at<00:05:06.870> rest<00:05:07.080> but<00:05:07.140> if

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.530 
wasn't specifically good at rest but if
you're<00:05:07.410> if<00:05:07.650> you're<00:05:07.680> 6<00:05:08.280> 5<00:05:08.580> in<00:05:08.850> kindergarten
