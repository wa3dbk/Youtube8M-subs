00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
in this tutorial we will take a look at

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.369 
in this tutorial we will take a look at
one<00:00:04.799> way<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> run<00:00:05.549> some<00:00:06.150> windows<00:00:06.600> applications

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
one way to run some windows applications

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.430 
one way to run some windows applications
in<00:00:07.620> Linux<00:00:08.240> using<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.420> piece<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:09.960> software

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
in Linux using a piece of software

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.370 
in Linux using a piece of software
called<00:00:10.559> wine<00:00:11.130> now<00:00:11.790> wine<00:00:12.179> some<00:00:12.809> people<00:00:13.139> call

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
called wine now wine some people call

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.019 
called wine now wine some people call
wine<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:14.040> windows<00:00:14.670> emulator<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.870> wine<00:00:16.260> is

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
wine a windows emulator but wine is

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.450 
wine a windows emulator but wine is
actually<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.560> recursive<00:00:19.560> acronym<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.250> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
actually a recursive acronym and it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.750 
actually a recursive acronym and it
stands<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.029> wine<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.720> not<00:00:22.289> an<00:00:22.590> emulator<00:00:23.310> wine

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
stands for wine is not an emulator wine

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.080 
stands for wine is not an emulator wine
is<00:00:24.060> actually<00:00:24.720> an<00:00:24.900> open<00:00:25.500> source<00:00:26.090> reverse

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
is actually an open source reverse

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
engineering of the windows API it's

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.040 
engineering of the windows API it's
basically<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.170> native<00:00:32.009> way<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.210> run<00:00:33.510> Windows

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050

applications<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.980> Linux<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.270> has

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
applications in Linux it actually has

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.799 
applications in Linux it actually has
created<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.440> hundred<00:00:37.770> percent<00:00:38.100> free

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
applications to run in Linux now it's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.090 
applications to run in Linux now it's
not<00:00:44.879> perfect<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.020> does<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.320> run<00:00:46.620> most

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
not perfect it does not run most

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.389 
not perfect it does not run most
software<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:48.300> does<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.660> run<00:00:48.960> most<00:00:49.440> games<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
software it does not run most games but

software it does not run most games but
it<00:00:50.670> does<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.300> things<00:00:51.809> very<00:00:52.199> well<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.710> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it does do some things very well and it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.189

the wine project provides a piece of

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.190 
the wine project provides a piece of
software<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> needs<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.420> installed<00:01:36.689> and

it's<00:01:37.619> easily<00:01:37.920> found<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.729> simply

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it's easily found here one can simply

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.880 
it's easily found here one can simply
type<00:01:39.450> wine<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.200> fact<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> search<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
type wine in fact and do a search and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.050 
type wine in fact and do a search and
the<00:01:43.890> very<00:01:44.070> first<00:01:44.250> thing<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> comes<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.880> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
the very first thing that comes up is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.760 
the very first thing that comes up is
the<00:01:45.240> wine<00:01:45.450> windows<00:01:45.930> emulator<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the wine windows emulator and it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.950 
the wine windows emulator and it
explains<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.640> little<00:01:47.820> bit<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:48.630> wine<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
explains a little bit about what wine is

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.469 
explains a little bit about what wine is
down<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.700> first<00:01:50.909> thing<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.299> do

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
down here so the first thing to do

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.260 
down here so the first thing to do
before<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.619> use<00:01:52.860> wine<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.759> select

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
before one can use wine is to select

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.440 
before one can use wine is to select
wine<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.380> check<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.890> box<00:01:56.130> click<00:01:56.700> apply<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
wine just check this box click apply and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.780 
wine just check this box click apply and
go<00:01:57.750> through<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> installation<00:01:58.409> process<00:01:58.790> once

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
go through the installation process once

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.179 
go through the installation process once
wine<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.479> installed<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.439> next<00:02:01.770> thing<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
wine is installed the next thing that

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.709 
wine is installed the next thing that
one<00:02:02.490> should<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.939> take<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> look<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.570> this

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
one should do is take a look at this

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.440 
one should do is take a look at this
documentation<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.799> using<00:02:05.280> wine<00:02:05.520> basically

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
documentation on using wine basically

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.040 
documentation on using wine basically
the<00:02:06.780> short<00:02:07.290> explanation<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:09.330> uses<00:02:09.780> wine

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the short explanation is one uses wine

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.990 
the short explanation is one uses wine
in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> command<00:02:10.890> line<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.400> idea<00:02:11.700> is

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
in the command line the idea is

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.480

program name whatever it is dot exe and

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.350 
program name whatever it is dot exe and
simply<00:03:15.060> hitting<00:03:15.330> return<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:17.040> wine

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
simply hitting return and that the wine

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.759 
simply hitting return and that the wine
application<00:03:18.360> will<00:03:18.630> then<00:03:18.840> pick<00:03:19.200> up<00:03:19.260> at<00:03:19.620> that

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
application will then pick up at that

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.910 
application will then pick up at that
point<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.910> will<00:03:21.150> run<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.840> exe<00:03:22.410> file<00:03:22.650> now

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
point and it will run the exe file now

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.330 
point and it will run the exe file now
obviously<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.610> exe<00:03:24.030> file<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> setup<00:03:25.340> EXE

obviously if the exe file is a setup EXE

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.120 
obviously if the exe file is a setup EXE
that's<00:03:27.239> fine<00:03:27.480> wine<00:03:27.930> can<00:03:28.290> run<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.769> setup.exe

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
that's fine wine can run the setup.exe

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.310 
that's fine wine can run the setup.exe
and<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.120> will<00:03:30.269> go<00:03:30.450> through<00:03:30.780> its<00:03:30.959> installation

and it will go through its installation

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.190 
and it will go through its installation
and<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.040> will<00:03:32.130> attempt<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.730> install<00:03:33.200> now
