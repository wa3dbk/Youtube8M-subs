00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

here<00:00:25.910> sheared<00:00:26.910> cleanly<00:00:27.570> off<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:28.910> new<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.060> here

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
here sheared cleanly off a new one here

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.350 
here sheared cleanly off a new one here
I<00:00:30.480> broke<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.960> which<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.980> difficult<00:00:33.649> when

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
I broke this which is difficult when

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.410 
I broke this which is difficult when
it's<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.540> attached<00:00:36.960> into<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:38.180> all<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> got

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it's not attached into here all you got

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.520 
it's not attached into here all you got
to<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.719> count<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> revolutions<00:00:41.540> 1<00:00:42.829> 2<00:00:44.000> 3<00:00:45.530> 4<00:00:47.000> 5

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
to do is count the revolutions 1 2 3 4 5

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:06.850 
to do is count the revolutions 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:00:49.579> 7<00:00:50.719> 8<00:00:51.770> 9<00:00:53.030> 10<00:00:54.030> 11<00:00:54.680> 12<00:00:55.820> 13<00:00:56.960> 14<00:00:58.850> 15<00:00:59.960> 16<00:01:00.960> 17<00:01:01.730> 18

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.080 

19:23<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.150> 23<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
19:23 was 23 just like that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.870 
19:23 was 23 just like that
same<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.270> last<00:01:12.300> time<00:01:13.310> then<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
same as last time then you just do the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600 
same as last time then you just do the
same<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> new

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:37.200 

one<00:01:18.240> two

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.510 

2:23

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
2:23

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.779

23<00:01:42.580> Soph

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.569 

seek<00:01:47.789> a<00:01:47.969> little<00:01:48.180> better

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.010 

it's<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.240> bad<00:01:51.420> when<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.840> have

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's really bad when you don't have

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
it's really bad when you don't have
proper<00:01:52.380> tools<00:01:52.740> or<00:01:52.979> anything

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.210 

I<00:02:00.679> guess<00:02:01.679> that<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.039> bits<00:02:02.280> crusty<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.000> there

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:16.869 

come<00:02:06.820> out<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.090> there

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.250 

just<00:02:17.879> like<00:02:18.060> that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:31.080 

new<00:02:23.260> net<00:02:23.470> on

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.950 

clamp<00:02:32.090> this

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:47.350 

take<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.230> back<00:02:40.530> up

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.410 

it's<00:02:48.360> just

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.700 

apparently<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:56.600> back<00:02:56.840> nut<00:02:57.110> didn't<00:02:57.410> move<00:02:57.530> at

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
apparently this back nut didn't move at

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.850 
apparently this back nut didn't move at
all<00:02:57.800> so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.320 

wait<00:03:04.490> that's<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.760> good<00:03:04.940> thing<00:03:06.430> my<00:03:07.430> linemen<00:03:07.730> stay

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
wait that's a good thing my linemen stay

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:29.370 
wait that's a good thing my linemen stay
pretty<00:03:08.660> well<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.960> scene<00:03:25.660> socket<00:03:26.660> bill

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.720 

probably<00:03:30.380> metric<00:03:30.950> which<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.220> don't<00:03:31.280> have<00:03:31.430> in

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
probably metric which I don't have in

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.420 
probably metric which I don't have in
sections<00:03:32.240> not<00:03:35.500> there's<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.590> lot<00:03:36.740> faster<00:03:37.310> with

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
sections not there's a lot faster with

00:03:37.430 --> 00:04:04.290 
sections not there's a lot faster with
an<00:03:37.520> impact<00:03:42.190> especially<00:03:43.420> returning<00:03:44.420> yes<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.870> is

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:20.370 

not<00:04:04.780> have<00:04:04.989> one<00:04:05.170> offense

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.830 

well

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.470 

still

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.609 

and<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.350> between<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.800> signs

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:38.619 

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:41.159 

Hey

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
Hey

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.890 
Hey
well<00:04:41.999> rest<00:04:42.999> it's<00:04:43.240> pretty<00:04:43.449> simple<00:04:43.749> you<00:04:43.840> just

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
well rest it's pretty simple you just

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.260 
well rest it's pretty simple you just
tighten<00:04:44.319> it<00:04:44.379> up<00:04:44.560> until<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:45.610> tight<00:04:45.819> and

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
tighten it up until it's tight and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.550 
tighten it up until it's tight and
that's<00:04:46.599> it<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.229> this<00:04:47.349> is<00:04:47.409> it<00:04:47.560> right<00:04:47.800> here

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.230 

it's<00:04:51.040> like<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.190> shirred<00:04:51.550> raid<00:04:51.790> off<00:04:53.010> junk<00:04:54.240> cheap

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
it's like a shirred raid off junk cheap

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.090 
it's like a shirred raid off junk cheap
 tire<00:04:55.780> rod<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.170> just<00:04:56.350> installed<00:04:56.890> that

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
 tire rod I just installed that

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:07.070 
 tire rod I just installed that
like<00:04:57.310> two<00:04:57.490> years<00:04:57.730> ago

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.139 

you
