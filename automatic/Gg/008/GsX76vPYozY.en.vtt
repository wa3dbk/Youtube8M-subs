00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:06.910
 hello everyone I want to give my 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.180
 an oven that can work on solid 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:16.420
 and liquid fuels as solid 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:19.240
 fuel wood is used to 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.910
 to use firewood it was necessary 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.910
 to make this such under the guise 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.660
 but on the basis of 676 pipe without six 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.530
 discs cut hole 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:43.479
 reverse steel pipe 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:45.789
 sides there are such blades and and 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.960
 all and nothing more 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:53.829
 and this system works already recognized 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:00.600
 well flaw this system was 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.600
 only one thing is something else 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.929
 is ending 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.540
 the constant component was the solution 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.619
 use 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.619
 start this stove was a background 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.890
 and liquid as liquid 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.100
 fuel can be used waste 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100
 butter 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:30.899
 brake fluid here kerosene fuels 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.849
 as you want because 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:38.149
 I have a lot of used oil 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.149
 quantity 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.479
 a special injector was manufactured 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.479
 uncomplicated by the way and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.070
 is running. 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.580
 on modified so 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.159
 dna consists of two lines first tube 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.370
 it's 76 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:05.740
 which is a drilled hole 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.740
 higher exactly the same piston here 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.150
 12 mm drill floor in the creature and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.050
 pipe passes pipe 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.940
 inch and a quarter and at the very end will begin 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.970
 there is a stub in this stub 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.740
 the holes under the pipe are still down below 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.880
 there is a bowl 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.100
 it means the oil is ignited for this here 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.890
 This wood stove was necessary 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.480
 will do this 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.830
 not chop for ignition and all your here 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.150
 no upgrades 3 he's not 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:51.330
 it took further made such 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.330
 nozzle 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.470
 running Arizona such a supply of oil 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.360
 everything works garage is warm 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.360
 you can even listen to how it will be 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.170
 it is currently used not on 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.460
 full power 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.790
 since the townspeople are quite warm 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.860
 now 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.630
 translated minimum mode but if 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.750
 spoiled on whom property 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.450
 up to the very best the whole balloon of that color 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.050
 like downstairs so thank you all for 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.050
 Attention
