 Today I want to show you an animated diagram in one 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.099
 create power point presentation 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.429
 I have already prepared an empty powerpoint document 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.029
 from a lizard tables I copy myself 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.230
 a diagram 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.480
 and then fits into my powerpoint presentation 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.669
 I change the size of the TuS Büppel is better to recognize 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.390
 via the tab Animations I have the possibility custom 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 Introduce animations 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.430
 but first I have to make sure that the whole 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.240
 Diagram area is selected this happens simply with a left click 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.650
 when I open now add »click 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.550
 I have the option of the initial effect dazzle for the entire diagram 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 select 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.020
 the preview shows that everything is now displayed together 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 in the next step teak I right-click on my animation 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.620
 for the diagram 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 Here I have the opportunity to choose the infection 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.330
 in the tab Diagrams Animations 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.620
 I can now group the individual and awakens 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.010
 So the whole diagram and 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.860
 change to category 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.680
 displayed 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.230
 This also confirmed that I am now 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.280
 Have 7 effects 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 with a press of 5 5 instead of me the slide show 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.870
 appears with a mouse click 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.020

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.290
