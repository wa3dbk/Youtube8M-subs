long<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> get<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> second<00:00:35.310> row<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> hope

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
long to get to the second row but I hope

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.569 
long to get to the second row but I hope
it<00:00:35.970> was<00:00:36.090> worth<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:40.100> think<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.220> I'd<00:00:41.340> had<00:00:41.460> done

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
it was worth it I think if I'd had done

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.920 
it was worth it I think if I'd had done
the<00:00:41.670> second<00:00:41.940> row<00:00:42.030> before<00:00:42.180> Christmas<00:00:42.690> then

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the second row before Christmas then

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.840 
the second row before Christmas then
none<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.800> my<00:00:43.890> Christmas<00:00:44.130> presents<00:00:44.640> would<00:00:44.760> have

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
none of my Christmas presents would have

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.630 
none of my Christmas presents would have
gotten<00:00:45.000> done<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> reason<00:00:53.190> why<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.340> one

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
gotten done and the reason why this one

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.759 
gotten done and the reason why this one
came<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.329> shorter<00:00:54.780> again<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.620> we're

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
came out a little shorter again is we're

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.470 
came out a little shorter again is we're
using<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.129> double<00:00:56.370> strain<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.730> clasp<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
using a double strain of clasp so you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.619 
using a double strain of clasp so you
have<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.989> build<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.410> into<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.629> which

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
have to kind of build up into that which

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.610 
have to kind of build up into that which
does<00:01:00.899> make<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> end<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.590> little<00:01:01.710> longer<00:01:06.620> then

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
does make the end a little longer then

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.240 
does make the end a little longer then
when<00:01:07.830> you're<00:01:07.950> doing<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> single

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.980

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
and I just had one more bead and then

00:01:14.990 --> 00:02:24.640 
and I just had one more bead and then
we'll<00:01:15.140> do<00:01:15.980> the<00:01:16.100> clasp

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.479 

okay<00:02:25.430> now<00:02:26.030> I've<00:02:26.150> got<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.830> full<00:02:28.069> two<00:02:28.280> rows

one<00:02:36.200> end<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.720> clasp<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.560> first<00:02:39.739> thing

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
one end of the clasp and the first thing

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.899 
one end of the clasp and the first thing
I'm<00:02:39.980> going<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.159> do<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.430> I'm<00:02:40.549> going<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.700> string

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
I'm going to do is I'm going to string

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.180 
I'm going to do is I'm going to string
on<00:02:41.000> two<00:02:42.220> seed<00:02:43.220> beads<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:44.049> then<00:02:45.049> five<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.950> a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
on two seed beads and then five so a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.369 
on two seed beads and then five so a
total<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.760> seven<00:02:47.329> on<00:02:47.450> one<00:02:47.629> side<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:48.110> just

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
total of seven on one side but just

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.119 
total of seven on one side but just
think<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.829> as<00:02:49.010> two<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.519> five<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:53.420> I've<00:02:53.540> got

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
think of it as two in five so I've got

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.770 
think of it as two in five so I've got
I'm<00:02:55.129> gonna<00:02:55.280> bring<00:02:55.459> those<00:02:55.670> down<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:59.569> then<00:02:59.629> I'm

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
I'm gonna bring those down and then I'm

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.630 
I'm gonna bring those down and then I'm
gonna<00:02:59.870> take<00:03:00.109> half<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.709> toggle<00:03:01.220> clasp<00:03:01.400> and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
gonna take half of the toggle clasp and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.059 
gonna take half of the toggle clasp and
I<00:03:01.700> want<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.970> start<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.450> loop<00:03:02.829> just<00:03:03.829> in

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
I want to start with the loop just in

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.550 
I want to start with the loop just in
case<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.609> need<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.849> add<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> little<00:03:05.450> extra<00:03:05.750> to

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
case you need to add a little extra to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.020 
case you need to add a little extra to
make<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.829> bar<00:03:07.069> work<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.609> shouldn't<00:03:07.940> have

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
make the bar work but you shouldn't have

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.449 
make the bar work but you shouldn't have
to<00:03:08.180> do<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:08.810> case<00:03:09.049> but<00:03:09.650> just<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.129> case<00:03:10.159> it's

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
to do in this case but just in case it's

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.050 
to do in this case but just in case it's
always<00:03:10.579> best<00:03:10.879> to<00:03:10.970> start<00:03:11.030> with<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:11.510> loop<00:03:11.750> end

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
always best to start with that loop end

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.059 
always best to start with that loop end
now<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.209> if<00:03:15.200> your<00:03:15.409> seed<00:03:15.650> beads<00:03:15.829> are<00:03:15.980> gonna

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
now that if your seed beads are gonna

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.830 
now that if your seed beads are gonna
roll<00:03:16.400> through<00:03:16.909> the<00:03:17.150> loop<00:03:17.329> of<00:03:17.510> your<00:03:17.540> toggle

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
roll through the loop of your toggle

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.080 
roll through the loop of your toggle
then<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.890> might<00:03:19.069> want<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.280> cut<00:03:19.489> them<00:03:19.640> down<00:03:19.819> but

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
then you might want to cut them down but

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.460 
then you might want to cut them down but
in<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.239> case<00:03:20.450> they're<00:03:20.690> not<00:03:20.810> going<00:03:21.079> to<00:03:21.109> so

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
in this case they're not going to so

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.960 
in this case they're not going to so
again<00:03:21.799> this<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.340> what<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.549> wanted<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:22.940> think

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
again this is what I wanted you to think

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.599 
again this is what I wanted you to think
of<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.329> as<00:03:23.470> two<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.680> five<00:03:24.920> I'm<00:03:25.220> going<00:03:25.459> to

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
of it as two and five I'm going to

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:31.120 
of it as two and five I'm going to
string<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.060> five<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:30.139> then<00:03:30.889> I'm<00:03:30.980> going<00:03:31.099> to

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
string on five and then I'm going to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.589 
string on five and then I'm going to
bring<00:03:31.340> them<00:03:31.489> back<00:03:31.579> down<00:03:31.790> through<00:03:32.060> those<00:03:32.180> two

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
bring them back down through those two

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.120 
bring them back down through those two
seed<00:03:33.019> beads<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.349> we<00:03:33.500> started<00:03:33.799> with<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:37.040> I'm

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
seed beads that we started with and I'm

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.409 
seed beads that we started with and I'm
gonna<00:03:37.250> go<00:03:37.459> ahead<00:03:37.639> and<00:03:37.730> run<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:37.880> down<00:03:38.000> through

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
gonna go ahead and run it down through

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.589 
gonna go ahead and run it down through
the<00:03:38.540> two<00:03:38.720> core<00:03:38.989> beads<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:41.090> needle<00:03:41.419> down

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
the two core beads the needle down

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.670 
the two core beads the needle down
through<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.900> two<00:03:42.049> core<00:03:42.260> beads<00:03:42.440> then<00:03:42.590> I'm

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
through the two core beads then I'm

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.759 
through the two core beads then I'm
gonna<00:03:42.799> pull<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:45.440> that's<00:03:45.620> one<00:03:45.889> to<00:03:46.010> bring<00:03:46.220> up

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
gonna pull and that's one to bring up

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.909 
gonna pull and that's one to bring up
mix<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.980> loop<00:03:49.129> for<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.400> toggle<00:03:49.790> here<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.799> I'm

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
mix the loop for the toggle here and I'm

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.949 
mix the loop for the toggle here and I'm
gonna<00:03:52.099> run<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.370> up<00:03:52.549> through<00:03:52.690> just<00:03:53.690> like<00:03:53.750> you

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
gonna run it up through just like you

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.629 
gonna run it up through just like you
would<00:03:54.379> when<00:03:54.620> you're<00:03:54.739> building<00:03:54.949> the<00:03:55.160> clasp<00:03:55.400> on

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
would when you're building the clasp on

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.860 
would when you're building the clasp on
the<00:03:55.760> other<00:03:55.940> one<00:03:56.150> you're<00:03:56.269> gonna<00:03:56.359> run<00:03:56.629> it<00:03:56.720> back

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
the other one you're gonna run it back

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.460 
the other one you're gonna run it back
through<00:03:56.900> several<00:03:57.829> beads<00:03:58.419> around<00:03:59.419> back<00:04:00.169> up

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
through several beads around back up

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.349 
through several beads around back up
through<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:01.129> loop<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.790> made<00:04:02.060> for<00:04:02.269> the

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
through the loop that you made for the

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.000 
through the loop that you made for the
toggle<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:02.930> then<00:04:03.319> do<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.500> couple<00:04:03.829> of<00:04:03.889> half

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
toggle and then do a couple of half

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.129 
toggle and then do a couple of half
hitch<00:04:04.220> knots<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:05.150> secure<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.629> thread<00:04:05.900> and

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
hitch knots to secure the thread and

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.449 
hitch knots to secure the thread and
then<00:04:06.290> you'll<00:04:06.440> do<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.590> same<00:04:06.709> for<00:04:06.919> that<00:04:07.190> other

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
then you'll do the same for that other

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.339 
then you'll do the same for that other
half<00:04:10.419> you<00:04:11.419> just<00:04:11.449> want<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.810> bring<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.139> through

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
half you just want to bring this through

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.110 
half you just want to bring this through
a<00:04:12.379> couple<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.769> times<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.489> can<00:04:13.639> get<00:04:13.790> a

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
a couple of times just so you can get a

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.580 
a couple of times just so you can get a
good<00:04:14.629> reinforcement<00:04:15.349> on<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.959> thread<00:04:18.320> and

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
good reinforcement on the the thread and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:36.640 
good reinforcement on the the thread and
the<00:04:18.680> seed<00:04:18.889> bead<00:04:19.039> loop<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.549> created

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.820 

it<00:04:37.130> seems<00:04:37.310> like<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:37.580> tape

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.130 

okay

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.900 

and<00:04:47.650> go<00:04:47.860> back<00:04:48.040> to<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.400> loop

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.540 

up<00:04:54.870> through<00:04:55.140> these<00:04:55.260> two<00:04:55.500> seed<00:04:55.740> beads<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.460> we

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
up through these two seed beads that we

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.520 
up through these two seed beads that we
started<00:04:56.940> with<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.480> back<00:04:57.720> through<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.110> toggle

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
started with and back through the toggle

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.230 
started with and back through the toggle
and<00:04:58.710> back<00:04:58.860> down<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.340> do<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.550> half<00:04:59.850> a<00:04:59.880> couple<00:05:00.150> of

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
and back down and do a half a couple of

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.180 
and back down and do a half a couple of
half<00:05:00.390> hitch<00:05:00.540> knots<00:05:00.840> before<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:01.830> start<00:05:02.100> the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
half hitch knots before you start the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:29.510 
half hitch knots before you start the
other<00:05:02.280> side

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.339 

so<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.090> went<00:05:30.240> through<00:05:30.419> this<00:05:30.539> flap<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:31.050> I'm<00:05:31.229> gonna

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
so I went through this flap so I'm gonna

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.850 
so I went through this flap so I'm gonna
go<00:05:31.590> back<00:05:31.800> through<00:05:32.250> these<00:05:32.580> to<00:05:33.470> write<00:05:34.470> down<00:05:34.620> my

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
go back through these to write down my

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:42.460 
go back through these to write down my
core<00:05:35.130> beads

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.990 

I'm<00:05:42.920> going<00:05:43.100> to<00:05:43.160> come<00:05:43.310> back<00:05:43.490> up<00:05:43.640> through<00:05:43.880> this

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
I'm going to come back up through this

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.720 
I'm going to come back up through this
flap<00:05:44.330> here<00:05:44.980> back<00:05:45.980> through<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:46.280> shared<00:05:46.520> back

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
flap here back through the shared back

00:05:46.730 --> 00:06:21.670 
flap here back through the shared back
cone<00:05:46.970> on<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.150> shared<00:05:47.420> seed<00:05:47.690> beads

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.230 

I'm<00:06:22.250> gonna<00:06:22.400> go<00:06:22.550> ahead<00:06:22.639> and<00:06:22.759> bring<00:06:23.030> it<00:06:23.210> back

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
I'm gonna go ahead and bring it back

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.939 
I'm gonna go ahead and bring it back
down<00:06:23.660> through<00:06:23.930> the<00:06:23.990> core<00:06:24.229> beads<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:24.710> start

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
down through the core beads and start

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.800 
down through the core beads and start
nodding<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:29.120> you're<00:06:29.210> gonna<00:06:29.330> have<00:06:29.600> hitch

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
nodding and you're gonna have hitch

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.290 
nodding and you're gonna have hitch
knots<00:06:30.080> when<00:06:30.320> you<00:06:30.410> catch<00:06:30.620> a<00:06:31.009> thread<00:06:31.460> with<00:06:32.090> your

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
knots when you catch a thread with your

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:39.010 
knots when you catch a thread with your
needle<00:06:32.660> you<00:06:32.840> bring<00:06:33.020> it<00:06:33.110> up<00:06:33.199> underneath<00:06:33.650> it<00:06:38.020> and

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
needle you bring it up underneath it and

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.120 
needle you bring it up underneath it and
you<00:06:39.139> run<00:06:39.320> your<00:06:39.350> needle<00:06:39.590> through<00:06:39.949> that<00:06:39.979> loop

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
you run your needle through that loop

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.120 
you run your needle through that loop
you<00:06:40.520> created<00:06:42.970> we'll<00:06:43.970> just<00:06:44.750> go<00:06:44.870> on<00:06:44.990> down<00:06:45.199> do

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
you created we'll just go on down do

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.249 
you created we'll just go on down do
this<00:06:46.250> two<00:06:46.430> or<00:06:46.490> three<00:06:46.520> times<00:06:46.850> and<00:06:47.840> then<00:06:47.900> you<00:06:48.110> can

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
this two or three times and then you can

00:06:48.259 --> 00:07:17.490 
this two or three times and then you can
snip<00:06:48.620> your<00:06:48.770> thread

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.700 

okay

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.980 

and<00:07:22.710> then<00:07:22.950> you'll<00:07:23.070> read<00:07:23.250> thread<00:07:23.960> your<00:07:24.960> needle

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
and then you'll read thread your needle

00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.370 
and again with the bicone you'll need to

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.100 
and again with the bicone you'll need to
use<00:07:59.400> one<00:07:59.910> more<00:07:59.940> bead<00:08:00.330> than<00:08:00.570> you<00:08:00.660> did<00:08:00.840> when<00:08:00.990> the

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.450 
right when you use around so this is the

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.380 
right when you use around so this is the
difference<00:08:03.780> in<00:08:03.930> how<00:08:04.020> they<00:08:04.170> look
