00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.140 

so<00:00:10.450> this<00:00:10.660> is<00:00:10.870> my<00:00:11.370> design<00:00:12.370> studio<00:00:12.639> stroke

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
so this is my design studio stroke

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.859 
so this is my design studio stroke
workspace<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.820> can<00:00:16.000> see<00:00:16.209> various<00:00:16.480> bits<00:00:16.720> of

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
workspace you can see various bits of

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.780 
workspace you can see various bits of
inspiration<00:00:17.470> here<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:18.009> some<00:00:18.490> of<00:00:18.520> the

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
inspiration here and some of the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:34.460 
inspiration here and some of the
garments<00:00:19.540> that<00:00:19.599> I've<00:00:19.750> made<00:00:20.020> previously

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.800 

so<00:00:35.470> this<00:00:35.620> is<00:00:35.800> what<00:00:36.430> starts<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.060> process<00:00:37.540> what

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
so this is what starts the process what

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.250 
so this is what starts the process what
we<00:00:37.990> have<00:00:38.260> in<00:00:38.440> here<00:00:38.800> is<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:40.570> can<00:00:40.750> see<00:00:40.960> one<00:00:41.140> of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
we have in here is you can see one of

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.680 
we have in here is you can see one of
these<00:00:41.410> this<00:00:41.770> is<00:00:41.950> your<00:00:42.130> living<00:00:42.430> organism<00:00:43.090> so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
these this is your living organism so

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.890 
these this is your living organism so
this<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.020> a<00:00:44.489> symbiotic<00:00:45.489> culture<00:00:46.060> of<00:00:46.330> yeast<00:00:46.720> and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
this is a symbiotic culture of yeast and

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.240 
this is a symbiotic culture of yeast and
bacteria<00:00:47.560> and<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:49.300> will<00:00:49.750> start<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.890> growing

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
bacteria and this will start the growing

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.000 
bacteria and this will start the growing
process<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.000> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:53.410> also<00:00:53.620> known<00:00:53.830> as<00:00:53.980> a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
process so this is also known as a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.820 
process so this is also known as a
mother<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.580> that<00:00:54.850> gave<00:00:55.059> birth<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.870> this<00:00:56.440> sheet

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
mother and that gave birth to this sheet

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.040 
mother and that gave birth to this sheet
but<00:00:57.730> it<00:00:57.820> would<00:00:57.910> also<00:00:58.059> give<00:00:58.270> birth<00:00:58.720> to<00:00:58.780> much

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
but it would also give birth to much

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:07.260 
but it would also give birth to much
much<00:00:59.530> larger<00:00:59.950> one<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:05.229> fact<00:01:05.530> has<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.550> mother

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
much larger one this fact has the mother

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.560 
much larger one this fact has the mother
culture<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.860> living<00:01:09.130> organism<00:01:09.729> and<00:01:10.000> in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
culture the living organism and in

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.440 
culture the living organism and in
addition<00:01:11.050> to<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.820> sugary<00:01:12.820> green<00:01:13.149> tea

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
addition to that a sugary green tea

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.600 
addition to that a sugary green tea
solution<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.170> helps<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.710> feed<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.399> provide

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
solution that helps to feed and provide

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.430 
solution that helps to feed and provide
nutrient<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.380> bacteria<00:01:18.220> in<00:01:18.460> here<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.840> this

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
nutrient to the bacteria in here so this

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.050 
nutrient to the bacteria in here so this
is<00:01:20.710> what<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.040> sheet<00:01:21.220> will<00:01:21.399> look<00:01:21.550> like<00:01:21.700> after

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
is what the sheet will look like after

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.859 
is what the sheet will look like after
about<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.270> week<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.880> can<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.840> can

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
about a week and you can you can

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.160 
about a week and you can you can
actually<00:01:26.080> smell<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:28.090> fermenting<00:01:28.750> is<00:01:28.960> it's

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
actually smell the fermenting is it's

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.130 
actually smell the fermenting is it's
quite<00:01:29.320> vinegary<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.940> also<00:01:31.119> has<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.450> sensor

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
quite vinegary it also has a sensor

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.710 
quite vinegary it also has a sensor
which<00:01:32.860> is<00:01:33.070> controlled<00:01:33.550> by<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.850> thermostat<00:01:34.270> to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
which is controlled by a thermostat to

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.380 
which is controlled by a thermostat to
regulate<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.410> temperature<00:01:36.899> after<00:01:37.899> two<00:01:38.380> weeks

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
regulate the temperature after two weeks

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.029 
regulate the temperature after two weeks
once<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.630> are<00:01:40.780> happy<00:01:40.990> with<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.410> thickness<00:01:41.679> of

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
once you are happy with the thickness of

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.480 
once you are happy with the thickness of
the<00:01:42.160> material<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:43.179> would<00:01:43.390> be<00:01:44.490> stringently

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
the material it would be stringently

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.139 
the material it would be stringently
washed<00:01:45.910> out<00:01:46.209> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.950> for<00:01:48.640> example<00:01:48.700> what<00:01:49.119> you

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
washed out and then for example what you

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.609 
washed out and then for example what you
could<00:01:49.390> do<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.929> lay<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.860> wet<00:01:51.039> material<00:01:52.319> onto<00:01:53.319> a

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
could do is lay the wet material onto a

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.540 
could do is lay the wet material onto a
form<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:55.000> is<00:01:55.179> a<00:01:55.209> garment<00:01:55.810> shape<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.920> you

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
form so this is a garment shape and you

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.999 
form so this is a garment shape and you
can<00:01:57.759> mold<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.600> wet<00:01:58.750> material<00:01:59.319> around<00:01:59.740> that

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
can mold the wet material around that

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.089 
can mold the wet material around that
and<00:02:00.630> let<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.660> dry<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.349> that<00:02:02.530> would<00:02:02.679> take<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.860> few

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
and let it dry and that would take a few

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:08.760 
and let it dry and that would take a few
more<00:02:03.250> days<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:07.080> if<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.140> come<00:02:08.380> with<00:02:08.530> me<00:02:08.679> it

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
more days and if you come with me it

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:18.720 
more days and if you come with me it
will<00:02:08.860> look<00:02:09.009> something<00:02:09.369> like<00:02:09.399> this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.570 

so<00:02:19.270> once<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.629> water<00:02:19.660> has<00:02:20.020> evaporated<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
so once the water has evaporated the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.190 
so once the water has evaporated the
materials<00:02:22.030> coming<00:02:22.270> together<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.959> it's

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
materials coming together and it's

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.690 
materials coming together and it's
formed<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.450> three-dimensional<00:02:25.450> shape<00:02:26.489> this<00:02:27.489> is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
formed a three-dimensional shape this is

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.550 
formed a three-dimensional shape this is
just<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.030> test<00:02:28.330> garment<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:28.989> isn't<00:02:29.290> obviously

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
just a test garment this isn't obviously

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.710 
just a test garment this isn't obviously
wearable<00:02:30.099> but<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.819> can<00:02:31.030> see<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.569> it's

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
wearable but you can see that it's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.990 
wearable but you can see that it's
completely<00:02:32.319> seamless<00:02:32.680> there's<00:02:33.160> no<00:02:33.310> stitching

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
completely seamless there's no stitching

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.539 
completely seamless there's no stitching
to<00:02:34.209> create<00:02:34.599> this<00:02:34.780> shape<00:02:44.010> alternatively<00:02:45.010> you

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
to create this shape alternatively you

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.150 
to create this shape alternatively you
could<00:02:45.790> dry<00:02:46.269> that<00:02:46.630> wet<00:02:46.870> material<00:02:47.349> down<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.890> form

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
could dry that wet material down to form

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.839 
could dry that wet material down to form
a<00:02:48.430> sheet<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:50.290> that's<00:02:50.920> what<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.340> would<00:02:51.580> be

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
a sheet and so that's what it would be

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.259 
a sheet and so that's what it would be
like<00:02:52.019> when<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.140> comes<00:02:53.380> out<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:54.580> color<00:02:54.910> that

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
like when it comes out that color that

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.180 
like when it comes out that color that
you're<00:02:55.420> getting<00:02:55.690> there<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.140> purely<00:02:56.920> from<00:02:57.099> the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
you're getting there is purely from the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.600 
you're getting there is purely from the
green<00:02:57.430> tea<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.030> then<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.170> can<00:02:59.860> be<00:03:00.010> used<00:03:00.040> to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
green tea and then that can be used to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.720 
green tea and then that can be used to
be<00:03:00.760> cut<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.239> sewn<00:03:01.480> conventionally<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:03.190> make<00:03:03.400> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
be cut and sewn conventionally to make a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.259 
be cut and sewn conventionally to make a
garment<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.620> these<00:03:05.980> are<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:07.180> know
