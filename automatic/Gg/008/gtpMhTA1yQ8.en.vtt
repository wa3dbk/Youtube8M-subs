00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.419
 The fate of a hero Kal-El, Krypton's last child 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.834
 Are you done? 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.308
 Almost. 

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:34.626
 It's the only way, Lara. 

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:40.312
 If he stays here he will not escape, just like us. 

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:41.873
 But why the Earth, Jor-El? 

00:00:42.124 --> 00:00:44.314
 They are primitive, thousands of years behind us. 

00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:47.437
 He will need that advantage to survive. 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.124
 Their atmosphere is ... 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.062
 He will support it. 

00:00:56.938 --> 00:00:58.497
 It will challenge their gravity. 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.371
 Its dense molecular structure will make it strong 

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:07.178
 It will be strange ... 

00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:08.919
 Different... 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.869
 It will be fast ... 

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:14.018
 Virtually invulnerable ... 

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:16.620
 Isolated... 

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:19.120
 Only... 

00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:23.681
 It won't be just ... 

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:31.694
 He will never be alone. 

00:01:34.242 --> 00:01:35.305
 You know me better than anyone 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.045
 What we have is something more 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.730
 I realized that you are the one I need 

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:52.744
 I'd stay for you 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.793
 Lois, I died when you left 

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:03.555
 I would give up Africa to be with you 

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:08.354
 I promise we will stay together ... 

00:02:09.808 --> 00:02:10.806
 Always and ... 

00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:12.308
 Forever...
