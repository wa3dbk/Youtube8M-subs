when<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> hold<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.649> hands<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.099> seemed

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
when I hold it in my hands it seemed

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.949 
when I hold it in my hands it seemed
like<00:01:41.429> the<00:01:41.520> pictures<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.119> jiggling<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.780> and

thing i did like is and when I stuck it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.710 
thing i did like is and when I stuck it
out<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.220> window<00:02:13.370> driving<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.360> Rambler

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
the other day it you know it didn't pick

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.140 
the other day it you know it didn't pick
up<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.200> lot<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.500> wind<00:02:18.680> noise<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.670> was<00:02:19.849> for

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
up a lot of wind noise so it was for

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.360 
up a lot of wind noise so it was for
there<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.510> was<00:02:20.630> good<00:02:20.890> all<00:02:21.890> right<00:02:22.069> now<00:02:22.250> I'm

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
there it was good all right now I'm

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.530 
there it was good all right now I'm
going<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.580> put<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.819> out<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.090> window<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.420> see

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
going to put it out the window to see

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:37.760 
going to put it out the window to see
how<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.900> wind<00:02:24.230> sound<00:02:24.560> effects<00:02:24.950> it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.250 

so<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.300> sure<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.570> think<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.960> might<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so I'm not sure I think it might be a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
so I'm not sure I think it might be a
good<00:02:40.380> camera<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.890> set<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.220> tripod<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.880> play

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
good camera to set on a tripod to play

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.700 
good camera to set on a tripod to play
the<00:02:42.180> banjo<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.690> front<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.140> maybe<00:02:43.590> not

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
the banjo in front of maybe not

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.800 
the banjo in front of maybe not
necessarily<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.580> good<00:02:44.790> camera<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.450> carry

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
necessarily a good camera to carry

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.910 
necessarily a good camera to carry
around<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.320> car<00:02:46.530> show<00:02:47.480> anyway<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:49.830> know

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
around at a car show anyway you know

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.560 
around at a car show anyway you know
it's<00:02:50.070> hard<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> know<00:02:50.520> unless<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.180> one<00:02:51.420> and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
it's hard to know unless you get one and

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.830 
it's hard to know unless you get one and
try<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.880> that's<00:02:54.030> what<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.270> think<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.690> it

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
try it and so that's what I think of it

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.560 
try it and so that's what I think of it
so<00:02:55.530> far
