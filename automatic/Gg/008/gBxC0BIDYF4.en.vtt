00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.030
 we are going to mensah this series of techniques 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.449
 for bondholders 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 with an exercise that helps develop the rib cage 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.659
 then we will continue with relaxation exercises 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.069
 because it is important to perform a series of relaxation exercises 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.269
 before starting 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.689
 with the spi agents 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.179
 so let's start 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.179
 with the development exercises of the rib cage 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.460
 new shoulders saying goodbye 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.820
 a circle lomas antonio possible 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 upwards 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.630
 backward 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 down 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.320
 forward 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.400
 while doing this movement 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.320
 his arms will remain to lower the salaries 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.180
 throughout the flight 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.280
 like those of a rag doll 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.600
 insist very particularly on the backward movement 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 Too many years 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.200
 the second exercise 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.080
 for the development of the rib cage 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.700
 place your arms throughout the effort 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.000
 go lifting the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.670
 sideways 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 until reaching shoulder height 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.720
 placing the palms 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.960
 before the arms until the hands 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.090
 a fojas 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.090
 above 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.220
 and avoid delays high possible hills 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 as if I wanted 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.950
 during all this he does 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.770
 the one that I had a great crisis 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.770
 cutting it 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.959
 the lungs must be full when they arrive 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.959
 hands above the head 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.029
 I lowered my arms to shoulder height 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.939
 moment of suspension 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.939
 and hands down 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.559
 I lowered my arms to the lake of the fort 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.489
 this double movement of descent 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.489
 rivera companies and for a benefit 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:39.929
 interrupted 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:41.889
 for instants suspense 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.889
 Always take a breath 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.239
 must be an administrator in such a way 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.239
 and allow a breath 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.439
 to get more out of these movements 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.439
 it is accurate 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.469
 on the contrary 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.739
 they are good for nothing 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.869
 it would be good to imagine 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.429
 have a great weight 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:09.419
 who are opposed 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.419
 so much to censorship 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.890
 We continue with this series of house development exercises to 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.109
 there are margins 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.489
 I started it with clenched fists 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.469
 and placed in front 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:36.549
 in ten deaths backward nudges 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.549
 and I go back to the fists 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.499
 do not forget to do st 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.979
 second series 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.919
 of relaxing 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.870
 First exercise 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.139
 drop the arms along the body 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.139
 generating the sensation 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.889
 making a wade movement from one side 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.309
 perform the same movements 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.830
 second relaxation exercise 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.580
 make very smooth circular movements 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.529
 with the head 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.430
 starting 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.430
 to the left 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.620
 and last movement 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.460
 make movement 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.379
 with the head 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.379
 upwards 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.879
 above 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.129
 down 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.939
 exhaling
