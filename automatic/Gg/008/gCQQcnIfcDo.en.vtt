00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.070
 really looking forward to tomorrow what there 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.650
 the team then that is for a team 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.739
 it will be on 16 at 18 o'clock then it is there 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.010
 I'm curious about Diego Lopez 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:40.000
 Wow 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:41.560
 I am horrified one will say and one 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.960
 so even if he does not really have much 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.610
 worth is, I do not learn 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.010
 are fought but it broadway here 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.430
 goalkeeper 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.900
 that can not be okay then 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.670
 we still have a seven-meter pack on it 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.340
 is really so tragic that we constantly 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.410
 here this stupid 50 businessman and nothing 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:10.770
 third pull and ask and here so 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:14.110
 a nice jersey ok 60 we still have 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:26.770
 Now we are on the last 50 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:30.780
 luggage with lospech on so now but that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.780
 last paquin read as recorded here 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:44.140
 pure tension and is co i believed 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:46.019
 not happening is having problems with 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.380
 because of me 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:54.100
 that's just annoying that was 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.970
 is annoying and a seven and a half 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.910
 perfect at the end 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.350
 but then it really is over 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.570
 a very short episode i hope you have 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.700
 liked that she mentioned 15 times 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.160
 have raised the German there would be very 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.760
 very nice and all those who love me 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.200
 like dislike you can also like 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.600
 let a thumb down there though 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.200
 you want one if you like it 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.120
 rating is always very nice and leads 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.580
 unfortunately it was already 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.830
 I'm curious so there are several 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.320
 Possibilities for the team often emphasize 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.780
 either it is so that they really are 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.370
 Complete German team for take the 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.080
 Complete German team was up 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:40.200
 just doubt it but that 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.420
 my team is chic but i think so 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.990
 it will become what he becomes in this 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.440
 direction 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.450
 there we have it with only the ko 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.880
 phase are good players like you 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.650
 you just see new bumblebee 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.990
 The best players are playing 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.960
 We have what I still have from the tournament 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.610
 times saw and service and figures and 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.800
 again müller 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.770
 He will definitely be there and 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.140
 maybe yes and that reports 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.790
 usually in the klose still there would be 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:21.180
 the superspecial klose if we have the 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:22.190
 find the user miroslav klose very short 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.479
 depressed 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:30.840
 we have already here 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:34.820
 just not there is still that 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:39.000
 Offer I offer exchange offer 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.880
 exchange offer that gets from me 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.440
 of my duty by me 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:49.450
 you search 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.550
 offer make alas only friends you 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.950
 it's something someone offers 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.840
 can make an exchange offer 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.280
 everything is bright so very good 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.060
 klose who likes to be third 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.100
 but also like our müller dollar times 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:09.540
 look how expensive the 88er müller now 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:12.460
 at the moment the strike is 500 1404 100 yes 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.370
 there's all here 2.6 million 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:19.450
 but he himself is not yet 29 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.780
 yes to be happening 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.480
 aqua 398,000 it is actually then 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.130
 You can almost beat so that is 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.040
 All right, one can think with work 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.810
 I am a good player 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.340
 And maybe I'll remember 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.380
 something good and maybe he will 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.230
 also be there so that would be on the one hand 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.850
 my tip and thank you 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.750
 turn on for you and I hope you 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.750

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:47.070

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.070
