00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.690
 hello how about youtube people apologize 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.940
 for leaving them without video but good I've already 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.010
 turned hehe this time I bring you 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.990
 something very curious that occurred to me and it 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.180
 I want to share them in advance 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.070
 I say this is just a theory and I 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.070
 I would like you to tell me what you think of 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.990
 she as many of us know the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.150
 next movie of the avengers to 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.130
 debut is the war of infinity in 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.410
 the fourth one manages to get all six 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.390
 infinity gems to be a possessor 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.369
 of a great power an issue that I 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.469
 wine was quoted he already knew about the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.659
 existence of these gems because it was not 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.190
 before them and why he did not use that 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.690
 great power to fight with 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.059
 anyone who would like to take away the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.489
 gauntlet with the gems the question is 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.859
 simple because she had used the 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.929
 gems and the gauntlet will surely 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.760
 you will be asking how can that be 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.409
 possible the question is to see the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.539
 different clues that leave us 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.670
 the different marvel movies 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.469
 the first one that I will show will be when the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.510
 collector shows the guardians 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.639
 the previous owners of the gem 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.100
 known as the orb in this scene it 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.960
 shows us a celestial which uses the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.409
 gem to wipe out the life of everything 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.079
 one 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.210
 with this in mind you would think who would be 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.460
 able to challenge a celestial with 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.740
 this immense power to take away the gem 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.270
 the answer is simple and even gives it to us 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.830
 this guard that I do not even remember 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.250
 of his name hehe 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.490
 my lord do not harm us is the most 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 mighty of the universe see only out 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.200
 saying this the second clue which 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.299
 I think it's the most important one is in 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.280
 the kevin vault in which he hides his 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.290
 treasures that he is collecting during his 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.330
 battles here we are shown another 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.490
 gauntlet that is accommodated in the background 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.740
 of the scene but that has this from 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.590
 interesting the question is the following 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.450
 so that audi meta something here needs 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.939
 be at least a weapon or something very valuable 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.920
 being this that was considered as a 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.409
 gun so he had no choice but to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.659
 hide the gauntlet and disperse 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.640
 gems all over the galaxy this one could 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 change the name to make it difficult to 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.440
 search the third act the orb and the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.440
 Aten because if again gather this 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.209
 there would not be anything that could stop him 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.549
 in some way is he managed to keep us 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.290
 with a single gem the gem of the mind the 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.239
 little by little he waited for them to leave 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.769
 rediscovering the location of 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.920
 gems and thus meet your ambitious 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.660
 good objectives I know that this is not the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.700
 best theory in the world but they are 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.590
 I wanted to share you can leave in the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.569
 comments what do you think of her and if you 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.819
 liked share it so that more people 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.090
 see without saying more than saying goodbye and until 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.090
 the next
