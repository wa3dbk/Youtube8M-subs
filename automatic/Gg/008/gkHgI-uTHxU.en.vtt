already seen this in some of the videos
I've<00:00:17.850> done<00:00:17.880> before<00:00:19.220> this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.430> first<00:00:20.820> look

I've done before this is the first look

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.359 
I've done before this is the first look
today<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.750> out<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.470> 2nd<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.010> January<00:00:23.550> Friday

today is out on 2nd of January Friday

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.630 
today is out on 2nd of January Friday
2015<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> first<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.050> 2015<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
2015 and is the first one of 2015 of the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.540 
2015 and is the first one of 2015 of the
figures<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.210> released<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:30.750> Hot<00:00:31.050> Toys

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
figures to be released from Hot Toys

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.229 
figures to be released from Hot Toys
it<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:33.090> pretty<00:00:33.660> damn<00:00:33.989> big<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.550> hard<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
it is pretty damn big it's it's hard to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.940 
it is pretty damn big it's it's hard to
do<00:00:36.390> without<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> height<00:00:36.870> comparison<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.710> I

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
do without a height comparison so I

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430 
do without a height comparison so I
think<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.670> made<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.030> another<00:00:39.300> video<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:40.200> some

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
think I made to another video with some

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.720 
think I made to another video with some
poses<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.129> comparing<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.059> standard

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
poses and comparing it to a standard

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
poses and comparing it to a standard
stand<00:00:45.469> along<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:47.960> something<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.140> an

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
stand along with something like an

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.900 
stand along with something like an
ironmonger<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.250> that'll<00:00:50.460> work<00:00:50.489> quite

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
ironmonger I think that'll work quite

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.810 
ironmonger I think that'll work quite
well<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> high<00:00:51.570> comparison<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.640> got<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
well as a high comparison so it's got a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.810 
well as a high comparison so it's got a
lot<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> battle<00:00:54.420> damage<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> few

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
lot of battle damage it has a few

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
lot of battle damage it has a few
movable<00:00:57.270> parts<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.989> overs<00:00:58.260> articulation<00:00:58.980> in

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
movable parts the overs articulation in

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.930 
movable parts the overs articulation in
the<00:00:59.160> arms<00:00:59.579> legs<00:00:59.879> hands<00:01:01.489> there's<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.670> thing

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the arms legs hands there's one thing

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
the arms legs hands there's one thing
which<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.210> dying<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.049> actually<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
which I'm dying to see is actually the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.010 
which I'm dying to see is actually the
back<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.129> figure<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.119> reason<00:01:06.540> being<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
back of this figure the reason being is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.260 
back of this figure the reason being is
that<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.530> articulation<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> movements

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that the articulation and the movements

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
that the articulation and the movements
and<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> back<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.869> detail<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:11.280> actually

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and the back and detail is actually

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.179 
and the back and detail is actually
really<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:12.540> good<00:01:12.689> I've<00:01:13.140> seen<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.619> myself<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
really really good I've seen as myself a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
really really good I've seen as myself a
toy<00:01:14.400> song<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> way<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> is

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
toy song but because of the way this is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
toy song but because of the way this is
posed<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.520> impossible<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> back

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
posed is impossible to see the back

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.200 
posed is impossible to see the back
properly<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.380> can't<00:01:19.890> even<00:01:20.009> get<00:01:20.490> round<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.090> know

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
properly I can't even get round you know

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
properly I can't even get round you know
this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> best<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.080> could<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.040> I'll<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
this is the best I could do so I'll do a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
this is the best I could do so I'll do a
separate<00:01:23.790> video<00:01:23.909> showing<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.930> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
separate video showing off the back of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.450 
separate video showing off the back of
this<00:01:25.259> figure<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:26.009> that's<00:01:26.220> something

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
this figure because that's something

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
this figure because that's something
that<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.750> missed<00:01:28.460> when<00:01:29.460> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that I think it's missed when this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.420 
that I think it's missed when this
figure<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.119> posed<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.979> anyway<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
figure will be posed so anyway just a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.719 
figure will be posed so anyway just a
