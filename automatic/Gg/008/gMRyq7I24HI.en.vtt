00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hi everyone, today I will show you my hanging ones 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.370
 in May this month was 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.379
 my birthday month so I am 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.760
 granted some small whim then there 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.190
 I will also show the gifts I received 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.700
 the first thing I want to show you is 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.369
 super very curious and super hairy 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 I'm talking about my young to whom 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.449
 I'm joking 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.340
 okay okay I'm sorry I'm sorry 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.080
 the first thing I want to show you is a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.050
 gift that friends made me from 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.210
 lush and I love so I leave you will understand 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.859
 when I'm excited about this thing 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 inside the box there was a shower 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.480
 olive oil and citrus foam but it is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 really very good if not me 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.230
 especially like citrus fruits 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.329
 this foam is really really 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 good you have all a lemon and soap 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.100
 sand and even this with perfume 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.520
 crazy really delicious a scrub 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.120
 to sugar and I don't know what that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.680
 I have not tried it yet 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 ginger and sugar in fact and by some 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.030
 part below where he also buried 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.640
 one of those massage oils 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.060
 here is that this is always lemon type 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.470
 coconut and cocoa butter other gift 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 received from my friends and this desire 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 of danny roses that probably not 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.600
 will be able to make you see in full 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 because it's wide enough anyway 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.740
 white with this black star and the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.200
 particularity is that with a long sleeve e 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.960
 the other one is not there, actually 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.579
 a sleeve that engages for 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.970
 simulate a second sleeve 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.770
 but I like it more like that with a sleeve or 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.869
 cut we pass to the various books has 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 received percy jackson and the thief of 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.430
 lightning and yes I had never read 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.960
 percy jackson so I was 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 very happy to receive it so I have 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.899
 an opportunity to see if it really is 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.970
 nice as they say 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.860
 and since I've already said this in this book 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.040
 and I liked it but I won't tell you anything else 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 because good will also come out the video of 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.240
 the beds during this month I have 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.160
 also bought the second and third o 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.410
 at least I hope they are the second 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.150
 third and as the style of the writer 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.650
 I am really pleased with it 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.140
 also take another of his books 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.970
 or of the chronic one is always a sa 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.830
 that this is the first other book volume 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.660
 who gave me encyclopedia of the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.090
 Japanese monsters this book is 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.010
 something super wow because I can 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.500
 more than a year I want to buy it but 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.390
 it cost a little bit so I have so 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.240
 lent of my birthday for 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.370
 ask for it and it's beautiful I adore the 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.020
 Japanese stories and especially those 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.959
 who talk about monsters because they are a lot 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.370
 details he received then graceling a 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.680
 another book I absolutely could not 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.360
 let me escape because it is a fantasy I have 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.740
 heard the erika very well 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.350
 so give me enough of his 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.060
 judgment and I see absolutely no time 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.890
 to read it another book that you 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.500
 very curious that I made myself 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.090
 give and intrigue me as a program 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.820
 because he knew me a lot about story history 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.100
 hunger games but you'll know more about it 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.110
 videos on the books of the month I took advantage 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.090
 of library discounts to buy 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.220
 also the infinite story that they don't have 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.140
 never read and I'm super curious about 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.840
 read and among other things the library mi 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.580
 they also brought this little book 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.769
 companion agec commanded by the city of 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.900
 google but I don't have the faintest 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.459
 idea of â€‹â€‹what you talk a few days ago 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.530
 I then posted a photo of a book that 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.330
 I was reading, however, the psychiatrist of 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.160
 wolf sleeps many of you have me 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.980
 suggested another book of his that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.540
 I accidentally found in a store 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.620
 used books so I took advantage of it 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.140
 to finally buy it on bukvic I got it 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.299
 can rossonero of agatha christie yes 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.489
 slowly I'm recovering all the 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.340
 various books novels tales of forÃ² 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.410
 because I stradone it and therefore more than a 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.269
 fail to take everything keep of 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.430
 go to the comics I received the 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.590
 curious investigations of pure and can not 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.080
 understand how happy I am to have a 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.110
 comic on true because I adore then I have 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.930
 I think we also understood enough ho 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.540
 then received a comic in silent voices 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.410
 really beautiful that I said in 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.790
 English 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.800
 as soon as I found out it also came out in 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.960
 Italian I decided to give myself a gift 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.030
 because a comic book really very much 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.980
 beautiful you will hear about at 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.410
 here on the canal I was on a snow of 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.300
 I need to be honest hatori I don't know 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.850
 nothing about this comic I haven't read the 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.739
 I don't know what you're talking about, I think it is 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.220
 a show because it's written here 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.930
 side 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.489
 what drove me to fix 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.710
 this comic is the author because 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.810
 various biscuit wrote oscar then 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.430
 he said as soon as I saw a new comic 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.950
 well i don't care what they do 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.110
 I have to buy it finally released on 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.600
 third of orange so I couldn't not 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.280
 I haven't read it yet, but I am 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.930
 super curious to see how it goes on 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.050
 this story because now I will have done it 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.000
 an 80 head was so orange but it is a 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.760
 really beautiful last comic 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 game balloon and the number 14 is the 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.370
 final volume that closes this series e 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.020
 I'm a little sad but on the one hand I'm 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.390
 also glad that the story is over 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.550
 because I think they have stretched it a 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.830
 much more especially in the last numbers 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.140
 but it was a really great story 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.690
 very nice that I liked so much and 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.880
 finally the dreaded number 15 of 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.430
 attack of giants the cover makes me 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.260
 I really don't dislike it for 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.700
 nothing and probably this is the 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.860
 do what i do when i look 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.930
 this cover because of 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.700
 amazon there were really promotions 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.770
 amazing with regards to blu ray 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.169
 I decided to stock up on some 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.120
 animated films that I miss in 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.640
 particular I took the wind rises 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.070
 comisso al chino and that I loved and 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.410
 cried practically all the time 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.330
 the howl wandering castle I saw 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.490
 once only so long ago e 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.140
 I can't wait to see it again 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.790
 mononoke princess and that i saw 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.260
 this too is really good at the cinema 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.450
 nice beautiful nice i love it 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.460
 as well as the enchanted city too 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.620
 this when they returned to the cinema 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.720
 I went to see him because at the cinema 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.340
 really a whole other impression then 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.410
 they changed the dubbing though 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.540
 I honestly didn't notice 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.260
 so much because I had seen a lot of it 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.860
 long ago and I did not remember 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:02.620
 the kooks and I restitute them because yes I do 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.100
 I scrape the sky only on videotape 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.870
 and you can't see it much less because I have 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.360
 seen so many times in 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.670
 unfortunately the videocassette gets ruined e 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.130
 so I decided to buy it blu ray 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.140
 I can not wait to see him again the time we are almost 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.520
 in the end don't worry these are 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.730
 the last gifts I received from 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.790
 my sisters are this beautiful cover 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.770
 with lobster that bites the apple apple and me 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.880
 I really love this cover 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.000
 lot 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.000
 the astuccio zum zum diminu which extract 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.790
 item inside it's all I'm about to pelus everything 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.830
 super soft and nino is beautiful between 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.780
 the other vaguely resembles foods that 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.120
 well yes maybe you will have noticed a 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.970
 change in the background because the last one 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.760
 gift my sister gave me is 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.200
 this big sticks ie you see how much 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.290
 it's great it doesn't fit in the camera 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.890
 because giant is huge and proper 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.810
 immense and is super morbid and ssimo is 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.390
 still the label because I don't decide 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.610
 never wet the labels but it is super 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.500
 giant I don't know what easy fake 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.210
 man likes a lot 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.250
 these were all mine 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.020

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.260
 think and if this kind of video there 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.480
 like it because I don't make so many purchases 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.680
 generally because I tend to save 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.360
 however when I make purchases I do them 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.010
 substantial budget what description 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.080
 all the titles of the comic books I have 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.960
 quoted in case you had forgotten to 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.640
 say some important information 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.960
 you can also find t links on the various social networks 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.150
