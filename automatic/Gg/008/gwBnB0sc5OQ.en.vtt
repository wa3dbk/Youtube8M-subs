patelliday will call them and pretty
much<00:01:02.059> straight<00:01:03.059> away<00:01:03.090> from<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> saw

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
much straight away from what I saw

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.679 
much straight away from what I saw
looking<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.890> them<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.369> go<00:01:05.460> through

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
looking at them which will go through

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.550 
looking at them which will go through
the<00:01:07.520> blur<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.820> has<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.420> range<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.049> less<00:01:10.260> are

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the blur for has the range but less are

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
the blur for has the range but less are
classy<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.159> read<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.390> also<00:01:12.720> complete

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
classy and read for is also complete

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.350 
classy and read for is also complete
opposite<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.530> accuracy<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
opposite more accuracy but you have to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.780 
opposite more accuracy but you have to
get<00:01:15.540> closer<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> ism<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> both<00:01:17.610> have

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
get closer to you ism so both have

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
get closer to you ism so both have
advantages<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.540> disadvantages<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.380> fast<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
advantages and disadvantages so fast to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.740 
advantages and disadvantages so fast to
go<00:01:20.070> red<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.670> straight<00:01:21.180> away<00:01:21.740> with<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> ball

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
go red for straight away with the ball

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.149 
go red for straight away with the ball
this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> most<00:01:25.380> expensive<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:28.110> c8<00:01:28.740> mesos

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
this is the most expensive and c8 mesos

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.899 
this is the most expensive and c8 mesos
and<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:30.810> accuracy<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.590> amazing<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.729> only

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and that accuracy is amazing the only

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.870 
and that accuracy is amazing the only
problem<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.890> believe<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.670> will

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
problem as I believe that these will

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.810 
problem as I believe that these will
stow

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
stow

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.779 
stow
be<00:01:38.820> able<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.179> get<00:01:39.299> shot<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.810> sky

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.490 

that's<00:01:44.789> weapon<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.359> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> target<00:01:45.840> ships<00:01:46.229> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that's weapon me on the target ships is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.389 
that's weapon me on the target ships is
designed<00:01:46.890> yes<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.909> these<00:01:48.329> should<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:49.229> able<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
designed yes so these should be able to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.120 
designed yes so these should be able to
be<00:01:50.520> shot<00:01:50.819> out<00:01:50.969> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> sky<00:01:51.600> by<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.109> chefs<00:01:52.979> de

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
be shot out of the sky by the chefs de

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.139 
be shot out of the sky by the chefs de
fancy<00:01:53.490> style<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.869> obviously<00:01:55.200> it'd<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.909> easier

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
fancy style so obviously it'd be easier

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.120 
fancy style so obviously it'd be easier
to<00:01:57.179> take<00:01:57.390> another<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.619> obviously<00:01:58.860> just

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
to take another one and obviously just

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.539 
to take another one and obviously just
closet<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.490> higher<00:01:59.640> Chrissy<00:02:00.209> and<00:02:01.280> 22nd<00:02:02.280> reload

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
closet at higher Chrissy and 22nd reload

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.080 
closet at higher Chrissy and 22nd reload
times<00:02:02.850> no<00:02:03.179> too<00:02:03.240> bad<00:02:03.799> anyway<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.009> right<00:02:05.939> I'll

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
times no too bad anyway and right I'll

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.089 
times no too bad anyway and right I'll
go<00:02:06.209> through<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.140> red<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.649> one's<00:02:07.890> faster

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
go through the red for one's faster

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.569 
go through the red for one's faster
think<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.970> next<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.539> red<00:02:10.500> dot<00:02:10.709> i'm<00:02:11.430> also

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
think so next we have red dot i'm also

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.250 
think so next we have red dot i'm also
going<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.299> a<00:02:14.569> most<00:02:15.569> expensive<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.110> least

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
going in a most expensive to least

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.699 
going in a most expensive to least
expensive<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.090> thing<00:02:18.360> has<00:02:18.630> one<00:02:19.610> Masao

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
expensive so that thing has one Masao

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.589 
expensive so that thing has one Masao
but<00:02:22.709> but<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.400> looks<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.360> bag

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
 but yeah this is going to

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.220

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.930 
need resupplying constantly sexy point
seems<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.680> bit<00:02:31.799> steep<00:02:32.069> as<00:02:32.250> well<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.640> i<00:02:32.700> guess

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
seems a bit steep as well but i guess

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.289 
seems a bit steep as well but i guess
it's<00:02:33.180> got<00:02:33.299> better<00:02:33.480> range<00:02:33.810> than<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.860> ball<00:02:35.299> so

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
it's got better range than the ball so

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.589 
it's got better range than the ball so
can<00:02:36.480> fire<00:02:36.690> father<00:02:37.019> away<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:39.030> problem<00:02:39.360> i'll

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
can fire father away the problem i'll

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.949 
can fire father away the problem i'll
have<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.739> ball<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.160> at<00:02:41.420> 5600<00:02:42.420> meals<00:02:42.600> f

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
have with the ball is at 5600 meals f

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.590 
have with the ball is at 5600 meals f
i'm<00:02:43.650> assuming<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.730> done<00:02:45.180> will<00:02:45.269> be<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.450> main

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
i'm assuming it done will be the main

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.080 
i'm assuming it done will be the main
guns<00:02:45.889> of<00:02:46.889> a<00:02:47.010> skeptic<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.459> target<00:02:47.760> these<00:02:47.850> which

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
guns of a skeptic and target these which

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.340 
guns of a skeptic and target these which
is<00:02:48.239> about<00:02:48.389> four<00:02:48.810> thousand<00:02:49.230> nine<00:02:49.319> hundred

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
is about four thousand nine hundred

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.539 
is about four thousand nine hundred
meters<00:02:49.859> i<00:02:49.950> think<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:51.239> f<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:53.040> enemy<00:02:53.280> does<00:02:53.430> not

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
meters i think so f the enemy does not

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.650 
meters i think so f the enemy does not
have<00:02:53.639> a<00:02:53.700> fleet<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.510> off

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
have a fleet this is going to get off

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.050 
have a fleet this is going to get off
one<00:02:54.959> maybe<00:02:55.410> two<00:02:55.500> shots<00:02:55.980> before<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> fleet<00:02:56.819> get

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
one maybe two shots before the fleet get

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.309 
one maybe two shots before the fleet get
Santa<00:02:57.389> cantar<00:02:57.810> worth<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.230> range<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.560> firing

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
Santa cantar worth and range of firing

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.860 
Santa cantar worth and range of firing
so<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.590> don't<00:03:01.889> know<00:03:02.069> how<00:03:02.220> that's<00:03:02.430> going<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.670> work

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
so I don't know how that's going to work

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.940 
so I don't know how that's going to work
because<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.139> obvious<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.470> over<00:03:04.650> babe<00:03:04.829> will

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
because it's obvious on over babe will

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.309 
because it's obvious on over babe will
be<00:03:05.069> targeted<00:03:05.310> by<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:06.440> boats<00:03:07.440> mesos<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:09.319> guess

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
be targeted by the boats mesos I guess

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.690 
be targeted by the boats mesos I guess
we'll<00:03:10.530> find<00:03:10.769> out<00:03:10.889> when<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.069> get<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.400> use<00:03:11.519> them

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
we'll find out when we get to use them

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.830 
we'll find out when we get to use them
later<00:03:12.599> on<00:03:12.720> oh<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.700> yeah<00:03:14.849> that's<00:03:15.120> obviously

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
later on oh so yeah that's obviously

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.479 
later on oh so yeah that's obviously
slightly<00:03:16.290> less<00:03:16.410> accurate<00:03:16.829> as<00:03:16.950> well<00:03:17.160> because

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
slightly less accurate as well because

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.289 
slightly less accurate as well because
it's<00:03:17.639> a<00:03:17.730> lot<00:03:17.880> cheaper<00:03:19.730> but<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:20.880> seed<00:03:21.090> one

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
it's a lot cheaper but like seed one

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.449 
it's a lot cheaper but like seed one
messy<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.200> last<00:03:22.500> but<00:03:22.530> not<00:03:22.680> least<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:23.069> red

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
messy and last but not least for red

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.920 
messy and last but not least for red
fort<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:26.010> shank<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.269> coolest<00:03:27.510> design

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
fort of this shank is the coolest design

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.630 
fort of this shank is the coolest design
and<00:03:28.200> my<00:03:28.290> turn<00:03:28.560> away<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:29.970> looks<00:03:30.359> unique

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
and my turn away it just looks unique

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.940 
and my turn away it just looks unique
but<00:03:33.210> I<00:03:33.240> only<00:03:33.630> has<00:03:33.870> two<00:03:34.110> missiles<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.800> yet

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
but I only has two missiles and yet

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.130 
but I only has two missiles and yet
again<00:03:35.069> as<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.700> wasps<00:03:35.940> range<00:03:36.300> in<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.720> water<00:03:36.959> ah

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
again as the wasps range in the water ah

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.040 
again as the wasps range in the water ah
cracy<00:03:37.560> but<00:03:37.860> yet<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.310> cheapest<00:03:38.700> aw<00:03:42.050> well

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
cracy but yet it's the cheapest aw well

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.410 
cracy but yet it's the cheapest aw well
i<00:03:43.080> just<00:03:43.230> noticed<00:03:43.580> 1,500<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:45.090> i<00:03:45.120> get<00:03:45.330> distracted
