00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
something we think that they like

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.650 
something we think that they like
specifically<00:02:23.760> when<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:24.880> moved<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.270> Brooklyn

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
specifically when we moved to Brooklyn

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.300 
specifically when we moved to Brooklyn
we<00:02:25.810> really<00:02:26.020> wanted<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.350> pull<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:27.040> this

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
we really wanted to pull in this

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.610 
we really wanted to pull in this
underground<00:02:27.790> more<00:02:28.570> industrial<00:02:29.080> feeling<00:02:29.440> and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
underground more industrial feeling and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.790 
underground more industrial feeling and
so<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:30.370> became<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:31.500> specifically<00:02:32.500> different

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
so we became a specifically different

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.410 
so we became a specifically different
thing<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.070> it's<00:02:33.190> been<00:02:33.250> going<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:34.060> way<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.390> a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
thing and it's been going that way for a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.949 
thing and it's been going that way for a
long<00:02:34.570> time<00:02:39.209> getting<00:02:40.209> people<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.630> come<00:02:40.780> to

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
long time getting people to come to

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.380 
long time getting people to come to
Brooklyn<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.530> think<00:02:41.920> was<00:02:42.400> easier<00:02:42.850> for<00:02:42.910> people

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
Brooklyn I think was easier for people
