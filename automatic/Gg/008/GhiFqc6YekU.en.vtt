00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.589
 thermaltake play even easier thank you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 to corporations for giving video on 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.200
 tests graphics card hello swami john 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.360
 no connections and this techno kitchen is cool 4k 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 permissions and is it worth it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.510
 let's all remember the period of 9 videos with 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.750
 his picture fell 720 to 576 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.010
 or 480 points or let's remember 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.800
 HD video with a resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.260
 and above and here is porn in what resolution 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.410
 better watch dvd or hd 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.200
 of course go but better yet full hd 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.680
 everything can be seen in more detail okay good 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.260
 joke so from 4k even more details 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.079
 more detailed picture all 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.239
 can be seen thoroughly and naturally with us 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.270
 the full feeling that the world has moved into 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.059
 view on the aegis and full hd and so he 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.030
 will switch to 4k 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.730
 full hd you ratio 1920 to 1080 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.689
 points 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:12.840
 1920 multiply by 2 and get 3840 1080 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.610
 multiply by 2 and get 2163 1840 by 2160 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.950
 pixels 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 sort of multiplied by 2 but received 4 times 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.229
 more pixels for example imagine 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.229
 simple square 2 by 2 and square 4 by 4 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.680
 that is , the area will be 4 by 16 then 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.869
 i mean four times that way 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.630
 instead of one pixel meaning point 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.460
 the pool we eat we get 4 points that is 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.380
 more detailed image with our 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 monitor that we used similar 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.030
 sizes 27 inches 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.549
 that's why the 4k game doesn't really require 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.530
 smoothing because the ladder arose when 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.930
 there was not enough data on the boundaries 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.229
 Objects and now data has become four 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.409
 times more remember gta bridge and how is it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.619
 not smoothing always had a ladder 4k them 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.840
 virtually no play really 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.300
 fine picture is completely different 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.320
 after 4k full hd it looks just iwc 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.220
 how 1024 by 768 looked after 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.920
 full hd 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.190
 if gamers were given cheap 4k monitor 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.770
 and and inexpensive accelerator pulling 4k they 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.350
 would be happy to leave full hd 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.960
 to get more detailed picture 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.520
 up for 4k games at maximum are not needed as 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.500
 at least two 985 video cards and a platform 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.970
 20113 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.700
 six-core processor and twelve 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.710
 virtual streams under minimum we 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.890
 we understand fps not lower than 40 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.330
 but even here failures are waiting for us not all games 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.250
 support with strength 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.590
 project cars with illy for example 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.320
 turns on then no very unstable 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.960
 this particular project is a powerful trump card 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.910
 md up yuri ex have to pull these 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.430
 4k races are better thanks to crossfire x 2 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.710
 980 combine cheaper but stupid fps 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.830
 will go below 40 which is annoying 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.450
 You can certainly reduce the graphics but remove 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.100
 singing distance drawing for the sake of 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.470
 the resolution is somehow wild 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.840
 cross good project cars but frost 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.959
 supports few games someone has 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.000
 hope for even dec 12 which we donâ€™t have 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.760
 but generally not on the market yet 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.020
 single card that would draw 4k like 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.760
 would we like to 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.980
 and as soon as such cards become 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.200
 appear generation after generation and 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.110
 then the transition will begin 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.160
 users on 4k 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.860
 performance you are not the only 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.470
 minus the transition to 4k will interfere with what 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.380
 browsers and website don't even know about 4k at all 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.330
 and the programs are also very small and 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.970
 say honestly work or 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.060
 Internet surfing for 4 monitors is real 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.850
 hell we caught ourselves feeling that we wanted 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.970
 have at home 2 4k monitors for games and for 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.130
 films full hd and preferably 3 full 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.530
 hd purely 2d mode 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.430
 As for 2k resolution which 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.370
 techno-kitchen 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.330
 bypass something we don't like these 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.570
 gaps 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.750
 remember it was 1600 by 900 so where is it 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.420
 Now who says about him, but 4k will 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.000
 talk a lot like his 16k 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.850
 so what can you say now? 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.690
 lose 4k games but he's all true 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.630
 Witcher 3 and gta 5 can if you have money 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.139
 recommend the same witcher looks like 4k 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.300
 just awesome and very detailed as well 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.460
 another five years will pass until we get 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.710
 Cheap accelerator and a platform 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.300
 important in the same optimization programs 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.850
 and sites under 4k 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.680
 but we are sure that full hd will remain 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.680
 the past like me in my time 9 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:54.819
 for such 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.860
 monitor 4k we bought profitably by reference in 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.990
 description of the video on how to start 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.810
 competent work with the store, see in 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.150
 our special review with you was john 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.699
 no connections and techno-like the movie 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.669
 Like and come to my channel 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:13.949
 there found the best processor for gta 5 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.949
 see you soon, and until we meet again
