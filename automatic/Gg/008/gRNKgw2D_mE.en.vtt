but<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.660> can<00:04:00.840> see<00:04:01.050> that<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:02.640> thick

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
but you can see that that that thick

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.340 
but you can see that that that thick
black<00:04:03.420> coating<00:04:03.900> on<00:04:04.050> there<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:06.690> protects<00:04:07.170> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
black coating on there that protects the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.430 
black coating on there that protects the
steel<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.760> blade<00:04:09.090> here<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.930> hollow

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
steel the the blade here it is hollow

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.560 
steel the the blade here it is hollow
ground<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.490> hollow<00:04:11.820> grind<00:04:11.940> that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
ground this is a hollow grind that

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.190 
ground this is a hollow grind that
begins

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
begins

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.330 
begins
well<00:04:14.040> far<00:04:14.580> down<00:04:14.910> on<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.180> blade<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:16.130> then<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
well far down on the blade and then the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.860 
well far down on the blade and then the
actual<00:04:17.910> edge<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.660> cut<00:04:19.109> at<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.380> 20<00:04:19.859> degree<00:04:20.010> angle

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
actual edge is cut at a 20 degree angle

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.380 
actual edge is cut at a 20 degree angle
so<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:22.170> it<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.740> it's<00:04:23.190> surprisingly<00:04:24.060> sharp

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
so it's it is it's surprisingly sharp

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.720 
so it's it is it's surprisingly sharp
offer<00:04:25.200> through<00:04:25.710> this<00:04:25.860> kind<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.250> tool

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.270 

it's<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.330> little<00:04:41.569> more<00:04:41.719> sharp<00:04:42.080> it's<00:04:43.039> a<00:04:43.099> little

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
more sharp here than it is back here I

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.920 
more sharp here than it is back here I
think<00:04:47.919> but<00:04:48.919> it's<00:04:49.120> plenty<00:04:50.120> sharp<00:04:50.479> all<00:04:50.689> the<00:04:50.840> way
