 there was a video where this make-up artist carnazza 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.890

 to characteristics of this trick rera 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060
 well defined lips 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.660
 instead his eyes leave everything a little messy 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.500
 pechalat loco we say t 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.409
 for those who do not have a great decision, great e-mail meetings 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.130
 as you started in your eyes open sincerely various pencil shades 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.160
 example this 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.090

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.090
 mo too red 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.580
 I always understand backup 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.870
 my energy on TV 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.160
 open to these pencils here and started with defining it as the most a little more 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.130
 chiara masala was the redhead then aiola quenelle at 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.690
 and then we start optics where then step is sort 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.739
 Facebook 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.429
 the past above the stars in an aesthetically dark red pencil 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.999

 at what age is a sin and the chessboard use 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.909
 This 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.739
 and therefore in the end I can also throw in let's say that lapidator on the lips 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.959
 however photo cavolaia caterpillar being black dvd has defined why in the end if 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.369
 go to ie9 directly on the milan not yes 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:38.190

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.619
 open the pencil 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.619
 see here attachment I gave birth to 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.479
 self-styled drawing tips 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.479
 cap started 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.379
 pump years 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.679
 look to be done 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.679
 pedaso at all art. 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.769
 c'hai you have put you which year imprecision to remove the eyes are not 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.909
 regular, however, the effect that at least that 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.519
 padalecki alone 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.389
 you are fantastic 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.959
 the tread is all here 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.359
 always within the full inside the eye markets you do everything 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.749
 all black hiragana 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.929
 he is not the special person 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.119
 the cheek bend back blash star mac 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.059
 just to give some color otherwise 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.879
 terni seemed to be dead 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:44.979
 since in prague 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.039
 applied the mascara 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.199
 the end of the year that I acapella who 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.939
 this trick is always big 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.429
 tosi 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:56.999
 I know 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:00.229
 Italy made so wet that 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.169
 and it has a pretty good effect 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.089
 with your head held high 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:08.489
 In my opinion, or better, I would never go around with this trick here 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:10.959
 then 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.079
 for us 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.689
 real choice room which are launching very very very very much 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.209
 the black 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.699
 but honestly I wouldn't go there 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.990
 could be a game made for a corn head 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.320
 for a show I think of you 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.880
 all you want but frankly around with everyone now 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.249
 from good day to all and I hope to brando soon and I can do is a 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.879
 makeup video 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.199
 with cereal hesselink 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.620
 from here companies of inspiration if you want that you don't really love the punishment in my opinion 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.710
 because from many ideas more than anything else 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.740
 if you want to laugh to see it happen 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.010
 ranking save hours allowed also starts 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:54.779
 Hello everyone and have a good day
