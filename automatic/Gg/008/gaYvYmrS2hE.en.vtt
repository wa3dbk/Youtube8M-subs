to chase and follow winter to the pole
of<00:00:11.740> cold<00:00:12.010> the<00:00:12.519> poll<00:00:12.700> of<00:00:12.849> cold<00:00:13.059> is<00:00:13.180> a<00:00:13.210> location

of cold the poll of cold is a location

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.959 
of cold the poll of cold is a location
east<00:00:13.930> of<00:00:14.110> Siberia<00:00:14.740> and<00:00:14.920> it's<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.550> coldest

east of Siberia and it's the coldest

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.760 
east of Siberia and it's the coldest

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.020 
planet the temperatures been registered
at<00:00:20.980> some<00:00:21.160> about<00:00:21.340> minus<00:00:22.080> 65<00:00:23.080> 67

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.660 

but<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.900> main<00:00:27.110> reason<00:00:27.140> I'm<00:00:27.710> part<00:00:28.130> of<00:00:28.280> the<00:00:28.370> trip

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
but the main reason I'm part of the trip

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.920 
but the main reason I'm part of the trip
was<00:00:29.120> to<00:00:29.750> record<00:00:30.260> it<00:00:30.410> as<00:00:30.620> a<00:00:31.400> photographer<00:00:31.930> your

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
was to record it as a photographer your

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.860 
was to record it as a photographer your
current<00:00:33.290> job<00:00:33.410> almost<00:00:33.920> is<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.730> come<00:00:34.970> see<00:00:35.540> things

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
current job almost is to come see things

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.180 
current job almost is to come see things
that<00:00:36.050> maybe<00:00:36.230> other<00:00:36.500> people<00:00:36.590> don't<00:00:36.890> see

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
that maybe other people don't see

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.940 
that maybe other people don't see
instantly<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.300> then<00:00:39.080> show<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.350> back<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.770> them

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
instantly and then show it back to them

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.680 
instantly and then show it back to them
it<00:00:40.400> also<00:00:40.550> enables<00:00:41.060> you<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.150> kind<00:00:41.390> of<00:00:41.420> freeze

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
it also enables you to kind of freeze

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.229 
it also enables you to kind of freeze
time<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.440> can<00:00:42.470> have<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.739> proper<00:00:43.160> look<00:00:43.400> at

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
time so you can have a proper look at

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
you go outside for me the main physical

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.450 
you go outside for me the main physical
thing<00:01:07.250> will<00:01:07.460> be<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:08.110> constant<00:01:09.110> cold<00:01:09.800> there's

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
thing will be this constant cold there's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.520 
thing will be this constant cold there's
a<00:01:10.550> photographer<00:01:11.180> your<00:01:11.600> hands<00:01:11.960> are<00:01:12.110> your<00:01:12.260> key

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
a photographer your hands are your key

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.800 
a photographer your hands are your key
thing<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.130> always<00:01:13.640> faffing<00:01:14.270> about<00:01:14.390> with

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
thing and always faffing about with

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.750 
thing and always faffing about with
cameras<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.320> little<00:01:15.740> tiny<00:01:15.950> buttons<00:01:16.490> and

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
cameras and little tiny buttons and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.580 
cameras and little tiny buttons and
lenses<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.390> Iceland<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:17.960> learn<00:01:18.110> how<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.350> do<00:01:18.500> all

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
lenses in Iceland I learn how to do all

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.260 
lenses in Iceland I learn how to do all
that<00:01:18.620> sometimes<00:01:19.520> you're<00:01:19.790> scared<00:01:20.150> about

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
that sometimes you're scared about

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.700 
that sometimes you're scared about
taking<00:01:20.570> your<00:01:20.750> gloves<00:01:21.080> off<00:01:21.229> because<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.560> think

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
taking your gloves off because you think

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.990 
taking your gloves off because you think
you're<00:01:21.770> going<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:21.950> get<00:01:22.040> instant<00:01:22.340> frostbite

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
you're going to get instant frostbite

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.490 
you're going to get instant frostbite
but<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.630> just<00:01:23.780> learn<00:01:23.960> how<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.110> do<00:01:24.320> things

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
but you just learn how to do things

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.120 
but you just learn how to do things
quickly<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:25.930> think<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.200> link<00:01:27.380> between<00:01:27.560> broad

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
quickly I think the link between broad

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.910 
quickly I think the link between broad
geographical<00:01:28.700> society<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.270> Land<00:01:29.479> Rover

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
geographical society and Land Rover

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.560 
geographical society and Land Rover
was<00:01:30.280> actually<00:01:30.640> crucial<00:01:30.820> we've<00:01:31.420> had

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
was actually crucial we've had

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.109 
was actually crucial we've had
tremendous<00:01:32.470> backing<00:01:33.100> with<00:01:33.250> land<00:01:33.460> rover<00:01:33.850> with

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
tremendous backing with land rover with

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.740 
tremendous backing with land rover with
their<00:01:34.299> engineers<00:01:34.810> everyone<00:01:35.799> is<00:01:35.979> on<00:01:36.100> board<00:01:36.130> I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
their engineers everyone is on board I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.850 
their engineers everyone is on board I
think<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.840> really<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.229> combination<00:01:38.439> of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
think it really is the combination of

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.320 
think it really is the combination of
people<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.369> their<00:01:39.549> geography<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.180> their

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
people in their geography and their

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.999 
people in their geography and their
environment<00:01:40.930> I<00:01:41.049> think<00:01:41.560> that's<00:01:41.710> one<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
environment I think that's one of the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.550 
environment I think that's one of the
things<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.820> fascinated<00:01:43.360> me<00:01:43.479> was<00:01:43.689> having<00:01:44.470> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
things that fascinated me was having the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.410 
things that fascinated me was having the
opportunity<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:45.100> go<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.369> places<00:01:45.640> where<00:01:46.060> I'm

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
opportunity to go to places where I'm

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:55.149 
opportunity to go to places where I'm
never<00:01:46.960> ever<00:01:47.049> going<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.440> go<00:01:47.560> there<00:01:47.799> on<00:01:48.399> my<00:01:48.610> own

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.219
