00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
ghost bait so what I typically do with

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.940 
ghost bait so what I typically do with
the<00:00:11.920> ghost<00:00:12.130> bait<00:00:12.400> is<00:00:12.640> uh<00:00:12.930> it'll<00:00:13.930> be<00:00:13.960> kind<00:00:14.860> of

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
the ghost bait is uh it'll be kind of

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.170 
the ghost bait is uh it'll be kind of
part<00:00:15.160> of<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.280> base<00:00:15.430> gonna<00:00:15.639> remain<00:00:15.880> clear

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
part of the base gonna remain clear

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.210 
part of the base gonna remain clear
after<00:00:16.930> you're<00:00:17.080> done<00:00:17.230> which<00:00:17.679> is<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:18.010> bottom

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
after you're done which is the bottom

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.609 
after you're done which is the bottom
probably<00:00:18.940> a<00:00:19.150> quarter<00:00:19.990> of<00:00:20.080> the<00:00:20.199> bait<00:00:20.350> is<00:00:20.500> gonna

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
probably a quarter of the bait is gonna

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.859 
probably a quarter of the bait is gonna
be<00:00:20.800> clear<00:00:21.100> the<00:00:21.250> belly<00:00:21.460> underside<00:00:22.060> so<00:00:22.779> I'll

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
be clear the belly underside so I'll

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.540 
be clear the belly underside so I'll
just<00:00:22.990> kind<00:00:23.140> of<00:00:23.260> hit<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:23.410> top<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:23.949> sides<00:00:24.160> a

in this case give it something to grab

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.880 
in this case give it something to grab
onto<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.540> here<00:00:40.780> this<00:00:40.899> is<00:00:40.960> just<00:00:41.290> fluorescent

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
onto so here this is just fluorescent

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.670 
onto so here this is just fluorescent
green<00:00:42.010> right<00:00:42.579> out<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:42.850> bottle<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.690> just

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
green right out of the bottle it just

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.620 
green right out of the bottle it just
covered<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.070> top<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.520> then<00:00:45.640> go<00:00:46.360> down<00:00:46.480> the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
covered the top and then go down the

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.840 
covered the top and then go down the
sides<00:00:46.870> about<00:00:47.260> 1/2<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.890> 3/4<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.550> way<00:00:48.670> down

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
sides about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way down

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.240 
sides about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way down
and<00:00:49.210> then<00:00:50.050> you'll<00:00:50.290> you'll<00:00:50.649> start<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.070> notice

and then you'll you'll start to notice

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.040 
and then you'll you'll start to notice
as<00:00:51.579> you<00:00:51.969> get<00:00:52.149> further<00:00:52.329> down<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.660> side<00:00:52.899> of<00:00:52.930> the

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
as you get further down the side of the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.279 
as you get further down the side of the
bait<00:00:53.260> it'll<00:00:54.039> become<00:00:54.129> more<00:00:54.309> transparent<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
bait it'll become more transparent and

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.029 
bait it'll become more transparent and
then<00:00:57.390> obviously<00:00:58.390> your<00:00:58.870> your<00:00:59.230> bottom<00:00:59.590> quarter

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
then obviously your your bottom quarter

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.250 
then obviously your your bottom quarter
how<00:01:00.340> much<00:01:00.610> ever<00:01:00.820> you're<00:01:00.969> gonna<00:01:01.059> leave<00:01:01.360> for<00:01:02.110> the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
the ghost part of it will be perfectly

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.769 
the ghost part of it will be perfectly
clear<00:01:05.880> after<00:01:06.880> your<00:01:06.999> clear<00:01:07.209> coats<00:01:07.450> applied

after it's done so so after that greens
been<00:01:30.249> applied<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.549> just<00:01:30.880> go<00:01:30.969> over<00:01:31.029> the<00:01:31.149> top<00:01:31.329> now

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
been applied I just go over the top now

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.419 
been applied I just go over the top now
this<00:01:31.749> is<00:01:31.959> just<00:01:32.109> fluorescent<00:01:32.649> yellow<00:01:32.679> just

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
this is just fluorescent yellow just

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:34.919 
this is just fluorescent yellow just
gonna<00:01:33.639> cover<00:01:33.880> right<00:01:34.060> over<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.389> top<00:01:34.599> of<00:01:34.630> the

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
gonna cover right over the top of the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.109 
gonna cover right over the top of the
the<00:01:35.740> green<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.130> kind<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.340> gives<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.669> that<00:01:36.700> the

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
the green it kind of gives it that the

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.629 
the green it kind of gives it that the
chartreuse<00:01:37.569> color<00:01:37.689> it's<00:01:38.499> kind<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.459> hard

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
chartreuse color it's kind of a hard

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:42.149 
chartreuse color it's kind of a hard
color<00:01:39.819> to<00:01:39.959> to<00:01:40.959> get<00:01:41.109> exact<00:01:41.499> I<00:01:41.679> think<00:01:42.039> there's

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
color to to get exact I think there's

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.679 
color to to get exact I think there's
different<00:01:42.459> shades<00:01:42.669> of<00:01:42.849> chartreuse<00:01:43.240> out<00:01:43.479> there

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
different shades of chartreuse out there

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.459 
different shades of chartreuse out there
so<00:01:44.139> it's<00:01:44.979> kind<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.219> a<00:01:46.109> mix<00:01:47.109> and<00:01:47.259> match<00:01:47.319> of

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
so it's kind of a mix and match of

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.190 
so it's kind of a mix and match of
yellows<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.249> greens<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.729> what<00:01:49.299> you<00:01:49.419> can<00:01:49.599> what

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
yellows and greens and what you can what

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.690 
yellows and greens and what you can what
you<00:01:50.229> have<00:01:50.529> available<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:51.189> what<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.429> can<00:01:51.549> make

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
you have available and what you can make

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.419 
you have available and what you can make
work<00:01:51.939> but<00:01:52.239> you<00:01:53.049> might<00:01:53.200> want<00:01:53.349> to<00:01:53.409> try<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.649> base

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429
