and like a Japanese the kpop music is

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.419 
and like a Japanese the kpop music is
really<00:02:07.260> really<00:02:08.260> different<00:02:08.530> from<00:02:08.979> any<00:02:09.190> other

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.510 

I<00:02:24.790> think<00:02:25.790> Tokyo<00:02:26.210> people<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.780> kind<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.200> shy<00:02:27.520> when

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
I think Tokyo people is kind of shy when

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.690 
I think Tokyo people is kind of shy when
they<00:02:28.730> done<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.110> they<00:02:30.920> don't<00:02:31.130> really<00:02:31.310> dance

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
they done and they don't really dance

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880 
they done and they don't really dance
actually<00:02:31.970> some<00:02:32.780> people<00:02:32.930> does<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.680> guess

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
actually some people does but I guess

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.830 
actually some people does but I guess
most<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.610> people<00:02:34.790> doesn't<00:02:35.480> know<00:02:35.600> how<00:02:35.810> to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
most of the people doesn't know how to

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.370 
most of the people doesn't know how to
dance

or so like it's always connected in my

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.039 
or so like it's always connected in my
mind<00:03:48.799> let's<00:03:49.519> for<00:03:49.819> example<00:03:49.849> we<00:03:50.510> have<00:03:50.720> likes

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
mind let's for example we have likes

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.069 
mind let's for example we have likes
Twitter<00:03:51.409> Instagram<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.370> Facebook<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.720> those

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
Twitter Instagram and Facebook and those

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.890 
Twitter Instagram and Facebook and those
kind<00:03:54.379> of<00:03:54.790> like<00:03:55.959> internet<00:03:56.959> stuff<00:03:57.379> so<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.160> can

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
kind of like internet stuff so you can

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.220 
kind of like internet stuff so you can
show<00:03:59.900> everyone<00:04:00.379> what<00:04:00.799> you<00:04:00.950> doing<00:04:01.730> now<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.870> it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
show everyone what you doing now so it

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.780
