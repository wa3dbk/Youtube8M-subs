00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.130 

so<00:03:41.879> it<00:03:41.970> was<00:03:42.090> time<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.450> find<00:03:42.629> out<00:03:42.810> if<00:03:42.840> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.930 

already<00:04:20.470> its<00:04:20.650> looks<00:04:20.980> start<00:04:21.459> tipping<00:04:21.850> the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
scales in the siroccos favor but it's a

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.250

lower seating position meaning that the

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.610

different<00:05:12.889> as<00:05:13.159> the<00:05:13.340> cars<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:14.240> would<00:05:14.539> they

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
different as the cars so would they

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.510 
different as the cars so would they
reach<00:05:14.900> consensus<00:05:15.650> on<00:05:17.740> feels<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:19.099> feels<00:05:19.129> more

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
reach consensus on feels it feels more

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.420 
reach consensus on feels it feels more
exciting<00:05:19.970> United<00:05:20.300> feels<00:05:20.949> more<00:05:21.949> like<00:05:22.099> a<00:05:22.159> racer

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
exciting United feels more like a racer

exciting United feels more like a racer
where<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.819> golf<00:05:23.030> feels<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:23.960> little<00:05:24.110> bit<00:05:24.349> more

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
where the golf feels a little bit more

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.270 
where the golf feels a little bit more
you<00:05:25.340> know<00:05:25.900> toned<00:05:26.900> down<00:05:27.050> like<00:05:27.620> a<00:05:27.650> family

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.499 

understeer<00:05:31.280> but<00:05:31.490> mourn<00:05:31.759> the<00:05:32.000> corners<00:05:32.389> and

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
understeer but mourn the corners and

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.649 
understeer but mourn the corners and
stuff<00:05:32.750> like<00:05:32.900> that<00:05:33.110> much<00:05:33.319> more<00:05:33.530> so<00:05:34.449> you<00:05:35.449> know<00:05:35.569> if

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
stuff like that much more so you know if

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.290 
stuff like that much more so you know if
I<00:05:35.810> had<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:35.990> choose<00:05:36.259> today<00:05:36.469> I<00:05:36.620> would<00:05:36.949> choose

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
I had to choose today I would choose

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.080 
I had to choose today I would choose
this<00:05:38.300> one<00:05:38.569> I<00:05:38.810> think<00:05:39.620> what<00:05:39.819> interesting<00:05:40.819> today

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
this one I think what interesting today

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.360 
this one I think what interesting today
driving<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:41.629> cars<00:05:41.870> around<00:05:41.990> this<00:05:42.349> Trek<00:05:42.740> is<00:05:43.039> the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
driving the cars around this Trek is the

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.189 
driving the cars around this Trek is the
difference<00:05:43.699> in<00:05:43.819> Thai<00:05:44.030> way<00:05:44.240> just<00:05:45.020> right

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
difference in Thai way just right

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.659 
difference in Thai way just right
obvious<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.949> golf's<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.370> heavier

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
obvious that the golf's a heavier

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.189 
obvious that the golf's a heavier
vehicle

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.939 

and<00:05:51.199> they<00:05:52.990> like<00:05:53.990> I<00:05:54.110> said<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.379> golf<00:05:54.590> it's<00:05:54.770> not<00:05:54.919> a

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
and they like I said the golf it's not a

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.020 
and they like I said the golf it's not a
bad<00:05:55.159> car<00:05:55.370> -<00:05:55.610> great

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
bad car - great

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.360 
bad car - great
it's<00:05:56.180> a<00:05:56.210> great<00:05:56.419> moto<00:05:56.659> car<00:05:56.930> but<00:05:57.650> you<00:05:58.099> know<00:05:58.129> if

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
it's a great moto car but you know if

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.399 
it's a great moto car but you know if
you<00:05:58.550> really<00:05:58.879> push<00:05:59.090> it<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.389> the<00:05:59.419> edge<00:06:00.229> of

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
you really push it to the edge of

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.520 
you really push it to the edge of
performance<00:06:00.979> rock<00:06:01.909> is<00:06:02.180> more<00:06:02.509> exciting<00:06:03.110> car<00:06:03.349> -

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
performance rock is more exciting car -

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.730 
performance rock is more exciting car -
Heather<00:06:03.770> yeah<00:06:04.129> I<00:06:04.159> think<00:06:04.340> that<00:06:04.669> because<00:06:05.479> we

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
Heather yeah I think that because we

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.740 
Heather yeah I think that because we
conveyed<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.889> vehicles<00:06:07.219> on<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.340> hard<00:06:07.750> surface

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
conveyed the vehicles on a hard surface

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.350 
conveyed the vehicles on a hard surface
they're<00:06:09.620> really<00:06:09.919> gone

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
they're really gone

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.210 
they're really gone
living<00:06:11.930> in<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.050> four-wheel<00:06:12.379> drive<00:06:12.860> maybe<00:06:13.009> on

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
living in the four-wheel drive maybe on

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.020 
living in the four-wheel drive maybe on
the<00:06:13.340> way<00:06:13.370> to<00:06:13.550> ice<00:06:15.250> well<00:06:16.250> I<00:06:16.280> think<00:06:16.400> you<00:06:16.669> know<00:06:16.819> for

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
the way to ice well I think you know for

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.879 
the way to ice well I think you know for
your<00:06:17.210> everyday<00:06:17.720> driver<00:06:18.020> I<00:06:18.139> don't<00:06:18.229> think<00:06:18.710> they

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
your everyday driver I don't think they

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.740 
your everyday driver I don't think they
would<00:06:19.069> actually<00:06:19.280> notice<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.180> difference<00:06:20.599> on

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
would actually notice the difference on

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.390 
would actually notice the difference on
the<00:06:20.840> road<00:06:21.050> you<00:06:21.470> know<00:06:21.500> it<00:06:21.710> would<00:06:21.860> probably<00:06:21.889> be

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
the road you know it would probably be

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.960 
the road you know it would probably be
whatever<00:06:23.150> car<00:06:23.599> you<00:06:24.069> prefer<00:06:25.069> it<00:06:25.430> really<00:06:25.699> fast

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
whatever car you prefer it really fast

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.610 
whatever car you prefer it really fast
these<00:06:26.210> cars<00:06:26.449> I<00:06:26.569> mean<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:26.840> was<00:06:26.990> impressed<00:06:27.139> with

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
these cars I mean I was impressed with

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.279 
these cars I mean I was impressed with
you<00:06:28.520> can<00:06:28.699> feel<00:06:28.940> under<00:06:29.330> 90<00:06:29.780> kilowatts

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
you can feel under 90 kilowatts

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.570 
you can feel under 90 kilowatts
Stephanie<00:06:31.280> the<00:06:31.460> very<00:06:32.270> sounds<00:06:32.840> very<00:06:33.620> sporty<00:06:34.190> it

Stephanie the very sounds very sporty it

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.800 
Stephanie the very sounds very sporty it
doesn't<00:06:34.819> even<00:06:34.909> sound<00:06:35.120> like<00:06:35.330> a<00:06:35.360> favor

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
doesn't even sound like a favor

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.719 
doesn't even sound like a favor
you<00:06:36.229> know<00:06:36.319> normally<00:06:36.710> turbo<00:06:37.039> cars<00:06:37.280> don't<00:06:37.430> sound

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
you know normally turbo cars don't sound

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.450 
you know normally turbo cars don't sound
good<00:06:37.789> but<00:06:38.120> these<00:06:38.300> two<00:06:38.659> cars<00:06:38.990> sound<00:06:39.310> you<00:06:40.310> know

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
very nice certainly like like it from

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:45.339 
very nice certainly like like it from
that<00:06:43.879> point<00:06:44.090> of<00:06:44.180> view<00:06:44.240> one<00:06:44.750> thing<00:06:45.020> that<00:06:45.199> we

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
that point of view one thing that we

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:46.990 
that point of view one thing that we
have<00:06:45.469> to<00:06:45.680> mention<00:06:45.919> is<00:06:46.219> that<00:06:46.310> they<00:06:46.699> seem<00:06:46.969> to

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
have to mention is that they seem to

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.430 
have to mention is that they seem to
have<00:06:47.180> matched<00:06:47.509> the<00:06:47.659> brakes<00:06:47.990> to<00:06:48.319> the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
have matched the brakes to the

have matched the brakes to the
performance<00:06:49.009> we<00:06:49.669> drove<00:06:49.940> them<00:06:50.150> quite<00:06:50.389> hard

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
performance we drove them quite hard

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.649
