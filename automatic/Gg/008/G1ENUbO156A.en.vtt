across<00:01:47.890> what<00:01:48.220> that's<00:01:48.970> what<00:01:49.119> I<00:01:49.149> thought<00:01:49.450> was<00:01:49.869> a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
across what that's what I thought was a

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.109 
across what that's what I thought was a
screen<00:01:50.619> or<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.830> wall<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.280> light<00:01:51.490> across<00:01:51.850> the

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
screen or a wall of light across the

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.520 
screen or a wall of light across the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
road my heart started racing adrenaline

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.590 
road my heart started racing adrenaline
and<00:01:56.679> was<00:01:56.800> sort<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.580> pumping<00:01:58.119> through<00:01:58.240> my<00:01:58.330> body

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
and was sort of pumping through my body

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.570 
and was sort of pumping through my body
and<00:01:58.840> I'm<00:01:58.929> thinking<00:01:59.259> we've<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.340> seen<00:02:00.429> this

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
don't even remember covering it might

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.680 
don't even remember covering it might
have<00:02:12.420> been<00:02:13.190> possibly<00:02:14.190> close<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> kilometer

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
it was like some sort of low-level

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.270 
it was like some sort of low-level
frequency<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.239> came<00:03:52.659> in<00:03:52.810> waves<00:03:53.109> but<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:54.010> was

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
frequency that came in waves but it was

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.830 
frequency that came in waves but it was
so<00:03:54.549> dense<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.389> I<00:03:55.569> could<00:03:55.720> actually

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
so dense that I could actually

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.629 
so dense that I could actually
physically<00:03:56.590> feel<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:56.919> going<00:03:57.069> through<00:03:57.280> my<00:03:57.459> body

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
and that feeling absolutely terrified me

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.599 
and that feeling absolutely terrified me
it<00:04:00.519> was<00:04:00.639> like<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:02.109> can't<00:04:02.709> even<00:04:02.799> explain<00:04:03.159> the

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
it was like I can't even explain the

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.000 
it was like I can't even explain the
horror<00:04:03.879> that<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.480> felt<00:04:04.810> just<00:04:05.169> feeling<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.650> and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
horror that I felt just feeling this and

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.729 
horror that I felt just feeling this and
I<00:04:07.349> began<00:04:08.349> screaming<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:10.480> minute<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:10.840> did<00:04:11.169> the

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
I began screaming the minute I did the

eyes on these things lit up and they can

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.969 
eyes on these things lit up and they can
charging<00:04:15.159> across<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.609> field<00:04:16.680> halfway<00:04:17.680> across

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
charging across the field halfway across

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.949 
charging across the field halfway across
they<00:04:18.340> split<00:04:18.609> up<00:04:18.729> into<00:04:18.909> two<00:04:19.120> groups<00:04:19.150> if<00:04:19.750> I'm

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
they split up into two groups if I'm

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.719 
they split up into two groups if I'm
headed<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.320> off<00:04:20.380> down<00:04:20.680> there<00:04:20.949> and<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.579> rest

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.050 
headed it off down there and the rest
came<00:04:21.940> directly<00:04:22.389> towards<00:04:22.900> us<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.880> felt<00:04:24.880> this

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
came directly towards us I felt this
