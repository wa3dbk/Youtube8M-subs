00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.950
 last November audi created in 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.799
 madrid and barcelona- a space called 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.210
 audi e-tron hub for a week the 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.039
 general public that approached him 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.070
 enjoyed the opportunity to meet and 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.690
 drive the audi a3 sportback e tron 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.880
 In addition, talks and debates were organized 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.980
 with different experts on new 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.960
 energies and the future of mobility in 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.699
 the cities as one more person 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.410
 we went to this act to record the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.060
 video that you are watching and where you 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.099
 let's tell the main data 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.110
 technicians and the most relevant information 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.470
 This new model audio 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.470
 let's start 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130
 ah 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.080
 the audi a3 sportback e tron is the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.579
 plug-in hybrid version of the a3 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.039
 sportback 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.350
 under its hood there are two engines one of 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.510
 150 horsepower and another 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.120
 102 horsepower electric that in 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.159
 set give a maximum power of 204 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.739
 horses the battery that feeds the 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.479
 electric motor is lithium ion it 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.519
 You can recharge by plugging it into an outlet 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.140
 conventional and according to naudi allows 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.009
 travel up to 50 kilometers without 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.009
 turn on the combustion engine 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.320
 the change is automatic six 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.689
 speeds and traction is in the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.060
 front wheels the price of a3 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.920
 sportback e tron ​​is 40 thousand four hundred 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.750
 eighty euros that stays in thirty and 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.280
 five thousand nine hundred eighty one time 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.230
 discounted the current aid for this 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.240
 type of vehicles 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.710
 in this table you compare electron with 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.710
 its two alternatives of thermal engine 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.330
 within the a3 sportback range both with 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.130
 the level of ambition equipment the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.710
 only available for electron and with 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.750
 automatic change it must be said that in 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.850
 the case of the 184 diesel version 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.370
 horses the automatic change is linked 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.090
 necessarily to all-wheel drive like 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.189
 it looks electron we get badly 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.170
 add to the table the volkswagen golf 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.080
 gti that shares the propelling system 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.720
 with the audio 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.170
 the petrol engine of the a3 e-tron is the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.490
 same as the version 1.4 tfsi but 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.450
 without the automatic disconnection system 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.450
 of cylinders 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.280
 this engine has had to move 6 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.319
 centimeters to the right to accommodate 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.090
 to the gearbox s tronic to the engine 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.890
 electrical and other elements of the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.020
 hybrid system 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.990
 the battery has a capacity of 88 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.310
 kilowatt hours weighs 125 kilograms and 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.870
 It has a cooling system 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.239
 liquid 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.700
 there are three ways to recharge the first 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.680
 main and already commented is connecting 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.540
 the to a conventional outlet using 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.599
 the charge that is behind the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.459
 frontal emblem the second is the phases 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.830
 of deceleration transforming the energy 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.840
 kinetic in electrical and the third is 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.150
 using the combustion engine as 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.840
 generator activating the charts mode of 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.840
 that we will talk about later 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.390
 the battery is placed under the 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.190
 rear seats and the deposit of 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.470
 fuel has been relocated under the floor 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.330
 of the trunk this has caused the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.910
 cargo capacity of the luggage compartment has 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.970
 depleted 100 liters now has 280 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.300
 liters instead of the 380 of the rest of a3 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.490
 sportback 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.930
 the rear seats can be folded down and 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.770
 get a load volume of 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.420
 1000 120 liters 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.850
 the inclusion of the bree 2 system 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.590
 assumes an increase in weight of 305 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.900
 kilograms on the version that only 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.300
 has a gasoline engine for this reason 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.680
 the e-tron has a harder suspension 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.540
 and can not have even the suspension 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.820
 sports suspension adaptive 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.720
 that if they are available in the rest of 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.210
 to three 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.460
 There are four driving modes v auto 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.010
 hold and sharks are selected with the 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.660
 Uve key on the dashboard 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.520
 vee mode is activated which 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.050
 failure to boot where only 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.360
 uses the electric motor as a machine 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.550
 booster in this mode can be 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.620
 travel up to 50 kilometers or reach 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.740
 at a maximum speed of 130 kilometers 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.570
 per hour the auto mode is theoretically the 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.700
 that gets the most efficiency in 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.530
 acceleration demand function the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.540
 control unit decides which motor to use 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.040
 and with how much intensity if you drive 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.320
 with softness and taking advantage of the inertia 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.810
 we will make the electric motor be the 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.220
 which assumes most of the movement 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.750
 the combustion engine will enter 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.600
 operation at specific moments 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.370
 to support you hold mode it serves to 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.200
 keep the battery charge level 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.330
 that is at that moment for that reason 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.900
 the thermal engine assumes the role of 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.000
 main driver of 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.500
 finally with the church mode it 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.540
 Get to charge the battery by 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.310
 combustion engine is the least way 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.229
 efficient to do it but the fastest 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.229
 to increase the electrical autonomy in 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.850
 if we need it later 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.949
 to differentiate a3 sportback and tron 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.020
 of your range brothers you have to look 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.389
 in its front bumper and the 14 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.800
 chrome grille bars as well as 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.750
 in the black part diffusers 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.699
 back and of course there are the 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.560
 logos that put the throne these 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.690
 small aesthetic changes make the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.759
 Electrone body is 2 mm 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.919
 longer and one millimeter lower than the 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.650
 from the rest of a3 sportback the width does not 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.479
 changes but if it does curiously the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.850
 wheelbase decreasing 6 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.110
 millimeters inside the change 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.270
 main is seen in the box 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.830
 instruments where a usage indicator 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.700
 of power occupies the space of 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.730
 Rev counter 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.350
 however, the latter does not disappear anymore 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.009
 that can now be visualized in the 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.080
 Onboard computer screen 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.520
 the strong version of the 3 is only 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.949
 available with sportback body 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.629
 that is to say the five- door and the 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.289
 moment does not seem to extend to the 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.289
 rest of bodies
