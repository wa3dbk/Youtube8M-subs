00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.559
 roj

 h 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.760
 Axes look back on that last month made the season begin with one 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.279
 loss against Feyenoord and it became 6 0 profit against Utrecht 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.560
 that actually says a bit differently about the varying results 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.710
 too bad you also need an STD 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.439
 We see that the match against Utrecht was a very weak Utrecht, I thought 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.170
 experienced a single treasure a little higher 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.510
 the supporters is not entirely comparable with a barely different side 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.020
 you have to score six times and have done that but also against lesser ones 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.290
 plowing and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 after the indicates that the top football have become antoine fortunÃ© it 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.980
 last six months that is also not fun of course 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.890
 yes, his analysis was started I think 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 and after yes always look welcome 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.210
 After both games we started to play better and could come now 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.660
 grab points and 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.660
 his taken title race 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 if you look at the first few months what were at your doorstep 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.060
 the highlights 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.410
 the first months 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.930
 disadvantage the first time did not perform so well, it is often the only one 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.120
 Highlights but well the point is that you as a team clearly have got you 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.390
 Jan wants to do how and how should we do it and then where do they go 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.790
 each other then grows and that's you that's the beauty of a friend's 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.570
 Betuwe works again 10 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.420
 that until Feyenoord the next game is against Feyenoord again 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.460
 plotting to possible feyenoord 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.070
 yes you have that because you have the bleeckere 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.110
 so chances are that you also became a mistake can lottery tickets because we are too 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.660
 the gone through it 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.720
 That would be a very nice competition to look forward to 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.340
 I think we have the next three games that are of course quite 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.340
 important, because sometimes the city plows 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.970
 so i got there very quickly 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.140
 Ryan sees the young Ajax the front David Beckham again too dangerous 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.459
 a nice poster 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.790
 yes those are the matches you are looking forward to each other 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.450
 that's why build it 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.790
 I also trained well for myself, also during the holidays 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.589
 myself 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.619
 And well this was possible to come back as much as possible 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.209
 and after a hard tackle from the line by therefore this week of another disaster or 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.299
 started spicy 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.299
 must catch fish 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.519
 many train many many many many practice duels 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.549
 we have them two players away blind I am already happy that they both go to it 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:51.980
 first 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.099
 picking up the brother of the world 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.889
 well i think that's nice to have demol range with all of us 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.359
 participating in bonaire competitions 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.210
 and then 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.100
 yes there is still playing 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.279
 it must all be well to be able to absorb 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.450
 yes but I assume that I hope those guys also have a salad with ours 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.909
 a player other side whatever you are again young ajax is also training with the 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.839
 young players perhaps from a youth 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:19.059
 will be forwarded again and they will be able to develop further 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.219
 and that is already being filled in and it simply works 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.340
 There is also he seemed to work at the Wajong Ajax course that you people 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.859
 tries to keep on flowing and that other boys get the chance again 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.859
 does it work and so does the accident 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.889
 16 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.169
 Here you will find delivery in the coming months at the first 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.049
 especially that I do not know but we are all for boys one 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:51.870
 broadcasting knowledge 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.210
 to enter the name of which I think well that a juice could also be at etoile 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.340
 are going to make it and if they knew this season he would definitely come 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.819
 gel 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.699
 It is true that we are with or without a good cause 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:18.260
 These matches are coming without the day 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.270
 does have the two games suspension meanwhile he means the 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.270
 cup match no longer hosts the party 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.689
 Prague 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.300
 but
