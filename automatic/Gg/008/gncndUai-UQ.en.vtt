think<00:00:15.770> the<00:00:16.190> most<00:00:16.309> interesting<00:00:16.580> bike<00:00:17.150> I've

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
think the most interesting bike I've

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.090 
think the most interesting bike I've
seen<00:00:17.600> yet<00:00:17.779> today<00:00:17.990> tell<00:00:18.320> us<00:00:18.440> about<00:00:18.619> this<00:00:18.890> bike

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
seen yet today tell us about this bike

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.780 
seen yet today tell us about this bike
here<00:00:19.400> well<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:20.180> bike<00:00:20.300> started<00:00:20.660> out<00:00:20.810> is<00:00:21.790> really

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
here well the bike started out is really

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.790 
here well the bike started out is really
is<00:00:23.000> a<00:00:23.030> concept<00:00:23.540> to<00:00:23.690> do<00:00:23.840> wooden<00:00:24.170> fenders<00:00:24.590> that

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
is a concept to do wooden fenders that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.050 
is a concept to do wooden fenders that
are<00:00:25.960> proper<00:00:26.960> wooden<00:00:27.289> fenders<00:00:27.740> ones<00:00:28.670> that<00:00:28.910> are

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
are proper wooden fenders ones that are

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.420 
are proper wooden fenders ones that are
round<00:00:29.480> it<00:00:30.200> would<00:00:30.350> actually<00:00:30.470> channel<00:00:31.190> water

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
round it would actually channel water

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.869 
round it would actually channel water
away<00:00:32.920> most<00:00:33.920> of<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.100> fenders<00:00:34.370> there's<00:00:34.730> some

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
away most of the fenders there's some

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.580 
away most of the fenders there's some
guys<00:00:35.059> now<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:35.600> think<00:00:35.719> that<00:00:36.050> are<00:00:36.170> doing<00:00:36.379> some

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
guys now I think that are doing some

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.130 
guys now I think that are doing some
some<00:00:37.070> proper<00:00:37.640> fenders<00:00:38.000> but<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.900> know<00:00:38.989> the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
some proper fenders but you know the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.990 
some proper fenders but you know the
past<00:00:39.350> they<00:00:39.530> were<00:00:39.590> all<00:00:39.710> just<00:00:39.829> flat<00:00:40.489> pieces<00:00:40.760> of

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
past they were all just flat pieces of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.670 
past they were all just flat pieces of
wood<00:00:41.120> which<00:00:41.390> in<00:00:41.540> Northwest<00:00:42.020> you<00:00:42.230> can't<00:00:42.440> use

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
wood which in Northwest you can't use

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.200 
wood which in Northwest you can't use
when<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:43.190> raining<00:00:43.370> because<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:43.760> don't<00:00:43.910> work

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
when it's raining because it don't work

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.120 
when it's raining because it don't work
right<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.020> this<00:00:45.170> was<00:00:45.320> sort<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.649> impetus<00:00:45.980> to

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
right so this was sort of the impetus to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.010 
right so this was sort of the impetus to
start<00:00:46.399> this<00:00:46.550> bike<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.450> other<00:00:47.480> thing<00:00:47.810> is<00:00:47.840> I

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
start this bike the other thing is I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.410 
start this bike the other thing is I
have<00:00:48.140> three<00:00:48.440> sons<00:00:48.730> six<00:00:49.730> eight<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:49.970> a<00:00:50.090> half<00:00:50.120> and

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
have three sons six eight and a half and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.700 
have three sons six eight and a half and
10<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.290> so<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.739> lot<00:00:52.130> of<00:00:52.190> this<00:00:52.399> is<00:00:53.380> do<00:00:54.380> they<00:00:54.500> fight

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
10 and so a lot of this is do they fight

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.229 
10 and so a lot of this is do they fight
over<00:00:54.739> this<00:00:55.070> no<00:00:55.719> I'll<00:00:56.719> tell<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.020> why<00:00:58.239> but

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
over this no I'll tell you why but

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.090 
over this no I'll tell you why but
drawing<00:00:59.510> inspiration<00:00:59.899> from<00:01:00.260> them<00:01:00.590> is<00:01:00.829> you

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
drawing inspiration from them is you

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.109 
drawing inspiration from them is you
know<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:02.930> make<00:01:03.079> something<00:01:03.440> that's

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
know to make something that's

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.969 
know to make something that's
ridiculously<00:01:05.119> over-the-top<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:06.619> know<00:01:06.710> kids

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.440 
can have well now we flip it a little
bit<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.459> don't<00:01:13.670> see<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:13.999> but<00:01:14.090> they<00:01:14.240> can't

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
bit so you don't see it but they can't

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.029 
bit so you don't see it but they can't
have<00:01:14.689> it<00:01:14.719> right<00:01:15.170> right<00:01:15.469> because<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:15.799> not<00:01:15.979> for

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
have it right right because it's not for

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.179 
have it right right because it's not for
them<00:01:16.369> right<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:17.840> also<00:01:18.020> completely<00:01:18.619> over

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
them right but it's also completely over

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.889 
them right but it's also completely over
the<00:01:19.219> top<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.209> started<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:20.630> way<00:01:20.689> I

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
the top so it started that way I

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.559 
the top so it started that way I
actually<00:01:21.649> built<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.340> frame<00:01:22.579> backwards<00:01:23.420> i

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
actually built the frame backwards i

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.139 
actually built the frame backwards i
made<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.200> fenders<00:01:24.560> first<00:01:24.889> and<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.789> fenders

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
made the fenders first and the fenders

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.139 
made the fenders first and the fenders
are<00:01:26.329> this<00:01:27.170> one's<00:01:27.380> 13<00:01:27.799> plies<00:01:28.069> started<00:01:28.639> out<00:01:28.729> as<00:01:28.939> a

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
are this one's 13 plies started out as a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.690 
are this one's 13 plies started out as a
thin<00:01:29.869> CH<00:01:29.899> thick<00:01:30.259> strips<00:01:31.069> two<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.549> half

thin CH thick strips two and a half
inches<00:01:31.850> wide<00:01:32.299> Wow<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.469> I<00:01:33.590> formed<00:01:34.039> them<00:01:34.219> around

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
inches wide Wow and I formed them around

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.860 
inches wide Wow and I formed them around
to<00:01:34.609> die<00:01:34.759> by<00:01:35.029> boiling<00:01:35.359> them

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
to die by boiling them

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.930 
to die by boiling them
and<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.680> later<00:01:37.890> laid<00:01:38.160> him<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.610> epoxy

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
and then I later laid him up with epoxy

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.700 
and then I later laid him up with epoxy
resin<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.690> had<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> big<00:01:40.020> blank<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> had

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
resin that I had a big blank and I had

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.680 
resin that I had a big blank and I had
to<00:01:40.800> carve<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.340> he<00:01:41.580> used<00:01:41.730> a<00:01:41.820> router<00:01:42.120> live

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
to carve that out he used a router live

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.740 
to carve that out he used a router live
it<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:42.930> not<00:01:43.080> yep<00:01:43.290> yep<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.570> then

long and it a big dent and so I had to

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.380 
long and it a big dent and so I had to
rewrite<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.220> blades<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.790> had<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.000> pull<00:04:32.240> the

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
when I got it back it was a frame and a

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.360 
when I got it back it was a frame and a
