00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.440 

so<00:00:17.710> first<00:00:17.950> if<00:00:18.130> you<00:00:18.250> judge<00:00:18.490> an<00:00:18.640> activity<00:00:19.060> by<00:00:19.240> how

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
so first if you judge an activity by how

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.900 
so first if you judge an activity by how
long<00:00:19.720> it<00:00:20.020> keeps<00:00:20.290> your<00:00:20.500> kids<00:00:20.710> occupied<00:00:21.070> these

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
long it keeps your kids occupied these

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.540 
long it keeps your kids occupied these
ice<00:00:22.150> box<00:00:22.420> were<00:00:22.630> a<00:00:22.690> huge<00:00:23.200> winner<00:00:23.770> all<00:00:24.190> you<00:00:24.369> need

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
ice box were a huge winner all you need

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.609 
ice box were a huge winner all you need
is<00:00:24.700> a<00:00:24.730> bin<00:00:25.060> toys<00:00:25.720> that<00:00:25.900> can<00:00:26.050> get<00:00:26.170> wet<00:00:26.349> and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
is a bin toys that can get wet and

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.560 
is a bin toys that can get wet and
colored<00:00:27.040> liquid<00:00:27.400> I<00:00:27.640> wanted<00:00:28.210> to<00:00:28.300> do<00:00:28.390> it<00:00:28.510> in

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
colored liquid I wanted to do it in

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.240 
colored liquid I wanted to do it in
layers<00:00:28.810> so<00:00:29.050> that<00:00:29.080> the<00:00:29.290> toys<00:00:29.500> were<00:00:29.800> dispersed

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
layers so that the toys were dispersed

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.280 
layers so that the toys were dispersed
and<00:00:30.460> I<00:00:30.520> could<00:00:30.700> get<00:00:30.849> a<00:00:30.880> little<00:00:31.150> color<00:00:31.390> radiation

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
and I could get a little color radiation

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.520 
and I could get a little color radiation
so<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.040> started<00:00:33.400> with<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:33.610> clear<00:00:33.910> bottom<00:00:34.530> let

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
so I started with a clear bottom let

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.979 
so I started with a clear bottom let
that<00:00:35.710> freeze<00:00:36.270> pour<00:00:37.270> cold<00:00:37.600> it's<00:00:37.840> very

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
that freeze pour cold it's very

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.210 
that freeze pour cold it's very
important<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.350> liquid<00:00:38.620> is<00:00:38.710> cold<00:00:38.949> trails

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
important that liquid is cold trails

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.460 
important that liquid is cold trails
that<00:00:39.370> will<00:00:39.489> crack<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.910> first<00:00:40.120> layer<00:00:40.330> and<00:00:40.840> you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
that will crack the first layer and you

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.229 
that will crack the first layer and you
keep<00:00:41.680> going<00:00:41.830> until<00:00:42.129> it's<00:00:42.430> done<00:00:42.610> now<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:42.970> have<00:00:43.090> to

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
keep going until it's done now I have to

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.820 
keep going until it's done now I have to
warn<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:43.480> it<00:00:43.750> takes<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:44.080> while<00:00:44.260> for<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.590> liquid

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
warn you it takes a while for a liquid

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.619 
warn you it takes a while for a liquid
of<00:00:44.949> this<00:00:45.070> volume<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.460> freeze<00:00:45.970> so<00:00:46.390> you'll<00:00:46.540> have

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
of this volume to freeze so you'll have

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.270 
of this volume to freeze so you'll have
to<00:00:46.780> start<00:00:46.960> this<00:00:47.110> tonight<00:00:47.379> before<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.890> gave<00:00:48.010> it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
to start this tonight before I gave it

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.009 
to start this tonight before I gave it
to<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.489> kids<00:00:48.729> with<00:00:48.909> a<00:00:48.970> few<00:00:49.239> tools<00:00:49.390> they

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
to the kids with a few tools they

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:56.160 
to the kids with a few tools they
started<00:00:50.379> with<00:00:50.530> brute<00:00:50.800> force<00:00:54.299> and<00:00:55.299> then<00:00:56.080> we

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
started with brute force and then we

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.430 
started with brute force and then we
tried<00:00:56.379> stalls<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.820> then<00:00:58.629> finally<00:00:59.080> figured

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
tried stalls and then finally figured

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.079 
tried stalls and then finally figured
out<00:00:59.559> that<00:00:59.799> heat<00:01:00.129> would<00:01:00.400> melt<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.729> ice<00:01:00.879> the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
out that heat would melt the ice the

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:13.200 
out that heat would melt the ice the
fastest<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:11.490> feel<00:01:12.490> like<00:01:12.670> they<00:01:12.790> learned<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:13.090> lot

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
fastest I feel like they learned a lot

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.609 
fastest I feel like they learned a lot
because<00:01:13.479> they<00:01:13.600> were<00:01:13.659> really<00:01:13.990> motivated<00:01:14.200> to

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
because they were really motivated to

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.340 
because they were really motivated to
get<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.860> toys<00:01:15.159> out<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.810> if<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:19.990> don't<00:01:20.200> have<00:01:20.320> a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
get the toys out and if you don't have a

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.719 
get the toys out and if you don't have a
lot<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.560> time<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.890> set<00:01:21.039> this<00:01:21.189> up<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.490> can<00:01:21.609> also

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
lot of time to set this up you can also

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.249 
lot of time to set this up you can also
do<00:01:21.969> something<00:01:22.180> more<00:01:22.420> simple<00:01:22.750> like<00:01:23.079> these

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
do something more simple like these

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.609 
do something more simple like these
really<00:01:23.680> cool<00:01:23.829> dinosaurs<00:01:25.049> next<00:01:26.049> we<00:01:26.170> tried<00:01:26.409> ice

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
really cool dinosaurs next we tried ice

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.499 
really cool dinosaurs next we tried ice
painting<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.219> this<00:01:27.310> was<00:01:27.460> surprisingly<00:01:28.210> not

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
painting and this was surprisingly not

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.690 
painting and this was surprisingly not
messy<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.049> my<00:01:29.140> kids<00:01:29.380> loved<00:01:29.649> it<00:01:29.829> all<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.520> need

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
messy and my kids loved it all you need

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.060 
messy and my kids loved it all you need
is<00:01:30.969> paint<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.869> ice<00:01:32.229> cube<00:01:32.560> tray<00:01:32.829> and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
is paint and ice cube tray and

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.740 
is paint and ice cube tray and
toothpicks<00:01:34.030> all<00:01:34.179> right<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.359> spin<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.600> few

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
toothpicks all right you spin a few

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.660 
toothpicks all right you spin a few
forks<00:01:35.109> and<00:01:35.380> then<00:01:35.649> it's<00:01:35.770> really<00:01:36.070> easy<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:36.640> just

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
forks and then it's really easy you just

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.190 
forks and then it's really easy you just
fill<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.149> containers<00:01:37.539> up<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.750> third<00:01:37.990> with

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
fill the containers up a third with

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.459 
fill the containers up a third with
paint<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:39.250> rest<00:01:39.429> water<00:01:39.759> stir<00:01:40.509> it<00:01:40.630> up<00:01:40.750> let<00:01:41.350> it

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
paint the rest water stir it up let it

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.410 
paint the rest water stir it up let it
freeze<00:01:41.740> for<00:01:42.070> about<00:01:42.100> two<00:01:42.429> hours<00:01:42.490> then<00:01:43.329> you

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
freeze for about two hours then you

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.969 
freeze for about two hours then you
stick<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.810> ice<00:01:43.929> fix<00:01:44.200> in<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.439> can<00:01:44.560> also<00:01:44.679> tape

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
stick the ice fix in you can also tape

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.230 
stick the ice fix in you can also tape
them<00:01:45.159> in<00:01:45.280> but<00:01:45.429> I<00:01:45.460> thought<00:01:45.579> this<00:01:45.759> was<00:01:45.939> easier

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
them in but I thought this was easier

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.940 
them in but I thought this was easier
let<00:01:46.780> them<00:01:46.899> freeze<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.259> rest<00:01:47.439> of<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.590> way<00:01:47.710> and

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
let them freeze the rest of the way and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.919 
let them freeze the rest of the way and
you're<00:01:48.100> ready<00:01:48.249> to<00:01:48.310> go<00:01:48.490> all<00:01:49.179> right<00:01:49.359> guys<00:01:49.600> let's

you're ready to go all right guys let's
see<00:01:50.049> how<00:01:50.109> these

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
see how these
