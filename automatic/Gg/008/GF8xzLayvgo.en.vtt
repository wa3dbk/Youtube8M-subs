00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.140
 I speak English, I'm Rodrigo, and today I 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.940
 I decided to leave some of the seats 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.010
 conventions to talk a little bit about a 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.360
 curious subject that has been well 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.950
 evident in some of the comments 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 my publications mainly when 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.600
 I do smartphone analysis for not 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.340
 have made it clear that some users do not 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.680
 accept some types of criticism 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.900
 they simply do not accept criticism they say 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.760
 that I'm exaggerating what I was the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.550
 only to speak what I am the king 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.679
 so I'm making those criticisms 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.540
 anything in the sense of 12 legitimates 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.370
 that clip I 'm making and I think 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.050
 that this is counter-intuitive because in the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 my head how it works and for what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.030
 I'll go there and use the device. 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.640
 and I say the things that I found cool that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.530
 can please other people and things 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.750
 which are not good also that can 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.120
 to annoy other people so that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.440
 make the best decision when it comes to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.000
 buy the cell phone but you can not 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430
 perceive that a large part of the public 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.530
 assists the analysis is made of people who 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.070
 already have the product in question and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.409
 cent basically to hear compliments to the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.500
 question what they did and then they 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.840
 offend critical comments or increase 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.060
 what i meant simply understood 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.189
 how to critique things that are not critical 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.200
 have been very clear for example and 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.200
 videos about handsets with windows phone 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 7 that an ecosystem lacks the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.460
 citizen to comment that this is an illusion 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.040
 Mine that I'm stuck in the past. 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 or what about other videos about 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.979
 I say that the device's battery 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.560
 it's not good 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.329
 every time I repeat, I do not know how to use the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 device I think it really 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.250
 Bizarre, it's like I have to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.590
 consider only the good points of everything and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.479
 When I'm going to talk about negative points, 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.899
 to create in story version 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.310
 cute to please that hide the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.909
 mistakes happen until they seem 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.040
 good but in actual psychology itself 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.259
 explains this and I will speak 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.360
 social discourse here grossly 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.729
 can be explained as follows when 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.990
 a person recognizes himself as part of a 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.450
 certain group 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.759
 she will not measure efforts to improve 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.160
 the image of this group because 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.330
 will consequently improve its own 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.770
 her image 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.840
 even though it is integral, it goes 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.400
 strengthen self-esteem there it 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.290
 including experiments that show that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.330
 any little thing with more beast than 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.490
 it is enough to make 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.440
 people are divided into groups if 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.790
 feel part of a group and opposed to 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.730
 other or other 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.130
 imagine you nexus smartphone are a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.230
 an important element of Argentina 's 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.930
 today I thought when the person 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.850
 feels fixed and a chuku when they say no 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.010
 case of smartphones when she likes 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.570
 much of the brand so it's fixed 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.550
 in that brand or when it simply 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.560
 There's no money to keep ringing the phone. 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.720
 every time it means she 's static 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.290
 beyond that group she will not measure 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.840
 efforts to praise it to improve 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.930
 image of him as I said before and this 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.430
 often involves criticism of what the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.530
 people call ezhou group wants to say 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.450
 who is out that I're madness 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.970
 talking this sort of thing in this video is 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.580
 but somehow I think it's valid because 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.950
 seems to me to explain well because some 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.720
 People just do not take points. 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.510
 do not accept comments 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.580
 critical to their smartphones, which are the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.680
 main topic 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.709
 I think of the guys anyway 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.140
 is understandable because in the 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.900
 analysis I think criticism is 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.450
 perhaps the most important point both for 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.670
 help people who want to buy 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.850
 so decide better how much you 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.070
 port to force businesses to 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.010
 software updates 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.730
 or maybe in upcoming versions of these 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.330
 gadgets 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.220
 mvp and that side of which often the 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.989
 criticisms are my personal opinion 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.489
 opinion of who is analyzing then 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.920
 How will you fight if you have 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.930
 another beauty you will not do 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.239
 nothing gets into a war of opinions 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.360
 because often the result 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.800
 aluna they went my 50 cents on 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.950
 this situation which for me has been 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.510
 great and the very striking seer who 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.310
 seems very curious 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.290
 but ultimately I wanted to leave here even 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.690
 this message that they relax at times 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.360
 people just think differently 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.940
 and that also does not make much sense to you 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.620
 nor accept criticism is sometimes worth 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.289
 sorry you stop to think and then it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.389
 makes sense and if you are satisfied 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.639
 with the device you have 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.830
 will not have analysis is something that will have 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.389
 a force to change what matters is the 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.889
 Your satisfaction, huh? 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.210
 but that's it in the video show staying for 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.710
 here you have enjoyed yourself 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.669
 liked click like I am 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.740
 first time here on the channel that 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.479
 write that accompanying the next 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.199

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.219

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.219
