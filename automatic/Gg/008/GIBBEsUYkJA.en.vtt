00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.670 
still instinctively thought that they
had<00:05:48.730> no<00:05:49.060> solution<00:05:49.720> to<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:49.870> anti-mage<00:05:50.290> once<00:05:50.560> he

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
had no solution to the anti-mage once he

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.950 
had no solution to the anti-mage once he
gets<00:05:50.830> his<00:05:50.950> Manta<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.430> it<00:05:52.150> seemed<00:05:52.420> like<00:05:52.570> right

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
gets his Manta and it seemed like right

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.660 
gets his Manta and it seemed like right
about<00:05:53.170> then<00:05:53.500> once<00:05:53.740> he<00:05:53.860> got<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.130> Manta<00:05:54.460> they

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
about then once he got the Manta they

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.700 
about then once he got the Manta they
did<00:05:55.630> they<00:05:55.720> just<00:05:55.840> kind<00:05:55.960> of<00:05:55.990> snowballed<00:05:56.260> for<00:05:56.650> the

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
did they just kind of snowballed for the

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.230 
did they just kind of snowballed for the
side<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:56.890> a<00:05:57.010> c9<00:05:57.340> obviously<00:05:57.820> it<00:05:57.880> wasn't<00:05:58.000> just

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
side of a c9 obviously it wasn't just

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.490 
side of a c9 obviously it wasn't just
the<00:05:58.390> anti-mage<00:05:58.690> there's<00:05:58.870> a<00:05:58.960> huge<00:05:59.110> problem

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
the anti-mage there's a huge problem

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.620 
the anti-mage there's a huge problem
like
