now<00:00:00.659> a<00:00:01.040> square<00:00:02.040> number<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.790> when<00:00:03.480> we<00:00:03.600> multiply

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
now a square number is when we multiply

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.760 
now a square number is when we multiply
a<00:00:04.200> number<00:00:04.589> by<00:00:04.830> itself<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:06.299> one<00:00:06.569> squared<00:00:07.049> would

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
a number by itself so one squared would

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:20.390 
a number by itself so one squared would
be<00:00:07.830> 1<00:00:11.059> times<00:00:13.700> 1<00:00:14.700> which<00:00:16.190> equals<00:00:17.840> 1<00:00:18.949> 2<00:00:19.949> squared

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
be 1 times 1 which equals 1 2 squared

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.960 

now<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.160> cube<00:02:35.610> numbers<00:02:36.060> are<00:02:37.670> very<00:02:38.670> very

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
now the cube numbers are very very

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.800 
now the cube numbers are very very
similar<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> square<00:02:40.290> numbers<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:42.360> cube

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
similar to the square numbers the cube

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.250 
similar to the square numbers the cube
numbers<00:02:43.290> are<00:02:43.590> when<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.190> times<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.060> number<00:02:45.480> by

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
numbers are when we times the number by

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.390 
numbers are when we times the number by
itself<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:51.080> then<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.230> times<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:53.330> again<00:02:54.330> so

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
itself and then we times it again so

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.630 
itself and then we times it again so
instead<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.460> having<00:02:56.610> 1<00:02:57.030> times<00:02:57.330> 1<00:02:57.570> you'd<00:02:58.170> have<00:02:58.350> 1

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
instead of having 1 times 1 you'd have 1

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:07.000 
instead of having 1 times 1 you'd have 1
times<00:02:59.640> 1<00:02:59.910> times<00:03:00.210> 1<00:03:01.110> which<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:02.630> 1<00:03:04.070> 2<00:03:05.070> would<00:03:05.880> be<00:03:05.910> 2

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
times 1 times 1 which is 1 2 would be 2

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:21.330 
times 1 times 1 which is 1 2 would be 2
times<00:03:08.010> 2<00:03:09.260> times<00:03:11.060> 2<00:03:12.060> which<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:13.970> 8

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.320 

then<00:03:21.940> 3q<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.870> be<00:03:22.989> 3<00:03:23.260> times<00:03:23.440> 3<00:03:23.560> times<00:03:23.860> 3<00:03:24.300> which<00:03:25.300> is

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
then 3q to be 3 times 3 times 3 which is

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.890 
then 3q to be 3 times 3 times 3 which is
27<00:03:28.080> 4<00:03:29.080> cubed<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.920> 4<00:03:30.370> times<00:03:30.610> 4<00:03:30.879> times<00:03:30.910> 4<00:03:31.530> which<00:03:32.530> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
27 4 cubed is 4 times 4 times 4 which is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.770 
27 4 cubed is 4 times 4 times 4 which is
64<00:03:35.430> 5<00:03:36.430> cubed<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.090> 5<00:03:37.330> times<00:03:37.660> 5<00:03:37.870> times<00:03:37.930> 5<00:03:38.400> which<00:03:39.400> is

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
64 5 cubed is 5 times 5 times 5 which is

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.890 
64 5 cubed is 5 times 5 times 5 which is
125<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.530> 10<00:03:42.340> cubed<00:03:42.670> is<00:03:42.819> 10<00:03:43.060> times<00:03:43.269> 10<00:03:43.390> times<00:03:43.569> 10

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
125 and 10 cubed is 10 times 10 times 10

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.940 
125 and 10 cubed is 10 times 10 times 10
which<00:03:44.860> is<00:03:46.590> 1000<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:48.120> those<00:03:49.120> are<00:03:49.480> called<00:03:49.959> the

which is 1000 and those are called the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:04.650 
which is 1000 and those are called the
cube<00:03:56.040> numbers

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.729 

so

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.800 

the<00:04:08.340> cube<00:04:08.670> numbers<00:04:09.120> are<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:11.340> answer<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.450> doing

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
recognize the square numbers up till 12

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.790 
recognize the square numbers up till 12
and<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.410> cube<00:04:37.680> numbers<00:04:38.100> 1<00:04:38.310> 2<00:04:38.460> 5<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:38.970> 10<00:04:39.800> the

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
and the cube numbers 1 2 5 and 10 the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.570 
and the cube numbers 1 2 5 and 10 the
opposite<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:42.840> doing<00:04:43.199> a<00:04:43.590> squares<00:04:44.100> called<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
opposite of doing a squares called the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.490 
opposite of doing a squares called the
square<00:04:44.910> root<00:04:45.120> 2<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.389> square<00:04:45.660> root<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:45.930> 1<00:04:46.169> would

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
square root 2 the square root of 1 would

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.140 
square root 2 the square root of 1 would
get<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.740> back<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.100> one<00:04:47.250> square<00:04:47.610> root<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:47.910> 4

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
get you back to one square root of 4

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.520 
get you back to one square root of 4
would<00:04:48.330> get<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.570> back<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.870> force<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:49.260> tells

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
would get you back to force that tells

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.250 
would get you back to force that tells
me<00:04:49.710> how<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:49.919> would<00:04:50.160> get<00:04:50.340> from<00:04:50.460> this<00:04:50.669> 9<00:04:51.000> back<00:04:51.990> to

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
me how you would get from this 9 back to

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.520 
me how you would get from this 9 back to
this<00:04:52.410> 3<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.789> cube<00:04:54.120> roots<00:04:54.419> are<00:04:54.990> exactly<00:04:55.410> as

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
this 3 and the cube roots are exactly as

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.330 
this 3 and the cube roots are exactly as
soon<00:04:55.710> as<00:04:55.830> well<00:04:56.010> so<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.940> cube<00:04:57.210> root<00:04:57.389> of<00:04:57.510> 125

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
soon as well so the cube root of 125

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.820 
soon as well so the cube root of 125
would<00:04:59.340> be<00:04:59.520> 5
