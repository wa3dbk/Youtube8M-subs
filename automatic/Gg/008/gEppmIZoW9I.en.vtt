00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
awesome this might be because i'm in the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000 
awesome this might be because i'm in the
age<00:00:26.580> where<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.300> should<00:00:28.109> appreciate<00:00:28.410> stuff<00:00:28.890> like

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
age where I should appreciate stuff like

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.519 
age where I should appreciate stuff like
this<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.400> basically<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> old<00:00:30.720> RPG

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this and basically it's the old RPG

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.940 
this and basically it's the old RPG
style<00:00:32.420> creep<00:00:33.420> health<00:00:33.809> bar<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.860> if

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
style creep health bar so I think so if
