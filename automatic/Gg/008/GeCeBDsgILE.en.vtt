merchant<00:02:21.510> race<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.020> then<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.800> i'll<00:02:22.950> include

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280

other stuff like GTA and rally races etc

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.030 
other stuff like GTA and rally races etc
etc<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.690> those<00:02:27.989> that's<00:02:28.590> quite<00:02:28.770> standard

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
etc so those that's quite standard

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.250

flight school missions because I did

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.440

feel<00:02:37.770> they<00:02:38.340> were<00:02:38.400> quite<00:02:38.819> limited

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
feel they were quite limited

feel they were quite limited
destinations<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.709> quite<00:02:41.250> like<00:02:41.459> then<00:02:41.640> they<00:02:41.760> were

then flight school missions I thought it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.760 
then flight school missions I thought it
was

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770

new missions of new flight school
missions<00:04:51.270> were<00:04:51.660> there<00:04:51.900> because<00:04:52.410> of<00:04:52.800> new

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
missions were there because of new

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.460

helicopters new planes coming in that

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.200 
helicopters new planes coming in that
would<00:04:55.620> make<00:04:55.800> quite<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.100> better<00:04:56.340> sense<00:04:56.610> ashicus

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
would make quite a better sense ashicus

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.000

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
obviously we do know there is a new

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.070 
obviously we do know there is a new
plane<00:04:59.310> coming<00:04:59.550> in

the<00:05:00.259> business<00:05:00.710> DLC<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:01.909> that<00:05:02.479> may<00:05:02.659> be<00:05:02.689> part<00:05:02.990> of

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
the business DLC so that may be part of

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.649 
the business DLC so that may be part of
it<00:05:03.349> I<00:05:03.560> I<00:05:04.340> think<00:05:05.030> it's<00:05:05.120> got<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.240> good<00:05:05.389> thing<00:05:05.449> going

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
it I I think it's got a good thing going

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.879 
it I I think it's got a good thing going
that<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.110> think<00:05:06.379> there<00:05:06.500> might<00:05:06.560> be<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.770> huge<00:05:07.729> new

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
that I think there might be a huge new

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.679 
that I think there might be a huge new
array<00:05:09.889> of<00:05:09.919> planes<00:05:10.340> coming<00:05:10.639> in<00:05:10.819> or<00:05:11.090> helicopters

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:11.689 
array of planes coming in or helicopters

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.450

coming<00:05:11.900> in<00:05:12.080> or<00:05:12.259> something<00:05:13.039> like<00:05:13.159> that<00:05:13.219> that

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
coming in or something like that that

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.490 
coming in or something like that that
requires<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.479> significant<00:05:15.199> amount<00:05:15.379> of

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
requires a significant amount of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.679 
requires a significant amount of
training<00:05:15.740> obviously<00:05:16.310> did<00:05:16.819> talk<00:05:17.030> about<00:05:17.060> the

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:17.689 
training obviously did talk about the

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.570 
training obviously did talk about the
hunter<00:05:18.080> from<00:05:18.259> GTA<00:05:18.620> san<00:05:18.830> andreas<00:05:18.860> as<00:05:19.340> well

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
hunter from GTA san andreas as well

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.770 
hunter from GTA san andreas as well
which<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:20.810> got<00:05:20.990> forget<00:05:21.650> in<00:05:21.770> like<00:05:22.419> top<00:05:23.419> level

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
which you got forget in like top level

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.020 
which you got forget in like top level
on<00:05:23.900> all<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.379> flight<00:05:25.219> school<00:05:25.490> missions<00:05:25.520> in

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
on all of the flight school missions in

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.240 
on all of the flight school missions in
GTA<00:05:26.360> san<00:05:26.569> andreas<00:05:26.599> so<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.590> think<00:05:27.740> if<00:05:28.129> you

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
GTA san andreas so I think if you

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.820 
GTA san andreas so I think if you
complete<00:05:28.759> all<00:05:28.969> of<00:05:29.090> them<00:05:29.539> and<00:05:29.780> get<00:05:29.930> gold<00:05:30.259> then

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
complete all of them and get gold then

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.379 
complete all of them and get gold then
you<00:05:30.979> will<00:05:31.189> get<00:05:31.340> this<00:05:31.400> home<00:05:31.729> to<00:05:31.879> helicopter

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
you will get this home to helicopter

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.209 
you will get this home to helicopter
from<00:05:32.449> GTA<00:05:32.840> san<00:05:33.020> andreas<00:05:33.050> obviously<00:05:34.009> we<00:05:34.069> all

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
from GTA san andreas obviously we all

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:35.619 
from GTA san andreas obviously we all
remember<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.610> Haunter<00:05:34.879> helicopter<00:05:35.389> if<00:05:35.509> you

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
remember the Haunter helicopter if you

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.200 
remember the Haunter helicopter if you
played<00:05:35.900> GTA<00:05:36.319> san<00:05:36.620> andreas<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:37.430> was<00:05:37.789> pretty

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
played GTA san andreas it was pretty

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.839 
played GTA san andreas it was pretty
much<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.599> greatest<00:05:38.719> helicopter<00:05:39.710> in<00:05:39.889> any<00:05:40.250> GTA

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
much the greatest helicopter in any GTA

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.119 
much the greatest helicopter in any GTA
ever<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:41.960> hopefully<00:05:42.379> they<00:05:42.500> do<00:05:42.620> bring<00:05:42.800> that<00:05:42.979> ink

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129 
ever so hopefully they do bring that ink

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.850 
ever so hopefully they do bring that ink
is<00:05:43.280> that<00:05:43.460> would<00:05:43.669> be<00:05:43.849> pretty<00:05:44.150> epic<00:05:44.360> as<00:05:44.990> isn't

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
is that would be pretty epic as isn't

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.890 
is that would be pretty epic as isn't
all<00:05:45.979> there<00:05:46.520> isn't<00:05:46.909> a<00:05:47.000> really<00:05:47.330> good<00:05:47.659> helicopter

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
all there isn't a really good helicopter

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.110 
all there isn't a really good helicopter
out<00:05:48.349> there<00:05:48.650> there's<00:05:48.889> the<00:05:48.949> Buzzard<00:05:49.400> but<00:05:49.940> that's

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
out there there's the Buzzard but that's

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.309 
out there there's the Buzzard but that's
just<00:05:50.210> you<00:05:50.509> know<00:05:50.629> I<00:05:50.810> mean<00:05:50.960> we've<00:05:51.080> had<00:05:51.229> the

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
just you know I mean we've had the

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.430 
just you know I mean we've had the
Buzzard<00:05:51.620> in<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:52.090> GTA<00:05:53.090> 4<00:05:53.449> and<00:05:53.750> it's<00:05:54.139> just<00:05:54.289> not

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
Buzzard in the GTA 4 and it's just not

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.409 
Buzzard in the GTA 4 and it's just not
it's<00:05:54.710> not<00:05:54.889> the<00:05:54.979> greatest<00:05:55.219> of<00:05:55.430> things<00:05:55.669> and

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
it's not the greatest of things and

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.450 
it's not the greatest of things and
obviously<00:05:56.810> then<00:05:56.990> we've<00:05:57.139> got<00:05:57.169> the<00:05:57.919> Annihilator

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
obviously then we've got the Annihilator

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.540 
obviously then we've got the Annihilator
which<00:05:58.819> is<00:05:59.270> just<00:05:59.979> explosive<00:06:00.979> rounds<00:06:01.400> which

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
which is just explosive rounds which

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.300 
which is just explosive rounds which
isn't<00:06:01.819> too<00:06:02.000> great<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.500> haanta<00:06:04.159> though

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
isn't too great the the haanta though

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.219 
isn't too great the the haanta though
was<00:06:04.460> an<00:06:04.580> extremely<00:06:04.879> fast<00:06:05.300> helicopter<00:06:06.110> that

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
was an extremely fast helicopter that

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.170 
was an extremely fast helicopter that
had<00:06:06.440> explosive<00:06:06.979> rounds<00:06:07.370> and<00:06:07.729> lockets

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.730 
had explosive rounds and lockets
everything<00:06:08.599> and<00:06:08.779> that<00:06:08.810> would<00:06:09.080> be<00:06:09.289> great<00:06:09.529> if<00:06:09.650> to

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
everything and that would be great if to

Rockstar have a ton of stuff planned
obviously<00:06:26.990> like<00:06:27.110> I<00:06:27.139> said<00:06:27.409> this<00:06:27.560> and<00:06:27.710> more<00:06:28.190> it's

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
obviously like I said this and more it's

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.519 
obviously like I said this and more it's
I<00:06:28.940> reckon<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.659> know<00:06:29.750> rockstar<00:06:30.259> I've<00:06:30.349> got<00:06:30.500> a

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:30.529 
I reckon you know rockstar I've got a

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:33.339 
I reckon you know rockstar I've got a
whole<00:06:30.770> lot<00:06:31.039> line<00:06:31.729> of<00:06:31.909> story<00:06:32.360> whole<00:06:33.050> line<00:06:33.319> of

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
whole lot line of story whole line of

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.189 
whole lot line of story whole line of
additional<00:06:34.069> content<00:06:34.550> up<00:06:35.029> for<00:06:35.509> GTA<00:06:35.839> 5

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
additional content up for GTA 5

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.709 
additional content up for GTA 5
throughout<00:06:37.129> the<00:06:37.279> next<00:06:37.460> year<00:06:38.089> maybe<00:06:38.360> two<00:06:38.690> years

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
throughout the next year maybe two years

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:40.450 
throughout the next year maybe two years
obviously<00:06:39.259> because<00:06:39.440> a<00:06:39.469> GTA<00:06:39.800> only<00:06:40.129> comes<00:06:40.310> out

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
obviously because a GTA only comes out

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.149 
obviously because a GTA only comes out
around<00:06:40.849> every<00:06:41.180> five<00:06:41.389> years<00:06:41.659> so<00:06:42.289> having<00:06:42.620> DLC

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
around every five years so having DLC

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.790 
around every five years so having DLC
come<00:06:43.370> out<00:06:43.520> to<00:06:43.969> the<00:06:44.089> next<00:06:44.360> year<00:06:44.599> two<00:06:45.050> years<00:06:45.319> with

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
come out to the next year two years with

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.320 
come out to the next year two years with
perfectly<00:06:46.250> reasonable<00:06:46.759> even<00:06:47.060> if<00:06:47.150> it<00:06:47.240> does

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
perfectly reasonable even if it does

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.180 
perfectly reasonable even if it does
come<00:06:47.360> out<00:06:47.599> on<00:06:47.839> next<00:06:48.199> generation<00:06:48.379> which<00:06:48.740> I<00:06:48.889> hope

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
come out on next generation which I hope

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.269 
come out on next generation which I hope
it<00:06:49.400> does<00:06:49.550> personally<00:06:50.180> I'd<00:06:50.810> love<00:06:50.990> to<00:06:51.110> see<00:06:51.289> the

it does personally I'd love to see the
increased<00:06:52.849> graphics<00:06:53.270> and<00:06:53.419> obviously<00:06:53.719> been

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
increased graphics and obviously been

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.689 
increased graphics and obviously been
able<00:06:54.259> to<00:06:54.440> play<00:06:54.529> this<00:06:54.620> on<00:06:54.800> next-gen<00:06:55.310> rather
