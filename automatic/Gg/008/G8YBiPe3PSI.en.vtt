00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
majority the parson here are ok so a few

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.810 
majority the parson here are ok so a few
of<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.860> parts<00:00:39.160> that<00:00:39.250> do<00:00:39.489> need<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.700> get

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
of the parts that do need to get

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.510 
of the parts that do need to get
replaced<00:00:40.239> such<00:00:40.450> as<00:00:40.600> memory<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:42.370> it's

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
replaced such as memory and that it's

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.250 
replaced such as memory and that it's
not<00:00:42.610> that<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.940> memory<00:00:43.210> is<00:00:43.329> bad<00:00:43.600> just<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:44.170> it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
not that the memory is bad just that it

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.310 
not that the memory is bad just that it
needs<00:00:44.469> to<00:00:44.620> be<00:00:44.739> upgraded<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.969> there's<00:00:46.780> really

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
needs to be upgraded so there's really

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.740 
needs to be upgraded so there's really
really<00:00:47.890> no<00:00:48.100> reason<00:00:48.399> to<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:49.180> just<00:00:49.210> get<00:00:49.570> rid<00:00:49.660> of

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
really no reason to to just get rid of

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.180 
really no reason to to just get rid of
this<00:00:49.870> computer<00:00:50.289> just<00:00:50.410> because<00:00:50.620> it's<00:00:50.829> it's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
this computer just because it's it's

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.400 
this computer just because it's it's
getting<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.579> little<00:00:51.730> old<00:00:52.020> spinning<00:00:53.020> them<00:00:53.109> for

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
getting a little old spinning them for

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.180 
getting a little old spinning them for
1.2<00:00:54.340> or<00:00:54.730> so<00:00:54.969> gigahertz<00:00:55.300> processor<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.620> once

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
1.2 or so gigahertz processor and once

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.500 
1.2 or so gigahertz processor and once
this<00:00:57.280> thing<00:00:57.340> is<00:00:57.609> up<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:57.910> running<00:00:58.090> this<00:00:58.359> thing

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
this thing is up and running this thing

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.610 
this thing is up and running this thing
could<00:00:58.719> even<00:00:58.899> run<00:00:59.640> windows<00:01:00.640> 7<00:01:01.210> however<00:01:01.620> right

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
could even run windows 7 however right

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.260 
could even run windows 7 however right
now<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:02.920> runs<00:01:03.039> windows<00:01:03.250> vista<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:06.270> don't

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
now it runs windows vista I don't

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.990 
now it runs windows vista I don't
recommend<00:01:07.570> using<00:01:07.990> this<00:01:08.260> town<00:01:08.500> an<00:01:08.650> old<00:01:08.800> machine

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
recommend using this town an old machine

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360 
recommend using this town an old machine
or<00:01:10.000> Windows<00:01:10.510> 7<00:01:10.840> just<00:01:10.990> because<00:01:11.320> those<00:01:12.130> new

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
or Windows 7 just because those new

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.670 
or Windows 7 just because those new
operating<00:01:12.730> systems<00:01:13.120> are<00:01:13.270> just<00:01:13.630> really<00:01:14.440> am<00:01:14.530> not

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
operating systems are just really am not

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.050 
operating systems are just really am not
compatible<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:16.450> these<00:01:17.350> older<00:01:18.060> computers

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
compatible with these older computers

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.060 
compatible with these older computers
but<00:01:19.420> it'll<00:01:19.990> work<00:01:22.410> so<00:01:23.410> what<00:01:23.560> I've<00:01:23.680> been<00:01:23.890> doing

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
try to solder them they don't sound are

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.360 
try to solder them they don't sound are
very<00:02:31.060> good<00:02:31.270> so<00:02:31.890> that's<00:02:32.890> going<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.190> be<00:02:33.310> an

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.000 
and when i was playing with this earlier
this<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.690> drop-down<00:04:05.260> door<00:04:05.530> in<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:05.890> back

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
this is the drop-down door in the back

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.680 
this is the drop-down door in the back
I'm<00:04:06.400> surprised<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.850> is<00:04:07.030> still<00:04:07.210> on<00:04:07.360> here

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.590 

a<00:04:11.260> lot<00:04:11.770> of<00:04:11.800> times<00:04:11.980> these<00:04:12.280> just<00:04:12.520> break<00:04:12.760> off<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.300> I

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
a lot of times these just break off so I

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.100 
a lot of times these just break off so I
may<00:04:14.050> end<00:04:14.620> up<00:04:14.800> popping<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.520> off<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:15.959> keeping<00:04:16.959> it

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
may end up popping it off and keeping it

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.600 
may end up popping it off and keeping it
just<00:04:17.500> because<00:04:17.739> it's<00:04:17.950> still<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.459> good<00:04:18.549> shape

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
just because it's still in good shape

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.570 
just because it's still in good shape
but<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.600> got<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.989> ethernet<00:04:20.769> connector<00:04:21.280> over

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
but you got the ethernet connector over

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.200 
but you got the ethernet connector over
there<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.120> then<00:04:22.240> we<00:04:22.330> have<00:04:22.630> your<00:04:23.050> USBs<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.880> get

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
there and then we have your USBs you get

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.690 
there and then we have your USBs you get
the<00:04:25.450> video<00:04:25.600> out<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.590> got<00:04:26.800> your<00:04:27.010> parallel<00:04:27.370> port

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
the video out you got your parallel port

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.760 
the video out you got your parallel port
for<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> printer<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.900> course<00:04:29.140> your<00:04:29.350> monitor

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
for a printer and of course your monitor

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.980 
for a printer and of course your monitor
there<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.100> no<00:04:30.250> serial<00:04:30.730> on<00:04:30.940> here<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.390> of<00:04:31.960> course
