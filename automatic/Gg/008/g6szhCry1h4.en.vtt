00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
little find but I don't know I mean I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.999 
little find but I don't know I mean I
haven't<00:01:44.250> looked<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.540> into<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.110> but

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.800 
I guess this riedel book and these two
go<00:01:51.180> together<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.490> makes<00:01:53.810> organizing
