spent a lot of time on the grass but he

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.670 
spent a lot of time on the grass but he
was<00:00:58.489> fast<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:59.059> think<00:00:59.780> working<00:01:00.050> with<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.410> stones

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
was fast I think working with the stones

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.740 
was fast I think working with the stones
they've<00:01:01.129> sort<00:01:01.370> of<00:01:01.430> discipline<00:01:01.910> he's<00:01:02.270> driving

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750

they've sort of discipline he's driving
style<00:01:03.020> and<00:01:03.140> now<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:03.829> know<00:01:03.890> he's<00:01:04.070> pretty<00:01:04.280> close

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
style and now you know he's pretty close

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.730 
style and now you know he's pretty close
to<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.640> complete<00:01:05.000> driver<00:01:05.300> when<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.350> reasons

dietitians<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.470> really<00:01:42.649> got<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.860> do<00:01:42.950> all<00:01:42.979> that

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
dietitians you really got to do all that

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.059 
dietitians you really got to do all that
yourself<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.349> you<00:01:45.349> know<00:01:45.440> who<00:01:45.590> knows<00:01:45.649> what's

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
yourself so you know who knows what's

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.460 
yourself so you know who knows what's
going<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.399> in<00:01:46.580> Shane<00:01:46.819> van<00:01:47.119> Gisbergen<00:01:47.750> head<00:01:48.080> but

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
going on in Shane van Gisbergen head but

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.350 
going on in Shane van Gisbergen head but
it's<00:01:49.069> obvious<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.670> he<00:01:49.789> needs<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.060> get<00:01:50.239> away

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
it's obvious that he needs to get away

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.359 
it's obvious that he needs to get away
from<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.750> recharge<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.470> batteries<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.160> I

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
from it recharge the batteries and I

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.729 
from it recharge the batteries and I
reckon<00:01:52.700> will<00:01:52.819> seem<00:01:53.030> back<00:01:53.349> maybe<00:01:54.349> a<00:01:54.500> couple

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:54.739 
reckon will seem back maybe a couple

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.290 
reckon will seem back maybe a couple
years<00:01:55.039> but<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.429> know<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.759> loss<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.209> the

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
years but you know it is a loss to the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.729 
years but you know it is a loss to the
support<00:01:56.660> but<00:01:56.780> I'm<00:01:56.869> not<00:01:57.020> surprised<00:01:57.410> with<00:01:57.649> the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
support but I'm not surprised with the

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.050 
support but I'm not surprised with the
reasons<00:01:58.099> and<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.489> course<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.910> know<00:01:59.000> he

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
reasons and of course you know he

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.880 
reasons and of course you know he

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
experience such other demands yeah it

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.650 
experience such other demands yeah it
force<00:02:18.410> it's<00:02:18.860> actually<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.459> lot<00:02:19.760> more<00:02:20.090> like

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
force it's actually a lot more like

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.360 
force it's actually a lot more like
Formula<00:02:21.080> One<00:02:21.230> now<00:02:21.440> where<00:02:21.680> they<00:02:21.830> say<00:02:22.010> your<00:02:22.220> age

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
Formula One now where they say your age

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.220 
Formula One now where they say your age
you<00:02:22.730> know<00:02:22.819> ten<00:02:23.090> years<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.540> every<00:02:23.750> five<00:02:23.930> in

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
you know ten years and every five in

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.520 
you know ten years and every five in
Formula<00:02:24.590> One<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:24.740> think<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.840> complete<00:02:27.200> driver

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
Formula One I think the complete driver

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.320 
Formula One I think the complete driver
needs<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.040> be<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> lot<00:02:28.430> different<00:02:28.460> and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
needs to be a lot different and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.270 
needs to be a lot different and
it<00:02:29.630> suits<00:02:30.110> some<00:02:30.380> people<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.890> perhaps<00:02:31.100> a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
it suits some people that perhaps a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.650 
it suits some people that perhaps a
little<00:02:31.370> bit<00:02:31.610> more<00:02:31.730> disciplined<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.480> can

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
little bit more disciplined that can

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.330 
little bit more disciplined that can
sort<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:32.990> put<00:02:33.260> up<00:02:33.410> with<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:34.010> know<00:02:34.070> dust

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
sort of put up with it and you know dust

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.920 
sort of put up with it and you know dust
it<00:02:34.490> off<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.760> shoulders<00:02:35.150> someone<00:02:35.780> that's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
it off the shoulders someone that's

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.420 
it off the shoulders someone that's
perhaps<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.230> little<00:02:36.320> bit<00:02:36.530> more<00:02:36.680> sensitive<00:02:37.070> or

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
perhaps a little bit more sensitive or

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.890 
perhaps a little bit more sensitive or
as<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.670> say<00:02:37.820> younger<00:02:38.210> like<00:02:38.360> he<00:02:38.510> was<00:02:38.660> when<00:02:38.840> he

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
as you say younger like he was when he

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.990 
as you say younger like he was when he
came<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:40.310> know<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.460> think<00:02:40.520> it's<00:02:40.820> pretty

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
came in you know I think it's pretty

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.820 
came in you know I think it's pretty
challenging<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.810> look<00:02:42.170> at<00:02:42.290> him<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.470> Scott

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
challenging and I look at him and Scott

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.260 
challenging and I look at him and Scott

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
got big futures you know whether he

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.520 
got big futures you know whether he
races<00:02:47.240> in<00:02:47.390> New<00:02:47.540> Zealand<00:02:47.900> or<00:02:47.960> not<00:02:48.110> I'm<00:02:48.230> not<00:02:48.260> sure

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
was definitely I think he's obviously

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.490 
was definitely I think he's obviously
one<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.600> younger<00:03:38.840> blokes<00:03:39.050> in<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.290> field

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
one of the younger blokes in the field

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.620 
one of the younger blokes in the field
and<00:03:39.739> he's<00:03:40.550> achieved<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.030> much<00:03:41.060> already<00:03:41.480> and

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
and he's achieved so much already and

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.470 
and he's achieved so much already and
obviously<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:43.160> everyone<00:03:43.610> obviously<00:03:43.820> expects

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
obviously and everyone obviously expects

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.590 
obviously and everyone obviously expects
him<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.870> continue<00:03:45.380> on<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.800> rise<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:47.180> guess

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
him to continue on that rise so I guess

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.440 
him to continue on that rise so I guess
to<00:03:48.050> say<00:03:48.230> young<00:03:48.500> bloke<00:03:48.820> obviously<00:03:49.820> he<00:03:49.880> wants<00:03:50.300> to

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
to say young bloke obviously he wants to

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.030 
to say young bloke obviously he wants to
leave<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.810> sport<00:03:51.080> at<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.380> stage<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.890> it's

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
leave the sport at this stage and it's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.160 
leave the sport at this stage and it's
it's<00:03:52.459> disappointing<00:03:52.970> but<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.690> mean<00:03:53.989> he

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
it's disappointing but I mean he

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.840 
it's disappointing but I mean he
obviously<00:03:54.230> has<00:03:54.590> his<00:03:54.709> own<00:03:54.860> reasons<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.519> you

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850
