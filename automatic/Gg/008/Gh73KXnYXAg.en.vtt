like you can taste it ice and I feel
like<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.390> hot<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:18.869> dissolves

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
like when it's hot it just dissolves

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
like when it's hot it just dissolves
into<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> milk<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.700> can't<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.030> taste

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
into the milk and you can't really taste

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.600 
into the milk and you can't really taste
the<00:01:21.390> coffee<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.650> iced<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.369> one

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the coffee but when it's iced this one

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.530 
the coffee but when it's iced this one
is<00:01:23.840> amazing<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.740> sweetness<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
is amazing because the sweetness of the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.060 
is amazing because the sweetness of the
coffee<00:01:27.540> doesn't<00:01:27.960> overpower<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.740> coffee<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
coffee doesn't overpower the coffee you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
coffee doesn't overpower the coffee you
can<00:01:29.280> still<00:01:29.520> taste<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.030> coffee<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
can still taste the coffee in it and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.870 
can still taste the coffee in it and
that's<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> love<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.310> any<00:01:32.520> type<00:01:32.850> of

you<00:04:28.110> don't<00:04:28.259> like<00:04:28.409> peppermint<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:29.009> can<00:04:29.129> always

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
you don't like peppermint you can always

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.670 
you don't like peppermint you can always
try<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.580> green<00:04:29.849> tea<00:04:30.030> latte<00:04:30.180> but<00:04:30.650> personally<00:04:31.650> I

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
try the green tea latte but personally I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.800 
try the green tea latte but personally I
think<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.370> peppermint<00:04:32.819> is<00:04:32.970> what<00:04:33.120> makes<00:04:33.569> it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
think the peppermint is what makes it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.959 
think the peppermint is what makes it
the<00:04:33.870> drink<00:04:34.289> because<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.979> regular<00:04:35.550> green<00:04:35.789> tea

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:35.969 
the drink because the regular green tea

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.779 
the drink because the regular green tea
latte<00:04:36.120> isn't<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.900> like<00:04:37.770> appetizing<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.669> me<00:04:38.699> I
