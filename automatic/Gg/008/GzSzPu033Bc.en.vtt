it<00:00:23.570> might<00:00:23.720> be<00:00:23.869> a<00:00:23.899> little<00:00:24.140> bit<00:00:24.320> darker<00:00:24.529> from<00:00:25.009> a

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
it might be a little bit darker from a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.729 
it might be a little bit darker from a
Squatch<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:25.520> I<00:00:25.579> saw<00:00:25.730> online<00:00:25.939> but<00:00:26.529> it's<00:00:27.529> not
