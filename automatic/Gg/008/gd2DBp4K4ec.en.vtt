here's<00:00:01.650> something<00:00:02.010> you've<00:00:02.100> probably<00:00:02.340> never

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
here's something you've probably never

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.820 
here's something you've probably never
seen<00:00:03.030> before<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> driveway<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.680> know

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
seen before this is a driveway I know

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.230 
seen before this is a driveway I know
you've<00:00:05.040> seen<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.250> driveway<00:00:05.730> but<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.210> a

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
you've seen a driveway but this is a

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.059 
you've seen a driveway but this is a
very<00:00:06.480> special<00:00:06.720> driveway<00:00:07.259> made<00:00:07.740> out<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.010> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
very special driveway made out of a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.089 
very special driveway made out of a
material<00:00:08.189> called<00:00:09.000> pervious<00:00:09.540> concrete

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
material called pervious concrete

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.770 
material called pervious concrete
pervious<00:00:11.099> concrete<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.269> regular

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
pervious concrete is just like regular

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.620 
pervious concrete is just like regular
concrete<00:00:13.019> -<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.950> sand<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.969> other<00:00:15.120> words<00:00:15.389> it's

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
concrete - the sand in other words it's

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.710 
concrete - the sand in other words it's
got<00:00:16.520> Portland<00:00:17.520> cement<00:00:17.880> holding<00:00:18.570> together

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
got Portland cement holding together

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
got Portland cement holding together
particles<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.770> aggregate<00:00:20.220> which<00:00:20.369> is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
particles of aggregate which is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.269 
particles of aggregate which is
basically<00:00:20.970> little<00:00:21.150> pieces<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.630> crush<00:00:21.960> rock<00:00:22.279> no

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
basically little pieces of crush rock no

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.550 
basically little pieces of crush rock no
sand<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.910> sand<00:00:24.150> normally<00:00:24.779> fills<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
sand the sand normally fills in the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.310 
sand the sand normally fills in the
interstices<00:00:25.920> between<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.240> rocks<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.900> causes

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
interstices between the rocks and causes

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.919 
interstices between the rocks and causes
the<00:00:28.920> surface<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.939> impervious<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.599> water

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the surface to be impervious to water

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.590 
the surface to be impervious to water
this<00:00:31.800> allows<00:00:32.160> water<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.640> soak<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.360> kind

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
this allows water to soak in it's kind

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.650 
this allows water to soak in it's kind
of<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> rice<00:00:34.260> cake<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> little

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
of like a rice cake and all the little

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840 
of like a rice cake and all the little
pieces<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.350> voids<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.219> between<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
pieces have voids in between and the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.729 
pieces have voids in between and the
water<00:00:39.030> will<00:00:39.270> go<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.540> through<00:00:39.899> why<00:00:40.559> would

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
water will go down through why would

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.889 
water will go down through why would
that<00:00:40.860> possibly<00:00:41.610> matter<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.149> anyone<00:00:42.420> well

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that possibly matter to anyone well

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.680 
that possibly matter to anyone well
here's<00:00:43.110> why<00:00:44.000> when<00:00:45.000> water<00:00:45.270> hits<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
here's why when water hits a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
here's why when water hits a
conventional<00:00:46.350> paved<00:00:46.620> surface<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.489> runs<00:00:47.850> off

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
conventional paved surface it runs off

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420 
conventional paved surface it runs off
it's<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> soak<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it's not going to soak in it's going to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.889 
it's not going to soak in it's going to
run<00:00:50.610> off<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> hits<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> driveway<00:00:51.780> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
run off and when it hits the driveway it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.080 
run off and when it hits the driveway it
runs<00:00:52.140> off<00:00:52.320> into<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> gutter<00:00:52.920> when<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.760> gets<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
runs off into the gutter when it gets to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.350 
runs off into the gutter when it gets to
the<00:00:54.210> gutter<00:00:54.420> -<00:00:54.989> problems<00:00:55.530> begin<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> occur<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the gutter - problems begin to occur the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.930 
the gutter - problems begin to occur the
first<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> floods<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> street

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
first one is that it floods the street

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000 
first one is that it floods the street
sometimes<00:01:00.780> that's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> problem<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.859> your

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
sometimes that's a problem if your

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
sometimes that's a problem if your
drainage<00:01:02.309> isn't<00:01:02.699> too<00:01:02.820> good<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> have

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
drainage isn't too good or if you have

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.140 
drainage isn't too good or if you have
heavy<00:01:04.199> torrential<00:01:04.650> rainfall<00:01:05.070> urban<00:01:06.000> flooding

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
heavy torrential rainfall urban flooding

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.410 
heavy torrential rainfall urban flooding
is<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.900> big<00:01:07.080> problem<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:08.100> example<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
is a really big problem for example the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.980 
is a really big problem for example the
Los<00:01:09.630> Angeles<00:01:09.869> basin<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:11.100> 78<00:01:11.760> percent<00:01:11.790> paved<00:01:12.720> or

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
Los Angeles basin is 78 percent paved or

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.469 
Los Angeles basin is 78 percent paved or
roofed<00:01:13.580> 78<00:01:14.580> percent<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> land<00:01:15.270> is

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
roofed 78 percent of the land is

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.010 
roofed 78 percent of the land is
impervious<00:01:16.140> which<00:01:16.830> means<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.400> only<00:01:17.520> 22%<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
impervious which means that only 22% is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.999 
impervious which means that only 22% is
soaking<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.590> water

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
soaking up water

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.850 
soaking up water
the<00:01:20.640> net<00:01:20.880> effect<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.140> urban<00:01:22.710> flooding

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the net effect then is a urban flooding

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.770 
the net effect then is a urban flooding
and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.340> second<00:01:23.790> thing<00:01:23.970> which<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> really

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and then second thing which is really

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.460 
and then second thing which is really
important<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:27.119> water<00:01:27.439> goes<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
important be all that water goes and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.249 
important be all that water goes and
ends<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.040> somewhere<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.939> streams<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
ends up somewhere in the streams in a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.200 
ends up somewhere in the streams in a
lake<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> river<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.049> ocean<00:01:35.210> causing

reaches a level that when it gets
concentrated<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.630> those<00:02:00.719> bodies<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.259> water

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
concentrated in those bodies of water

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.700 
concentrated in those bodies of water
you<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.219> tremendous<00:02:02.460> problems<00:02:03.049> bacteria

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
you have tremendous problems bacteria

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.070 
you have tremendous problems bacteria
all<00:02:06.430> kinds<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.880> water<00:02:07.090> pollution<00:02:07.420> really<00:02:08.050> a

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
all kinds of water pollution really a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.139 
all kinds of water pollution really a
big<00:02:08.319> deal<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> idea<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.670> pervious

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
big deal so the idea of a pervious

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.650 
big deal so the idea of a pervious
pavement<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.920> allow<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.370> water<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.880> remain

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
pavement is to allow the water to remain

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.110 
pavement is to allow the water to remain
on<00:02:13.810> site<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.650> doesn't<00:02:14.950> go<00:02:15.100> anywhere<00:02:15.370> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
on site it doesn't go anywhere it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.440 
on site it doesn't go anywhere it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
stays on site with a third benefit which

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.199 
stays on site with a third benefit which
is<00:02:22.600> watering<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.680> plants<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.220> are<00:02:24.610> nearby

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
is watering the plants that are nearby

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.820 
is watering the plants that are nearby
the<00:02:25.390> roots<00:02:25.870> are<00:02:26.020> actually<00:02:26.140> getting<00:02:26.590> under

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
the roots are actually getting under

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.620 
the roots are actually getting under
this<00:02:26.950> material<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.670> they're<00:02:28.150> taking<00:02:28.510> that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
this material and they're taking that

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.110 
this material and they're taking that
water<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.709> a<00:02:29.860> much<00:02:30.130> much<00:02:30.400> better<00:02:30.670> way<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.970> go

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
water it's a much much better way to go

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.870 
water it's a much much better way to go
it's<00:02:31.450> such<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> good<00:02:31.959> idea<00:02:32.020> that

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
it's such a good idea that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.070 
it's such a good idea that

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
all over the country are beginning to

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.500 
all over the country are beginning to
require<00:02:38.440> this<00:02:38.680> material<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.610> lot<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.420> the

require this material on a lot of the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.830 
require this material on a lot of the
development<00:02:40.900> projects<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:43.269> was<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.570> first

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
development projects this was the first

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.620 
development projects this was the first

pervious concrete residential driveway
in<00:02:46.900> California<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.220> my<00:02:48.340> house<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.850> it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
in California here at my house and it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.910 
in California here at my house and it
was<00:02:49.030> quite<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> production<00:02:50.019> when<00:02:50.410> we<00:02:50.530> put<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.830> in

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
was quite a production when we put it in

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.920 
was quite a production when we put it in
about<00:02:51.040> eight<00:02:51.340> years<00:02:51.519> ago<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:52.570> worked<00:02:52.810> really

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
about eight years ago this worked really

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.140 
about eight years ago this worked really
well<00:02:53.260> I've<00:02:53.890> been<00:02:54.070> really<00:02:54.370> really<00:02:54.519> happy<00:02:55.120> with

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
well I've been really really happy with

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.910 
well I've been really really happy with
it<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:56.140> wanted<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.530> tell<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.890> a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
it and I just wanted to tell you a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.320 
it and I just wanted to tell you a
little<00:02:57.190> bit<00:02:57.340> about<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:57.820> that<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.120> can

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
little bit about it so that you can

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.360 
little bit about it so that you can
consider<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.650> have<00:02:59.890> an<00:03:00.190> application

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
consider it if you have an application

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.130 
consider it if you have an application
where<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.060> might<00:03:01.269> work<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:01.900> not<00:03:01.959> only

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
where it might work and it's not only

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.690 
where it might work and it's not only
for<00:03:02.260> driveways<00:03:02.890> by<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.220> way<00:03:03.459> they've<00:03:03.670> been

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
for driveways by the way they've been

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.880 
for driveways by the way they've been
pervious<00:03:04.209> concrete<00:03:04.319> walkways<00:03:05.319> sidewalks

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
pervious concrete walkways sidewalks

pervious concrete walkways sidewalks
patios<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.670> whatnot<00:03:06.970> it's<00:03:07.840> load-bearing<00:03:08.200> it

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
patios and whatnot it's load-bearing it

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.759 
patios and whatnot it's load-bearing it
will<00:03:08.890> take<00:03:09.130> any<00:03:09.489> kind<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.290> reasonable<00:03:11.290> vehicle

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
will take any kind of reasonable vehicle

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.259 
will take any kind of reasonable vehicle
traffic<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:14.019> about<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.620> same<00:03:14.860> cost<00:03:15.130> as<00:03:15.610> a

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
traffic it's about the same cost as a

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.560 
traffic it's about the same cost as a
conventional<00:03:17.079> concrete<00:03:17.709> driveway<00:03:18.570> sometimes

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
conventional concrete driveway sometimes

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.180 
conventional concrete driveway sometimes
it's<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.810> little<00:03:19.959> more<00:03:20.230> sometimes<00:03:20.799> it's<00:03:21.130> a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
it's a little more sometimes it's a

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.470 
it's a little more sometimes it's a
little<00:03:21.280> less<00:03:21.579> but<00:03:21.850> one<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.239> really

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
little less but one of the really

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.080 
little less but one of the really
interesting<00:03:22.510> things<00:03:22.900> about<00:03:23.230> cost<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:24.160> that

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
interesting things about cost is that

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.600 
interesting things about cost is that
because<00:03:26.049> it's<00:03:26.380> pervious<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.160> don't<00:03:27.400> need<00:03:27.519> to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
because it's pervious you don't need to

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.160 
because it's pervious you don't need to
think<00:03:27.790> about<00:03:27.880> drainage<00:03:28.450> normally<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.140> might

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
think about drainage normally you might

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.130 
think about drainage normally you might
have<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.560> drain<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:30.970> drain<00:03:31.239> pipe<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.989> takes

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
have a drain and a drain pipe that takes

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.900 
have a drain and a drain pipe that takes
the<00:03:32.350> water<00:03:32.560> away<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.250> costs<00:03:33.549> money<00:03:33.730> to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
the water away and that costs money to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.000 
the water away and that costs money to
put<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.239> sometimes<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:34.959> be<00:03:35.110> very<00:03:35.799> very

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
put in sometimes it can be very very

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.150 
put in sometimes it can be very very
expensive<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:38.410> water<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.709> not<00:03:38.799> going<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:39.010> go

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
expensive the water is not going to go

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.880 
expensive the water is not going to go
anywhere<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.030> you've<00:03:40.209> eliminated<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:41.380> need

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
anywhere so you've eliminated the need

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.350 
anywhere so you've eliminated the need
for<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.310> drainage<00:03:42.519> system<00:03:42.970> which<00:03:43.120> means

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
for that drainage system which means

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.690 
for that drainage system which means
that<00:03:43.959> even<00:03:44.170> if<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.410> driveway<00:03:44.860> itself<00:03:45.250> costs

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
that even if the driveway itself costs

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.880 
that even if the driveway itself costs
more<00:03:45.880> it's<00:03:46.090> going<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.329> cost<00:03:46.390> less<00:03:46.840> when<00:03:47.799> you

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
more it's going to cost less when you

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.400 
more it's going to cost less when you
take<00:03:48.070> out<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.340> drainage<00:03:48.700> system<00:03:48.760> so<00:03:49.570> cost<00:03:50.230> is

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
take out the drainage system so cost is

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.870 
take out the drainage system so cost is
not<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.620> factor<00:03:51.180> durability<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.299> not<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.540> factor

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
not a factor durability is not a factor

soak up all the rain that could possibly
fall<00:04:46.020> here<00:04:46.290> so<00:04:46.800> it's<00:04:47.340> essentially<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:47.970> zero

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
if we apply water to this watch what

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.260 
if we apply water to this watch what
happens

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.880 

it's<00:05:46.270> going<00:05:46.600> through<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:48.400> concrete<00:05:49.890> through

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
it's going through the concrete through

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.250 
it's going through the concrete through
the<00:05:51.100> concrete

the concrete

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.440 
the concrete
that<00:05:53.260> means<00:05:53.440> it's<00:05:53.590> staying<00:05:53.860> on<00:05:54.040> the<00:05:54.190> land<00:05:54.450> it's

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
that means it's staying on the land it's

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.050 
that means it's staying on the land it's
going<00:05:55.690> to<00:05:55.810> work<00:05:55.960> for<00:05:56.230> you<00:05:56.380> it's<00:05:57.340> not<00:05:57.580> causing

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
going to work for you it's not causing

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.710 
going to work for you it's not causing
flooding<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:59.230> it's<00:05:59.410> not<00:05:59.590> polluting<00:06:00.040> anything

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
flooding and it's not polluting anything
