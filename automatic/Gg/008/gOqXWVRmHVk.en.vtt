 play heroes of sword and magic 3 on the net 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.040
 for this we need

 the folder I took the c games drive 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.859
 so it looks like this 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.260
 I don't need to install it special 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.199

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.130
 confuse them with heroes Armageddon and also 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.700
 They can play but in this case, 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.320
 the complex has more rooms so it means 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 green ball 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.920
 next to the room it means that the game 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.049
 already started that is you join 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.079
 the game is impossible now you can go 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.500
 there is space in the rooms but 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.610
 playing can not lock means that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 the room is already closed 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:11.850
