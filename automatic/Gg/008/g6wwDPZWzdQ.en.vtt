00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.060 

so<00:00:15.050> the<00:00:15.950> birds<00:00:16.219> for<00:00:16.550> me<00:00:16.700> are<00:00:16.880> are<00:00:17.810> a<00:00:18.040> sort<00:00:19.040> of

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
so the birds for me are are a sort of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.120 
so the birds for me are are a sort of
study<00:00:19.430> in<00:00:19.610> form<00:00:19.970> they<00:00:20.480> are<00:00:20.869> very<00:00:21.800> sort<00:00:22.040> of

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
study in form they are very sort of

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.720 
study in form they are very sort of
primal<00:00:22.520> shapes<00:00:23.000> they<00:00:25.480> they<00:00:26.480> do<00:00:26.540> have<00:00:28.689> a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
primal shapes they they do have a

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.560 
primal shapes they they do have a
certain<00:00:31.730> power<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.329> them<00:00:32.860> but<00:00:34.270> they<00:00:35.270> don't

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
certain power to them but they don't

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.110 
certain power to them but they don't
have<00:00:35.870> very<00:00:36.050> much<00:00:36.290> detail<00:00:36.739> at<00:00:36.980> all<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.370> I<00:00:38.060> think

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
have very much detail at all and I think

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.970 
have very much detail at all and I think
that's<00:00:38.630> actually<00:00:38.960> what<00:00:39.380> gives<00:00:39.620> them<00:00:39.829> the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
that's actually what gives them the

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.709 
that's actually what gives them the
power<00:00:44.769> so<00:00:45.769> this<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.579> bird<00:00:46.789> series<00:00:47.269> has<00:00:47.449> come

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
power so this the bird series has come

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.869 
power so this the bird series has come
about<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:48.350> think<00:00:48.469> almost<00:00:48.980> as<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.309> direct<00:00:49.730> result

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
about I think almost as a direct result

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.630 
about I think almost as a direct result
of<00:00:50.300> studying<00:00:51.199> my<00:00:51.530> MA<00:00:52.030> at<00:00:53.030> Farnham<00:00:53.510> University

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
of studying my MA at Farnham University

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.479 
of studying my MA at Farnham University
while<00:00:55.640> stars<00:00:55.940> there<00:00:56.149> I<00:00:56.179> I<00:00:56.660> was<00:00:57.489> researching

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
while stars there I I was researching

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.090 
while stars there I I was researching
various<00:00:58.730> artists<00:00:59.660> and<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.559> one<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.890> stood

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
various artists and the one that stood

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.099 
various artists and the one that stood
out<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.370> most<00:01:01.399> for<00:01:01.820> me<00:01:01.850> as<00:01:02.149> far<00:01:02.480> as<00:01:02.629> sculpture

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
out the most for me as far as sculpture

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.830 
out the most for me as far as sculpture
does<00:01:03.320> was<00:01:04.480> Constantin<00:01:05.480> Brancusi<00:01:07.840> his

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
does was Constantin Brancusi his

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.660 
does was Constantin Brancusi his
sculpture<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:10.700> very<00:01:10.820> very<00:01:11.330> powerful<00:01:11.930> yet<00:01:12.860> has

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
sculpture is very very powerful yet has

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.180 
sculpture is very very powerful yet has
very<00:01:14.450> little<00:01:14.690> detail<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:15.650> if<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.860> look<00:01:16.010> at

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
very little detail to it if you look at

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.680 
very little detail to it if you look at
his<00:01:16.750> sculptures<00:01:17.750> for<00:01:18.410> example<00:01:18.860> he<00:01:18.950> sculpted<00:01:19.520> a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
his sculptures for example he sculpted a

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.930 
his sculptures for example he sculpted a
baby<00:01:20.690> crying<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.470> all<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:21.800> is<00:01:21.830> really<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:22.520> is

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
baby crying and all it is really is a is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.040 
baby crying and all it is really is a is
a<00:01:22.970> marble<00:01:24.250> egg<00:01:25.250> shape<00:01:25.850> with<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.660> couple<00:01:27.020> of

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
a marble egg shape with a couple of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.220 
a marble egg shape with a couple of
lines<00:01:27.320> on<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:28.390> yet<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.660> can<00:01:29.990> see

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
lines on it and yet you can see

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.490 
lines on it and yet you can see
instantly<00:01:30.740> what<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.160> is<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.660> I<00:01:32.660> feel<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.230> my

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
instantly what it is and I feel that my

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.570 
instantly what it is and I feel that my
Birds<00:01:33.860> have<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.700> similar<00:01:35.240> quality<00:01:35.480> hopefully

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
Birds have a similar quality hopefully

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.630 
Birds have a similar quality hopefully
in<00:01:37.580> that<00:01:38.240> they<00:01:38.840> have<00:01:39.050> very<00:01:39.350> little<00:01:39.560> detail<00:01:39.920> as

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
in that they have very little detail as

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.120 
in that they have very little detail as
far<00:01:41.000> as<00:01:41.150> they<00:01:41.840> don't<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.110> eyes<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.770> feathers

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
far as they don't have eyes and feathers

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.270 
far as they don't have eyes and feathers
and<00:01:43.330> things<00:01:44.330> like<00:01:44.780> that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
and things like that

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.880 
and things like that
but<00:01:46.870> they<00:01:47.870> definitely<00:01:48.050> have<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.530> bird-like

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
but they definitely have a bird-like

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.440 
but they definitely have a bird-like
quality<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:50.140> very<00:01:51.190> recognizable<00:01:52.190> as<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:53.060> bird

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
quality and very recognizable as a bird

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.490 
quality and very recognizable as a bird
shape<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:55.630> guess<00:01:56.630> an<00:01:56.780> interesting<00:01:57.260> thing<00:01:57.440> about

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
shape I guess an interesting thing about

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.270 
shape I guess an interesting thing about
the<00:01:58.160> making<00:01:58.430> of<00:01:58.700> these<00:01:58.910> birds<00:01:59.210> is<00:01:59.450> that<00:02:00.280> most

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
the making of these birds is that most

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.810 
the making of these birds is that most
of<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.550> time<00:02:01.760> I'm<00:02:01.970> making<00:02:02.330> them<00:02:02.450> on<00:02:02.720> my<00:02:03.320> own<00:02:03.820> it

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
of the time I'm making them on my own it

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.550 
of the time I'm making them on my own it
is<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:04.970> lot<00:02:05.240> more<00:02:05.270> challenging<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:06.200> make<00:02:06.350> them

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
is a lot more challenging to make them

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.260 
is a lot more challenging to make them
on<00:02:06.800> your<00:02:07.010> own<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.310> I've<00:02:07.430> had<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.790> adapt

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
on your own and I've had to adapt

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.920 
on your own and I've had to adapt
certain<00:02:08.599> things<00:02:09.550> certain<00:02:10.550> techniques<00:02:11.180> so

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
certain things certain techniques so

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.600 
certain things certain techniques so
that<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.110> can<00:02:12.470> do<00:02:12.709> that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
that I can do that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.220 
that I can do that
because<00:02:13.970> generally<00:02:14.209> glassblowing<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.019> done

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
because generally glassblowing is done

like<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:23.030> I've<00:02:23.150> developed<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.630> way<00:02:23.810> of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
like that so I've developed a way of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.410 
like that so I've developed a way of
working<00:02:24.200> on<00:02:24.530> my<00:02:24.650> own

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
purely out of necessity mostly but it is

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.610 
purely out of necessity mostly but it is

it has sort of become my mouth my

it has sort of become my mouth my
