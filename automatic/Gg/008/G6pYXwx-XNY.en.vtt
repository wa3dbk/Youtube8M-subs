00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.040
 I will show you how I did 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.920
 my at the New Year's art so like 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.470
 often I imagined a little less 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 drawings on paper and I'm going to you 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.539
 show how I do them on the angle 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.420
 I have already put a very beautiful nail polish 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.689
 holographic from cooler club it's 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.850
 the 995 and so I'm going to make a pattern 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 black the black patterns that's really 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.420
 very very good for decorating varnishes 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.579
 holographic and fluorescent varnishes 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.590
 these are types of varnish not always 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.790
 easy year arte but really the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.140
 black patterns it always works 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.140
 so I'm going to take a brush 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.760
 black acrylic pouilly color and my 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.870
 detail brush is their color 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.250
 size 2 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.059
 so I'm going to start by drawing the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.980
 2013 in the fact that a little bit my 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.680
 trouble on the creek will work 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.149
 easier 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.149
 we try to manage the space 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.060
 moment with the camera it's not very 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.370
 practical I can not turn my angle 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.190
 but you do not hesitate to put yourself 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.490
 in the sense that sees us the best so 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.940
 then I start down with a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.270
 little arabesques we will come their 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 then removed 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:02.540
 and we will work around this trait 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:09.679
 now so I 'm going to grow here the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:17.989
 end of my arabesques here i'm going to come 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:24.370
 do like a kind of leaves and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.370
 finish with something rounded here 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.150
 and I continue with a kind of 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.150
 foliage to stay the same style 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.130
 then the color all that is enough for me 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.880
 to press my brush to unload 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.880
 the painting 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.920
 at the end here I will come to do yet 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.920
 a kind of leaves 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.620
 now i'm going to come imply a 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.620
 further decline here 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.040
 So here we do something we 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.930
 continue his share dc and it comes back here and 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.280
 I will finish my motive with some 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.890
 drops so for the drops I 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.370
 do not press then I press with the body 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.370
 from my brush 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.970
 we can also do some points 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.609
 fill with arabesques if there are any 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.859
 places a little bit empty 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.180
 so that's what it gives do not forget 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.829
 to put your layer of top coat 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.340
 final to shine and last your 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.469
 deco and so that's thinking about the reasons 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.450
 blacks to decorate your last ones at 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.919
 graphic 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.940
 I make you many kisses and I will 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.940
 tell quickly evil
