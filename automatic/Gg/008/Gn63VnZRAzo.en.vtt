00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.339

 find peace if it is good then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.830
 I would even have a rating 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.299
 So I see that would have been like that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.479
 arrives the intro or the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.220
 video but I was if that too 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.450
 you think that's good then you can too 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:21.149
 like to have licon have no problem 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:22.950
 if it takes place then yes 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.509
 they also have many hearts 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.920
 why I'm talking is just that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.619
 people I have nothing to do with 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.210
 and they just do not have another life 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.930
 out and fight my work box or 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.829
 something like that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.570
 that's pretty funny people 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.119
 and already the first types were killed 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.570
 and there's the next one I want too 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.289
 race, race, race equal to going away 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.229
 Race Race Race Race 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.619
 the second is dead so the third one must 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.710
 definitely be somewhere here exactly 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.420
 I thought how it because even equal 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.460
 path 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.460
 so he is dead too 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.050
 yes in any case, the round runs 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.929
 really good which extra 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.260
 really used it is it is located 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.490
 facebook means it's me and me 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.990
 I know that someone is under here 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.640
 so it is also dead in jumped 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.060
 I still want to kill one, too 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.080
 and then the recording is good 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.130
 Just like you said, just write 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.660

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.220
