00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.670
 I bought a ball that I could 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.179
 patching the hole can play first 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.689

 aspirants to director the first one 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.450
 comes coming with his image of 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.530
 reinventing herself is the young woman hallucinating more 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.530
 how is it 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.289
 hahahahaha I am hallucinating more as is and 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.020
 I come to tell you that we can feed 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.569
 this school when I was director of the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.759
 school while I was still in kindergarten 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.209
 I invented the black thread that was used to 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.150
 sew the batman cape teaches him to 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.370
 kicking chuck norris develops the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.709
 space program for cats 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.590
 while I was composing Maria's song 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.069
 Pretty Augustine Lara, I say that I 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.069
 I wrote it 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.840
 well bringing a bigger boy to 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.880
 I hit that hits you no thanks 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.250
 well before I continue 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.890
 inventing I think we'd better pass him the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.310
 microphone to another suck also in 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.490
 mind to the microphone where that comes from 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.140
 music also in my house music but if 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.270
 this grief grandson also no no is not at 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.030
 invent here hello probably all 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.650
 they know me for dazzling more lie 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.690
 but I come to tell you that I am like 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.510
 you and I understand your shortcomings 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.520
 that so when I was a boy I lived in 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.860
 a house where there was a lot of poverty 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.780
 butler my cook my driver and up 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.730
 my gardener were poor every time 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.250
 I saw them depressed me until one day 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.710
 I decided to do something about it and I told him 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.290
 my daddy they ran them but what 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.000
 a seagull is arriving and it is 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.870
 pecking hallucinates more as is seagull 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.330
 seagull 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.920
 well the idea is that they can be 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.040
 I sure that if I promise you fill up 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.430
 and if you do not believe me, ask him thank you ok 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.100
 ok well I think we only have left 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:46.260
 but where does that light come from but if it is 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.800
 nothing more and nothing less than amlo brothers 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.830
 mine 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.560
 then as a graduate of this school 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.530
 I come to ask for peace and love for all 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.720
 I offer my frank hand, even if it's 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.480
 time the farm in your life because it's 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.520
 used to have it in the form of a fist 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.489
 but the joke is that while not 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.890
 know the verses of josé martí I can 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.709
