information is right here whoops this is

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.270 
information is right here whoops this is
the<00:02:40.299> spider<00:02:40.569> spawner<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.230> course<00:02:41.560> all<00:02:41.709> the

the spider spawner and of course all the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.460 
the spider spawner and of course all the
coordinates<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.180> information<00:02:43.720> will<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.290> in

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
coordinates and information will be in

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.729 
coordinates and information will be in
the<00:02:44.590> description<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:45.610> easily

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the description so you can easily

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.720 
the description so you can easily
teleport<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.010> if<00:02:48.159> you're<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.370> creative

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
teleport to it if you're in creative

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.119 
teleport to it if you're in creative
mode<00:02:48.760> or<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.360> find<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.349> easily<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.709> general

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
mode or just find it easily in general

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.020 
mode or just find it easily in general
so<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.269> spider<00:02:53.140> spawner<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.709> read<00:02:53.920> cap<00:02:54.730> is

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
so it is spider spawner to read cap is

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.449 
so it is spider spawner to read cap is
negative<00:02:55.569> 1<00:02:55.890> 79<00:02:56.890> in<00:02:57.340> 184<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.890> the

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
negative 1 79 in 184 and so this is the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.150 
negative 1 79 in 184 and so this is the
in<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.810> Y<00:03:01.989> my<00:03:02.799> x<00:03:03.519> is<00:03:03.760> negative<00:03:03.910> 1<00:03:04.209> 29<00:03:04.629> wise<00:03:05.560> 26

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
in the Y my x is negative 1 29 wise 26

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.809 
in the Y my x is negative 1 29 wise 26
zzz<00:03:06.519> 184<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.079> is<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.349> loot<00:03:09.190> eat<00:03:09.430> I'd<00:03:09.640> the

go back to the surface and we will see

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.309 
go back to the surface and we will see
the<00:03:22.959> double<00:03:23.230> ravine<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:24.489> just<00:03:24.940> like<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.319> w

just like the spider spawner the double
ravine<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.540> right<00:03:29.169> next<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.530> spawn<00:03:29.859> it<00:03:30.459> is

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
ravine is right next to spawn it is

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:43.010 
ravine is right next to spawn it is
negative<00:03:31.510> 1<00:03:31.720> 83<00:03:32.400> 231<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:33.790> over<00:03:34.150> here
