00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.470
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.300
 in the why of how 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.100
 and once again beautiful I want to 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.209
 wish you a beautiful and holy-year 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.280
 and 2014 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.450
 yes I know it's late January but good 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.100
 it seems that we can exchange our 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.610
 wishes for a whole month so I 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.800
 benefits 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.990
 finally actually I would like to 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.300
 wish you a better year on 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.820
 hope all 2014 will be better than 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.320
 2013 especially at the economic level and that 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.300
 it's not a new year of 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.010
 lean cows as they say ah but 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.260
 here is another interesting expression 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.390
 for us a year of lean cows 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.700
 a phrase that simply means 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.710
 a period of deprivation difficulties 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.070
 as opposed to years of cows 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.350
 fat 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.329
 good ok it's true that at first glance 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.060
 like that it seems very understandable 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.060
 simply purebred cows in grace here 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.710
 plenty and then lean cows 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.300
 privations that's it but hey you think 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.070
 although if I tell you about it it is 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.079
 there is a beautiful story behind all that 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.100
 go I take you to the side of the 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.640
 more specifically in chapter 41 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.950
 setting the scene 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.440
 we are in Egypt in the middle of 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.670
 amazing adventures of joseph the son 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.950
 Jacob's favorite 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.380
 the young Hebrew was sold as 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.270
 slave by his jealous brothers and bought 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.940
 per year to public servants who 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.619
 him his right arm wrongly accused by the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.409
 wife of the latter who wanted to sleep 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.690
 with him joseph is thrown into jail where he 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.750
 share his cell with two servants 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.520
 of Pharaoh one morning his fellow inmates him 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.530
 asks to interpret the dreams they 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.570
 have done during the night with the help of 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.189
 god he predicts alain that he will 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.140
 innocent and will find his 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.240
 functions with the king and the other 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.040
 that he will be hanged and eaten by the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.340
 birds and three days later 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.439
 these predictions come true two years 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.909
 pass and it's the turn of lighthouses in him 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.700
 even to make a dream of the most 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.830
 troubling he stands at the edge of the nile and 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.750
 see out of the river this magnificent 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.860
 fat cows that start to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.500
 graze on the shore 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.450
 just after she this other cow come out 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.790
 of the river but those there are ugly and 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 completely gaunt that's when 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.140
 the lean cows will devour the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.170
 fat cows a little later in the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.330
 night he makes a second dream he sees this 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.270
 ear of wheat that grows on a single stem 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.920
 full ears is beautiful and next 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.569
 it was 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.819
 then all lean and parched by the 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.160
 wind and as for the cows the seven 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.800
 lean ears swallow the beautiful spikes 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.690
 very tormented by her restless night 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 he summons all the scientists and 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.660
 magicians of the kingdom 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.890
 but none of them knows 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.959
 interpret his dreams 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.150
 it is then that the former companion of 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.459
 joseph prison actually reinstated 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.260
 to the court counsel to the king to solicit 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.340
 this young Hebrew who had so well 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.980
 to decipher his dream 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.569
 Joseph is then brought to the sovereign and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.030
 here is the interpretation they give 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.910
 always carried by this gift of the creator 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.739
 the seven fat cows represents this 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.140
 year of plenty and the seven cows 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.780
 skinny symbolizes this year of famine 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.489
 god calls Pharaohs and the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.130
 warns of the imminence of a 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.110
 unprecedented deprivation besides the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.420
 repetition of the dream with the symbolism of 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.730
 wheat means that it will come true very 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.739
 soon Joseph counsel then at 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.870
 king to find a wise man and 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.580
 smart who will store the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.910
 cereals from all over Egypt during 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.739
 good years in anticipation of the family 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.959
 pharaoh is very impressed by joseph 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.940
 by the trust he has in God and by 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.769
 the wise advice they give he 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.450
 so decides to give him the important 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.280
 mission to manage the reserves of 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.630
 food all over the country and he in 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.870
 makes his prime minister 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.000
 here the message of the Bible is clear on the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.400
 dream of fat cows then lean 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.200
 as well as joseph's life invites us to 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.810
 look at good times or more 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.940
 difficult of our life with hindsight and 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.560
 especially to keep this link and this 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.170
 trust in God during the moments 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.910
 complicated here you know all thanks 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.010

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.459
