but that's not gonna happen anymore

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.259 
but that's not gonna happen anymore
because<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:16.220> nice<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.700> strong<00:03:16.970> because

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
it's like five piece deck so if those

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.369 
it's like five piece deck so if those

the best way to tell the difference

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.170 
the best way to tell the difference
between<00:03:33.320> different<00:03:33.680> guitars<00:03:34.220> definitely<00:03:34.940> put

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
between different guitars definitely put

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.970 
between different guitars definitely put
mana<00:03:35.390> queens<00:03:35.780> in<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.470> what<00:03:36.590> I'm<00:03:36.680> going<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.860> do

for you I know there's a lot of interest

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.340 
for you I know there's a lot of interest
in<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.320> violet<00:03:40.220> chameleon<00:03:40.850> in<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.480> 570<00:03:42.260> and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
in the violet chameleon in the 570 and

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.590 
in the violet chameleon in the 570 and
also<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.770> 550<00:03:43.370> as<00:03:43.490> well<00:03:43.670> I'm<00:03:44.360> going<00:03:44.420> to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
also in the 550 as well I'm going to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.410 
also in the 550 as well I'm going to
compare<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.340> 674<00:03:46.340> hominid<00:03:46.640> body<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:47.330> the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
compare the 674 hominid body to the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.480 
compare the 674 hominid body to the
basswood<00:03:47.810> body<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.590> magnetic<00:03:49.250> force

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
basswood body and the magnetic force

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.890 
basswood body and the magnetic force
versus<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:49.940> Rosewood<00:03:50.270> neck<00:03:50.330> on<00:03:50.600> this<00:03:50.750> one

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
versus the Rosewood neck on this one

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.170 
versus the Rosewood neck on this one
here<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.320> let's<00:03:51.470> go<00:03:51.650> one<00:03:52.460> position<00:03:52.760> up<00:03:53.000> from

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
here so let's go one position up from

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.430 
here so let's go one position up from
the<00:03:53.270> bottom<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.750> have<00:03:53.990> a<00:03:54.020> listen<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.350> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
the bottom and have a listen to the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:10.690 
the bottom and have a listen to the
clean<00:03:54.560> tone

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:24.700 

position<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.970> off<00:04:12.090> we<00:04:12.239> go

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.469 

now<00:04:25.710> it's<00:04:25.889> interesting<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.789> guitar<00:04:27.150> sounds

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
now it's interesting this guitar sounds

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.610 
now it's interesting this guitar sounds
quieter<00:04:28.139> all<00:04:28.259> the<00:04:28.349> finger<00:04:28.620> people<00:04:30.409> but<00:04:31.409> on<00:04:31.530> the

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
the violet chameleon ego here's a look

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.610 
the violet chameleon ego here's a look
at<00:05:23.060> how<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.389> thing<00:05:23.630> goes<00:05:23.750> purple<00:05:24.199> and<00:05:24.319> great
