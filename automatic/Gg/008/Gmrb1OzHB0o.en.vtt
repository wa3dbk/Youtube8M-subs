when<00:00:42.040> these<00:00:42.400> leather<00:00:43.000> chairs<00:00:43.390> began<00:00:43.810> to

when these leather chairs began to

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.110 
when these leather chairs began to
arrive<00:00:44.260> I<00:00:44.620> think<00:00:44.920> that<00:00:45.070> they<00:00:45.220> were<00:00:45.280> becoming

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
arrive I think that they were becoming

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.480 
arrive I think that they were becoming
popular<00:00:46.450> with<00:00:46.990> Europeans<00:00:47.770> which<00:00:48.010> is<00:00:48.130> why<00:00:48.250> they

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
popular with Europeans which is why they

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.650 
popular with Europeans which is why they
were<00:00:48.580> starting<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:48.940> appear<00:00:49.330> for<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.630> first
