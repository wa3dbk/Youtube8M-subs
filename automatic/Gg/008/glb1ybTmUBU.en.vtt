movies HD DVD movies that's its you DVD

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.230 
movies HD DVD movies that's its you DVD
so<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> has<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> unified<00:00:26.430> video<00:00:26.580> decoder<00:00:26.880> on

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
so it has a unified video decoder on

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.540 
so it has a unified video decoder on
board<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.930> removes<00:00:28.320> virtually<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
board it removes virtually all of the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.479 
board it removes virtually all of the
stress<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.060> decoding<00:00:30.630> those<00:00:30.869> files<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.130> those

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
stress of decoding those files and those

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
stress of decoding those files and those
movies<00:00:33.149> from<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> cpu<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.440> puts<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.770> right

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
movies from the cpu and it puts it right

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.780 
movies from the cpu and it puts it right
here<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.520> got<00:00:35.640> its<00:00:35.790> own<00:00:35.899> 725<00:00:36.899> megahert<00:00:37.790> core

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
here it's got its own 725 megahert core

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.380 
here it's got its own 725 megahert core
clock<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.540> also<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.079> 128-bit<00:00:40.860> card<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.390> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
clock it also it's 128-bit card and this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.680 
clock it also it's 128-bit card and this
one<00:00:42.570> has<00:00:42.750> 512<00:00:43.379> megabytes<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.129> memory<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:45.450> well

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
one has 512 megabytes of memory as well

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.010 
one has 512 megabytes of memory as well
and<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.440> runs<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.890> 1600<00:00:47.460> megahertz<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> as

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and that runs at 1600 megahertz so as

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.049 
and that runs at 1600 megahertz so as
you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.129> very<00:00:50.489> small

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
you can see here it's a very small

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.270 
you can see here it's a very small
simple<00:00:51.480> card<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.020> two<00:00:52.260> DVI<00:00:52.770> ports<00:00:53.190> on

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
simple card you have two DVI ports on

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830 
simple card you have two DVI ports on
this<00:00:53.399> side<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.210> nice<00:00:54.360> thing<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:54.570> these

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
this side and the nice thing about these

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.600 
this side and the nice thing about these
ports<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> supports<00:00:55.710> hdmi<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.520> an

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
dual monitors you can do that a max

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.340 
dual monitors you can do that a max
resolution<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.680> 2560<00:01:53.220> by<00:01:53.520> 1600<00:01:54.060> there<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.259> we

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
resolution of 2560 by 1600 there so we

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.289 
resolution of 2560 by 1600 there so we
have<00:01:55.439> two<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> those<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> box<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:56.610> and
