00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
hey guys so today I want to make a

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.619 
hey guys so today I want to make a
benchmark<00:00:02.100> speed<00:00:02.639> comparison<00:00:03.120> test<00:00:03.360> here

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
benchmark speed comparison test here

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.619 
benchmark speed comparison test here
between<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.350> galaxy<00:00:04.740> s3<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.580> Galaxy<00:00:06.330> s4

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
between the galaxy s3 and the Galaxy s4

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.049 
between the galaxy s3 and the Galaxy s4
mini<00:00:06.779> so<00:00:07.470> we're<00:00:07.770> making<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.309> browser<00:00:08.610> test

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
mini so we're making a browser test

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.790 
mini so we're making a browser test
videos<00:00:09.450> twelve<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:10.080> want<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.349> check<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.620> out

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
videos twelve you want to check that out

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.129 
videos twelve you want to check that out
so<00:00:11.639> we'll<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.179> trying<00:00:12.450> out<00:00:12.660> for<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.960> geek

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
so we'll be trying out for the geek

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.599 
so we'll be trying out for the geek
bench<00:00:13.349> too<00:00:13.590> here<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> Duke<00:00:14.250> or<00:00:15.230> s4<00:00:16.230> mini<00:00:16.609> will

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
bench too here is Duke or s4 mini will

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.450 
bench too here is Duke or s4 mini will
be<00:00:17.730> running<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.480> test<00:00:18.980> versus<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.160> quad

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
be running this test versus the quad

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.740 
be running this test versus the quad
core<00:00:21.260> like<00:00:22.260> 1.2<00:00:23.189> or<00:00:23.460> could<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.180> point<00:00:24.390> four

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
core like 1.2 or could be one point four

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.450 
core like 1.2 or could be one point four
gigahertz<00:00:25.080> yeah<00:00:25.439> probably<00:00:25.710> yeah<00:00:26.039> won't<00:00:26.279> move

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
gigahertz yeah probably yeah won't move

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.150 
gigahertz yeah probably yeah won't move
to<00:00:26.640> four<00:00:26.820> gigahertz<00:00:27.060> quad-core<00:00:27.890> on<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
to four gigahertz quad-core on the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.510 
to four gigahertz quad-core on the
galaxy<00:00:29.519> s3<00:00:30.050> not<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.170> 400<00:00:31.679> instead<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
galaxy s3 not at 400 instead of the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.330 
galaxy s3 not at 400 instead of the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
Adreno 305 GPU Verity do against on the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.660 
Adreno 305 GPU Verity do against on the
s4<00:00:35.640> mini<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:37.559> also<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.070> gets<00:00:38.309> an<00:00:38.370> older

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
s4 mini and also do gets an older

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.030 
s4 mini and also do gets an older
version<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.910> Android<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> s3<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:40.890> we're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
version of Android on the s3 but we're

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.229 
version of Android on the s3 but we're
probably<00:00:41.250> gonna<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.730> new<00:00:41.910> version<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
probably gonna get the new version of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
probably gonna get the new version of
Android<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.750> pretty<00:00:42.930> soon<00:00:43.020> under<00:00:43.530> 4.3<00:00:44.190> but

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
Android here pretty soon under 4.3 but

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
Android here pretty soon under 4.3 but
right<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.940> running<00:00:45.149> Android<00:00:45.510> 4.1<00:00:45.840> jelly

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
right now it's running Android 4.1 jelly

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.970 
right now it's running Android 4.1 jelly
bean<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> we've<00:00:50.219> got<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> score<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.640> 19<00:00:51.059> 25<00:00:51.480> here

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
bean so we've got a score of 19 25 here

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.189 
bean so we've got a score of 19 25 here
on<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.579> baby<00:00:53.850> s4<00:00:54.420> gonna<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.809> interesting<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
on this baby s4 gonna be interesting to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.799 
on this baby s4 gonna be interesting to
see<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.559> score<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.940> galaxy<00:00:57.390> s3<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
see the score here on the galaxy s3 I

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.000 
see the score here on the galaxy s3 I
have<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:01.079> no<00:01:01.230> idea<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.739> gonna<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
have actually no idea if it's gonna get

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
have actually no idea if it's gonna get
better<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.730> worse<00:01:05.659> okay<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.840> interesting

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
better or worse okay pretty interesting

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
better or worse okay pretty interesting
there<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.400> see<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:08.909> much

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
there so you can really see how much

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.200 
there so you can really see how much
power<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.560> inside<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> galaxy<00:01:11.909> s4<00:01:12.150> mini

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
power it is inside of the galaxy s4 mini

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
power it is inside of the galaxy s4 mini
I<00:01:12.479> mean<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.840> might<00:01:13.020> be<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.350> bit<00:01:13.560> smaller

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I mean it might be a little bit smaller

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.370 
I mean it might be a little bit smaller
device<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.490> terms<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.850> display<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.380> clearly

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
device in terms of display but clearly

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.980 
device in terms of display but clearly
on<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:17.340> test<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.509> definitely<00:01:18.630> see

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
on this test here you can definitely see

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.130 
on this test here you can definitely see
that<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.400> powerful<00:01:20.729> oh<00:01:20.970> boy<00:01:21.840> yeah

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that it's a it's a powerful oh boy yeah

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.410 
that it's a it's a powerful oh boy yeah
which<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.590> getting<00:01:22.830> 25%<00:01:23.369> higher<00:01:23.790> score<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
which is getting 25% higher score and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.350 
which is getting 25% higher score and
then<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> galaxy<00:01:25.140> s3<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.250> cool<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.210> gonna

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
then the galaxy s3 so cool now I'm gonna

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.300 
then the galaxy s3 so cool now I'm gonna
do<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> enter<00:01:28.110> 2d<00:01:28.320> 3d<00:01:29.040> GPU<00:01:29.670> test<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:31.100> we<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.189> have

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
do a enter 2d 3d GPU test so we do have

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.859 
do a enter 2d 3d GPU test so we do have
the<00:01:32.400> mail<00:01:32.549> at<00:01:32.670> 400<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> performing

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the mail at 400 here which is performing

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.130 
the mail at 400 here which is performing
good<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.439> GTA<00:01:34.979> games<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.549> GTA<00:01:35.579> 3<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.390> GTA<00:01:36.750> Y

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
good on GTA games like GTA 3 and GTA Y

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
good on GTA games like GTA 3 and GTA Y
City<00:01:37.880> but<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.270> s<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.079> probable<00:01:40.970> for

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
City but this one s for probable for

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.499 
City but this one s for probable for
better<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:43.009> 305<00:01:44.009> in-game<00:01:44.759> love<00:01:45.000> games<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.479> on

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
better with 305 in-game love games or on

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.480 
better with 305 in-game love games or on
game<00:01:45.899> off<00:01:46.079> games<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.369> running

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
game off games so we will be running

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.660 
game off games so we will be running
this<00:01:47.759> test<00:01:48.000> over<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.159> here

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
this test over here and we can see here

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.539 
this test over here and we can see here
that<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.270> FPS<00:01:51.979> pretty<00:01:52.979> interesting<00:01:53.399> here

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
that the FPS pretty interesting here

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
that the FPS pretty interesting here
they<00:01:53.700> both<00:01:53.939> go<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.509> down<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.020> think<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
they both go up and down I think that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.139 
they both go up and down I think that
they<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> run<00:01:56.549> off<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.850> probably

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
they don't have to run off I probably

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.609 
they don't have to run off I probably
would<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.630> bit<00:01:57.990> better<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.350> little

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
would be a little bit better a little

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.929 
would be a little bit better a little
bit<00:01:58.799> sharper

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
bit sharper

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.700 
bit sharper
that<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.630> my<00:02:00.780> guess

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.219 

you<00:02:07.310> see<00:02:07.549> there<00:02:07.820> those<00:02:08.030> guys<00:02:08.209> running<00:02:09.020> around

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
you see there those guys running around

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.480 
you see there those guys running around
on<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:10.009> green<00:02:10.900> I'm<00:02:11.980> for<00:02:12.980> sure<00:02:13.130> what's<00:02:13.340> going

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
on this green I'm for sure what's going

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:28.000 
on this green I'm for sure what's going
on<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:13.670> something<00:02:14.540> interesting

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.970 

so<00:02:29.010> drink<00:02:29.940> my<00:02:30.150> coffee<00:02:30.390> let's<00:02:31.379> go<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.739> over

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
so drink my coffee let's go see over

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:45.530 
so drink my coffee let's go see over
here<00:02:32.150> yeah<00:02:33.150> it's<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> good<00:02:34.080> stuff<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:45.150> pretty

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
here yeah it's the good stuff so pretty

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.080 
here yeah it's the good stuff so pretty
cool<00:02:45.750> benchmark<00:02:46.379> program<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.700> answers

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
cool benchmark program and the answers

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.259 
cool benchmark program and the answers
are<00:02:48.180> also<00:02:48.360> there<00:02:48.660> they<00:02:48.959> have<00:02:49.379> another<00:02:50.269> program

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
are also there they have another program

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.589 
are also there they have another program
we<00:02:51.870> gotta<00:02:52.019> see<00:02:52.200> her<00:02:52.349> score<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:53.000> 4105<00:02:54.000> here<00:02:54.329> on

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
we gotta see her score of 4105 here on

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.589 
we gotta see her score of 4105 here on
the<00:02:54.959> s4<00:02:55.470> mini<00:02:56.030> vs<00:02:58.040> 3398<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.400> 90<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:00.360> we<00:03:00.480> do

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
the s4 mini vs 3398 or 90 and if we do

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.780 
the s4 mini vs 3398 or 90 and if we do
get<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.079> on<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.610> galaxy<00:03:03.030> s3<00:03:04.400> we<00:03:05.400> probably

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
get here on the galaxy s3 we probably

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.339 
get here on the galaxy s3 we probably

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
vs 540 x 960 so pretty sure a little bit

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.099

off screen test is doing in the kind of

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
same resolution so let's try that out as

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:40.220 
same resolution so let's try that out as
well<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:38.000> do<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.030> know<00:03:39.180> personally<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
well so do you know personally that the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.530 
well so do you know personally that the
malecon<00:03:40.769> readings<00:03:41.069> are<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.310> s3<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:41.970> pretty

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
malecon readings are the s3 is pretty

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.140 
malecon readings are the s3 is pretty
powerful<00:03:42.750> see<00:03:43.169> I<00:03:43.200> mean<00:03:43.669> compared<00:03:44.669> to<00:03:44.730> rest<00:03:44.970> to

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
powerful see I mean compared to rest to

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.509 
powerful see I mean compared to rest to
I<00:03:45.180> think<00:03:45.389> they<00:03:45.540> overclocked<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.310> one<00:03:47.310> more<00:03:47.430> up

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
I think they overclocked it one more up

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.819 
I think they overclocked it one more up

so<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:51.180> could<00:03:51.329> actually<00:03:51.480> win<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:52.049> thing<00:03:52.130> or

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
so it could actually win this thing or

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.729 
so it could actually win this thing or
it's<00:03:54.150> gonna<00:03:54.299> be<00:03:54.450> at<00:03:54.569> least<00:03:54.630> very<00:03:55.109> very<00:03:55.319> close

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
it's gonna be at least very very close

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:10.080 
it's gonna be at least very very close
close<00:03:56.700> call<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.060> think<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:58.560> terms<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:59.069> score

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
very very interesting here they seem to

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.870 
very very interesting here they seem to

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
maybe they're not 305 win by low so

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.840 
maybe they're not 305 win by low so

that's<00:04:52.130> about<00:04:52.370> what<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.759> can<00:04:53.000> expect<00:04:53.770> I'm

that's about what you can expect I'm

that's about what you can expect I'm
Trisha<00:04:55.190> which<00:04:55.370> device<00:04:55.669> is<00:04:55.880> more<00:04:56.270> expensive

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
Trisha which device is more expensive

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.810 
Trisha which device is more expensive
here<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:56.930> think<00:04:57.169> these<00:04:57.320> devices<00:04:57.860> are<00:04:58.009> very<00:04:58.250> much

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
here I think these devices are very much

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.790 
here I think these devices are very much
familiar<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.570> terms<00:04:59.600> of<00:05:00.110> pricing<00:05:00.590> at<00:05:00.680> the

familiar in terms of pricing at the

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.189 
familiar in terms of pricing at the
moment<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.520> is<00:05:01.639> the<00:05:01.669> 4G<00:05:02.150> s3<00:05:02.630> that<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:02.930> have

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
moment this is the 4G s3 that you have

moment this is the 4G s3 that you have
so<00:05:03.800> pretty<00:05:04.250> interesting<00:05:04.639> there<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.090> we

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
so pretty interesting there and we
