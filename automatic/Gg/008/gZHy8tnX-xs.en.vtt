00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.560
 Hello, I want to show the consequences 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.080
 my work my work on the piston 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.059
 il planet 5 to improve efficiency 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.279
 engine performance and improvement 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.010
 reliability if you look at the old video 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.850
 it is told there that it is made for 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 order to get away from the scoring problem on 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.500
 sticking pistons and rings were also 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 It turned out that this is most likely 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.950
 happened then no contractions butter butter i 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.190
 lil as recommended 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.190
 manufacturing plant 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.329
 porsche was modified using sandpaper 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.670
 for easy passage through the cylinder 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.379
 in order to reduce his trench 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.410
 work time now I tell you this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.149
 I will demonstrate well 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.710
 so here we go set 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.079
 as he must stand on 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.949
 while working he is very loving like me 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:08.590
 right now he passes very lightly 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.590
 without any effort so to speak 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:22.190
 demonstrate what you can watch 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:23.409
 under the cylinder as opposed to 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.009
 old piston 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.550
 the same for the tree is much too that 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:38.060
 causes additional frictional forces and 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:40.450
 generally sticking so another one of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.210
 improvements I decided to do it 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.250
 point channel which is just below 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.780
 channel point to see which is 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.990
 just below the lower piston ring this 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.130
 was made to work 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.649
 this box was going to butter 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.430
 smeared naturally on the surface 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.770
 some some offered me 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.070
 drill a hole somewhere like that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.980
 so that these holes do not fall but 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.810
 whether there exhaust but purge windows then 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.450
 these holes are about you should have been 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.329
 turn out here I do not do this 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.320
 become like u have my guess all 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:27.410
 It should work without such modifications I 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.220
 afraid to overdo it with all sorts of new 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.760
 visions 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.019
 so did enough in my opinion 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.370
 reliable and harmless 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.819
 refinement of the piston such a channel points and 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.989
 did for three minutes usually try 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.909
 on virgin soil operation will show 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.120
 correct completion or not and you just 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.120
 kind
