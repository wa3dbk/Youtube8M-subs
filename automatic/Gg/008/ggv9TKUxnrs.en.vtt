00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that so this is all mostly done with a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
that so this is all mostly done with a
tweak<00:00:22.410> called<00:00:22.590> messages<00:00:23.369> customizer<00:00:23.910> which

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
tweak called messages customizer which

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.609 
tweak called messages customizer which
you're<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.960> actually<00:00:25.109> add<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
you're going to have to actually add a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.939 
you're going to have to actually add a
repo<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.390> order<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> download<00:00:28.740> this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
repo for this in order to download this

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.200 
repo for this in order to download this
but<00:00:29.160> I'll<00:00:29.250> put<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.000> link<00:00:30.150> in

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
but I'll put that in a link in

messages<00:00:33.780> customizer<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
messages customizer this is going to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.330 
messages customizer this is going to
allow<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.140> changes<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
allow you to make these changes so you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.770 
allow you to make these changes so you
can<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.180> obviously<00:00:39.480> have

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
can see right here that I obviously have

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.209 
can see right here that I obviously have
an<00:00:39.930> image<00:00:40.260> right<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.770> background

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
an image right here in the background

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.470 
an image right here in the background
rather<00:00:41.309> than<00:00:41.550> having<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.059> solid<00:00:42.450> color

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
rather than having just a solid color

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.990 
rather than having just a solid color
which<00:00:43.290> has<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.100> subtle<00:00:44.309> texture<00:00:44.730> right

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
which has just a subtle texture right

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.400 
which has just a subtle texture right
here<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.930> looks<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.260> nice

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
here and I think it looks really nice

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.619 
here and I think it looks really nice
with<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.010> theme<00:00:47.399> I've<00:00:47.850> also<00:00:48.090> changed<00:00:48.420> the

button<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.850> down<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.030> rather<00:01:15.420> than

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
button right down here rather than

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.810

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
sinned button and that is a different

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.810 
sinned button and that is a different
tweak<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.430> called

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
tweak and that's called

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
tweak and that's called
return<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.509> sender<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.799> install<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
return to sender so just install that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
return to sender so just install that
tweak<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.150> enable<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.780> then

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
tweak and then just enable it and then

blur the image then it's going to

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.569 
blur the image then it's going to
possibly<00:03:15.689> lag<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.349> little<00:03:16.530> bit<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.340> can<00:03:17.459> also

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
possibly lag a little bit you can also

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.879 
possibly lag a little bit you can also
change<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.239> few<00:03:18.479> different<00:03:18.780> things<00:03:18.959> when<00:03:19.799> you

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
change a few different things when you

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.430 
change a few different things when you
choose<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.340> image<00:03:20.639> that<00:03:20.669> allow<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.479> put

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
choose the image that allow you to put

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.809 
choose the image that allow you to put
an<00:03:22.560> overlay<00:03:22.859> on<00:03:22.979> it<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.579> put<00:03:23.729> an

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
an overlay on it so if you put an

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.789 
an overlay on it so if you put an
overlay<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.449> then<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.260> could<00:03:25.409> possibly

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
overlay on it then that could possibly

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.490 
overlay on it then that could possibly
lag<00:03:26.250> out<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.760> little<00:03:27.150> bit<00:03:27.329> as<00:03:27.449> well<00:03:27.720> but<00:03:28.319> coming

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
lag out a little bit as well but coming

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.439 
lag out a little bit as well but coming
back<00:03:28.680> down<00:03:28.829> here<00:03:29.069> if<00:03:29.159> we<00:03:29.280> tap<00:03:29.459> on<00:03:29.639> info<00:03:29.970> text<00:03:30.359> I

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
that up you can change the bubble width

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.819 
that up you can change the bubble width
if<00:03:38.699> you<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.239> do<00:03:39.329> that<00:03:39.479> mine<00:03:39.780> set<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.319> 31

we<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.489> bubble<00:03:41.849> tales<00:03:42.060> which<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.389> have<00:03:42.540> hide

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
we have bubble tales which I have hide

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.449 
we have bubble tales which I have hide
all<00:03:43.079> just<00:03:43.379> because<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.620> think<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:44.009> bubble

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
all just because I think the bubble

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.369 
all just because I think the bubble
tales<00:03:44.609> don't<00:03:44.879> look<00:03:45.120> all<00:03:45.479> that<00:03:45.540> great<00:03:46.049> so<00:03:46.229> I've

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
tales don't look all that great so I've

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.710 
tales don't look all that great so I've
decided<00:03:46.949> to<00:03:47.220> hide<00:03:47.459> those<00:03:47.669> and<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.449> you<00:03:48.540> don't

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
decided to hide those and if you don't

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.390 
decided to hide those and if you don't
want<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.049> fill<00:03:49.319> of<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> bubble<00:03:49.979> and<00:03:50.099> you<00:03:50.159> just

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
want the fill of the bubble and you just

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.339 
want the fill of the bubble and you just
want<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.699> bubble<00:03:50.879> outline<00:03:51.359> then<00:03:51.900> toggle<00:03:52.259> that

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
want the bubble outline then toggle that

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.199 
want the bubble outline then toggle that
on<00:03:52.530> right<00:03:52.769> there<00:03:53.009> if<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.579> want<00:03:53.729> flat<00:03:53.909> bubble

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
on right there if you want flat bubble

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.490 
on right there if you want flat bubble
edges<00:03:54.449> right<00:03:54.569> here<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.900> can<00:03:55.019> toggle<00:03:55.199> that<00:03:55.439> on

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
edges right here you can toggle that on

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.499 
edges right here you can toggle that on
that<00:03:56.069> basically<00:03:56.340> takes<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.849> bubbles<00:03:57.209> all<00:03:57.359> the

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:57.509 
that basically takes the bubbles all the

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.179 
that basically takes the bubbles all the
way<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.689> the<00:03:57.870> edge<00:03:58.049> doesn't<00:03:58.769> really<00:03:59.009> look<00:03:59.129> that

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
way to the edge doesn't really look that

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.949 
way to the edge doesn't really look that
great<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.609> my<00:03:59.699> opinion<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:00.209> if<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.419> like<00:04:00.810> it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
great in my opinion but if you like it

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.210 
great in my opinion but if you like it
then<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.199> can<00:04:01.379> toggle<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.739> right<00:04:02.009> there

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
then you can toggle that on right there

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.210 
then you can toggle that on right there
we<00:04:02.729> also<00:04:02.849> have<00:04:03.060> contact<00:04:03.359> pick<00:04:04.049> radius<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.799> this

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
we also have contact pick radius so this

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.249 
we also have contact pick radius so this
will<00:04:05.370> put<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.579> picture<00:04:06.120> right<00:04:06.540> there<00:04:06.569> in<00:04:07.109> your

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
conversation so you can change the

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.509 
conversation so you can change the
radius<00:04:09.509> right<00:04:09.989> here<00:04:10.319> I<00:04:10.349> have<00:04:10.620> mine<00:04:10.829> set<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.129> I

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
radius right here I have mine set to I

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.219 
radius right here I have mine set to I
tried<00:04:11.729> to<00:04:11.759> put<00:04:11.939> at<00:04:12.060> 27<00:04:12.599> which<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.750> actually<00:04:13.109> the

tried to put at 27 which is actually the

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.649 
tried to put at 27 which is actually the
default<00:04:13.909> obviously<00:04:14.909> sometimes<00:04:15.299> it's<00:04:15.449> kind<00:04:15.629> of

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
default obviously sometimes it's kind of

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.390 
default obviously sometimes it's kind of
hard<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.930> get<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:16.650> right<00:04:16.769> on<00:04:16.919> there<00:04:17.099> you<00:04:17.250> might

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
hard to get it right on there you might

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.670 
hard to get it right on there you might
be<00:04:17.489> able<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.669> just<00:04:17.880> tap<00:04:18.509> and<00:04:18.630> hold<00:04:18.690> on<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:18.959> no

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
be able to just tap and hold on that no

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.670 
be able to just tap and hold on that no
so<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.459> have<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.759> actually<00:04:20.849> swipe<00:04:21.539> to<00:04:21.930> 27<00:04:22.469> okay

so you have to actually swipe to 27 okay

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.560

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
darker especially at night to make it a

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.980 
darker especially at night to make it a
little<00:04:59.159> easier<00:04:59.520> on<00:04:59.669> your<00:04:59.789> eyes<00:04:59.819> so<00:05:00.210> we're
