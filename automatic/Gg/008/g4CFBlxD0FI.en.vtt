00:00:00.918 --> 00:00:02.628
Hello, I am Merve Ã–zkaynak.

00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:06.381
In this video, I will do this makeup
with using only five product.

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:08.967
This is actually a tag-video,
dear Deniz has tagged me...

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:10.761
...and I joined in.

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:14.431
At the end of this video, to make
you able to see what my other...

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:16.934
...friends have done, I will
put their links on both...

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:20.229
...at the end of this video and in the
description below. I hope you like it.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.198
I am starting my makeup with
Chanel Perfection Lumiere Velvet...

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.450
...number 20, beige.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.038
And I am using Sigma's
F50 as my brush.

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:40.499
First I make small dots
in my skin.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:45.087
And with using only the tip of the
brush, I spread the foundation.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.091
You can achieve a great look
by not pushing the brush too hard.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.302
It doesn't create lines and the
foundation suit the skin nicely.

00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:04.064
And now, it's time for
the eye makeup.

00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:07.276
Since this makeup only
requires five products...

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.529
...and since every eye shadow
colour counts as one product...

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:15.742
...I wanted to use the same bronzer
I have for my cheeks in my eyes.

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.870
This is a Barbara Bort product.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:22.207
It is a bit shiny and not too dark,
you can use it as bronzer and blush.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:26.044
First, I spread it with Mac's
number 217 brush.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.673
And later, I blend it with
Sigma's E55 brush.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.011
And now, it's time for the
Naked 1 chisel's Smoke colour.

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:37.389
I am applying it with
E45 brush and...

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:40.350
...and blend it with E55
brush.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:44.104
I am applying the same eye
shadow for my eyelashes.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.483
I am applying to my
eyelashes with E30 brush.

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:53.322
And now, I am cleaning the parts
that come from the eye shadows...

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.781
...with my foundation brush.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:59.077
I am using Estee
Lauder's Mascara.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.747
I couldn't use any base this time.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.046
I used the same Barbara Bort
product with Mac's number 168...

00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:14.134
...brush which can be used for
both contouring and the blushing...

00:02:14.927 --> 00:02:17.137
...while increasing the product.

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:20.974
You can't get too dark
colour with this product.

00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:29.608
And now for the final
stage, lipstick.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.611
Since this is a brown
coloured makeup...

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.489
...I want to finish with
a brown toned lipstick.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.160
I am finishing my makeup with
brown toned Mac Velvet Teddy.

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:54.925
Thank you for watching.
