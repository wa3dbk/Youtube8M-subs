overheating that was going really hot
and<00:06:49.130> then<00:06:49.610> it<00:06:49.700> would<00:06:49.790> just<00:06:49.820> shut<00:06:50.180> down<00:06:50.210> and<00:06:50.750> the

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
screen would go I either black or

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.720 
screen would go I either black or
completely<00:06:54.500> white<00:06:54.680> and<00:06:54.710> it<00:06:55.130> would<00:06:55.250> just<00:06:55.430> turn

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
completely white and it would just turn

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.720 
completely white and it would just turn
off<00:06:55.910> and<00:06:56.360> a<00:06:57.050> lot<00:06:57.169> of<00:06:57.260> you<00:06:57.320> guys<00:06:57.440> suggested<00:06:57.730> that
