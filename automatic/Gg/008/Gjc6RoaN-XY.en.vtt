00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.379
 high then the ingredients for the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.769
 recipe you will need three 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.599
 hours of a sachet of baking powder 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:17.570
 a jar of yogurt with rapeseed oil 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.570
 or sunflower of the foreign 2 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.250
 so for a start you will put 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.830
 the 3rd in a container and you to them 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.360
 mix with the podium 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:38.640
 you put the podium with the 3rd as 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 these ci see there and mix you like 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:53.820
 this you add sugar skin so 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.830
 you take your yoghurt pot and you 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.860
 put and you fill two sugar 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:08.870
 times like this you remember these 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:14.550
 twice the pulse of sugar to the brim 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:18.600
 like it a little fine sugar 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:23.730
 powdered sugar you scraped well with 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.840
 a spoon at the bottom of the pot recover 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.350
 everything they did like this site and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.350
 you mix well 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.600
 once it's homogeneous you 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.860
 to add two pots of famine so we 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040
 do as before you take 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.050
 your yoghurt elbow and you put yourself 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.180
 fill it twice with some 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:55.250
 flour like this you fill d 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.250
 first a little flour 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:07.400
 two buds flour pasta flour or 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.280
 so you remember well with the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.440
 spoon not to leave at the front 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.390
 like these it's very simple actually 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.610
 we just need to measure the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.500
 amounts of the rising pole 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.220
 we will say I have good to get a 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.480
 homogeneous mixture 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.140
 once you've got a mix 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.630
 well homogeneous we will add the bag of 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.510
 the wolf's vowel towards chemicals like 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.330
 this you put it in 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:40.910
 you mix well like these and you 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.220
 go to the three-quarters of the pot 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.330
 yogurt in oil you take your 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.610
 product or add the three-quarter one 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.019
 little more a little more than the night there 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.390
 as a problem it's just about the three 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.680
 quarter of the podium you can see like 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.650
 this you put in and you mix 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.670
 for it to take well at the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.170
 preparation for those who have 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.519
 ingredients to omit to give 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.840
 a little taste for example of cinnamon 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.820
 or even some vanilla you add to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.380
 this step there or I will add 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.310
 walnut powder like these 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.470
 present in this form 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.840

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.500
 want more at that moment you in 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.519
 put in the preparation 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.630
 what you take vanilla ben 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.100
 you add a little vanilla from the 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.750
 preparation to add even the 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.390
 Orange Blossom 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.010
 You mix well for it 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.750
 soaking up the preparation 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.260
 once your preparation is fine 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.239
 to mix 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.000
 you will put it in a mold 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.170
 buttered so you take buttered mold 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.440
 like those hen theirs and advocates a 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.940
 mold to miss or mold like this 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.340
 you remove the spatula from the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.359
 preparation and you're going to sink 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:11.560
 your not repairing in like those 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:13.940

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.760
 we remove all the preparation and 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.359

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.310
 here 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.580
 and when you have steeped in 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.599
 put your baking tin in the oven 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:39.770
 that is 220 degrees during 25 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:43.280
 minutes after 25 minutes of cooking at 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.979
 220 Â° we get a cake like this 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.960
 very beautiful that went well so let 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.300
 the little thing to say then you would unroll it 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.159
 and finally you can enjoy it hot 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.720
 or even let it cool for the 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.190
