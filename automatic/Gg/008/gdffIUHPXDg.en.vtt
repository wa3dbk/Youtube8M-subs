gray<00:00:26.580> parts<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.420> used<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.840> black

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
gray parts that you see used to be black

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.839 
gray parts that you see used to be black
in<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.529> grays<00:00:28.830> letting<00:00:29.220> everybody<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.609> that

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
in the grays letting everybody know that

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.560 
in the grays letting everybody know that
there's<00:00:30.000> changes

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
there's changes

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.080 
there's changes
there's<00:00:31.109> roller<00:00:31.529> bearings<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.520> all<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
there's roller bearings so all the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
there's roller bearings so all the
moving<00:00:33.450> parts<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> mirage<00:00:34.170> right<00:00:34.410> now

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
moving parts in the mirage right now

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.290 
moving parts in the mirage right now
have<00:00:34.800> bearings<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.550> before<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.940> was<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
have bearings so before it was just a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
have bearings so before it was just a
plastic<00:00:36.660> bushing<00:00:36.989> or<00:00:37.079> something<00:00:37.440> yeah<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:38.040> was

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
plastic bushing or something yeah it was

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.280 
plastic bushing or something yeah it was
a<00:00:38.160> glass<00:00:38.610> reinforced<00:00:39.059> metal<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> stainless

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
a glass reinforced metal on a stainless

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
a glass reinforced metal on a stainless
steel<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.850> does<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.329> just

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
steel and so what it does now it just

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.270 
steel and so what it does now it just
reduces<00:00:42.660> friction<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.920> little<00:00:44.070> bit

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
reduces friction so it's a little bit

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.340 
reduces friction so it's a little bit
easier<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> pedal<00:00:45.059> should<00:00:45.690> last<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.260> bit

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
easier to pedal should last a little bit

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.760 
easier to pedal should last a little bit
longer<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> that's<00:00:48.660> an<00:00:48.960> upgrade<00:00:49.079> obviously

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
longer so that's an upgrade obviously

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.869 
longer so that's an upgrade obviously
because<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.370> spending<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> lot<00:00:50.850> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
because when you're spending a lot of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.459 
because when you're spending a lot of
time<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> water<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.660> pedaling<00:00:52.110> it's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
time in the water you're pedaling it's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
time in the water you're pedaling it's
just<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> refreshing<00:00:54.059> being

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
just a little bit of refreshing being

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.930 
just a little bit of refreshing being
introduced<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.930> little<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.260> easier<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.680> pedal

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
introduced a little bit easier to pedal

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
introduced a little bit easier to pedal
moving<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.660> seat<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.070> new

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
moving on the seat back so it's a new

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
moving on the seat back so it's a new
seat<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.670> we<00:01:00.300> used<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.719> kind<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.020> sit<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
seat back we used to kind of sit on a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.729 
seat back we used to kind of sit on a
pad<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.390> molded<00:01:03.840> Hall<00:01:04.140> right

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
pad that was on a the molded Hall right

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.010 
pad that was on a the molded Hall right
now<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:05.070> sitting<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.430> 3d<00:01:05.880> mesh<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
now you're sitting on 3d mesh so it's a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
now you're sitting on 3d mesh so it's a
hammock<00:01:07.409> style<00:01:07.770> seat<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.150> obviously

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
hammock style seat and then obviously

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
hammock style seat and then obviously
all<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> options<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.770> do

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
all the options that we do

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.460 
all the options that we do
so<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.580> seats<00:01:11.820> adjustable<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.140> height

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so this seats adjustable we have height

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.520 
so this seats adjustable we have height
adjustment<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.119> move<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.530> even

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
adjustment so this back can move up even

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
adjustment so this back can move up even
to<00:01:16.680> positions<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.670> front<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> adjustable<00:01:18.659> as

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
to positions the front is adjustable as

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
to positions the front is adjustable as
well<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> back<00:01:20.700> has<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
well and then you know the back has the

typical<00:01:21.270> lumbar<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.140> even<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> little

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
typical lumbar we even do it a little

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
typical lumbar we even do it a little
boa<00:01:23.340> system<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.000> adjust<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.509> lumbar

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659

no you crank it and it gets tighter you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
no you crank it and it gets tighter you
snap<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.790> releases<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.509> okay<00:01:30.810> great

yeah so now what we did you can sit up

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.010 
yeah so now what we did you can sit up
higher<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.310> athletic<00:01:35.430> stance<00:01:36.119> we're

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
higher it's a more athletic stance we're

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.330 
higher it's a more athletic stance we're
seeing<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.590> more<00:01:37.740> people<00:01:37.979> want<00:01:38.250> to

hatches it used to be a little curved a
little<00:01:47.130> rounded<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.790> totally<00:01:48.210> flat

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
right yeah we did we did an H bar in the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.709 
right yeah we did we did an H bar in the
years<00:02:02.340> past<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> pro

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
years past but it was just for the pro

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.480 
years past but it was just for the pro
angler<00:02:03.899> because

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
angler because

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.069 
angler because
pro<00:02:04.700> angler<00:02:04.820> was<00:02:05.060> kind<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.329> designed<00:02:05.780> for

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
pro angler was kind of designed for

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.440 
pro angler was kind of designed for
standing<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.579> mean<00:02:07.729> this<00:02:07.880> boat<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.300> not

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
standing and I mean this boat is not

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.690 
standing and I mean this boat is not
replacing<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.380> pro<00:02:09.619> angler<00:02:09.770> it's<00:02:10.340> not<00:02:10.550> going

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
replacing the pro angler it's not going

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.400 
replacing the pro angler it's not going
to<00:02:10.759> be<00:02:10.880> as<00:02:11.060> stable<00:02:11.390> as<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:11.630> pro<00:02:11.870> angler<00:02:11.959> but<00:02:12.319> if

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
to be as stable as a pro angler but if

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.229

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
guys have developed and this could be

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.759 
guys have developed and this could be
used<00:02:35.000> in<00:02:35.150> any<00:02:35.269> boat<00:02:35.569> right<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.380> oh<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.620> age

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
crates and they'd accessorize them for

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.210

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
around the sides so you can mount

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.460
