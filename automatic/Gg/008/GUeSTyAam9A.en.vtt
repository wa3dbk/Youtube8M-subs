00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
the new screenshots which I've not

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.710 
the new screenshots which I've not
actually<00:01:23.460> done<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> video<00:01:23.909> yet<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> guess

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
actually done a video yet so I guess

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.999 
actually done a video yet so I guess
I'll<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> analysis

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
I'll kind of do a little bit of analysis

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
I'll kind of do a little bit of analysis
right<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.479> first<00:01:27.689> image<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.259> can

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
right now so this first image you can

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
right now so this first image you can
see<00:01:28.439> there's<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.070> new<00:01:29.400> type<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.790> model<00:01:30.180> for

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
see there's like a new type of model for

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.359 
see there's like a new type of model for
the<00:01:30.450> cop<00:01:31.049> cars<00:01:31.320> there's<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.009> slightly

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the cop cars there's like slightly

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.910 
the cop cars there's like slightly
transparent<00:01:32.700> glass<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.540> top<00:01:33.750> also<00:01:34.650> one

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
transparent glass on the top also one

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.370 
transparent glass on the top also one
key<00:01:35.159> thing<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.720> wing<00:01:36.990> mirror<00:01:37.200> on

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
key thing to see is the wing mirror on

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.780 
key thing to see is the wing mirror on
the<00:01:37.409> left<00:01:37.770> hand<00:01:37.920> side<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> cop<00:01:38.460> car<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the left hand side of the cop car I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.690 
the left hand side of the cop car I
wonder<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:40.979> use<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
wonder if you can actually use that to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.010 
wonder if you can actually use that to
your<00:01:41.759> advantage<00:01:41.820> i'm<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.450> entirely<00:01:42.659> sure<00:01:42.840> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
your advantage i'm not entirely sure but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560 
your advantage i'm not entirely sure but
it<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> reflective<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.000> something

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it is reflective and that is something

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.999 
it is reflective and that is something
they<00:01:45.810> would<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.110> had<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.409> implement<00:01:46.649> into

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
they would have had to implement into

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.380 
they would have had to implement into
the<00:01:47.100> game<00:01:47.250> says<00:01:47.490> something<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.060> little<00:01:48.180> bit

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the game says something a little bit

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
the game says something a little bit
interesting<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.810> notice<00:01:49.369> stadium<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.549> looks

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
interesting to notice stadium what looks

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
interesting to notice stadium what looks
to<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> stadium<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.930> factory<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
to like to be a stadium or a factory in

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.499 
to like to be a stadium or a factory in
the<00:01:52.560> background<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.520> tires<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> lorry

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the background the tires on the lorry

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.030 
the background the tires on the lorry
look<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.140> they're<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.710> little<00:01:55.860> bit

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
look like they're going a little bit

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.190 
look like they're going a little bit
crazy<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.149> may<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.299> some<00:01:57.600> new<00:01:57.719> physics

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
crazy so there may be some new physics

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.230 
crazy so there may be some new physics
not<00:01:58.469> entirely<00:01:58.740> sure<00:01:58.860> also<00:01:59.369> by<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.090> way

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
not entirely sure also by the way

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.730 
not entirely sure also by the way

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
is there going to be a new mechanic in

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.920 
is there going to be a new mechanic in
GTA<00:02:49.650> 5<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.190> don't<00:02:50.549> know<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.239> it's<00:02:51.720> definitely

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
potential for fun okay so you see the

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.759 
potential for fun okay so you see the
little<00:03:11.670> stream<00:03:12.090> /<00:03:12.359> River<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:13.170> into<00:03:13.379> a<00:03:13.409> huge

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
little stream / River going into a huge

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.349

cavern<00:03:14.159> up<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.549> left-hand<00:03:14.909> side<00:03:14.970> that

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
cavern up on the left-hand side that

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.539 
cavern up on the left-hand side that
does<00:03:15.569> look<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.109> bit<00:03:16.349> Karen<00:03:16.650> just<00:03:17.459> my
