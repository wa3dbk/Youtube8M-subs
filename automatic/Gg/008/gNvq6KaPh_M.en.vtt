00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.610
 hi to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.690
 minute box a little bit special 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.849
 as you know we have exceeded 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.559
 today the 130 thousand subscribers it's 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.690
 a nice growth we had seven 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.699
 past years and I want you all 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 thank for that now we're not going 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.300
 lie to yourself growth that's it's coming 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.490
 and as the leader of the votes cast 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.880
 I think it's good to induce a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.369
 little bit of time change I 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.590
 suggest I propose is actually 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.360
 I'm signing up the idea all the box makers go 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.100
 floor now shoes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.059
 others and we will swap the streets 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.270
 to make more varied missions 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 like that pay mix talents but I 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.190
 think it's good news and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.850
 pixel drummer chewbacca versus link 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.850
 Let's go 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.490

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.590
 composed a song from the theme of 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.300
 thymine fight in pokemon ruby omega 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.220
 and sapphire alpha listens to a tat 0 votes 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.680
 and it's not an original composition 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.850
 but as a result there is a music that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.729
 is already in fact it really makes me 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.520
 work so ok ok because it's a game for 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.290

 of one we sleep and soul to a manga putting 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.620
 forward a young man who finds himself 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.270
 mixed with a war between angels and 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.800
