video i am going to show you how to use
a<00:00:06.450> clicker<00:00:06.990> now<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.280> something<00:00:08.550> that

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
a clicker now this is something that

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.390 
a clicker now this is something that
I've<00:00:09.330> talked<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:10.019> many<00:00:10.530> times<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.280> my

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
I've talked about many times in my

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.940 
I've talked about many times in my
videos<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.570> haven't<00:00:12.900> taken<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.500> time<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
videos but I haven't taken the time to

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.279 
videos but I haven't taken the time to
explain<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.790> clicker<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.900> figured

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
explain what a clicker is and I figured

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.070 
explain what a clicker is and I figured
it'd<00:00:16.920> probably<00:00:17.340> be<00:00:17.609> useful<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.390> did<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
it'd probably be useful if I did that is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.460 
it'd probably be useful if I did that is
so<00:00:19.500> anyhow<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.820> what<00:00:21.180> acceptor<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> if

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
so anyhow this is what acceptor is if

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.890 
so anyhow this is what acceptor is if
you<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.769> see<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:24.660> box

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
you can see that it's just a little box

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.750 
you can see that it's just a little box
that<00:00:25.140> has<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.590> metal<00:00:25.740> tab<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.609> when<00:00:26.730> you

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
that has a metal tab in it and when you

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
that has a metal tab in it and when you
press<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.539> makes<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.080> noise<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.160> way

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
press it it makes this noise the way

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.740 
press it it makes this noise the way
that<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.760> use<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> clicker<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.679> we<00:00:31.679> click<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
that we use a clicker is we click it and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
that we use a clicker is we click it and
we<00:00:33.750> give<00:00:33.960> our<00:00:34.140> dog<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.530> treat<00:00:34.559> right<00:00:35.430> afterwards

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
we give our dog a treat right afterwards

00:00:36.030 --> 00:01:02.290 
we give our dog a treat right afterwards
so<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> looks<00:00:36.719> something<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.320> this

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
see you know when I made that so that's

see you know when I made that so that's
what<00:01:29.910> you're<00:01:30.090> gonna<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.700> way<00:01:32.730> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
what you're gonna do and the way that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.740 
what you're gonna do and the way that
you<00:01:33.210> use<00:01:33.510> it<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:34.440> training<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:35.600> when<00:01:36.600> your

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
you use it when training is when your

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
you use it when training is when your
dog<00:01:36.900> does<00:01:36.930> something<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.830> like<00:01:38.040> you're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
dog does something that you like you're

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
dog does something that you like you're
going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.300> click<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:41.210> treat<00:01:42.210> you're<00:01:42.750> going<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
going to click and treat you're going to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.820 
going to click and treat you're going to
treat<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:44.810> cliq<00:01:45.810> will<00:01:45.990> always<00:01:46.410> follow<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
treat and the cliq will always follow a

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.680 
treat and the cliq will always follow a
treat<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.580> click<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.450> treat

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
treat so if you click you have to treat

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.540 
treat so if you click you have to treat
because<00:01:49.140> you're<00:01:49.470> making<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.950> promise<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.369> your

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
because you're making a promise to your

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.790 
because you're making a promise to your
dog<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.060> says<00:01:51.330> you're<00:01:52.110> giving<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.590> treat

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
dog that says you're giving them a treat

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.160 
dog that says you're giving them a treat
they<00:01:53.100> rely<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.640> promise<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.660> like<00:01:54.900> let's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
they rely on that promise so like let's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.380 
they rely on that promise so like let's
say<00:01:55.260> I'm<00:01:55.470> her<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.860> beg<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.490> hey<00:01:58.010> come<00:01:59.010> on

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
all you see your sister winner ok so the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.540 
all you see your sister winner ok so the
click<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.330> really<00:02:06.750> saying<00:02:07.020> hey<00:02:07.830> good<00:02:08.130> dog<00:02:08.340> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
click is really saying hey good dog I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.970 
click is really saying hey good dog I
like<00:02:08.730> what<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> did<00:02:09.060> right<00:02:09.360> there<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.860> know

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
like what you did right there you know

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:18.410 
like what you did right there you know
that's<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.340> wanted<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.880> do

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.270 

so<00:02:19.420> anyway<00:02:19.840> that's<00:02:20.140> how<00:02:20.439> you<00:02:20.500> use<00:02:20.829> a<00:02:20.859> clicker

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
so anyway that's how you use a clicker

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.699 
so anyway that's how you use a clicker
it's<00:02:21.819> really<00:02:22.209> really<00:02:22.629> simple<00:02:22.659> so<00:02:23.349> if<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.530> dog

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
it's really really simple so if the dog

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.860 
it's really really simple so if the dog
does<00:02:23.980> something<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.670> like<00:02:25.299> while<00:02:25.750> you're

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
does something you like while you're

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.720 
does something you like while you're
training<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.709> moment<00:02:27.159> that<00:02:27.189> she<00:02:27.519> does

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
training and the moment that she does

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.729 
training and the moment that she does
that<00:02:27.879> you're<00:02:27.969> going<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.239> click<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.930> treat<00:02:29.469> and

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
that you're going to click and treat and

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.520 
that you're going to click and treat and
it's<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:30.609> just<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:31.120> simple<00:02:31.480> way<00:02:31.659> of<00:02:31.689> telling

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
it's really just a simple way of telling

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.530 
it's really just a simple way of telling
your<00:02:32.650> dog<00:02:32.829> good<00:02:33.459> dog<00:02:33.519> I<00:02:33.939> like<00:02:34.209> what<00:02:34.389> you<00:02:34.510> did

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
your dog good dog I like what you did

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.720 
your dog good dog I like what you did
that's<00:02:34.989> exactly<00:02:35.650> what<00:02:35.889> I<00:02:35.920> wanted<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.489> do

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
that's exactly what I wanted you to do

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.690 
that's exactly what I wanted you to do
and<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:38.200> reason<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.799> clicker<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.430> so

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
and the reason that the clicker is so

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.729 
and the reason that the clicker is so
effective<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.389> because<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.959> same<00:02:41.349> sound

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
effective is because it's same sound

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.399 
effective is because it's same sound
every<00:02:42.430> time<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.819> click<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.959> makes<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
every time you click it it makes the

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.679 
every time you click it it makes the
same<00:02:44.620> sound<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.790> marker<00:02:46.150> where<00:02:46.180> let<00:02:46.569> me

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
same sound and a marker where let me

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.720 
same sound and a marker where let me
explain<00:02:46.930> real<00:02:47.079> quick<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.439> marker<00:02:47.829> word<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.370> any

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
explain real quick a marker word is any

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.610 
explain real quick a marker word is any
word<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.120> you're<00:02:49.510> using<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:50.109> place<00:02:50.319> of<00:02:50.349> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
word that you're using in place of the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.140 
word that you're using in place of the
clicker<00:02:50.889> so<00:02:51.549> if<00:02:51.609> you<00:02:51.700> don't<00:02:51.879> have<00:02:52.030> your

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
clicker so if you don't have your

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.569 
clicker so if you don't have your
clicker<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.720> might<00:02:52.900> use<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.349> word<00:02:53.560> yes<00:02:54.189> or

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
clicker you might use the word yes or

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.879 
clicker you might use the word yes or
good<00:02:54.819> or<00:02:54.849> whooping<00:02:55.629> are<00:02:55.900> something<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.709> you

good or whooping are something that you

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.530 
good or whooping are something that you
completely<00:02:57.280> made<00:02:57.790> up<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.150> doesn't<00:02:58.239> matter
