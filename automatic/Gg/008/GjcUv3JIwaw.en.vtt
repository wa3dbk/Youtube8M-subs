00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
what it's all about these wheels are

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.840 
what it's all about these wheels are
super<00:01:02.489> gummy<00:01:03.619> not<00:01:04.619> super<00:01:05.070> slick<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.729> would

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
super gummy not super slick as you would

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.640 
super gummy not super slick as you would
think<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.900> 40<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.350> 50<00:01:07.619> feet

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
think you know they 40 or 50 feet

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.340 

this<00:01:27.369> sounds<00:01:27.700> great<00:01:27.820> they<00:01:28.330> they<00:01:28.900> don't<00:01:29.170> really

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780
