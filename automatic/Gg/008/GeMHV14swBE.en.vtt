00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 very good monsters here I bring a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.120
 new dedicated information and some 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:15.389
 speculations as always you already know 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.369
 see many times that once it leaked 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.199
 a song a bit of a song 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.180
 called saer the instagram with which 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.619
 we can intuit that it could be 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.689
 indeed a song by Lady Gaga 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.830
 our tray that in the absence of always 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.469
 I heard it said the cursor is not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.680
 has been able to let see, so to speak, the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.360
 own lady gaga that song but this 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.070
 sanction does not start I believe in the contract 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.200
 record is a notation title 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.870
 that at least it was spoken in the pop era 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.620
 about this song although when I was 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.059
 everything had to conclude with good guys 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.820
 because it was one of the songs that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.540
 rumored already high 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.500
 that would be a discard and if it's going to have 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.370
 some of us will do more record work 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.690
 What is known is that it has 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.460
 registered in asia or under baby and a 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.200
 song that is called martÃ­n and is the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.450
 world sounds bad is produced by 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:22.510
 by fernando garibay gave the indicated 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.780
 garden there are two possible two the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.970
 discount to see I want that I think no 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.040

 past may be a new song ask 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.280
 low withdrawal not for services that 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.690
 we already know everyone, then it 's like 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.340
 what 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.320
 to call a good place for well 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.240
 say it but what most calls me the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.550
 attention is that it is composed and 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.660
 produced by fernando garibay and if it is 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.130
 a song for one of the bow 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.080
 record that has been registered with 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.930
 would already sign officially 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.420
 fernando garibay would be with 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.280

 someone that I have not seen yet and now 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 we're going to be rumors that I said in the 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.250
 previous video that I wrote them down and 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.319
 final I went rolling and did not tell 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.630
 see about the new album was rumored 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.489
 that was going balance was working eight 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.620
 songs of these moments rumored by 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.569
 the world music awards that is 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.849
 working the formations and that you were going to 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.470
 choose in 2016 other than that of the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.110
 rumors that point to the new album 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.680
 of fight is going to be a trilogy three 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.690
 discs in one that according to what it says this 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.170
 source is that these three discs are going to 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.810
 be and they will go if they are not going to launch 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.849
 soon but not all three at once 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.310
 but one for example let's say and such that 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.040
 today another one in five or six months and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.690
 the next others a year then yes that 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.670
 would frame that if you throw it like this 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.340
 way 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.290
 by volumes so to speak you follow 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.930
 grateful 2016 but I personally 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.880
 I hope that national record in 2015 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.060
 no records and new music by the end of 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.730
 2015 or early 2016 with which 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.280
 expected to tour a whole year I 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.180
 it seems a bit late sincerely 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.370
 We will see to see if it is confirmed too 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.530
 all the data according to this information 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.930
 these rumors the trilogy of the new 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.730
 Lady Gaga's record work would be 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.709
 with four songs near volume 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.330
 eight times in general volume 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.580
 eight songs in the second volume and 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.860
 eight subjects in the third volume according to 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.930
 it says it would not appear that they were going to be etc 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.239
 but there are eight songs but long 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.700
 already talked about how he will repeat 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.410
 at the beginning of the age how I wanted 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.419
 do some cd an interview and I wanted to 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.169
 do something similar no songs that 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.169
 were long 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.810
 and said this if you want to transform 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.880
 all the most arising on a new 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.880
 disco the present the future all this 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.750
