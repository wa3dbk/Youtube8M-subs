they get these cool blue looking seeds
and<00:00:37.329> once<00:00:37.450> you<00:00:37.510> got<00:00:37.660> them<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:39.489> pop<00:00:39.550> might

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
and once you got them you just pop might

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.020 
and once you got them you just pop might
normal<00:00:40.469> exactly<00:00:41.469> the<00:00:41.590> same<00:00:41.820> yeah<00:00:42.820> they<00:00:42.940> do

normal exactly the same yeah they do
take<00:00:43.210> a<00:00:43.270> while<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.449> grow<00:00:43.719> which<00:00:44.050> is<00:00:44.079> good<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
take a while to grow which is good and

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.650 
take a while to grow which is good and
then<00:00:45.820> once<00:00:45.969> you're<00:00:46.120> fully<00:00:46.270> grown<00:00:46.360> you<00:00:46.629> can

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
then once you're fully grown you can

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.600 
then once you're fully grown you can
still<00:00:46.989> see<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.350> ground<00:00:47.559> by<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.770> year<00:00:48.129> well

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
still see the ground by the year well

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.790 
still see the ground by the year well
like<00:00:48.789> the<00:00:48.879> brown<00:00:49.120> crop<00:00:49.480> which<00:00:50.289> makes<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.649> bit

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
like the brown crop which makes a bit

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.819 
like the brown crop which makes a bit
easier<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:52.300> won't<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.079> break<00:00:53.350> him

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
easier now won't you break him

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.240 
easier now won't you break him
you<00:00:54.579> get<00:00:54.730> one<00:00:54.910> diamond<00:00:55.180> from<00:00:55.420> each<00:00:55.539> one<00:00:56.250> which

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
you get one diamond from each one which

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.549 
you get one diamond from each one which
is<00:00:57.460> glad<00:00:58.269> there's<00:00:58.480> not<00:00:58.600> more<00:00:58.809> because<00:00:59.440> you

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
is glad there's not more because you

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.229 
is glad there's not more because you
don't<00:00:59.710> really<00:00:59.800> need<00:00:59.980> it<00:01:00.039> and<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.910> be<00:01:01.030> honest

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
don't really need it and to be honest

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.610 
don't really need it and to be honest
it'd<00:01:01.359> be<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.510> little<00:01:01.750> bit<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.050> source<00:01:02.320> we<00:01:02.500> say

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
it'd be a little bit the source we say

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.160 
it'd be a little bit the source we say
overpowered<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:04.180> for<00:01:04.660> every<00:01:04.809> one<00:01:05.019> you

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
overpowered because for every one you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.530 
overpowered because for every one you
use<00:01:05.379> I<00:01:05.680> just<00:01:06.160> planted<00:01:06.550> all<00:01:06.760> them<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.360> go<00:01:07.480> you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
use I just planted all them you go you

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.749 
use I just planted all them you go you
get<00:01:07.720> eight<00:01:07.870> so<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.440> use<00:01:08.950> one<00:01:09.190> diamond<00:01:09.430> one

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
get eight so you use one diamond one

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.550 
get eight so you use one diamond one
seed<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.270> then<00:01:10.630> eventually<00:01:10.900> when<00:01:11.259> they<00:01:11.380> grow

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
seed and then eventually when they grow

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.830 
seed and then eventually when they grow
you<00:01:11.799> will<00:01:12.250> get<00:01:12.490> eight<00:01:12.610> diamonds<00:01:13.030> so<00:01:13.659> it's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
you will get eight diamonds so it's

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.499 
you will get eight diamonds so it's
quite<00:01:14.020> high<00:01:14.259> yielding<00:01:14.650> thing<00:01:15.210> I've<00:01:16.210> got<00:01:16.270> quite

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
quite high yielding thing I've got quite

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.100 
quite high yielding thing I've got quite
a<00:01:16.570> lot<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.750> planted<00:01:17.080> ear<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.600> other<00:01:19.900> thing

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
a lot of planted ear now the other thing

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.710 
a lot of planted ear now the other thing
which<00:01:20.290> doesn't<00:01:20.710> work<00:01:20.860> which<00:01:21.549> not<00:01:21.759> never<00:01:21.939> it's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
which doesn't work which not never it's

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.060 
which doesn't work which not never it's
meant<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.200> be<00:01:23.350> like<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:23.590> but<00:01:23.799> I'm<00:01:23.920> actually

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
meant to be like this but I'm actually

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.490 
meant to be like this but I'm actually
glad<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.549> doesn't<00:01:24.700> he's<00:01:25.630> bone<00:01:25.960> meal<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.259> can't

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
glad it doesn't he's bone meal you can't

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.319 
glad it doesn't he's bone meal you can't
actually<00:01:26.829> grow<00:01:27.070> normal<00:01:27.820> seats<00:01:28.030> like<00:01:28.240> the

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
actually grow normal seats like the

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.410 
actually grow normal seats like the
easier<00:01:28.570> which<00:01:28.659> I'm<00:01:28.780> sure<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.079> know<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:31.270> you

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
easier which I'm sure you know if you

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.960 
easier which I'm sure you know if you
right-clicking<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.320> seems<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.590> be<00:01:32.650> broke<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
right-clicking it seems to be broke you

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.880 
right-clicking it seems to be broke you
will<00:01:34.090> actually<00:01:34.240> grow<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:35.439> then<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:35.649> can<00:01:35.770> just

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
will actually grow and then you can just

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.469 
will actually grow and then you can just
harvest<00:01:36.040> them<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:37.750> these<00:01:38.100> don't<00:01:39.329> its<00:01:40.329> again

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
harvest them what these don't its again

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.880 
harvest them what these don't its again
I'm<00:01:40.630> quite<00:01:40.810> because<00:01:41.110> otherwise<00:01:41.409> it'd<00:01:41.680> be<00:01:41.860> a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
I'm quite because otherwise it'd be a

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.359 
I'm quite because otherwise it'd be a
little<00:01:42.220> bit<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:43.030> little<00:01:43.360> bit<00:01:43.479> too<00:01:43.689> much<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:44.140> think

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
little bit a little bit too much I think

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.850 
little bit a little bit too much I think
so<00:01:45.369> be<00:01:45.490> honest<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.259> yeah<00:01:47.439> that's<00:01:47.649> that's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
so be honest so yeah that's that's

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.719 
so be honest so yeah that's that's
pretty<00:01:48.100> much<00:01:48.310> it

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
pretty much it

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.130 
pretty much it
get<00:01:48.939> some<00:01:49.090> diamonds<00:01:49.450> which<00:01:49.630> are<00:01:49.780> pretty

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
get some diamonds which are pretty

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.899 
get some diamonds which are pretty
easily<00:01:50.320> obtainable<00:01:50.770> just<00:01:51.219> perfect<00:01:51.549> plaintiff

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
easily obtainable just perfect plaintiff

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.910 
easily obtainable just perfect plaintiff
on<00:01:52.090> some<00:01:52.930> seeds<00:01:53.200> which<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.560> certainly<00:01:53.829> not

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
on some seeds which is certainly not

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
to kill this thing quickly wrap it click

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.230 
to kill this thing quickly wrap it click
him<00:04:22.160> it's<00:04:23.160> got<00:04:23.250> quite<00:04:23.400> obviously<00:04:23.789> duty

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
him it's got quite obviously duty

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.510 
him it's got quite obviously duty
spewing<00:04:24.479> out<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.900> Dimond<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:25.979> quite<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.340> lot

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
spewing out that Dimond it's quite a lot

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.880 
spewing out that Dimond it's quite a lot
of<00:04:26.580> armor<00:04:27.090> now<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:27.930> also<00:04:28.169> think<00:04:28.530> what<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.710> does

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
of armor now I also think what it does

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.620 
of armor now I also think what it does
it<00:04:29.520> doesn't<00:04:29.729> just<00:04:29.849> let<00:04:29.909> you<00:04:30.000> bill

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
it doesn't just let you bill

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.080 
it doesn't just let you bill
I<00:04:30.660> believe<00:04:31.380> if<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.220> remember<00:04:32.250> correctly<00:04:32.760> it

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
I believe if I remember correctly it

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.300 
I believe if I remember correctly it
actually<00:04:33.390> spawns<00:04:33.780> them<00:04:33.990> in<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.200> world<00:04:34.410> but<00:04:35.250> I

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
actually spawns them in the world but I

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.280 
actually spawns them in the world but I
also<00:04:35.580> think<00:04:35.880> they're<00:04:36.030> quite<00:04:36.180> rare<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.720> find<00:04:36.750> so

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
also think they're quite rare to find so

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.240 
also think they're quite rare to find so
it's<00:04:37.410> not<00:04:37.530> something<00:04:37.740> you're<00:04:37.920> gonna<00:04:38.010> come

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
it's not something you're gonna come

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.470 
it's not something you're gonna come
across<00:04:38.370> every<00:04:38.790> two<00:04:38.970> minutes

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
across every two minutes

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.800 
across every two minutes
I'm<00:04:40.020> too<00:04:40.230> much<00:04:40.440> exploring<00:04:40.830> on<00:04:41.760> this<00:04:42.000> they<00:04:42.540> save

I'm too much exploring on this they save

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.400 
I'm too much exploring on this they save
so<00:04:43.110> they<00:04:43.950> might<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.340> who<00:04:45.060> knows<00:04:45.290> but<00:04:46.290> yeah

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
if you were playing that single play you

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.540 
if you were playing that single play you
got<00:06:48.600> T<00:06:48.780> and<00:06:48.900> C<00:06:48.990> Block<00:06:49.200> I<00:06:49.230> said<00:06:49.530> sure<00:06:49.710> so<00:06:49.890> yeah

got T and C Block I said sure so yeah
that<00:06:51.030> definitely<00:06:51.240> give<00:06:51.540> down<00:06:51.720> a<00:06:51.750> go<00:06:52.790> something

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
that definitely give down a go something

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.670 
that definitely give down a go something
again<00:06:53.970> that<00:06:54.360> I<00:06:54.390> think<00:06:54.450> will<00:06:54.780> probably<00:06:55.170> work

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
again that I think will probably work

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.280 
again that I think will probably work
quite<00:06:56.040> well<00:06:56.070> in<00:06:56.370> single<00:06:56.670> player<00:06:56.850> and<00:06:57.360> it's<00:06:58.140> not

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
quite well in single player and it's not

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.140 
quite well in single player and it's not
massive<00:06:58.890> overpowered<00:06:59.550> it's<00:06:59.700> not<00:06:59.850> sort<00:07:00.090> of

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
massive overpowered it's not sort of

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.540 
massive overpowered it's not sort of
just<00:07:00.960> diamond<00:07:01.380> stuff<00:07:01.590> is<00:07:01.710> on<00:07:01.830> for<00:07:01.950> that<00:07:02.100> so<00:07:02.400> I

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
just diamond stuff is on for that so I

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.800 
just diamond stuff is on for that so I
think<00:07:02.700> for<00:07:03.030> use<00:07:03.240> as<00:07:03.390> a<00:07:03.420> single<00:07:03.720> player

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
think for use as a single player

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.110 
think for use as a single player
actually<00:07:03.990> which<00:07:04.710> is<00:07:04.830> good<00:07:05.010> so<00:07:05.790> it<00:07:05.850> will<00:07:05.970> me<00:07:06.060> on

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
actually which is good so it will me on

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:15.129 
actually which is good so it will me on
to<00:07:06.240> the<00:07:06.300> next<00:07:06.360> one

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:15.139 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.199 

you
