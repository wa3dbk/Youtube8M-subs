00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
togs body and legs are broken and the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.900 
togs body and legs are broken and the
price<00:00:10.530> from<00:00:10.769> Bob<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.010> Lumbridge<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.639> really

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
price from Bob and Lumbridge is really

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.850 
price from Bob and Lumbridge is really
expensive<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> want<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.080> get<00:00:13.259> an<00:00:13.410> armor

stand which is level 55 right now mold

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.150 
stand which is level 55 right now mold
50<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:18.930> thought<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.470> would<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> perfect

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
50 so I thought this would be a perfect

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.620 
50 so I thought this would be a perfect
time<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> since<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.000> need<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> repair<00:00:21.480> it

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
time to do it since I need to repair it

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.550 
time to do it since I need to repair it
but<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.439> giant<00:00:23.279> skeletons<00:00:23.990> pretty<00:00:24.990> often<00:00:25.410> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but I giant skeletons pretty often you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560 
but I giant skeletons pretty often you
can<00:00:25.710> get<00:00:25.890> maybe<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.189> or<00:00:26.550> two<00:00:26.730> per<00:00:27.090> inventory

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
can get maybe one or two per inventory

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.720 
can get maybe one or two per inventory
they<00:00:27.689> drop<00:00:27.930> long<00:00:28.199> bones<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.460> see<00:00:29.609> I've

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
they drop long bones as you can see I've

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.120 
they drop long bones as you can see I've
saved<00:00:29.939> them<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.510> curved<00:00:31.289> bones<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.740> super

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
saved them up and curved bones are super

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.190 
saved them up and curved bones are super
rare<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.460> though<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.840> gives<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.079> little

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
rare on though I think it gives a little

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
construction as long as you're level 30

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.639 
construction as long as you're level 30
and<00:01:40.159> here<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.520> 28<00:01:41.970> bones<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:43.470> out

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and here we go from 28 bones and I'm out

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.300 
and here we go from 28 bones and I'm out
one<00:01:43.890> oh<00:01:43.920> three<00:01:44.220> oh<00:01:44.340> four<00:01:44.970> -<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:46.100> let's<00:01:47.100> see

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
one oh three oh four - and let's see

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.830 
one oh three oh four - and let's see
what<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> am<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.030> Wow

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.959 

Paulo<00:01:51.840> 53<00:01:52.649> construction<00:01:55.310> 145,000<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.430> I'm

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
Paulo 53 construction 145,000 so I'm

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.880 
Paulo 53 construction 145,000 so I'm
pretty<00:01:57.210> sure<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.479> give<00:01:57.630> 1.5<00:01:58.229> pay<00:01:58.439> each<00:01:58.680> which

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
pretty sure they give 1.5 pay each which

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.510 
pretty sure they give 1.5 pay each which
makes<00:01:59.159> sense

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
makes sense

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.249 
makes sense
28<00:01:59.969> times<00:02:00.149> 1.5<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:02.960> 1442<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.350> yeah<00:02:04.530> 42<00:02:05.040> plus<00:02:06.259> 103

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
28 times 1.5 is 1442 so yeah 42 plus 103

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.210 
28 times 1.5 is 1442 so yeah 42 plus 103
equals<00:02:07.560> 145<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:09.440> make

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
equals 145 so make

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.510 
equals 145 so make
I<00:02:11.390> hate<00:02:12.390> these<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:13.320> just<00:02:13.650> turn<00:02:13.770> rev<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.130> off<00:02:14.280> um

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
I hate these you just turn rev it off um

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.610 
I hate these you just turn rev it off um
so<00:02:15.270> I'm<00:02:15.330> going<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.810> my<00:02:15.930> next<00:02:16.170> inventory

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
so I'm going to go get my next inventory

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.140 
so I'm going to go get my next inventory
and<00:02:16.740> I'll<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.920> able<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> carry<00:02:17.580> my<00:02:17.730> curved<00:02:17.940> bone

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and I'll be able to carry my curved bone

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.350 
and I'll be able to carry my curved bone
-<00:02:18.590> okay<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.520> my<00:02:20.640> second<00:02:20.970> Victoria<00:02:21.270> I'm

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
- okay here with my second Victoria I'm

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.640 
- okay here with my second Victoria I'm
actually<00:02:21.510> going<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.810> drop<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.170> curved<00:02:22.380> bone

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
actually going to drop the curved bone

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.170 
actually going to drop the curved bone
because<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.280> want<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.430> see<00:02:23.550> how<00:02:23.670> much<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:23.970> by

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
because I want to see how much it is by

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.940 
because I want to see how much it is by
itself<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.690> don't<00:02:24.750> want<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.990> have<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.740> math

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
itself I don't want to have to do math

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.070 
itself I don't want to have to do math
after<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.790> Oh

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
after so Oh

after so Oh
53<00:02:28.650> um<00:02:29.420> 145<00:02:30.420> thousand<00:02:30.840> experience<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.760> he

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
53 um 145 thousand experience and he

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.790 
53 um 145 thousand experience and he
says<00:02:32.940> he'll<00:02:33.120> give<00:02:33.240> me<00:02:33.270> 20,000<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.440> 20

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
says he'll give me 20,000 so I have 20

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.790 
says he'll give me 20,000 so I have 20
left<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:36.950> boom<00:02:37.950> now<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> little<00:02:38.640> 55<00:02:39.620> which<00:02:40.620> is

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
left and boom now a little 55 which is

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.790 
left and boom now a little 55 which is
what<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.010> need<00:02:41.130> for<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.460> armor<00:02:41.700> sin<00:02:41.910> and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
what I need for the armor sin and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.320 
what I need for the armor sin and
125,000<00:02:43.800> experience<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.430> I'm<00:02:44.520> 9,000<00:02:45.120> off<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
125,000 experience so I'm 9,000 off the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.620 
125,000 experience so I'm 9,000 off the
next<00:02:45.570> level<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:47.010> let's<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.180> what<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> curve

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
next level so let's see what the curve

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.330 
next level so let's see what the curve
bun<00:02:48.870> gets<00:02:49.050> me<00:02:49.260> I'm<00:02:49.350> not<00:02:49.470> sure<00:02:49.620> if<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:49.830> more<00:02:50.190> or

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
bun gets me I'm not sure if it's more or

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.760 
bun gets me I'm not sure if it's more or
less<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.670> should<00:02:50.910> be<00:02:51.060> more<00:02:51.300> because<00:02:51.600> it's<00:02:51.780> 50

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
less it should be more because it's 50

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.949 
less it should be more because it's 50
times<00:02:53.010> more<00:02:53.160> rare<00:02:53.459> oh<00:02:53.670> yeah<00:02:53.970> it'll<00:02:54.690> give<00:02:54.840> me

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
times more rare oh yeah it'll give me

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.210 
times more rare oh yeah it'll give me
two<00:02:55.170> K<00:02:56.450> once<00:02:57.450> 75<00:02:58.020> roams<00:02:58.740> press<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.130> wrong

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
two K once 75 roams press the wrong

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
two K once 75 roams press the wrong
button<00:03:01.760> from<00:03:02.760> 125<00:03:03.300> we<00:03:03.510> got<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.810> me<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:05.820> point<00:03:06.030> to

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
button from 125 we got to me to point to

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.050 
button from 125 we got to me to point to
K<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.660> think<00:03:07.080> okay<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.620> from<00:03:08.370> all<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.640> bones<00:03:08.850> I

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
K I think okay so from all the bones I

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.020 
K I think okay so from all the bones I
got<00:03:09.090> 50<00:03:09.600> K<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.110> as<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.490> can<00:03:11.580> see<00:03:11.640> from<00:03:11.850> my

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
got 50 K and as you can see from my

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.330 
got 50 K and as you can see from my
strenght<00:03:12.270> exp<00:03:13.250> whoa<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.700> got<00:03:14.880> me<00:03:15.000> um<00:03:15.170> seventy

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
strenght exp whoa it got me um seventy

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.100 
strenght exp whoa it got me um seventy
four<00:03:17.340> thousand<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.269> yeah<00:03:18.570> seventy<00:03:18.930> four

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
four thousand so yeah seventy four

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.449 
four thousand so yeah seventy four
thousand<00:03:19.500> experience<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.820> know<00:03:21.660> about

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
thousand experience so I know about

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.290 
thousand experience so I know about
exactly<00:03:23.459> how<00:03:23.610> much<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.880> trained<00:03:24.120> there<00:03:24.269> I

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
exactly how much I trained there I

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.570 
exactly how much I trained there I
started<00:03:24.720> back<00:03:24.900> maybe<00:03:25.080> 1.9<00:03:28.040> 1.9<00:03:29.040> as<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.459> can

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
started back maybe 1.9 1.9 as you can

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.930 
started back maybe 1.9 1.9 as you can
see<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> started<00:03:30.090> doing<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.450> math<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.140> got

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
see I started doing the math but I got

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.449 
see I started doing the math but I got
maybe<00:03:32.940> five<00:03:33.360> point<00:03:34.200> two<00:03:34.290> million<00:03:34.709> experience

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
maybe five point two million experience

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.970 
maybe five point two million experience
training<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.850> giant<00:03:36.150> skeletons<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.320> if<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.800> do

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
training a giant skeletons so if you do

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.650 
training a giant skeletons so if you do
and<00:03:38.420> how<00:03:39.420> many<00:03:39.890> 74,000<00:03:40.910> 74,000<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.540> you

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
and how many 74,000 74,000 and you

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.490 
and how many 74,000 74,000 and you
divide<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:42.959> by<00:03:43.290> five<00:03:43.799> point<00:03:44.190> two<00:03:44.340> million

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
divide that by five point two million

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.310 
divide that by five point two million
you<00:03:46.500> get<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.920> which<00:03:47.480> saying<00:03:48.480> for<00:03:48.810> every<00:03:48.959> one

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
you get this which saying for every one

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.420 
you get this which saying for every one
XP<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.709> get<00:03:49.890> in<00:03:49.980> strength<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.519> get<00:03:50.970> point<00:03:52.430> 0.01

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
XP I get in strength I get point 0.01

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.150 
XP I get in strength I get point 0.01
for<00:03:53.880> construction<00:03:54.570> XP<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.200> that's<00:03:55.860> pretty

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
for construction XP so that's pretty

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.210 
for construction XP so that's pretty
nice<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.580> didn't<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.030> pay<00:03:57.209> for<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:57.540> um<00:03:57.780> so

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
nice I didn't have to pay for this um so

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.650 
nice I didn't have to pay for this um so
if<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.280> guys<00:03:59.430> want<00:03:59.670> train<00:03:59.880> construction<00:04:00.450> just

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
if you guys want train construction just

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.560 
if you guys want train construction just
get<00:04:00.810> over<00:04:01.220> 5<00:04:02.220> ml<00:04:02.459> strength<00:04:02.700> XP<00:04:03.030> at<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.269> giant

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
get over 5 ml strength XP at the giant

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.060 
get over 5 ml strength XP at the giant
skeletons<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.080> by<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.260> time<00:04:04.470> get<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.920> you

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
skeletons and by the time get that you

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.610 
skeletons and by the time get that you
should<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.430> enough<00:04:05.700> XP<00:04:06.330> in<00:04:06.540> long<00:04:07.110> bones<00:04:07.410> to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
should have enough XP in long bones to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.990 
should have enough XP in long bones to
get<00:04:09.380> 74,000<00:04:10.380> about<00:04:10.590> construction<00:04:11.250> space<00:04:11.760> so
