this is about all this is about process
most<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.400> paintings<00:01:26.700> were<00:01:27.390> about<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.900> fact

all my paintings are about process

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.460 
all my paintings are about process

of<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.190> things<00:02:49.430> about<00:02:49.610> an<00:02:49.940> abstract<00:02:50.360> painting

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
of the things about an abstract painting

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.610 
of the things about an abstract painting
is<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.430> does<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.580> resonate<00:02:53.140> does<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.290> resin

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
is is is does it resonate does it resin

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.380 
is is is does it resonate does it resin
so<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:55.040> may<00:02:55.190> not<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.430> can't<00:02:55.760> make<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:55.970> general

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.270 
discussion with this painting that I

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
could resonate with so so therefore the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.610

painting<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.070> when<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:12.760> walk<00:04:13.030> looked<00:04:13.300> at<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> 20

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
painting of when I walk looked at a 20

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.360 
painting of when I walk looked at a 20
and<00:04:13.960> other<00:04:14.140> times<00:04:14.380> but<00:04:14.740> I<00:04:14.800> always<00:04:15.010> said<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.310> was

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
and other times but I always said it was

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.070 
and other times but I always said it was
an<00:04:15.520> honest<00:04:15.850> painting<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.450> thought<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.870> thought

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
an honest painting I thought I thought

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.570 
an honest painting I thought I thought
it<00:04:17.230> was<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.380> painting<00:04:17.680> from<00:04:17.859> his<00:04:18.070> heart<00:04:18.310> I

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
it was a painting from his heart I

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.580 
it was a painting from his heart I
thought<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.090> was<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.239> painting<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:20.350> he

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
thought it was a painting that he

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.720 
thought it was a painting that he
believed<00:04:20.980> in<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.540> me<00:04:23.730> differentiating

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
believed in so to me differentiating

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.570 
believed in so to me differentiating
abstract<00:04:25.420> good<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.840> bad<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.350> me<00:04:26.500> is<00:04:26.740> more<00:04:27.400> than

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
abstract good and bad to me is more than

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.550 
abstract good and bad to me is more than
anything<00:04:27.790> else<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.810> know<00:04:28.930> it's<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.170> painting

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
anything else you know it's the painting

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.730 
anything else you know it's the painting
honest<00:04:29.890> so<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:31.030> guess<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.080> analogy<00:04:32.590> would

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
honest so the I guess the analogy would

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.790 
honest so the I guess the analogy would
be<00:04:32.800> if<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.190> look<00:04:33.340> at<00:04:33.460> an<00:04:33.580> actor<00:04:34.170> okay<00:04:35.170> if<00:04:35.590> you

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
be if you look at an actor okay if you

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.560 
be if you look at an actor okay if you
if<00:04:36.040> you<00:04:36.160> look<00:04:36.250> at<00:04:36.400> an<00:04:36.520> actor<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.420> you

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
if you look at an actor and you and you

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.470 
if you look at an actor and you and you
know<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:37.870> actor<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.650> acting<00:04:39.160> then<00:04:39.670> he's<00:04:39.880> to

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
know that actor is acting then he's to

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.660 
know that actor is acting then he's to
me<00:04:40.630> that's<00:04:40.930> not<00:04:41.110> an<00:04:41.380> honest<00:04:41.650> portrayal<00:04:41.860> he's

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
me that's not an honest portrayal he's

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.270 
me that's not an honest portrayal he's
not<00:04:42.820> digging<00:04:43.030> deep<00:04:43.330> in<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.630> right<00:04:43.930> if<00:04:44.470> you<00:04:45.100> just

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
not digging deep in it right if you just

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.860 
not digging deep in it right if you just
look<00:04:45.430> at<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.670> guy<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.210> believe<00:04:46.600> what

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
look at the guy and you believe what

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.720 
look at the guy and you believe what
they're<00:04:47.020> doing<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.950> me<00:04:48.100> that's<00:04:48.310> an<00:04:48.430> honest

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
they're doing to me that's an honest

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.060 
they're doing to me that's an honest
portrayal<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.780> don't<00:04:50.560> have<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.770> think<00:04:50.980> about

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
portrayal you don't have to think about

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.159 
portrayal you don't have to think about
it<00:04:51.280> just<00:04:51.490> there<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.330> same<00:04:52.570> thing<00:04:52.780> with<00:04:52.930> a

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
it just there so the same thing with a

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.980

an<00:04:53.530> abstract<00:04:54.100> painting<00:04:54.370> or<00:04:55.330> even<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.540> river

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
an abstract painting or even a river

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.480 
an abstract painting or even a river
even<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.260> representational<00:04:57.100> painting<00:04:57.370> but

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490
