00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
the Ferrari race seems to think that

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.890 
the Ferrari race seems to think that
it's<00:00:44.560> an<00:00:44.710> exact<00:00:45.160> replica<00:00:45.700> of<00:00:45.880> a<00:00:46.210> Ferrari<00:00:46.540> so<00:00:46.810> if

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
it's an exact replica of a Ferrari so if

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.570 
it's an exact replica of a Ferrari so if
you<00:00:46.990> drive<00:00:47.230> this<00:00:47.470> you<00:00:47.950> have<00:00:48.100> essentially

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
you drive this you have essentially

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.570 
you drive this you have essentially
trade<00:00:48.970> but<00:00:49.300> I<00:00:49.480> think<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:50.590> could<00:00:50.860> be<00:00:51.010> so<00:00:51.370> it

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
trade but I think it could be so it

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.550 
trade but I think it could be so it
might<00:00:51.700> not<00:00:51.760> be<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.510> I<00:00:52.540> have<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.870> thought<00:00:53.290> that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
might not be that I have a thought that

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.240 
might not be that I have a thought that
in<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.370> you<00:00:54.490> think<00:00:54.730> for<00:00:55.000> for<00:00:55.270> you<00:00:56.110> that's<00:00:57.040> right

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
in it you think for for you that's right

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.490 
in it you think for for you that's right
that<00:00:57.490> is<00:00:57.580> true<00:00:57.610> this<00:00:58.000> is<00:00:58.210> here<00:00:58.720> real<00:00:59.140> size

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
that is true this is here real size
