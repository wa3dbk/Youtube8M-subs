00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.519
 water is the cradle of life and part 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:13.150
 indispensable element of this 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.440
 constitutes 75% of our body and the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.230
 our planet 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.630
 but this whole blue world is at risk 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.140
 no more clean water 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:27.040
 97 percent of all water 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.610
 of the planet is salty 2% is in the form of 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.800
 ice and only 1% is represented by 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.960
 rivers and lakes that guarantee 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.339
 supply of fresh water to the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.190
 human consumption 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.429
 according to UN data, the shortage of 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.769
 water already reaches 2 billion people and in 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.260
 São Paulo Metropolitan Region 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.899
 is not different with the index of 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.839
 water availability similar to those 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.600
 areas of the Northeast, the volume of 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.280
 rivers and dams is already less than the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.550
 population demand 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.679
 therefore the conscious use of resources 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.590
 is essential in order to guarantee 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.770
 quality of life and sustainability to 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.900
 environment 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.180
 thinking about it, a partnership between the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.390
 Brazil and Sabesp make the project viable

 up to 1000 liters of reuse water per 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.640
 second, allowing industries

 treatment by a biological reactor 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.470
 followed by ultrafiltration in the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.470
 phase of biological treatment occurs 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.319
 removal of nitrogen dust serum and matter 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.049
 through anoxic processes and 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.109
 then the effluent is 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.720
 pumped to the 63 membrane modules 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:25.290
 ultrafiltration of these membranes with 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.750
 0.05 micron pores are responsible for 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.530
 by retaining solids and bacteria through 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.419
 of infiltration at constant intervals 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.669
 recycling processes take place and

 industrial preserving resources 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.610
 the aquapolo guarantees the
