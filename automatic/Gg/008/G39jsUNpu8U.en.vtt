00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
display the primary display is similar

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
display the primary display is similar
to<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> surveillance<00:01:27.689> display<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to a surveillance display that a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.399 
to a surveillance display that a
controller<00:01:29.070> might<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.460> today<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
controller might use today and the

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.440 
controller might use today and the
secondary<00:01:31.409> display<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:32.130> basically<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.850> sandbox

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
secondary display is basically a sandbox

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.179 
secondary display is basically a sandbox
where<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> controller<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.799> play<00:01:35.040> out

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
where the controller can play out

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.890 
where the controller can play out
different<00:01:35.520> scenarios<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.240> look<00:01:36.630> into<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
different scenarios and look into the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.380 
different scenarios and look into the
future<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> number<00:01:39.299> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
future so there are a number of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.179 
future so there are a number of
different<00:01:39.720> components<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> prototype

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
different components to the prototype

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.100 
different components to the prototype
and<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> start<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.450> the

and I'm going to start with the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.950 
and I'm going to start with the
automation<00:01:43.770> timeline<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> automation

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
automation timeline so the automation

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.859 
automation timeline so the automation
timeline<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:47.430> basically<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.970> window<00:01:48.329> into<00:01:48.659> what

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
timeline is basically a window into what

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.480 
timeline is basically a window into what
the<00:01:48.990> automation<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.590> thinking<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.100> any<00:01:50.250> given

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the automation is thinking at any given

with<00:04:09.430> aircraft<00:04:09.849> and<00:04:10.150> managing<00:04:10.720> them<00:04:10.870> manually

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
with aircraft and managing them manually

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.580 
with aircraft and managing them manually
the<00:04:12.190> controller<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.640> actually<00:04:12.760> interacting

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
the controller is actually interacting

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.780 
the controller is actually interacting
collaborating<00:04:14.590> really<00:04:14.860> with<00:04:15.220> an<00:04:15.430> automated

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
collaborating really with an automated

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.780 
collaborating really with an automated
agent<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:17.709> manage<00:04:18.310> traffic<00:04:18.750> now<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:20.680> arrive<00:04:21.370> at

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
agent to manage traffic now to arrive at

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.620 
agent to manage traffic now to arrive at
this<00:04:22.030> concept<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:23.970> controller<00:04:24.970> automation

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
this concept of controller automation

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.260 
this concept of controller automation
interaction<00:04:26.430> what<00:04:27.430> we<00:04:27.550> are<00:04:27.639> trying<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.000> mimic

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
interaction what we are trying to mimic

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.080 
interaction what we are trying to mimic
is<00:04:28.690> basically<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.560> conversation<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.790> two

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
is basically the conversation that two

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.689 
is basically the conversation that two
humans<00:04:31.570> might<00:04:31.889> accept<00:04:32.889> you<00:04:33.190> know<00:04:33.280> rather<00:04:33.520> than

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
humans might accept you know rather than

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.219 
humans might accept you know rather than
consuming<00:04:34.270> or<00:04:34.510> two<00:04:34.630> controllers

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
consuming or two controllers

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.270 
consuming or two controllers
it's<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.919> controller<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.699> an<00:04:37.150> automated<00:04:37.510> agent

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
it's a controller and an automated agent

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.420 
it's a controller and an automated agent
so<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:40.060> try<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.539> achieve<00:04:40.690> this<00:04:41.289> this<00:04:41.740> design

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
so to try to achieve this this design

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.529 
so to try to achieve this this design
philosophy<00:04:43.270> we<00:04:44.260> followed<00:04:44.590> three<00:04:44.889> principles

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
philosophy we followed three principles

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.140 
philosophy we followed three principles
the<00:04:46.539> first<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:47.710> basically<00:04:48.490> designing

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
the first is basically designing

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.379 
the first is basically designing
automation<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.260> is<00:04:50.410> transparent<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:52.360> the

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
automation that is transparent so the

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.870 
automation that is transparent so the
idea<00:04:52.750> here<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.139> that<00:04:53.320> transparent<00:04:54.310> automation

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
idea here is that transparent automation

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.779 
idea here is that transparent automation
allows<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:56.110> humans<00:04:56.590> who<00:04:56.860> get<00:04:57.280> an<00:04:57.370> idea<00:04:57.699> of

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
allows the humans who get an idea of

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.029 
allows the humans who get an idea of
what<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:58.539> automation<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.110> thinking<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.830> why

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
what the automation is thinking and why

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.480 
what the automation is thinking and why
it's<00:05:00.250> thinking<00:05:00.639> about<00:05:00.729> it<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.150> certain<00:05:01.419> way<00:05:01.630> so

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
it's thinking about it a certain way so

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.430 
it's thinking about it a certain way so
different<00:05:03.490> key<00:05:03.610> key<00:05:04.210> features<00:05:04.600> of<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.990> the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
different key key features of the the

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.670 
different key key features of the the
prototype<00:05:05.949> exemplify<00:05:06.789> that<00:05:07.050> for<00:05:08.050> example<00:05:08.289> the

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
prototype exemplify that for example the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.770 
prototype exemplify that for example the
whole<00:05:08.860> secondary<00:05:09.490> display<00:05:09.820> is<00:05:10.180> really<00:05:10.450> meant

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
whole secondary display is really meant

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.279 
whole secondary display is really meant
to<00:05:10.930> help<00:05:11.289> the<00:05:11.470> controller<00:05:11.979> and<00:05:12.220> get<00:05:12.370> an<00:05:12.490> idea

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
to help the controller and get an idea

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.200 
to help the controller and get an idea
or<00:05:14.289> get<00:05:14.650> an<00:05:14.740> insight<00:05:15.250> into<00:05:15.520> what<00:05:15.789> the

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
or get an insight into what the

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.250 
or get an insight into what the
automation<00:05:16.750> is<00:05:16.870> thinking<00:05:17.610> now<00:05:18.810> while<00:05:19.810> we

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
automation is thinking now while we

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.050 
automation is thinking now while we
wanted<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.710> make<00:05:20.889> the<00:05:21.039> automations<00:05:21.639> thought

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
wanted to make the automations thought

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.750 
wanted to make the automations thought
process<00:05:22.630> transparent<00:05:23.349> we<00:05:24.070> also<00:05:24.220> didn't<00:05:24.639> want

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
process transparent we also didn't want

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.839 
process transparent we also didn't want
to<00:05:24.880> overwhelm<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.510> controller<00:05:25.900> with<00:05:26.139> lots<00:05:26.380> of

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
to overwhelm the controller with lots of

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.580 
to overwhelm the controller with lots of
information<00:05:27.849> so<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.960> second<00:05:29.349> guideline

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
information so the the second guideline

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.640 
information so the the second guideline
the<00:05:30.099> second<00:05:30.370> design<00:05:30.639> guideline<00:05:31.210> was<00:05:31.650> to

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
the second design guideline was to

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.580 
the second design guideline was to
basically<00:05:32.830> only<00:05:33.690> introduce<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:35.320> right

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
basically only introduce the right

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.200 
basically only introduce the right
amount<00:05:35.979> of<00:05:36.070> information<00:05:36.400> so<00:05:36.760> we<00:05:37.090> were

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
amount of information so we were

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.070 
amount of information so we were
actually<00:05:37.630> very<00:05:37.660> very<00:05:39.270> critical<00:05:40.270> each<00:05:40.660> piece

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
actually very very critical each piece

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.570 
actually very very critical each piece
of<00:05:41.110> information<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.800> we<00:05:41.950> were<00:05:42.099> putting<00:05:42.370> in

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
of information that we were putting in

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.940 
of information that we were putting in
the<00:05:42.700> in<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.000> prototype<00:05:43.539> and<00:05:43.840> in<00:05:44.650> really

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
the in the prototype and in really

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.379 
the in the prototype and in really
making<00:05:45.099> sure<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:45.520> it<00:05:45.760> was<00:05:45.880> going<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.240> be

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
making sure that it was going to be

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.550 
making sure that it was going to be
useful<00:05:46.810> for<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.530> task<00:05:47.800> at<00:05:48.130> hand<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:50.380> third

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
useful for the task at hand the third

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.969 
useful for the task at hand the third
component<00:05:50.950> deals<00:05:51.490> more<00:05:51.760> with<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.979> user

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
component deals more with the user

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.879 
component deals more with the user
experience<00:05:54.669> in<00:05:54.820> terms<00:05:54.970> of<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.270> input

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
experience in terms of the input

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.140 
experience in terms of the input
interface<00:05:56.889> and<00:05:57.400> we<00:05:57.700> really<00:05:57.940> wanted<00:05:58.270> to<00:05:58.479> have<00:05:58.780> a

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
interface and we really wanted to have a

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.969 
interface and we really wanted to have a
environment<00:06:01.150> of<00:06:01.450> direct<00:06:02.050> manipulation<00:06:02.500> and

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
environment of direct manipulation and

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.719 
environment of direct manipulation and
that's<00:06:03.840> we<00:06:04.840> feel<00:06:05.110> something<00:06:05.740> that<00:06:06.099> gives<00:06:06.430> the

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
that's we feel something that gives the

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.629 
that's we feel something that gives the
controller<00:06:07.180> or<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.110> human<00:06:08.639> better

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
controller or the human better

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.070 
controller or the human better
engagement<00:06:10.570> in<00:06:10.720> the

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
engagement in the

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.200 
engagement in the
and<00:06:11.500> that<00:06:11.590> they're<00:06:11.740> able<00:06:11.889> to<00:06:12.069> actually<00:06:12.639> you

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
and that they're able to actually you

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.100 
and that they're able to actually you
know<00:06:14.009> directly<00:06:15.009> interact<00:06:15.430> with<00:06:15.580> it

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
know directly interact with it

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.800 
know directly interact with it
so<00:06:17.830> as<00:06:18.039> we<00:06:18.520> move<00:06:18.729> forward<00:06:19.259> one<00:06:20.259> of<00:06:20.289> the<00:06:20.409> key

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
so as we move forward one of the key

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.570 
so as we move forward one of the key
activities<00:06:22.810> that<00:06:23.110> we<00:06:23.259> still<00:06:23.500> have<00:06:23.680> to<00:06:23.919> go

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
activities that we still have to go

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.640 
activities that we still have to go
through<00:06:24.610> is<00:06:25.060> a<00:06:25.440> human<00:06:26.440> in<00:06:26.530> the<00:06:26.620> loop

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
through is a human in the loop

and<00:06:41.710> we<00:06:42.069> also<00:06:42.220> have<00:06:42.460> to<00:06:42.580> make<00:06:42.729> sure<00:06:42.940> as<00:06:43.150> we<00:06:43.270> go

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
and we also have to make sure as we go

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.189 
and we also have to make sure as we go
forward<00:06:43.659> that<00:06:43.810> we<00:06:44.710> continue<00:06:45.219> to<00:06:45.340> be<00:06:45.520> aligned

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
forward that we continue to be aligned

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.379 
forward that we continue to be aligned
with<00:06:47.460> next-gen<00:06:48.460> concepts<00:06:49.120> of<00:06:49.270> operations

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
with next-gen concepts of operations

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.020 
with next-gen concepts of operations
that<00:06:50.229> come<00:06:50.860> out<00:06:51.009> of<00:06:51.159> the<00:06:51.280> government<00:06:51.729> or

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
that come out of the government or

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.379 
that come out of the government or
industry<00:06:52.780> groups<00:06:53.639> so<00:06:54.639> that<00:06:54.819> we<00:06:54.969> can<00:06:55.180> basically

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
industry groups so that we can basically

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.369 
industry groups so that we can basically
take<00:06:56.009> those<00:06:57.009> types<00:06:57.340> of<00:06:57.729> initiatives<00:06:58.539> that<00:06:59.139> are

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379 
take those types of initiatives that are

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.020 
take those types of initiatives that are
being<00:06:59.530> talked<00:06:59.889> about<00:07:00.069> and<00:07:00.490> and<00:07:01.330> find<00:07:01.690> a<00:07:01.870> way<00:07:02.080> to

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
being talked about and and find a way to

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.700 
being talked about and and find a way to
integrate<00:07:04.030> them<00:07:04.270> into<00:07:04.479> what<00:07:04.780> we<00:07:04.810> believe<00:07:05.379> is

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
integrate them into what we believe is

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.570 
integrate them into what we believe is
is<00:07:06.039> a<00:07:06.099> very<00:07:06.490> intuitive<00:07:07.830> human<00:07:08.830> automation

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
is a very intuitive human automation
