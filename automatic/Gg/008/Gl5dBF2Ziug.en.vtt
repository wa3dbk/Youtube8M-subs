00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
as you know yesterday was the launch it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.200 
as you know yesterday was the launch it
was<00:00:21.330> indeed<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.199> 20<00:00:22.560> years<00:00:22.880> broadly<00:00:23.880> 20

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
was indeed and it's 20 years broadly 20

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.870 
was indeed and it's 20 years broadly 20
years<00:00:24.390> since<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> DSM<00:00:25.439> before<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.340> 20

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
years since the DSM before it is 20

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.349 
years since the DSM before it is 20
years<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.449> been<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.869> long<00:00:28.230> journey<00:00:29.119> we<00:00:30.119> think

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
years it's been a long journey we think

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.790 
years it's been a long journey we think
it's<00:00:30.480> been<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> very<00:00:30.900> successful<00:00:31.080> journey

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
it's been a very successful journey

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.780 
it's been a very successful journey
we've<00:00:32.600> reviewed<00:00:33.600> many<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> advances<00:00:35.550> that

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
we've reviewed many of the advances that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.280 
we've reviewed many of the advances that
have<00:00:35.969> taken<00:00:36.149> place<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.719> last<00:00:36.780> 20<00:00:37.260> years

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
have taken place in the last 20 years

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.790 
have taken place in the last 20 years
and<00:00:37.770> we've<00:00:38.190> made<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.700> number<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.480> changes<00:00:40.170> which

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and we've made a number of changes which

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.229 
and we've made a number of changes which
we<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:42.200> will<00:00:43.200> improve<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.820> clinical

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
we do think will improve the clinical

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.229 
we do think will improve the clinical
assessment<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.739> patients<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> their

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
assessment for patients and their

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.130 
assessment for patients and their
families<00:00:48.690> by<00:00:49.110> various<00:00:49.829> types<00:00:50.960> mental<00:00:51.960> health

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
families by various types mental health

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.810 
families by various types mental health
clinicians<00:00:52.649> tell<00:00:53.280> us<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> little<00:00:53.579> bit<00:00:53.760> about

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
clinicians tell us a little bit about

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
clinicians tell us a little bit about
some<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> headlines<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
some of the headlines if you will of the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
some of the headlines if you will of the
changes<00:00:56.520> well<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> things

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
changes well I think one of the things

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.470 
changes well I think one of the things
that's<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:59.280> paid<00:00:59.579> attention<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.180> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that's that we paid attention to this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
that's that we paid attention to this
time<00:01:00.780> which<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:01.800> was<00:01:01.920> very<00:01:01.980> important

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
time which I think was very important

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
time which I think was very important
was<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> whole<00:01:03.660> issue<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.439> developmental

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
was the whole issue of a developmental

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.580 
was the whole issue of a developmental
approach<00:01:05.670> since<00:01:06.479> many<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> our<00:01:07.080> disorders

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
approach since many of our disorders

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770 
approach since many of our disorders
begin<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.280> childhood<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> adolescence<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
begin in childhood and adolescence and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.649 
begin in childhood and adolescence and
so<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.650> throughout<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.400> manual<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so really throughout the manual there is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
so really throughout the manual there is
a<00:01:12.689> greater<00:01:13.020> sense<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.799> developmental

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
a greater sense of a developmental

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.149 
a greater sense of a developmental
lifespan<00:01:15.180> approach<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.500> second<00:01:16.920> thing<00:01:17.130> that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
lifespan approach the second thing that

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
lifespan approach the second thing that
relates<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.509> again<00:01:19.290> paying<00:01:19.530> much

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
relates to that is again paying much

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.789 
relates to that is again paying much
more<00:01:19.860> attention<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.790> gender<00:01:21.659> much<00:01:22.560> more

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
more attention to gender much more

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.880 
more attention to gender much more
attention<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:24.020> cultural<00:01:25.020> diversity<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
attention to cultural diversity and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.399 
attention to cultural diversity and
cultural<00:01:26.310> sensitivity<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.840> again<00:01:28.110> is

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
cultural sensitivity and that again is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.920 
cultural sensitivity and that again is
something<00:01:28.579> really<00:01:29.579> pervasive<00:01:30.360> throughout

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
something really pervasive throughout

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.679 
something really pervasive throughout
the<00:01:31.200> book<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:32.220> organization<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> book<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the book the organization of the book is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.749 
the book the organization of the book is
also<00:01:34.049> interesting<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.950> somewhat<00:01:35.369> different

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
also interesting and somewhat different

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.319 
also interesting and somewhat different
from<00:01:36.630> previous<00:01:36.810> DSM's<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.150> that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
from previous DSM's we think that

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
from previous DSM's we think that
there's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> very<00:01:39.659> good<00:01:40.110> introductory<00:01:40.799> section

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
there's a very good introductory section

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
there's a very good introductory section
on<00:01:41.640> how<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> use<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> book<00:01:42.689> which<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.320> hope

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
on how to use the book which we hope

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.880 
on how to use the book which we hope
people<00:01:43.560> will<00:01:44.220> read<00:01:45.170> section<00:01:46.170> 2<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> course

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
people will read section 2 of course

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.639 
people will read section 2 of course
contains<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.970> diagnostic<00:01:48.750> criteria<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
contains the diagnostic criteria for the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.539 
contains the diagnostic criteria for the
various<00:01:49.950> categories<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.909> section<00:01:51.720> 3<00:01:52.140> is

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
various categories and section 3 is

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.359 
various categories and section 3 is
really<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.759> section<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.750> deals<00:01:54.990> with

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
really a section that deals with

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.819 
really a section that deals with
emerging<00:01:56.369> measures<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.649> alternative<00:01:58.649> ways

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
emerging measures and alternative ways

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.550 
emerging measures and alternative ways
of<00:01:59.159> thinking<00:01:59.880> about<00:02:00.149> models<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.899> personality

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
of thinking about models for personality

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
of thinking about models for personality
disorder<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.250> well<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.030> number<00:02:03.299> of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
disorder as well as a number of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
disorder as well as a number of
conditions<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.979> hope<00:02:05.250> people<00:02:05.520> will

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
conditions that we hope people will

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.150 
conditions that we hope people will
study<00:02:06.360> which<00:02:06.960> are<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.290> necessarily<00:02:07.829> ready

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
the book is also interesting because

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.830 
the book is also interesting because
what<00:02:15.680> we've<00:02:15.890> done<00:02:16.189> is<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.519> we've<00:02:16.879> organized

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
what we've done is that we've organized

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.009 
what we've done is that we've organized
that<00:02:18.079> in<00:02:18.230> 20<00:02:18.620> chapters<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.310> number<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:20.019> disorder

basically have their own chapters which
we<00:02:26.959> think<00:02:27.230> are<00:02:27.670> important<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.989> will

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
we think are important if you will

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
address those particular issues as well

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.020 
address those particular issues as well
as<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.079> other<00:02:36.230> 18<00:02:36.799> chapters<00:02:37.310> if<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.609> will<00:02:37.760> and

they have is because this is a strong

well<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.739> think<00:03:42.859> sometimes<00:03:43.699> it<00:03:44.090> is

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
well I think sometimes it is

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.530 
well I think sometimes it is
misunderstood<00:03:45.139> that<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.889> DSM<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.699> a<00:03:47.090> research

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
misunderstood that the DSM is a research

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.819 
misunderstood that the DSM is a research
tool<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.639> it<00:03:49.970> can't<00:03:50.479> be<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:51.169> leader<00:03:51.440> in

terms of research it needs to be ready

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.039 
terms of research it needs to be ready
to<00:03:56.139> utilize<00:03:57.139> research<00:03:58.040> findings<00:03:58.729> and<00:03:59.049> make

to utilize research findings and make

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.129 
to utilize research findings and make

them amenable for clinicians to use them

them amenable for clinicians to use them

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:10.009 
hope that this will continue and

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.460 
hope that this will continue and
continue<00:04:10.489> even<00:04:11.030> more<00:04:11.329> quickly<00:04:11.659> than<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.259> has

continue even more quickly than it has

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.740 
continue even more quickly than it has
up<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.739> now<00:04:12.919> which<00:04:13.909> is<00:04:14.060> one<00:04:14.209> of<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.389> reasons

up to now which is one of the reasons
that<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.229> really<00:04:15.590> decided<00:04:16.009> to<00:04:16.970> make<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:17.269> much

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
that we really decided to make this much

that we really decided to make this much
