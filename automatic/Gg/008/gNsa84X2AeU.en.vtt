one lesson five estimating square and
cube<00:00:06.450> roots<00:00:07.760> estimating<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.269> approximate

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
cube roots estimating is to approximate

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.180 
cube roots estimating is to approximate
prior<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.250> calculating<00:00:12.150> your<00:00:12.389> answer

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
prior to calculating your answer

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.580 
prior to calculating your answer
rounding<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.400> replacing<00:00:15.089> an<00:00:15.210> answer<00:00:15.900> by

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
rounding is replacing an answer by

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.970 
rounding is replacing an answer by
another<00:00:17.100> number<00:00:17.369> close<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.199> same<00:00:19.470> value

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
another number close to the same value

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.420 
another number close to the same value
but<00:00:20.400> having<00:00:20.850> fewer<00:00:21.390> digits<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:22.340> lot<00:00:23.340> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
but having fewer digits a lot of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.920 
but having fewer digits a lot of
students<00:00:23.760> mix<00:00:24.000> those<00:00:24.269> twos<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.750> those<00:00:25.500> two<00:00:25.740> up

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930

estimating<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.740> first<00:00:28.949> rounding

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
estimating is what you do first rounding

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.630 
estimating is what you do first rounding
is<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.570> end<00:00:31.070> Vic<00:00:32.070> number<00:00:32.309> one

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
is what you do at the end Vic number one

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.270 
is what you do at the end Vic number one
sometimes<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.480> easiest<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> make<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.500> table<00:00:34.950> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
sometimes is easiest to make a table of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.410 
sometimes is easiest to make a table of
perfect<00:00:35.730> squares<00:00:36.059> or<00:00:36.450> cubes<00:00:36.559> to<00:00:37.559> aid<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.219> your

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
perfect squares or cubes to aid in your

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.280 
perfect squares or cubes to aid in your
estimating<00:00:41.420> which<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.930> did<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.260> here

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
estimating which is what we did up here

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.040 
estimating which is what we did up here
I<00:00:44.100> went<00:00:44.640> ahead<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> made<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> table<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.809> think

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
I went ahead and made a table I think

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
I went ahead and made a table I think
you<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> table<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:46.860> paper<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.489> ahead

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you have a table on your paper go ahead

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
you have a table on your paper go ahead
and<00:00:47.879> fill<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.379> this

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and fill it in with all of this

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
and fill it in with all of this
information<00:00:50.219> most<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.510> should<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.750> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
information most of you should have this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.680 
information most of you should have this
memorized<00:00:52.440> by<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:55.610> when<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.760> estimate<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
memorized by now when we estimate a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.900 
memorized by now when we estimate a
square<00:00:58.050> root<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:59.039> we're<00:00:59.219> doing<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.699> we're

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
square root what we're doing is we're

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.130 
square root what we're doing is we're
going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> locate<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:02.190> perfect<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.149> the

going to locate the perfect this the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.219 
going to locate the perfect this the
perfect<00:01:04.559> square<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.110> our

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
perfect square that is down is in our

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
perfect square that is down is in our
chart<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.159> we're<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> locate<00:01:08.610> where

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
chart and we're going to locate where

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.880 
chart and we're going to locate where
this<00:01:10.610> per<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.000> square<00:01:12.360> root<00:01:12.570> would<00:01:12.930> fall<00:01:13.290> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this per this square root would fall so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.910 
this per this square root would fall so
the<00:01:14.880> square<00:01:15.119> root<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.360> 28<00:01:16.369> falls<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.700> between

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
the square root of 28 falls in between

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
the square root of 28 falls in between
25<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:19.950> 36<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.110> square<00:01:22.560> root<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.950> 28<00:01:23.600> would

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
25 and 36 so the square root of 28 would

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.880 
25 and 36 so the square root of 28 would
be<00:01:24.750> 5<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.380> 6<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.549> let<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.880> back<00:01:27.259> if<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
be 5 or 6 so let me go back if I was to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
be 5 or 6 so let me go back if I was to
take<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.970> square<00:01:30.180> root<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.450> 25<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.560> 5

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
take the square root of 25 I would get 5

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.679 
take the square root of 25 I would get 5
if<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.549> were<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> take<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> square<00:01:33.329> root<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> 12

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
if I were to take the square root of 12

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.950 
if I were to take the square root of 12
36<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.439> would<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.829> 6<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.759> asked<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.659> take<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
36 I would get 6 I'm asked to take the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.550 
36 I would get 6 I'm asked to take the
square<00:01:37.259> root<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.590> 28<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.990> answer<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
square root of 28 so that my answer is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:50.139 
square root of 28 so that my answer is
going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.009> fall<00:01:41.460> between<00:01:42.439> 5<00:01:43.439> &amp;<00:01:44.210> 6<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:48.500> just

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
going to be fall between 5 &amp; 6 so I just

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.020 
going to be fall between 5 &amp; 6 so I just
shortened<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> word<00:01:51.390> between<00:01:51.860> 5<00:01:52.860> &amp;<00:01:53.040> 6<00:01:53.220> that's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
shortened the word between 5 &amp; 6 that's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
shortened the word between 5 &amp; 6 that's
my<00:01:54.299> solution<00:01:54.680> I'm<00:01:56.360> asked<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.750> estimate<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
my solution I'm asked to estimate the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.810 
my solution I'm asked to estimate the
square<00:01:58.799> root<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.509> 170<00:02:00.740> well<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.399> square<00:02:02.670> root

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
square root of 170 well the square root

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.200 
square root of 170 well the square root
of<00:02:02.880> 169<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.810> 13<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.560> square<00:02:04.829> root<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.100> 196<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
of 169 is 13 the square root of 196 is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.490 
of 169 is 13 the square root of 196 is
14<00:02:07.610> 170<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.000> between<00:02:09.569> those<00:02:09.750> two<00:02:10.020> answers

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
14 170 is in between those two answers

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.160 
14 170 is in between those two answers
so<00:02:10.890> it's<00:02:11.069> between

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so it's between

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.430 
so it's between
13<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.490> 14<00:02:16.730> make<00:02:17.730> sense<00:02:18.000> why<00:02:18.959> don't<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.260> try

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
13 and 14 make sense why don't you try

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.350 
13 and 14 make sense why don't you try
this<00:02:19.500> one<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:19.950> pause<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.459> video<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.090> try<00:02:21.330> to

work<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.780> one<00:02:21.959> out<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.110> yours<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.590> your<00:02:23.160> own

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.530 

did<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.410> get<00:02:34.590> between<00:02:34.920> seven<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.280> eight

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
did you get between seven and eight

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.600 
did you get between seven and eight
awesome

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.750 
number four is very similar to number
three<00:02:40.200> except<00:02:40.620> for<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.830> has<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.010> negative<00:02:41.310> sign

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
three except for it has a negative sign

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.880 
three except for it has a negative sign
out<00:02:42.000> front<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.830> only<00:02:44.190> difference<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:45.890> was

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
out front the only difference here was

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.950 
out front the only difference here was
that<00:02:47.100> negative<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.000> only<00:02:48.180> difference<00:02:48.510> in

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
that negative so the only difference in

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.930 
that negative so the only difference in
our<00:02:49.080> answer<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.160> negative<00:02:50.370> so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
our answer is going to be a negative so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.080 
our answer is going to be a negative so
this<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.210> going<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.450> be<00:02:54.810> between<00:02:55.320> negative

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
this is going to be between negative

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.150 
this is going to be between negative
seven<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.320> negative<00:02:58.320> 8<00:03:00.650> all<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
seven and negative 8 all right and the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.670 
seven and negative 8 all right and the
last<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.730> I've<00:03:03.060> got<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> decimal<00:03:04.260> here<00:03:04.320> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
last one I've got a decimal here the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.100 
last one I've got a decimal here the
square<00:03:04.860> root<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.220> eighteen<00:03:06.120> point<00:03:06.480> five<00:03:06.690> I

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
square root of eighteen point five I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.650 
square root of eighteen point five I
treat<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.000> would<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.420> whole

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
treat this just like I would a whole

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.740 
treat this just like I would a whole
number<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.370> square<00:03:11.580> root<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.850> eighteen<00:03:12.390> point

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
number the square root of eighteen point

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.370 
number the square root of eighteen point
five<00:03:13.010> would<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.940> between<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.990> square<00:03:16.260> root

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
five would be in between the square root

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.980 
five would be in between the square root
of<00:03:16.500> 16<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.160> square<00:03:17.190> root<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.610> 25<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.810> this

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
of 16 and the square root of 25 so this

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.720 
of 16 and the square root of 25 so this
answer<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.560> between<00:03:21.110> four<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.380> five<00:03:24.350> and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
answer is between four and five and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.350 
answer is between four and five and
we're<00:03:26.730> done

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.000 

okay<00:03:32.360> this<00:03:32.840> next<00:03:33.140> part<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.590> going<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.830> take<00:03:33.980> a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
okay this next part is going to take a

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.770 
okay this next part is going to take a
calculator<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:34.940> if<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.120> have<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.299> calculator

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
calculator so if you have a calculator

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.440 
calculator so if you have a calculator
handy<00:03:36.019> now<00:03:36.379> would<00:03:36.530> be<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.650> time<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.980> use<00:03:37.159> it<00:03:37.450> we

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
handy now would be the time to use it we

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.690 
handy now would be the time to use it we
are<00:03:38.569> going<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.780> simplify<00:03:39.250> by<00:03:40.250> taking<00:03:40.580> the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
are going to simplify by taking the

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.250 
are going to simplify by taking the
square<00:03:40.909> root<00:03:41.150> we're<00:03:41.720> going<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.900> round<00:03:42.080> our

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
square root we're going to round our

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.030 
square root we're going to round our
answers<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.040> nearest<00:03:43.430> hundredth<00:03:44.799> again

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
answers to the nearest hundredth again

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.250 
answers to the nearest hundredth again
all<00:03:46.610> we're<00:03:46.970> doing<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.329> we're<00:03:47.510> typing<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:48.019> into

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
all we're doing is we're typing it into

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
all we're doing is we're typing it into
our<00:03:48.349> calculator<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.980> square<00:03:49.280> root<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.659> 28<00:03:50.659> and

that's just five point two nine rounded
to<00:03:56.659> the<00:03:56.720> nearest<00:03:56.810> hundredth

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
to the nearest hundredth

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.190 
to the nearest hundredth
that's<00:03:58.099> the<00:03:58.250> hundreds<00:03:58.579> place<00:03:58.870> why<00:03:59.870> don't<00:03:59.900> you

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
that's the hundreds place why don't you

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.920 
that's the hundreds place why don't you
try<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.250> rest<00:04:01.519> of<00:04:01.700> these<00:04:01.849> just<00:04:02.329> typing<00:04:02.750> them

try the rest of these just typing them

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:19.440 
try the rest of these just typing them
into<00:04:03.170> your<00:04:03.290> calculator<00:04:03.739> that's<00:04:04.129> it

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.020 

did<00:04:20.020> you<00:04:20.110> get<00:04:20.260> this<00:04:20.380> as<00:04:20.560> your<00:04:20.740> answer<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.310> hope

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
did you get this as your answer I hope

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.300 
did you get this as your answer I hope
so<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.930> can<00:04:23.110> actually<00:04:23.380> go<00:04:23.770> back<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:24.040> the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
so you can actually go back to the

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.350 
so you can actually go back to the
previous<00:04:24.820> slide<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.390> check<00:04:25.780> your<00:04:26.350> answers<00:04:27.360> we

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
previous slide and check your answers we

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.940 
previous slide and check your answers we
said<00:04:28.630> that<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.560> square<00:04:29.800> root<00:04:29.890> of

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
said that this the square root of

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.920 
said that this the square root of
eighteen<00:04:30.340> point<00:04:30.580> five<00:04:30.730> when<00:04:30.970> we<00:04:31.090> estimated

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
eighteen point five when we estimated

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.320 
eighteen point five when we estimated
was<00:04:32.200> going<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.470> be<00:04:32.590> somewhere<00:04:33.160> between<00:04:33.400> four

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
was going to be somewhere between four

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.950 
was going to be somewhere between four
and<00:04:34.360> five<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.990> guess<00:04:35.380> what<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:36.490> it's<00:04:37.090> four

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and five and guess what it is it's four

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.530 
and five and guess what it is it's four
point<00:04:38.200> three<00:04:38.350> zero<00:04:38.590> in<00:04:39.400> between<00:04:40.330> four<00:04:40.510> and

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
point three zero in between four and

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.860 
point three zero in between four and
five<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:41.320> that's<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.520> difference<00:04:42.820> between

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
five so that's the difference between

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.310 
five so that's the difference between
estimating<00:04:43.870> at<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.230> beginning<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.890> guessing

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
estimating at the beginning and guessing

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.990 
estimating at the beginning and guessing
making<00:04:47.320> an<00:04:47.410> educated<00:04:47.830> guess<00:04:48.070> of<00:04:48.340> where<00:04:48.670> your

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
making an educated guess of where your

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.420 
making an educated guess of where your
square<00:04:49.300> root<00:04:49.510> will<00:04:49.750> fall<00:04:49.960> between<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:50.650> here

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
square root will fall between and here

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.040 
square root will fall between and here
rounding<00:04:52.120> actually<00:04:52.600> picking<00:04:52.870> up<00:04:52.930> your

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
rounding actually picking up your

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.930 
rounding actually picking up your
calculator<00:04:53.470> typing<00:04:53.980> it<00:04:54.070> in<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.430> run<00:04:54.640> in<00:04:54.820> to

fall<00:05:13.150> between<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.940> we're<00:05:15.940> going<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.180> take<00:05:16.300> the

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
fall between so we're going to take the

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.030 
fall between so we're going to take the
cube<00:05:16.690> root<00:05:16.810> of<00:05:16.990> 30<00:05:17.290> and<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:19.840> cube<00:05:20.830> root<00:05:20.950> of

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
cube root of 30 and the cube root of

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.090 
cube root of 30 and the cube root of
eight<00:05:21.700> is<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.690> cube<00:05:22.990> root<00:05:23.110> twenty-seven

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
eight is to the cube root twenty-seven

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.990 
eight is to the cube root twenty-seven
is<00:05:24.310> three<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.850> cube<00:05:25.120> root<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.360> 64<00:05:25.570> is<00:05:26.170> 4<00:05:26.610> so<00:05:27.610> 30

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
is three the cube root of 64 is 4 so 30

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.340 
is three the cube root of 64 is 4 so 30
would<00:05:28.240> fall<00:05:28.450> between<00:05:28.840> 27<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.590> 64<00:05:30.250> so<00:05:31.060> my<00:05:31.450> cube

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
would fall between 27 and 64 so my cube

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.770 
would fall between 27 and 64 so my cube
root<00:05:32.530> of<00:05:32.590> 30<00:05:32.890> is<00:05:33.160> going<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.460> be<00:05:33.610> between<00:05:36.570> 3<00:05:37.570> and

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
root of 30 is going to be between 3 and

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.860 
root of 30 is going to be between 3 and
4<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:39.180> then<00:05:40.180> you<00:05:40.300> can<00:05:40.450> pick<00:05:40.600> up<00:05:40.720> your

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
4 and then you can pick up your

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.340 
4 and then you can pick up your
calculator<00:05:41.490> type<00:05:42.490> in<00:05:42.840> finding<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.930> cube<00:05:44.140> root

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
calculator type in finding the cube root

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.220 
calculator type in finding the cube root
of<00:05:44.560> 30<00:05:45.040> you<00:05:45.610> might<00:05:45.790> have<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.150> hit<00:05:46.360> math<00:05:46.840> or

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
of 30 you might have to hit math or

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.370 
of 30 you might have to hit math or
second<00:05:48.130> and<00:05:48.370> some<00:05:48.940> button<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.870> on<00:05:50.110> your

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
calculator to get to the cube root but

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.690 
calculator to get to the cube root but
try<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.840> out<00:05:52.990> and<00:05:53.140> see<00:05:53.290> what<00:05:53.440> you<00:05:53.470> get<00:05:56.610> did<00:05:57.610> you

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
try it out and see what you get did you

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.700 
try it out and see what you get did you
get<00:05:57.850> 3.11

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
get 3.11

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.630 
get 3.11
hope<00:05:59.710> so<00:05:59.950> try<00:06:00.760> this<00:06:00.820> one<00:06:01.150> out<00:06:01.410> estimate<00:06:02.410> first

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
hope so try this one out estimate first

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.090 
hope so try this one out estimate first
then<00:06:03.640> pick<00:06:03.880> up<00:06:03.940> your<00:06:04.030> calculator<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:04.840> round

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
then pick up your calculator and round

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:16.600 
then pick up your calculator and round
to<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.130> nearest<00:06:06.220> hundredth

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610
