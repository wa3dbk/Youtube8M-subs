00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 good afternoon we found ourselves doing a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.720
 try here with the kitchenaid blender 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.690
 pro 600 below we are going to make a 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.790
 small history of how to place each 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.639
 one of its accessories without any 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.600
 problem as we can observe it 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.650
 It has a small one here 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.470
 we down the goal we put the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.630
 accessory in this way as indicated 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.100
 the ulna her how can we take it there 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.099
 up to the highest 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.380
 we cross to the left and go down and 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.050
 it will automatically be firm 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 we can do the tests going up the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.579
 bowl 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.579
 in a fixed way this week 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.500
 brunette 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.930
 in the same way let's give the floor 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.140
 completely and to remove what is 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.489
 here 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.489
 to remove the move 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 we go up we move to the left and 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.370
 we go down and he retires without any 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.730
 problem in the same way let's adapt 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.060
 in this next accessory 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.030
 we place on this side 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.880
 on this side we put it up here 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.369
 we rotate completely 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.549
 to the right and we give it down 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:32.009
 and he drops automatically we raise the bowl 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.009
 to the maximum and we do the test 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.820
 at maximum speed 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.170
 we turn off 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.520
 so that we can see correctly 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.360
 we have to make sure that the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.970
 volcano is completely in both in 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.970
 both falls that he has here and the fall 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.450
 who has behind 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.450
 Now we are going to withdraw 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.210
 in the same way 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.319
 if we get up we run towards the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.819
 left and we give it down 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.379
 good I hope with this little tutorial 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.569
 cover all the doubts you have about 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.349
 of the change of each of the accessories 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.349
 who brings the blender
