00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.180
 hello I am and was not the hairdresser today 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.070
 of milk 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.330
 I usually do a lot of work for several 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.040
 magazines 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.200
 It's here today to show you the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.490
 step by step in our hair type 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.230
 magazine cover 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.150
 A lot of people think they have to stay 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.910
 beautiful or has more durability when 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.940
 it needs to be wet but that is not 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940
 truth 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.110
 almost 180 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:52.530
 It is important that when serginho hair 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:56.180
 in words to facilitate the sandro was 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.180
 used many years 80 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:10.770
 returning a little to average in the case of 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 hair is already iso, so I'll give a 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 ripple that I will do I do not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.990
 I need to keep turning the brush 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.079
 I'll simply mark the cancellation 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.149
 then brushing causes the hair 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.430
 get more into it 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.040
 so it is important to remember that in this 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.140
 kind of ripple we just 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.140
 a brush roll and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.159
 I know that according to the minute 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.439
 It's really up to you 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.990
 durability to the brush of the time 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.459
 cool and so you have anchoring 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:15.019
 May after I did this I'll do 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.250
 a cookie for me guarantees more 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:30.290
 durability 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:32.510
 her album still warm in the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.510
 outline of her face has a bit of 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.900
 frizz are the shortest hair and are 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.390
 left outside the contour of the face 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.459
 then all this pull that just 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:53.840
 change the simplest 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:56.510
 before even modeling the concrete olim is 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.959
 an old thing but it works and 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.600
 helps you to have a lasting renato 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.780
 also has it's doing not alone 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.480
 It's work to do, it 's important for you. 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.430
 do this all of a sudden this makeup 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.040
 because while you are doing makeup on your hair 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.079
 has a greater fixation because you only have 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.079
 you get a lasting result 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.050
 I think potassium already registered one 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.620
 reaction seizures because of the heavy 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.620
 cold
