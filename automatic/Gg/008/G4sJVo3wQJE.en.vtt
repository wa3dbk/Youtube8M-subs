00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
in tool or the CRKT as people know it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:23.120 
in tool or the CRKT as people know it
and<00:00:14.879> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.329> model<00:00:16.170> M<00:00:19.010> 16-4<00:00:20.010> Z<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:22.130> they

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and this is the model M 16-4 Z and they

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.830 
and this is the model M 16-4 Z and they

you'll<00:00:28.080> see<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.950> specs<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.120> big

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
you'll see it with the specs it is a big

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.860 
you'll see it with the specs it is a big
blade<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.610> little<00:00:32.610> too<00:00:32.730> big<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.180> our<00:00:33.239> EDC

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
blade a little too big for our EDC

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.360 
blade a little too big for our EDC
blades<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:34.460> definitely<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.539> tactical<00:00:36.539> blade

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370

side to release the lock there's two
ways<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.580> deploying<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.150> blade<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.560> have

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
ways of deploying this blade you have

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.340 
ways of deploying this blade you have
the<00:02:44.910> flipper<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:48.600> then<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.110> thumb

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
the flipper and then you have the thumb

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.060 
the flipper and then you have the thumb

almost uncomfortable because of the way

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.440 
almost uncomfortable because of the way
it's<00:03:49.670> designed<00:03:50.889> but<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.069> rest<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.579> is<00:03:53.299> very

very comfortable in hand the pocket clip

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.250 
very comfortable in hand the pocket clip
looks<00:04:00.260> fairly<00:04:00.530> flimsy<00:04:01.659> but<00:04:02.659> it's<00:04:02.870> I've

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
looks fairly flimsy but it's I've

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.110 
looks fairly flimsy but it's I've
carried<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.739> for<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.010> lot<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.400> different<00:04:04.669> tasks

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
carried it for a lot of different tasks

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.229 
carried it for a lot of different tasks
in<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.419> past<00:04:05.659> and<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:07.760> very<00:04:07.939> strong

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
in the past and it's very strong

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:18.039 
in the past and it's very strong
considering<00:04:08.900> it's<00:04:09.139> a<00:04:09.609> smaller<00:04:10.609> clip<00:04:16.780> for<00:04:17.780> size

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
considering it's a smaller clip for size

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.610 
considering it's a smaller clip for size
comparison<00:04:18.079> I<00:04:19.449> will<00:04:20.449> only<00:04:21.169> use<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:23.620> cold

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
comparison I will only use the cold

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.060 
comparison I will only use the cold
steel<00:04:26.740> recon<00:04:27.740> one<00:04:28.039> and<00:04:29.680> those<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:30.860> have<00:04:31.039> the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
cold Steel's no they don't make Wimpy

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.200 
cold Steel's no they don't make Wimpy
blades<00:04:35.199> so<00:04:36.199> just<00:04:36.500> for<00:04:36.860> comparison<00:04:37.639> those<00:04:38.060> are

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
blades so just for comparison those are

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.879 
blades so just for comparison those are
the<00:04:39.340> two<00:04:40.340> big<00:04:40.580> dogs<00:04:40.789> in<00:04:40.970> my<00:04:41.120> collection<00:04:41.570> for<00:04:41.889> a

the two big dogs in my collection for a
little<00:04:43.130> different<00:04:43.550> comparisons<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.330> little

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
little different comparisons a little

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.990 
little different comparisons a little
smaller<00:04:44.780> size<00:04:45.639> I'll<00:04:46.639> use<00:04:46.909> the<00:04:48.669> so<00:04:49.669> I'll<00:04:49.759> print

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
smaller size I'll use the so I'll print

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.499 
smaller size I'll use the so I'll print
it<00:04:50.150> up<00:04:50.889> use<00:04:51.889> this<00:04:52.099> little<00:04:52.520> smaller<00:04:52.880> design

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
it up use this little smaller design

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.050 
it up use this little smaller design
there<00:04:53.900> we<00:04:54.050> use<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.909> Endora<00:04:55.909> 4<00:04:57.669> so<00:04:58.669> they<00:04:58.759> get<00:04:58.940> an

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
there we use the Endora 4 so they get an

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.680 
there we use the Endora 4 so they get an
idea<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.419> the<00:05:00.289> size<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.710> these<00:05:00.830> plates<00:05:01.690> so

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
idea of the size of these plates so

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:11.750 
idea of the size of these plates so
they're<00:05:02.900> all<00:05:03.070> pretty<00:05:04.070> good<00:05:04.250> sized<00:05:04.490> blades

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
clip on this one is it got a Teflon

clip on this one is it got a Teflon
coating<00:05:27.400> on<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:29.430> they<00:05:30.430> say<00:05:30.670> it's<00:05:30.850> to

coating on it and they say it's to

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.250 
coating on it and they say it's to

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
prevent some of the pocket wear but it

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.010 
prevent some of the pocket wear but it
works<00:05:38.470> good<00:05:39.090> could<00:05:40.090> be<00:05:40.120> a<00:05:40.240> little<00:05:40.450> stronger<00:05:40.720> I

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
works good could be a little stronger I

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.350 
works good could be a little stronger I
think<00:05:41.110> should<00:05:41.410> be<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.590> little<00:05:41.740> wider<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:43.240> it

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
think should be a little wider and it

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.100 
think should be a little wider and it
could<00:05:43.510> be<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:43.720> little<00:05:43.900> deeper<00:05:44.320> in<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:45.190> pocket

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
could be a little deeper in the pocket

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.870 
could be a little deeper in the pocket
but<00:05:48.300> it's<00:05:49.300> a<00:05:49.360> decent<00:05:49.570> decent<00:05:50.410> setup<00:05:50.650> I<00:05:51.040> just

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
but it's a decent decent setup I just

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.550 
but it's a decent decent setup I just
wish<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.300> blade<00:05:52.570> seal<00:05:52.900> was<00:05:53.140> a<00:05:53.170> little<00:05:53.440> bit

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
wish the blade seal was a little bit

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.200 
wish the blade seal was a little bit
better<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:56.220> way<00:05:57.220> that<00:05:57.430> Klein<00:05:57.700> dish<00:05:58.000> would

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
better and the way that Klein dish would

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.980 
better and the way that Klein dish would
be<00:05:58.240> better<00:05:59.040> maybe<00:06:00.040> the<00:06:00.280> newer<00:06:00.460> ones<00:06:00.790> are<00:06:01.000> a

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
be better maybe the newer ones are a

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.860 
be better maybe the newer ones are a
little<00:06:02.380> better<00:06:02.590> set<00:06:02.890> up<00:06:03.090> but<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.270> blade<00:06:04.540> still

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
little better set up but the blade still

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.990 
little better set up but the blade still
I'm<00:06:05.110> not<00:06:05.170> really<00:06:05.440> familiar<00:06:05.680> with<00:06:05.980> a<00:06:06.130> u.s.<00:06:06.610> four

I'm not really familiar with a u.s. four
I<00:06:07.270> know<00:06:08.260> it<00:06:08.470> doesn't<00:06:08.650> stay<00:06:08.860> sharp<00:06:09.160> for<00:06:09.310> very

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520
