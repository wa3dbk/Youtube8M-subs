00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
procedure you can see the effects right

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.110 
procedure you can see the effects right
off<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.950> bat<00:03:20.160> soon<00:03:20.400> as<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.580> procedure<00:03:20.940> is

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
off the bat soon as the procedure is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.300 
off the bat soon as the procedure is
done<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:23.540> probably<00:03:24.540> equivalent<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.310> probably

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
done is probably equivalent to probably
