that I don't usually recommend for

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.580 
that I don't usually recommend for
converting<00:02:10.579> to<00:02:11.090> reverse<00:02:11.420> Drive<00:02:11.750> because<00:02:12.290> it

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
converting to reverse Drive because it

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.710 
converting to reverse Drive because it
has<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.890> dual<00:02:13.190> range<00:02:13.519> on<00:02:13.820> it<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:14.299> is<00:02:14.450> easily

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
has the dual range on it this is easily

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720

you'll<00:02:17.690> see<00:02:17.900> there<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.260> sensor<00:02:18.799> that<00:02:19.519> shows

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
you'll see there is a sensor that shows

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.509 
you'll see there is a sensor that shows
you<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.840> high<00:02:21.500> range<00:02:21.829> or<00:02:22.070> low<00:02:22.250> range

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
you if it's in high range or low range

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.069 
you if it's in high range or low range
you'll<00:02:23.060> see<00:02:23.269> here<00:02:23.570> there<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.810> also<00:02:23.959> a

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
you'll see here there is also a

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.750 
you'll see here there is also a

range<00:02:25.909> to<00:02:26.150> low<00:02:26.330> range<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.049> easiest

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
range to low range that is the easiest

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.819 
range to low range that is the easiest
way<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.730> see<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:28.959> type<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:29.989> transmission<00:02:30.620> if

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
way to see this type of transmission if

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.350 
way to see this type of transmission if
you<00:02:30.980> also<00:02:31.129> look<00:02:31.400> at<00:02:31.579> the<00:02:31.730> bill<00:02:31.879> housing<00:02:32.209> and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
you also look at the bill housing and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.630 
you also look at the bill housing and
clutch<00:02:32.510> mechanism<00:02:33.069> you'll<00:02:34.069> see<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.489> this

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
clutch mechanism you'll see that this

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.360 
clutch mechanism you'll see that this
has<00:02:34.700> more<00:02:35.239> bolts<00:02:35.840> holding<00:02:36.829> the<00:02:36.950> front<00:02:37.099> in

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
has more bolts holding the front in

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.850 
has more bolts holding the front in
place<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.909> see<00:02:38.150> all<00:02:38.360> these<00:02:38.629> bolts<00:02:39.379> around<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
place you see all these bolts around the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.440 
place you see all these bolts around the
front<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.250> transmission<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.299> to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
front of the transmission this is to

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.210 
front of the transmission this is to
hold<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.750> extra<00:02:41.959> shaft<00:02:42.379> in<00:02:42.650> for<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.950> dual

hold the extra shaft in for the dual
range<00:02:43.640> setup<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.019> this<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.060> one<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:47.450> be

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
range setup so this is a one that can be

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.140 
range setup so this is a one that can be
used<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:48.079> I<00:02:48.290> usually<00:02:48.890> shy<00:02:49.099> away<00:02:49.129> from<00:02:49.400> this

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150
