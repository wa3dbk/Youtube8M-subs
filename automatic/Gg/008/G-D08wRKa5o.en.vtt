00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.680
 rich for hamburgers a lot of people 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.180
 like only with salt and pepper but 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.860
 we like to add a little more 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.010
 of ingredients and these are the 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.829
 next we will get onion 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:41.109
 parsley corn english sauce 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.109
 pepper and ground beef 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.010
 good friends, I am rich and good, I am going to 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.240
 help patti to stir the meat 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 let's put the meat in a big bowl 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.100
 the bigger it is more practical 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.030
 stir let's put the meat 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.030
 we integrate our parsley 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.700
 let's put our onion 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.090
 the onion has to be very good 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.230
 minced, the smaller I am 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.870
 I recommend that you will get richer 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.930
 let's start by integrating the sauce 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.380
 We are also going to put mag and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.840
 We are going to integrate the parts for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.910
 that is stir very well we are also going to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 season with salt and pepper remember that 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.660
 yellow is a little salty but 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.660
 every way you have to bring salt 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 with our very clean hands we are going to 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.719
 begin to integrate the ingredients 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.189
 we are going to press very hard so that 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:52.560
 mix and well let's put a little 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.719
 more of maggie let's put a little 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.420
 more than English to is around 3 to 4 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.670
 tablespoons of each ingredient you have to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.069
 be generous with this because it's going to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.990
 give a lot of flavor to our meat and it's going to 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.990
 be that our recipe is delicious 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.580
 and here we have our revolt very well 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.680
 meat remember that if you have to press 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.599
 well for it to stir perfectly 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.160
 we have here a mold that we are going 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.500
 to use and we wrap it with the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.049
 transparent plastic kitchen so that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.720
 do not stick the meat what we're going to 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.220
 use right now we take a handful of 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.360
 meat 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.400
 we put it in the mold and compress a 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.640
 little bit 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.829
 here and depends on the taste of each person 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.180
 the size they want and the thickness that 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:49.519
 want we want them or yes 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.519
 and now let's take off the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.380
 we are like this we use a mold to 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.380
 that we all remain couples 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.210
 well let's move on to put the meat in 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.240
 the coal I recommend them that 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.090
 let the coal be made embers 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.860
 there are many people who are in a hurry and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.650
 they put the meat then then when it's 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.420
 at stake if they burn the best point 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.760
 to put a hamburger meat is 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.980
 that the coal is red hot and not 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.310
 is throwing a flame that is a fire 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.530
 this 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.489
 a game that is not aggressive we are going to 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.489
 start putting the meat 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.680
 and then we put it on the other side I 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.750
 I put the meat 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.269
 a little bit of oil so you do not 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.269
 stick with a skewer spreads oil 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.670
 Now with another brochita I'm going to 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.670
 put up before turning them over 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.120
 we are ready to turn it around 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.890
 let's put a little oil to 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.310
 our flesh on this side before 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.310
 throw them 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.660
 let's put a cheese on top so that 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.660
 go gratin 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.410
