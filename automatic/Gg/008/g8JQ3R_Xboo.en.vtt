the property is located on the top of a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.749 
the property is located on the top of a
small<00:00:13.049> hill<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> barren<00:00:14.040> hinterland<00:00:14.490> and

small hill in the barren hinterland and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.849 
small hill in the barren hinterland and
that<00:00:15.599> was<00:00:15.750> great<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:16.080> us<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.619> allowed

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
that was great for us because it allowed

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.900 
that was great for us because it allowed
us<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.190> orientate<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.690> house<00:00:18.869> perfectly<00:00:19.910> part

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
us to orientate the house perfectly part

us to orientate the house perfectly part
of<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> brief<00:00:21.449> was<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.020> clients<00:00:22.590> had<00:00:23.150> or

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
of the brief was that the clients had or

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.320 
of the brief was that the clients had or
have<00:00:24.449> our<00:00:24.769> significant<00:00:25.769> art<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.609> book

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
have our significant art and book

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.169 
have our significant art and book
collections<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:29.310> whilst<00:00:29.609> they<00:00:29.789> wanted<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
collections so whilst they wanted a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.429 
collections so whilst they wanted a
house<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.480> had<00:00:30.599> strong<00:00:30.869> connection<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
house that had strong connection to the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.700 
house that had strong connection to the
landscape<00:00:31.830> they<00:00:32.130> also<00:00:32.340> needed<00:00:33.260> walls<00:00:34.260> within

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
landscape they also needed walls within

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
landscape they also needed walls within
the<00:00:34.980> particularly<00:00:35.460> than<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> main<00:00:35.790> living

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the particularly than the main living

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.200 
the particularly than the main living
space<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.020> bedrooms

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
space and the bedrooms

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.459 
space and the bedrooms
they<00:00:39.210> wanted<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> contemporary<00:00:39.989> house<00:00:40.170> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
they wanted a contemporary house but

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.069 
they wanted a contemporary house but
they<00:00:40.590> didn't<00:00:40.770> want<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> glass<00:00:41.100> box<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:42.420> we

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
they didn't want a glass box so we

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.200 
they didn't want a glass box so we
developed<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.649> idea<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> roof<00:00:44.730> opens

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
developed this idea that the roof opens

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840 
developed this idea that the roof opens
up<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.510> north<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.079> has<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> three-quarter

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
up to the north and has a three-quarter

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
up to the north and has a three-quarter
glazed<00:00:48.239> facade<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> north<00:00:49.140> rather<00:00:49.379> than<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
glazed facade to the north rather than a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
glazed facade to the north rather than a
fully<00:00:49.800> glazed<00:00:50.160> facade<00:00:50.899> one<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> ideas

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
fully glazed facade one of the ideas

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.689 
fully glazed facade one of the ideas
that<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.680> had<00:00:52.829> when<00:00:52.980> we're<00:00:53.129> developing<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that we had when we're developing the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.090 
that we had when we're developing the
concept<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> house<00:00:54.300> was<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.780> stone<00:00:55.500> Clint

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
concept of the house was a stone Clint

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.380 
concept of the house was a stone Clint
there's<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> base<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> even<00:00:57.059> though<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.300> only

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
there's a base and even though it only

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270 
there's a base and even though it only
sets<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.050> hundred<00:00:58.410> 50<00:00:58.620> mil<00:00:58.770> off<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> grass

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
sets of hundred 50 mil off the grass

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
sets of hundred 50 mil off the grass
it's<00:01:00.120> still<00:01:00.359> very<00:01:00.570> important<00:01:01.170> obviously

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it's still very important obviously

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's still very important obviously
we've<00:01:01.890> been<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.870> considered<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:04.080> how

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
we've been really considered about how

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.230 
we've been really considered about how
much<00:01:04.500> Sun<00:01:04.769> hits<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.790> different<00:01:05.939> times

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
much Sun hits that at different times

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.330 
much Sun hits that at different times
the<00:01:06.390> year<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.409> sort<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> base<00:01:08.010> for

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the year so that's sort of the base for

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
the year so that's sort of the base for
the<00:01:08.400> scheme<00:01:08.640> above<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.080> idea<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the scheme above that was this idea of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679 
the scheme above that was this idea of
walls<00:01:11.189> folding<00:01:11.729> into<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> roof<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.570> even

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
walls folding into the roof and even

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.640 
walls folding into the roof and even
though<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:12.990> quite<00:01:13.170> subtle

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
though it's quite subtle

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.920 
though it's quite subtle
it's<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.159> very<00:01:14.189> similarly<00:01:14.909> colored<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> very

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it's all very similarly colored and very

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's all very similarly colored and very
just<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.619> slightly<00:01:16.860> off-white<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.970> lights

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
just just slightly off-white the lights

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480 
just just slightly off-white the lights
so<00:01:18.479> strong<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> stark<00:01:19.860> white<00:01:20.100> just

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
so strong up here that stark white just

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.660 
so strong up here that stark white just
is<00:01:21.000> blinding<00:01:21.860> there's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> secretary<00:01:23.340> layer<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
is blinding there's a secretary layer of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
is blinding there's a secretary layer of
sort<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.880> quite<00:01:24.090> warm<00:01:24.360> things<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.259> stone

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
sort of quite warm things the stone

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.580 
sort of quite warm things the stone
fireplace<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.909> timber<00:01:27.210> joinery<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.020> then

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
fireplace the timber joinery and then

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.230 
fireplace the timber joinery and then
we've<00:01:28.829> used<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.159> elements<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.670> landscape

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
we've used some elements of landscape

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
we've used some elements of landscape
walls<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.780> run<00:01:31.079> into<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.409> house<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.189> future

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
walls that run into the house the future

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
walls that run into the house the future
wall<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.030> lead<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.960> entry<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
wall that lead you to the entry and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.050 
wall that lead you to the entry and
there's<00:01:35.070> green<00:01:35.310> walls<00:01:35.610> running<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
there's green walls running to the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.429 
there's green walls running to the
landscape<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> they're<00:01:37.110> sort<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
landscape and they're sort of a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.620 
landscape and they're sort of a
counterpoint<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.549> simplicity<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
counterpoint to the simplicity of the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.020 
counterpoint to the simplicity of the
the<00:01:39.840> main<00:01:40.049> frame<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> house<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.850> think

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the main frame of the house and I think

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.280 
the main frame of the house and I think
that<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.240> another<00:01:42.479> challenge<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> site

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that was another challenge at the site

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 
that was another challenge at the site
really<00:01:43.710> there's<00:01:43.979> no<00:01:44.100> real<00:01:44.310> back

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
really there's no real back

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
really there's no real back
of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> house<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> innovations<00:01:46.950> had

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
of the house and all the innovations had

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.100 
of the house and all the innovations had
to<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.720> equally<00:01:48.720> resolved<00:01:50.960> we're<00:01:51.960> in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
to be equally resolved we're in

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.890 
to be equally resolved we're in
subtropical<00:01:52.710> climate<00:01:53.400> here<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.670> um<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.300> guess

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
subtropical climate here and um I guess

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.780 
subtropical climate here and um I guess
one<00:01:55.080> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> key<00:01:55.350> features<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.550> hot

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
one of the key features is have very hot

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.420 
one of the key features is have very hot
wet<00:01:57.420> summers<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.530> rain<00:01:58.710> really<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.280> be

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
wet summers the rain really can be

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.920 
wet summers the rain really can be
coming<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.180> large<00:02:00.390> quantities

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
coming in in large quantities

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.050 
coming in in large quantities
horizontally<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.550> absolutely<00:02:02.700> crucial

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
horizontally so it is absolutely crucial

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.580 
horizontally so it is absolutely crucial
to<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:04.050> very<00:02:04.290> sheltered

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to have a really very sheltered

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.130 
to have a really very sheltered
protected<00:02:04.950> windows<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.630> them<00:02:07.020> on

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
protected windows and to have them on

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.290 
protected windows and to have them on
every<00:02:07.410> aspect<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.070> that<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.670> keep<00:02:09.090> that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
every aspect so that you can keep that

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.470 
every aspect so that you can keep that
cross<00:02:09.539> ventilation<00:02:09.990> going<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.459> um<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:12.090> used<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
cross ventilation going so um we used a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880 
cross ventilation going so um we used a
lot<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.690> louvers<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.140> particularly<00:02:13.650> high

the<00:02:15.900> eave<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.350> even<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.920> basically<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
the eave so even in the basically the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.949 
the eave so even in the basically the
worst<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:18.000> where<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.420> still<00:02:18.750> get

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
worst of where that you can still get

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.110
