00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
bark C bark just peels right off and you

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.620 
bark C bark just peels right off and you
can<00:00:15.929> take<00:00:16.049> chunks<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.480> pop<00:00:18.480> in

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
can take chunks of it and just pop in

your<00:00:18.720> mouth<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.020> chew<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:23.220> that's

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
your mouth and chew on it and that's

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.650 
your mouth and chew on it and that's
full<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.820> minerals<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.960> vitamins<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.970> has

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
full of minerals and vitamins and it has

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.710 
full of minerals and vitamins and it has
good<00:00:27.869> food<00:00:28.109> value<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.480> pine

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
good food value to it but the the pine

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.650 
good food value to it but the the pine
tree<00:00:30.929> bark<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> indigestible<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.570> other

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
tree bark is indigestible so in other

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.940 
tree bark is indigestible so in other
words<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> swallow<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.680> will<00:00:34.770> pass

words if you swallow it it will pass

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.500 
words if you swallow it it will pass
right<00:00:34.980> through<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.910> won't<00:00:36.000> digest

right through you and you won't digest

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.760 
right through you and you won't digest
it<00:00:36.800> but<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.219> do<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.410> extract

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it but what you can do you can extract

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.330 
it but what you can do you can extract
the<00:00:40.950> sugars<00:00:41.629> from<00:00:42.629> pine<00:00:42.840> tree<00:00:43.050> bark<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:44.160> like

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the sugars from pine tree bark just like

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.959 
the sugars from pine tree bark just like
peeling<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> peel<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> bark<00:00:47.160> off<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.850> get

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
peeling it and peel the bark off and get

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.020 
peeling it and peel the bark off and get
a<00:00:48.000> bunch<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:49.039> put<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.070> into<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.370> flat<00:00:50.640> shallow

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
a bunch of it put it into a flat shallow

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.139 
a bunch of it put it into a flat shallow
tray<00:00:51.860> with<00:00:52.860> about<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:54.180> much<00:00:54.360> water<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
tray with about that much water in it

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.119 
tray with about that much water in it
and<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.270> take<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> pine<00:00:58.410> cone<00:00:58.440> or<00:00:58.859> something

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and you take a pine cone or something

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.450 
and you take a pine cone or something
like<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.699> crush<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> crush<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.949> bark<00:01:02.190> in

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
like that and crush it crush the bark in

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
like that and crush it crush the bark in
the<00:01:02.850> water<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:04.019> crush<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:07.260> can

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the water and crush it up and you can

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
the water and crush it up and you can
get<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> sugar<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.180> makes<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
get the sugar out of it and it makes a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
get the sugar out of it and it makes a
nice<00:01:09.659> sweet<00:01:10.049> drink<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> drink<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.060> can

have honey and the pine cones pine cones

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
have honey and the pine cones pine cones
of<00:01:23.850> course<00:01:24.090> most<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.930> when<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.470> them

of course most of them when you get them
are<00:01:25.710> sealed<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.900> burn

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
are sealed like this you have to burn

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.230 
are sealed like this you have to burn
them<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> fire<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:29.610> burn<00:01:29.790> them<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> fire

them in a fire you burn them in a fire

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.679 
them in a fire you burn them in a fire
and<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:31.290> will<00:01:31.380> open<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.909> inside<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and they will open up and inside the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.630 
and they will open up and inside the
pine<00:01:33.900> cone<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.640> pine<00:01:35.640> cone<00:01:35.850> seat<00:01:36.150> or<00:01:36.840> pine<00:01:37.110> nuts

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
pine cone is pine cone seat or pine nuts

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
pine cone is pine cone seat or pine nuts
and<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:39.210> course<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.540> eat<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> pine<00:01:39.930> nuts

and of course you can eat the pine nuts

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.630 
and of course you can eat the pine nuts
then<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.950> good<00:01:41.100> food<00:01:41.280> value<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.369> pine

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.560 

you<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.520> can't<00:01:53.729> say<00:01:53.880> enough<00:01:54.060> about<00:01:54.180> pine

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
you just can't say enough about pine

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.600 
you just can't say enough about pine
trees<00:01:54.840> because<00:01:55.350> they're<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.190> completely

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
trees because they're just so completely

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.520 
trees because they're just so completely
useful<00:01:57.150> there's<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.540> many<00:01:57.659> parts<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> pine

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
useful there's so many parts of the pine

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.340 
useful there's so many parts of the pine
tree<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.130> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.240> use<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.570> food<00:02:00.750> used<00:02:01.229> to

species of pine trees form burrows on

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.670 
species of pine trees form burrows on
the<00:02:23.459> branches<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.030> smaller<00:02:24.300> branches<00:02:24.780> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the branches on the smaller branches and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.949 
the branches on the smaller branches and
yet<00:02:26.580> another<00:02:26.760> use<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.239> pine<00:02:27.420> tree<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
yet another use for the pine tree is to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.320 
yet another use for the pine tree is to
take<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.739> branch<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.580> has<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> burrow

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
take a branch like this it has a burrow

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.640 
take a branch like this it has a burrow
like<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.250> okay<00:02:32.780> nice<00:02:33.780> handle<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.440> end<00:02:34.590> of
