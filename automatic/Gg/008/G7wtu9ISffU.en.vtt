00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
from what I can see they work pretty

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.910

well<00:02:30.140> I'm<00:02:31.140> still<00:02:31.350> going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.560> read<00:02:31.740> some<00:02:31.890> more

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
well I'm still going to read some more
reviews<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.430> maybe<00:02:32.790> some<00:02:33.030> different<00:02:33.360> things

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
reviews on maybe some different things

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.470 
reviews on maybe some different things
to<00:02:33.780> try<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:34.890> far<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.970> outcome

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
to try but so far I like the outcome

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.460 
to try but so far I like the outcome
that<00:02:36.860> they<00:02:37.860> give<00:02:38.160> my<00:02:38.340> locks<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.990> then<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> rub<00:02:40.440> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
that they give my locks so then I rub a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.390 
that they give my locks so then I rub a
few<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:41.010> bun<00:02:41.310> which<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.570> hair<00:02:42.990> that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
few on my bun which is the hair that

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.500 
few on my bun which is the hair that
usually<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.490> up<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.880> bun<00:02:45.060> which<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.360> why<00:02:45.480> I

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
usually is up in a bun which is why I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.180 
usually is up in a bun which is why I
didn't<00:02:45.720> take<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.989> down<00:02:46.170> because<00:02:46.709> those

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
didn't take it down because those

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.070 
didn't take it down because those
strands<00:02:47.580> usually<00:02:48.060> show<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.570> didn't<00:02:48.840> want<00:02:48.989> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
strands usually show so I didn't want to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.240 
strands usually show so I didn't want to
put<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> little<00:02:49.470> bit<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.680> shine<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:50.040> those

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
put a little bit of shine on those

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:59.780 
put a little bit of shine on those
strands<00:02:50.640> as<00:02:50.820> well

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.750 

so<00:03:01.080> ears<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.319> those<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.950> really<00:03:03.099> like<00:03:03.400> because

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
so ears like those I really like because

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.789 
so ears like those I really like because
it<00:03:03.909> gives<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.269> my<00:03:04.360> life's<00:03:04.599> character<00:03:05.079> but<00:03:05.680> if

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
it gives to my life's character but if

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.140

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
them just a tad what I do is I start off

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.280 
them just a tad what I do is I start off
with<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.640> palm<00:03:09.970> roll<00:03:10.269> just<00:03:10.510> too<00:03:10.659> tight<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.140> lock

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
with a palm roll just too tight and lock

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.449 
with a palm roll just too tight and lock
the<00:03:11.439> hair<00:03:11.650> up<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.860> little<00:03:11.890> bit<00:03:12.220> which

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
the hair up a little bit which

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.559 
the hair up a little bit which
definitely<00:03:12.939> helps<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:14.849> then<00:03:15.849> here<00:03:16.269> I'm<00:03:16.450> not

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
definitely helps and then here I'm not

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.020 
definitely helps and then here I'm not
sure<00:03:16.659> if<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:16.930> can<00:03:17.079> see<00:03:17.379> me<00:03:17.590> but<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.760> already

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
sure if you can see me but it already

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.500 
sure if you can see me but it already
starts<00:03:19.659> to<00:03:20.430> minimize<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.670> frizz<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
starts to minimize the frizz and the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.430 
starts to minimize the frizz and the
unrivaled<00:03:22.930> look<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.299> then<00:03:25.299> what<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.480> do<00:03:25.599> is<00:03:26.079> I

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440
