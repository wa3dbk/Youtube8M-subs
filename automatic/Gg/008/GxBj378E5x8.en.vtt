00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
the entire part here and rotate it up

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.029 
the entire part here and rotate it up
there<00:02:07.619> we<00:02:07.710> go

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
there we go

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
well we do that we'll just hold that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.850 
well we do that we'll just hold that
rotates<00:02:12.990> legs<00:02:13.350> as<00:02:13.740> we're<00:02:14.250> flipping<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.030> up

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
rotates legs as we're flipping it up

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.730 
rotates legs as we're flipping it up
there<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:16.950> go<00:02:17.070> got<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.520> locked<00:02:17.760> into<00:02:17.970> place

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
there we go got that locked into place

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.010 
there we go got that locked into place
turn<00:02:19.740> these<00:02:19.920> rear<00:02:20.640> legs<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.090> bug<00:02:21.360> around<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
turn these rear legs of bug around and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.060 
turn these rear legs of bug around and
take<00:02:23.010> them<00:02:23.310> into<00:02:23.730> place<00:02:24.590> I'll<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.890> same

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
take them into place I'll do the same

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.460 
take them into place I'll do the same
thing<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.610> side<00:02:26.670> they're<00:02:27.660> going<00:02:28.290> then

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
thing for this side they're going then

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.080 
thing for this side they're going then
we<00:02:28.530> get<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.800> legs<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:31.640> then<00:02:32.640> we'll<00:02:32.850> take

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
we get the legs here and then we'll take

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.450 
we get the legs here and then we'll take
what<00:02:33.450> will<00:02:33.690> become<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.110> arms<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:34.980> what<00:02:35.370> is

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
what will become the arms or what is

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.840 
what will become the arms or what is
obviously<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.150> arms<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.050> just<00:02:37.350> rotate<00:02:38.070> and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
obviously the arms and just rotate and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.630 
obviously the arms and just rotate and
fold<00:02:39.120> them<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.950> like<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.950> yeah<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.520> got

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
fold them out like that and yeah you got

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.930 
fold them out like that and yeah you got
to<00:02:44.730> get<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.900> wasp<00:02:46.140> legs<00:02:46.580> situated<00:02:47.580> right

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
to get the the wasp legs situated right

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.190 
to get the the wasp legs situated right
so<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.010> then<00:02:50.010> we'll<00:02:50.400> come<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.640> here<00:02:51.050> slip<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
so and then we'll come up here slip the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.370 
so and then we'll come up here slip the
head<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:53.150> enough<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.420> get<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.810> swing<00:02:55.170> down

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
head just enough to get it to swing down

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.640 
head just enough to get it to swing down
and<00:02:55.710> then<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.270> little<00:02:57.570> slider<00:02:57.990> look<00:02:58.530> at

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
and then it's on a little slider look at

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.160 
and then it's on a little slider look at
that<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.190> then<00:02:59.850> plug<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.210> into<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.540> chest<00:03:00.750> so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
that and then plug it into the chest so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.060 
that and then plug it into the chest so
we'll<00:03:01.260> do<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> same<00:03:01.620> thing<00:03:01.680> over<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.120> and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
we'll do the same thing over here and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.450 
we'll do the same thing over here and

there we go now I was a little bit

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.000 
there we go now I was a little bit
disappointed<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.180> fact<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:10.010> wasp

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
disappointed in the fact that the wasp

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.410 
disappointed in the fact that the wasp
mode<00:03:11.550> where<00:03:12.150> I'm<00:03:12.270> sorry<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.690> robot<00:03:13.380> mode<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:14.420> a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
mode where I'm sorry the robot mode is a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.970 
mode where I'm sorry the robot mode is a
little<00:03:15.810> bit<00:03:15.960> lacking<00:03:16.200> oops<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:16.950> just

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
little bit lacking oops I just

discovered that was not paid in
correctly<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:20.280> wasp<00:03:20.700> mode<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.240> face

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
correctly the wasp mode of the face

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.230 
correctly the wasp mode of the face
specifically<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.770> missing<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.580> little<00:03:23.760> bit<00:03:23.880> now

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
in these first generation of beasts

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.040 
in these first generation of beasts
Horus<00:03:27.000> figures<00:03:27.330> they<00:03:27.540> had<00:03:27.690> what<00:03:27.870> was<00:03:27.990> called

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
in the show the robot head I just

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.190 
in the show the robot head I just
unplugged<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.970> in<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.150> front<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> back

and then swinging around the robot head

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.880 
and then swinging around the robot head
is<00:03:46.890> oddly<00:03:47.700> enough<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:48.450> was<00:03:48.890> repainted

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
is oddly enough this was repainted

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.830

gonna go with that one now the one issue

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.449 
gonna go with that one now the one issue
I<00:04:11.850> have<00:04:12.270> is<00:04:12.540> if<00:04:12.959> these<00:04:13.260> Park<00:04:13.800> lined<00:04:14.160> up

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
I have is if these Park lined up

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.199 
I have is if these Park lined up
perfectly<00:04:15.420> when<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.810> rotate<00:04:16.260> these<00:04:16.440> heads<00:04:17.209> it

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
perfectly when you rotate these heads it

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.060 
perfectly when you rotate these heads it
gets<00:04:18.510> really<00:04:19.020> really<00:04:19.260> finicky<00:04:21.380> but<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.950> know

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
gets really really finicky but you know

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.260 
gets really really finicky but you know
just<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.370> little<00:04:23.430> bit<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.700> fiddling<00:04:24.030> we'll<00:04:24.180> get

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
just a little bit of fiddling we'll get

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.050 
just a little bit of fiddling we'll get
it<00:04:24.360> back<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.540> normal

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
it back to normal

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.170 
it back to normal
so<00:04:25.680> he<00:04:26.680> can<00:04:26.830> wield<00:04:27.010> his<00:04:27.190> gun<00:04:27.430> perfectly<00:04:28.000> fine

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
so he can wield his gun perfectly fine

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.110 
so he can wield his gun perfectly fine
like<00:04:30.420> so<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.920> he<00:04:33.100> does<00:04:33.280> have<00:04:33.460> missiles<00:04:33.880> each

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
like so and he does have missiles each

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.820 
like so and he does have missiles each
missile<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:34.780> actually<00:04:35.200> part<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.650> wing

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
missile is actually part of the wing

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.790 
missile is actually part of the wing
it's<00:04:36.130> contained<00:04:36.580> underneath<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.120> wing<00:04:37.270> and

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
it's contained underneath the wing and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.490 
it's contained underneath the wing and
it's<00:04:38.800> great<00:04:39.280> storage<00:04:39.669> area<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.270> wish<00:04:41.050> more<00:04:41.260> bug

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
it's great storage area I wish more bug

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.000 
it's great storage area I wish more bug
figures<00:04:41.860> did<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:43.500> unfortunately<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:44.530> think<00:04:44.680> the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
figures did it unfortunately I think the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.230 
figures did it unfortunately I think the
spring<00:04:45.400> on<00:04:45.550> line<00:04:45.730> is<00:04:45.910> busted<00:04:48.000> maybe<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.150> is

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
spring on line is busted maybe it is

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.890 
spring on line is busted maybe it is
maybe<00:04:49.389> it<00:04:49.600> isn't

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
maybe it isn't

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.320 
maybe it isn't
or<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.080> just<00:04:50.260> haven't<00:04:50.680> lined<00:04:50.830> up<00:04:51.010> mom<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.430> do<00:04:52.300> not

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
or I just haven't lined up mom I do not

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.600 
or I just haven't lined up mom I do not
know<00:04:54.870> yep<00:04:55.900> oh<00:04:56.139> no<00:04:56.740> there<00:04:56.980> we<00:04:57.040> go<00:04:57.130> whoa<00:04:57.310> that

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
know yep oh no there we go whoa that

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.400 
know yep oh no there we go whoa that
that<00:04:57.910> shut<00:04:58.480> out<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.660> lot<00:04:58.870> harder<00:04:59.080> than<00:04:59.230> I

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
that shut out a lot harder than I

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.490 
that shut out a lot harder than I
thought<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.650> was<00:04:59.740> going<00:04:59.919> to<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:01.320> there<00:05:02.320> we<00:05:02.440> go

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
thought it was going to so there we go

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.780 
thought it was going to so there we go
articulation<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:05.950> is<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.250> little<00:05:06.550> bit<00:05:06.640> limited

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
articulation it is a little bit limited

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.340 
articulation it is a little bit limited
due<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.300> wings<00:05:07.540> which<00:05:07.780> you<00:05:07.900> can<00:05:08.080> get<00:05:08.260> out

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
due to the wings which you can get out

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.260 
due to the wings which you can get out
of<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.530> way<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.280> thorax<00:05:09.790> of<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.090> bug

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
of the way and the thorax of the bug

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.010 
of the way and the thorax of the bug
which<00:05:10.630> just<00:05:10.810> gets<00:05:10.990> in<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.200> way<00:05:11.290> and<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:13.020> giant

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
which just gets in the way and the giant

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.620 
which just gets in the way and the giant
wasp<00:05:14.320> legs<00:05:14.830> that<00:05:15.160> hang<00:05:15.400> off<00:05:15.580> they<00:05:16.270> get<00:05:16.419> in<00:05:16.540> the

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
wasp legs that hang off they get in the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.150 
wasp legs that hang off they get in the
way<00:05:16.750> but<00:05:16.960> they<00:05:17.080> can<00:05:17.320> move<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.800> little<00:05:17.919> bit

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
way but they can move a little bit

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.950 
way but they can move a little bit
otherwise<00:05:19.560> possibility<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:20.710> nice<00:05:20.979> I<00:05:21.430> mean<00:05:21.960> for
