to the middle and I dropped my heal
spell<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:33.479> don't<00:01:33.659> die<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
spell so just so they don't die out and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
spell so just so they don't die out and
basically<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.970> best<00:01:36.150> attacks<00:01:36.570> Reggie<00:01:36.900> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
basically the best attacks Reggie I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
basically the best attacks Reggie I
think<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.290> these<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.619> gonna<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.299> rush

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
think with these is gonna be as a rush

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.780 
think with these is gonna be as a rush
the<00:01:39.479> Town<00:01:39.659> Hall<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:39.990> fast<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> can

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
the Town Hall as fast as you can

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
the Town Hall as fast as you can
hopefully<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.090> destroy<00:01:42.509> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
hopefully to destroy it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.289 
hopefully to destroy it
and<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.100> fella<00:01:44.610> keys<00:01:44.820> are<00:01:44.970> very

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
and because the fella keys are very

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
and because the fella keys are very
powerful<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.930> very<00:01:46.079> quick<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.310> already

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
powerful and very quick and I already

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.429 
powerful and very quick and I already
said<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.049> use<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> heal

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
said that then you just use the heal

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.920 
said that then you just use the heal
spells<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> keep<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.220> alive<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:51.689> take

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
spells to keep them alive and they take

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.569 
spells to keep them alive and they take

that's pretty nice and I don't know I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.740 
that's pretty nice and I don't know I
kind<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.700> messed<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.270> my<00:02:18.390> editing

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
kind of messed it up with my editing

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.720 
kind of messed it up with my editing
with<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.200> clouds<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.770> stuff<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.340> sorry<00:02:20.580> about

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
with the clouds and stuff so sorry about

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.520 
with the clouds and stuff so sorry about
that<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.970> doesn't<00:02:21.240> look<00:02:21.360> very<00:02:21.420> smooth<00:02:21.840> for

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
that it doesn't look very smooth for

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.460 
that it doesn't look very smooth for
when<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.710> transmit<00:02:23.840> transition<00:02:24.840> into<00:02:25.110> attacks

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
when I transmit transition into attacks

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.020 
when I transmit transition into attacks
but<00:02:25.800> yeah<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.910> another

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
but yeah so you can see this is another

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.440 
but yeah so you can see this is another
pretty<00:02:27.930> high-caliber<00:02:28.560> base<00:02:28.940> or<00:02:29.940> higher<00:02:30.180> up

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
pretty high-caliber base or higher up

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.710 
pretty high-caliber base or higher up
there<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.770> great<00:02:32.480> he<00:02:33.480> has<00:02:33.600> some

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
there it's not that great he has some

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.090 
there it's not that great he has some
lower<00:02:33.960> levels<00:02:34.320> stuff<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.830> wizard

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
lower levels stuff like the wizard

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.700 
lower levels stuff like the wizard
towers<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.580> his<00:02:35.700> walls<00:02:35.910> aren't<00:02:36.180> very<00:02:36.300> high

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
towers and his walls aren't very high

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.370 
towers and his walls aren't very high
but<00:02:37.710> he<00:02:37.770> does<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.220> inferno<00:02:38.520> towers

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
but he does have the inferno towers

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.740 
but he does have the inferno towers
so<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:41.520> makes<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> little<00:02:42.060> higher<00:02:42.300> up<00:02:42.330> there

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
so it makes it a little higher up there

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.750 
so it makes it a little higher up there
you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.380> see<00:02:43.500> I'm<00:02:43.620> dropping<00:02:43.980> my<00:02:44.010> heal<00:02:44.490> spell

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
you can see I'm dropping my heal spell

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
you can see I'm dropping my heal spell
just<00:02:44.940> make<00:02:45.090> sure<00:02:45.240> they<00:02:45.360> don't<00:02:45.390> die<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
just make sure they don't die and the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.680 
just make sure they don't die and the
infirm<00:02:47.310> tours<00:02:47.550> are<00:02:47.760> locking<00:02:48.090> onto<00:02:48.210> them<00:02:48.480> right

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
infirm tours are locking onto them right

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.080 
infirm tours are locking onto them right
now<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.860> prevents<00:02:50.310> them<00:02:50.460> from<00:02:50.520> being

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
now and that prevents them from being

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.900 
now and that prevents them from being
healed<00:02:51.540> my<00:02:51.900> batteries<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.130> dropped<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.530 
dropped everything else and they all
funneled<00:02:59.760> into<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.060> middle<00:03:00.270> they're<00:03:00.390> all

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
though they're very quick deal a lot of

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.230 
though they're very quick deal a lot of
damage<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.370> take<00:03:26.490> out<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> lot<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:26.940> buildings

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
damage and take out a lot of buildings

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.180 
damage and take out a lot of buildings
because<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:28.380> tako<00:03:28.680> buildings<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.130> are

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
because the tako buildings that are

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.890 
because the tako buildings that are
right<00:03:29.400> next<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.700> each<00:03:29.850> other<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.750> makes

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
right next to each other so that makes

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.720 
right next to each other so that makes
them<00:03:31.020> very<00:03:31.290> good<00:03:31.500> I'm<00:03:32.010> glad<00:03:32.190> they<00:03:32.370> made<00:03:32.550> least

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
them very good I'm glad they made least

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.480 
them very good I'm glad they made least
they<00:03:33.390> buff<00:03:33.570> this<00:03:33.750> trooper<00:03:34.230> they<00:03:34.740> did<00:03:34.920> it's<00:03:35.340> not

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
they buff this trooper they did it's not

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.030 
they buff this trooper they did it's not
only<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.700> buff<00:03:36.530> because<00:03:37.530> they<00:03:37.650> didn't<00:03:37.800> improve

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
only a buff because they didn't improve

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.620 
only a buff because they didn't improve
the<00:03:38.190> stats<00:03:38.490> or<00:03:38.670> anything<00:03:38.850> but<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.270> did<00:03:39.420> make<00:03:39.600> it

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
the stats or anything but it did make it

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.120 
the stats or anything but it did make it
better<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.170> kind<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.620> with<00:03:40.860> like<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
better so it kind of is with like the

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.800 
better so it kind of is with like the
new<00:03:41.220> ability<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:41.910> guess<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.420> kind<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.750> a

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
new ability so I guess it kind of is a

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.800 
new ability so I guess it kind of is a
buff<00:03:43.050> but<00:03:43.920> yeah<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.700> they<00:03:44.850> are<00:03:44.970> very<00:03:45.300> good<00:03:45.540> very

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
buff but yeah so they are very good very

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.510 
buff but yeah so they are very good very

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
I do like them a lot they take a quite a

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.150

while<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.900> make<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.080> think<00:04:22.169> they<00:04:22.410> take<00:04:22.560> like<00:04:22.680> 15

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
while to make I think they take like 15

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.400 
while to make I think they take like 15
minutes<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.550> make<00:04:23.729> so<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.900> quite<00:04:25.200> a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
minutes to make so that is quite a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.770 
minutes to make so that is quite a
long<00:04:25.560> time<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:26.520> don't<00:04:26.970> know<00:04:27.150> how<00:04:27.330> they<00:04:27.510> are<00:04:27.540> at

long time I don't know how they are at

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.300 
long time I don't know how they are at
level<00:04:28.080> one<00:04:28.260> or<00:04:28.440> level<00:04:28.470> two<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.220> new

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
level one or level two with the new

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.890 
level one or level two with the new
ability<00:04:29.700> but<00:04:29.850> level<00:04:30.000> three<00:04:30.330> they're<00:04:30.660> still

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
ability but level three they're still

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.790

wrecking<00:04:31.230> some<00:04:31.700> higher<00:04:32.700> level<00:04:32.730> bases<00:04:33.390> and

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
wrecking some higher level bases and

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.230 
wrecking some higher level bases and
they<00:04:34.800> saw<00:04:35.010> they<00:04:35.280> can<00:04:35.430> still<00:04:35.610> be<00:04:35.640> upgraded<00:04:36.150> to
