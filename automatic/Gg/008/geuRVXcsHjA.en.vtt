00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.980
 after more than half a century of 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.190
 colombia violence today is again 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.790
 recognized as a country that advances with 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.760
 firm step towards peace and towards 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.280
 respect for life before the community 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.190
 international we are a reference of 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.570
 hope we have made real progress 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.940
 in health in education in quality of life 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.930
 but all that effort is destroyed 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.750
 when a single person dies because of 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.680
 the violence still more than 1000 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.730
 people die violently every month 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.219
 as a society we can not afford 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.579
 miss these years of effort 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:07.320
 collective why I want to reiterate my 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.540
 decision to support the march for life 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.120
 promoted by antanas mockus my old 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.250
 contender 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:20.610
 life has no ideology life 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.000
 can have contradictors the life of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.180
 our children our women our 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.010
 young and from every Colombian so be it 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.210
 contradictor needs to be protected and 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.500
 valued for that as president but 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.080
 especially as a Colombian I invite you to 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.440
 everyone to come out this Sunday, the 8th 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.380
 march to the streets to say that the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.650
 life is sacred as not to march through 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.650
 lifetime
