00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 the deal we will achieve a delicious 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 caramelized apple cake you go 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.719
 see the recipe is very simple first 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.420
 thing you preheat your oven to 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.039
 180 ° and you have shirt and your mold 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.920
 for shirt and a larger mold 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.630
 it is butter ointment and flour then 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 firstly you will choose four 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.080
 nice apples to cook and you go them 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.090
 peel and cut into large cubes 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.529
 in a pan you will put a whole 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.660
 little bit of brown sugar butter 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.600
 and you're going to add your apples we're going 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950
 put a brisk fire for six to seven 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 minutes and during that time we're going 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.750
 make the cake apparatus yoghurt 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.920
 so first operation we're going to separate 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.289
 the whites of the yellow bardet a little 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.700
 blow plates and from there you 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.760
 will never have shells in the white 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.550
 we never break the eggs on the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.030
 salad bowl we will take the velvety 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.050
 we empty the totality so what is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 interesting is that it will bring a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.989
 little creamy side to the cake we start 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.350
 to mix and we will fill an organ of 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 sugar no need to ask with this cake 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:15.630
 the weighings are made thanks to the pot of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.080
 yoghurt and mix a pot of starch 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.170
 but 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.130
 okay, we move slowly by bus 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.619
 he brought back a volume of flour and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.939
 will add 1/2 in oil then a 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.130
 neutral oil to the oil scene 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.110
 sunflower can put a rapeseed oil 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.150
 here is the yoghurt cake mix and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.759
 super creamy me I love added a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.229
 a little lemon zest we go now 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.970
 ride our whites in snow you go 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.840
 see it's very simple actually the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.090
 whites in snow it's like bubbles 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 of soap it is necessary that really your whites 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.100
 are at most in contact with arms 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 whip then games the pench and I 'm 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.460
 I do not need to go too hard I 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.890
 will show you is using nothing to brew 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.920
 the air of the very efficient but white 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.840
 snow are we are a little bit of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.290
 shaving cream or cream consistency 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.000
 chantilly 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.310
 we will add the rest of the sugar 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.560
 the equivalent of half a pau the sugar 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.270
 that is to say 2 tablespoons to the I 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.830
 am going to 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.420
 re mixed for about 30 seconds 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.250

 of the mold and I will gently pour 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.700
 a device I equalize very quickly 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.470
