00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:09.029 

look<00:00:00.940> at<00:00:01.329> the<00:00:01.599> Stars<00:00:06.900> each<00:00:07.900> of<00:00:08.200> them<00:00:08.379> is<00:00:08.619> a<00:00:08.650> Sun

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:09.039 
look at the Stars each of them is a Sun

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:14.209 
look at the Stars each of them is a Sun
like<00:00:09.309> ours<00:00:09.579> and<00:00:10.409> our<00:00:11.409> son<00:00:11.740> has<00:00:12.099> Planet<00:00:12.549> Earth

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
like ours and our son has Planet Earth

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.530 
like ours and our son has Planet Earth
could<00:00:15.219> this<00:00:15.369> really<00:00:15.459> be<00:00:15.669> the<00:00:15.789> only<00:00:16.059> planet

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
could this really be the only planet

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.920 
could this really be the only planet
anywhere<00:00:16.990> that's<00:00:17.200> full<00:00:17.470> of<00:00:17.590> life

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.870 

to<00:00:22.930> find<00:00:23.170> out<00:00:23.380> we<00:00:23.650> must<00:00:23.830> leave<00:00:24.040> our<00:00:24.370> own<00:00:24.580> world

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
to find out we must leave our own world

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.180 
to find out we must leave our own world
behind<00:00:27.900> let's<00:00:28.900> travel<00:00:29.170> further<00:00:31.980> beyond<00:00:32.980> our

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
behind let's travel further beyond our

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:43.490 
behind let's travel further beyond our
Sun<00:00:33.520> and<00:00:33.790> out<00:00:34.150> into<00:00:34.540> space

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.299 

there's<00:00:44.500> Mars<00:00:44.860> cold<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.970> inhospitable

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.240 

next<00:00:52.309> is<00:00:52.550> Jupiter<00:00:52.879> a<00:00:53.390> vast<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.530> lifeless<00:00:55.039> ball

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
next is Jupiter a vast and lifeless ball

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.240 
next is Jupiter a vast and lifeless ball
of<00:00:55.399> gas<00:00:58.300> then<00:00:59.300> another<00:00:59.570> gas<00:00:59.839> giant<00:01:00.289> Saturn

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.250 

then<00:01:06.970> Uranus<00:01:07.480> Neptune<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.380> all

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.900 

all<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.010> other<00:01:12.160> planets<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.730> our<00:01:12.850> solar

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
all the other planets of our solar

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.930 
all the other planets of our solar
system<00:01:13.600> are<00:01:13.750> barren<00:01:14.140> worlds<00:01:14.710> devoid<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.310> life

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
system are barren worlds devoid of life

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.480 
system are barren worlds devoid of life
but<00:01:16.720> beyond<00:01:17.080> our<00:01:17.290> solar<00:01:17.560> system<00:01:18.010> are<00:01:18.280> the

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
but beyond our solar system are the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.030 
but beyond our solar system are the
stars<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.240> remember<00:01:19.630> each<00:01:20.260> of<00:01:20.500> these<00:01:20.710> is

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
stars and remember each of these is

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.060 
stars and remember each of these is
another<00:01:21.310> Sun<00:01:22.140> four<00:01:23.140> hundred<00:01:23.590> thousand

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
another Sun four hundred thousand

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.140 
another Sun four hundred thousand
million<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.550> them<00:01:24.730> in<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.910> vast<00:01:25.180> swirling<00:01:25.780> cloud

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
million of them in a vast swirling cloud

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.110 
million of them in a vast swirling cloud
the<00:01:28.150> Milky<00:01:28.570> Way<00:01:28.750> our<00:01:29.820> galaxy<00:01:31.980> and<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:34.030> you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
the Milky Way our galaxy and when you

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.140 
the Milky Way our galaxy and when you
leave<00:01:34.270> our<00:01:34.450> galaxy<00:01:34.990> behind<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.790> begin<00:01:37.030> to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
leave our galaxy behind you begin to

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.950 
leave our galaxy behind you begin to
realize<00:01:37.270> just<00:01:37.690> how<00:01:37.810> vast<00:01:38.230> universe<00:01:38.920> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
realize just how vast universe is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.500 
realize just how vast universe is
because<00:01:40.960> each<00:01:41.230> of<00:01:41.260> these<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.340> galaxy<00:01:42.790> just

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
because each of these is a galaxy just

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.420 
because each of these is a galaxy just
like<00:01:43.750> ours<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.820> these<00:01:45.820> are<00:01:46.270> clouds<00:01:46.720> of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
like ours and these are clouds of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.640 
like ours and these are clouds of
galaxies<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:49.450> all<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.750> is<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.350> really

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
galaxies in all this is it really

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.350 
galaxies in all this is it really
possible<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.460> only<00:01:51.850> planet<00:01:52.240> with

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
possible that the only planet with

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.800 
possible that the only planet with
intelligent<00:01:52.510> life<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:54.640> one

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
