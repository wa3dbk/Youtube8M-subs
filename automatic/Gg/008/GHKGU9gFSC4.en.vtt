it wasn't cooperating all the rest of
them<00:02:33.000> work<00:02:33.150> first<00:02:33.510> time

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
them work first time

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.979 
them work first time
so<00:02:35.450> add<00:02:35.719> it<00:02:35.959> we<00:02:36.140> do<00:02:36.319> this<00:02:36.469> with<00:02:36.620> several<00:02:36.980> times

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
so add it we do this with several times

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
center prong see what I'm connecting

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.320 
center prong see what I'm connecting
with<00:02:40.939> the<00:02:41.239> center<00:02:41.659> wire

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
with the center wire

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.009 
with the center wire
but

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
but

00:02:45.019 --> 00:03:01.160 
but
took<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> few<00:02:45.650> Drive<00:02:46.010> keep<00:02:46.700> do<00:02:46.879> it<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.510> works

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.770 

well
