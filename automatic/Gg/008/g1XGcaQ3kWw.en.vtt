00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
into it yeah right so traditionally this

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.360 
into it yeah right so traditionally this
matchup<00:03:20.690> back<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> old<00:03:21.470> days<00:03:21.680> yeah<00:03:22.100> as<00:03:22.250> I

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
matchup back in the old days yeah as I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.330 
matchup back in the old days yeah as I
would<00:03:22.489> say<00:03:23.170> if<00:03:24.170> Falcon<00:03:24.800> got<00:03:24.920> above<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.160> certain

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
would say if Falcon got above a certain

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.830 
would say if Falcon got above a certain
percent<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.640> became<00:03:25.820> really<00:03:26.000> hard<00:03:26.239> for<00:03:26.540> Martha

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
percent it became really hard for Martha

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.300 
percent it became really hard for Martha
finishes<00:03:27.200> yes<00:03:27.380> absolutely

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
finishes yes absolutely

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
finishes yes absolutely
Marth<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.640> think<00:03:28.820> that<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.000> know<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.120> don't

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
Marth I think that you know I don't

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.479 
Marth I think that you know I don't
think<00:03:29.480> that's<00:03:29.600> just<00:03:29.800> just<00:03:30.800> Captain<00:03:31.130> Falcon<00:03:31.280> I

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
think that's just just Captain Falcon I

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.850 
think that's just just Captain Falcon I
think<00:03:31.670> most<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.239> lot<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:33.110> characters<00:03:33.500> first

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
think most a lot of characters first

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.900 
think most a lot of characters first
there's<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.100> lot<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.310> characters<00:03:34.550> mom<00:03:34.700> kind<00:03:34.880> of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
there's a lot of characters mom kind of

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.880 
there's a lot of characters mom kind of
suffers<00:03:35.209> from<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.390> peach<00:03:35.959> very<00:03:36.500> notably

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
suffers from that peach very notably

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.370 
suffers from that peach very notably
yeah<00:03:37.310> because<00:03:38.300> Mars<00:03:38.660> got<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.870> lot<00:03:39.050> of<00:03:39.140> ways<00:03:39.260> to

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
yeah because Mars got a lot of ways to

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.490 
yeah because Mars got a lot of ways to
combo<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:39.860> was<00:03:40.010> kill<00:03:40.220> moves<00:03:40.459> but<00:03:41.120> just<00:03:41.500> hitting

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
combo in was kill moves but just hitting

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.910 
combo in was kill moves but just hitting
um<00:03:43.060> hitting<00:03:44.060> his<00:03:44.180> kill<00:03:44.360> who's<00:03:44.570> a<00:03:44.600> raw<00:03:45.320> is<00:03:45.680> not

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
um hitting his kill who's a raw is not

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.140 
um hitting his kill who's a raw is not
always<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.310> easiest<00:03:46.340> thing<00:03:46.730> in<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.850> world<00:03:46.910> to

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
always the easiest thing in the world to

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.120 
always the easiest thing in the world to
do<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.780> above<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.230> certain<00:03:48.560> percent<00:03:48.830> who<00:03:48.920> can't

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
do and above a certain percent who can't

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.830

Asgard right now I like that I like that

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.060 
Asgard right now I like that I like that
you<00:03:56.780> do<00:03:56.870> D<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.290> he<00:03:57.380> did<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.620> four<00:03:57.830> door<00:03:57.980> to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
you do D that he did the four door to

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.140 
you do D that he did the four door to
just<00:03:58.250> send<00:03:58.370> him<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.489> little<00:03:58.730> bit<00:03:58.850> further<00:03:59.060> off

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
just send him a little bit further off

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.110 
just send him a little bit further off
and<00:03:59.420> then

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
and then

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.160 
and then
right<00:04:02.239> didn't<00:04:03.239> let<00:04:03.330> him<00:04:03.420> get<00:04:03.569> higher<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.080> you

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
right didn't let him get higher so you

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.229 
right didn't let him get higher so you
get<00:04:04.290> Falcon<00:04:04.650> kick<00:04:04.830> maybe<00:04:05.069> it's<00:04:05.940> something<00:04:06.090> a

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
get Falcon kick maybe it's something a

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.670 
get Falcon kick maybe it's something a
little<00:04:06.420> tricky<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.690> get<00:04:06.810> back<00:04:07.019> on<00:04:07.230> have<00:04:07.530> some

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
little tricky to get back on have some

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.470 
little tricky to get back on have some
kind<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:07.890> in<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.129> range<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.060> kill

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
kind of in that range for the kill

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.540 
kind of in that range for the kill
exactly<00:04:10.080> great<00:04:10.290> double<00:04:10.800> grab<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.400> knee

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
exactly great double grab to the knee

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.809 
exactly great double grab to the knee
yeah<00:04:12.769> okay<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:13.980> that's<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.160> stock<00:04:14.400> alright

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
yeah okay and that's the stock alright

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.030 
yeah okay and that's the stock alright
yeah<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.780> think<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.440> looked<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:16.680> even<00:04:16.919> if

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
yeah I think it looked like even if

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.469 
yeah I think it looked like even if
people<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.549> would<00:04:17.639> upbeat<00:04:17.880> there<00:04:18.030> he<00:04:18.359> would

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
people you would upbeat there he would

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.030 
people you would upbeat there he would
have<00:04:18.510> got<00:04:18.600> edgehog<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.350> he<00:04:19.500> recognized<00:04:19.979> that

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
have got edgehog so he recognized that

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.520 
have got edgehog so he recognized that
Moses<00:04:20.340> all<00:04:20.430> right<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:21.299> got<00:04:21.449> this<00:04:21.570> one<00:04:21.780> well

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
Moses all right you got this one well

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.430 
Moses all right you got this one well
here<00:04:22.680> we<00:04:22.770> go<00:04:23.270> home<00:04:24.270> actually<00:04:24.840> appears<00:04:25.290> out<00:04:25.410> of

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
here we go home actually appears out of

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.820 
here we go home actually appears out of
the<00:04:25.500> combo<00:04:26.660> but<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.050> punish<00:04:28.350> game<00:04:28.560> on<00:04:28.680> this

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
the combo but so the punish game on this

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.620 
the combo but so the punish game on this
stage<00:04:29.040> on<00:04:29.400> final<00:04:29.790> destination<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.360> really

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
stage on final destination it's really

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.930 
stage on final destination it's really
um<00:04:30.840> it's<00:04:31.440> really<00:04:31.680> di<00:04:31.979> dependent<00:04:32.460> like<00:04:32.700> the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
um it's really di dependent like the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.180 
um it's really di dependent like the
weight<00:04:33.120> Falcon<00:04:33.960> can<00:04:34.260> basically<00:04:34.500> serve<00:04:34.979> that

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
kombo sent him Ryan he did it instead of

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.120 
kombo sent him Ryan he did it instead of
doing<00:06:09.110> another<00:06:09.260> foreign<00:06:09.650> air<00:06:09.740> and<00:06:09.860> aiming<00:06:10.040> for

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
doing another foreign air and aiming for

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.200 
doing another foreign air and aiming for
a<00:06:10.190> downer<00:06:10.370> he<00:06:10.490> just<00:06:10.640> didn't<00:06:10.850> you<00:06:10.970> cut<00:06:11.120> her<00:06:11.180> off

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
a downer he just didn't you cut her off

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.880 
a downer he just didn't you cut her off
early<00:06:11.540> at<00:06:11.630> around<00:06:11.720> 80%<00:06:12.140> he<00:06:12.410> did<00:06:12.530> at<00:06:12.620> neutral

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
early at around 80% he did at neutral

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.080 
early at around 80% he did at neutral
air<00:06:13.040> I<00:06:13.190> think<00:06:13.520> this<00:06:13.610> was<00:06:13.760> on<00:06:13.880> the<00:06:13.940> Lord's

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
air I think this was on the Lord's

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.510 
air I think this was on the Lord's
second<00:06:14.840> stalk<00:06:15.050> and<00:06:15.470> Lord

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
second stalk and Lord

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.250 
second stalk and Lord
okay<00:06:16.910> so<00:06:17.120> Lord<00:06:17.360> was<00:06:17.540> one<00:06:17.660> step<00:06:17.870> ahead<00:06:17.990> of<00:06:18.110> the

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
okay so Lord was one step ahead of the

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.380 
okay so Lord was one step ahead of the
Ken<00:06:18.410> Cobb<00:06:18.620> when<00:06:18.770> he<00:06:18.890> died<00:06:19.190> away<00:06:19.669> right<00:06:20.180> but

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
Ken Cobb when he died away right but

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.850 
Ken Cobb when he died away right but
because<00:06:20.540> he<00:06:20.930> you<00:06:21.080> opted<00:06:21.350> to<00:06:21.380> do<00:06:21.530> an<00:06:21.650> air

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
because he you opted to do an air
