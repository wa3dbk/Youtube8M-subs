00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
good job I did have these on my feet I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
good job I did have these on my feet I
will<00:00:47.039> say<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.699> they<00:00:47.819> do<00:00:47.879> run<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.479> bit

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
will say that they do run a little bit

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.439 
will say that they do run a little bit
narrow<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> wider<00:00:49.859> foot<00:00:50.449> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
narrow so if you have a wider foot you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.829 
narrow so if you have a wider foot you
might<00:00:51.690> need<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> go<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.109> half<00:00:52.289> size<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.769> in<00:00:52.949> knees

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
might need to go a half size up in knees

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.910 
might need to go a half size up in knees
sticking<00:00:54.839> with<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> anatomically<00:00:55.739> correct

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
sticking with the anatomically correct

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.910 
sticking with the anatomically correct
style<00:00:56.819> they<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.389> the<00:00:57.659> laces<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.589> here<00:00:58.769> which

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
style they have the laces up here which

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
style they have the laces up here which
have<00:00:59.069> more<00:00:59.280> uniform<00:00:59.879> stuck<00:01:00.269> to<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.569> foot

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
have more uniform stuck to your foot
