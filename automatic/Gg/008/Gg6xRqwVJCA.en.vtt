00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.880
 Hello everyone, flash pain guys are not 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.650
 judge strictly 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.230
 Bleach I look I read I love but previous 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.160
 two chapters are more exact previous 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.270
 and today's chapter was well about nothing 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.520
 I practically say that he will be mine 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.010
 heir that is when i can 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.430
 maybe if i die or through 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.039
 how many years there then will take my hive 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 the place he will become the king that is now 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:51.180
 what prince have we been told that these 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.020
 Steiner of aquatic sees everything we will take 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.309
 Quincy is easier for all of these Quincy 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.000
 alphabet that is, less than about 7 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.469
 Sydney character and this is an interesting idea 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 taken from arrancar I think so but this is not 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:18.929
 the essence is important the whole point is that the whole 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:23.399
 reason for breaking the whole point 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:27.139
 that is, the entire chain of the former heir 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:34.789
 confuse and left all 

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:39.270
 the bottom line is that maybe someday 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:42.149
 isids will appear such hook skills 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.979
 ya baha i mean he will be stronger henry 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.539
 at sai 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.969
 believe it and though it will get stronger 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.389
 a shirt that is theoretically stronger 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.240
 hydra abutment maybe yes but i don't believe that 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:02:00.179
 isis will become so strong because 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.060
 he was not much different ie every 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:07.950
 seasons he didn't seem too cool 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.610
 very much so either smart ordinary 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.890
 character and all but no more i'm not a fan 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.970
 him and no matter how I say but this 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.450
 the truth is who killed and sisters he corr 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.640
 it is not 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.870
 10 girls who threw and her where 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.690
 wondrous closer 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.400
 she was not even dozens she is not for what 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.069
 was him she hardly won there and 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.590
 bach models i don't understand but maybe 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.190
 when I have empty abilities 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.980
 i.e. bank type conversion is possible 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.090
 something interesting will be added to this 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.540
 count and what else can I say 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:02.319
 very interesting and not entirely clear I'm 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:06.470
 last chapter said I was commenting 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.470
 you are the last living quincy in this chapter 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.010
 said this week today 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.890
 why did I say that because you 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.410
 one survived i took away the ability of all 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:24.920
 quincy in the world and you survived alone 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.690
 and ask Quincy's father too 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.440
 what the fuck was he then out 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.579
 or why he is not considered even more 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.120
 purebred than ishida uru and strong and 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:43.940
 smart and so on but why the truth 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:49.790
 it's not clear why he was chosen 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:55.840
 it's very very very strange about this 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.799
 said something else very interesting 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.150
 urahara is different 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.720
 and chat from a torus they arrived some 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.370
 the desert 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.190
 Ie have arrankarov on earth and team 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.639
 I don't seem to remember the name 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:18.919
 excuse me here and urahara found there 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.450
 how could this thing be round which 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:26.150
 printed the bank and 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.669
 and what if it's a can of urahara or 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.270
 some serious other can and 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.780
 he can print it out or some 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.460
 or 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.520
 and 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.930
 top that can recover 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:46.090
 sealed bank and all captains 5 13 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:49.229
 this is very interesting would say interesting 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.139
 in terms of what they will do with it 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:56.590
 maybe expose the power of all possible 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.470
 somehow strengthen yourself to help 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.419
 play count the main role in this fight 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.759
 these quincy 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.729
 we will learn about this in the next chapters. 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:11.259
 I guess I hope it will reveal because 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:16.180
 read at the moment is not quite 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:17.349
