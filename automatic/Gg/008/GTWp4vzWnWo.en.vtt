harmony

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:21.520 

let's<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> look<00:02:11.069> outside<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.849> window

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.310 

so<00:02:22.040> we're<00:02:22.220> quite<00:02:22.400> high<00:02:22.760> it's<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.150> 27th<00:02:24.050> floor

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.040 
so we're quite high it's the 27th floor
and<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:25.190> think<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.640> pentose<00:02:26.180> edfu<00:02:26.630> suite<00:02:26.930> is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.920 
and I think the pentose edfu suite is
only<00:02:27.230> available<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.280> 28th<00:02:28.880> floor<00:02:29.240> and
