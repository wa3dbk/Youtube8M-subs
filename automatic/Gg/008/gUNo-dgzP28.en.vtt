and<00:00:30.439> we<00:00:31.439> couldn't<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.859> all<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.219> these

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and we couldn't have all of these

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.100 
and we couldn't have all of these
options<00:00:32.790> really<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:34.350> until<00:00:34.610> recently<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> it

is<00:00:37.230> certainly<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> industry<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.040> changing<00:00:38.070> in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
is certainly the industry is changing in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.780 
is certainly the industry is changing in
terms<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.850> our<00:00:38.940> ability<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.899> remain<00:00:40.790> mobile

terms of our ability to remain mobile

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.920

and<00:00:42.379> for<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.649> while<00:00:44.180> everyone<00:00:45.180> was<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.600> nuts

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and for a while everyone was going nuts

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.510 
and for a while everyone was going nuts
over<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:46.350> things<00:00:46.590> called<00:00:46.890> netbooks

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
over these things called netbooks

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
over these things called netbooks
they've<00:00:48.149> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> had<00:00:48.570> their<00:00:48.780> day<00:00:49.260> they're

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
they've kind of had their day they're

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.660 
they've kind of had their day they're
about<00:00:50.719> done<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> say<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.739> wouldn't<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
about done not to say that wouldn't be a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.639 
about done not to say that wouldn't be a
good<00:00:53.730> option<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.500> not

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
good option for you I I would not

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.619 
good option for you I I would not
recommend<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.940> least<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.300> point<00:00:57.390> in

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
recommend one at least at this point in

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.670 
recommend one at least at this point in
time<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.199> better<00:00:58.320> more

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
time I think there are better more

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.479 
time I think there are better more
powerful<00:00:59.160> options<00:01:00.149> available<00:01:01.309> people<00:01:02.309> seem

don't want to have that weight and plus
think<00:01:32.430> about<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> battery<00:01:32.939> life<00:01:33.119> right<00:01:33.360> so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
think about the battery life right so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.899 
think about the battery life right so
Intel<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> championing<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.479> idea<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.049> an

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
ultra book so why would you want

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.380 
ultra book so why would you want
something<00:01:42.390> called<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.899> ultrabook<00:01:43.680> well<00:01:44.130> one

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
something called in ultrabook well one

something called in ultrabook well one
you<00:01:45.390> want<00:01:45.659> portability<00:01:46.500> without<00:01:47.490> sacrificing

power that is inherent in the definition

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
power that is inherent in the definition
of<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.380> an<00:01:52.530> ultrabook<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.479> just

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
of what an ultrabook is it's not just

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the portability it's not just the price

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.020 
the portability it's not just the price
tag<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.170> power<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.890> ultrabooks<00:01:59.880> are

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
tag it's the power in ultrabooks are

is<00:02:41.310> released<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.940> wide<00:02:42.330> array<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.980> ultrabooks

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
is released a wide array of ultrabooks

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.710 
is released a wide array of ultrabooks
and<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.400> think<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.270> spur<00:02:45.930> on

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
and I think this is going to spur on

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.420 
and I think this is going to spur on
really<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> renaissance<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:50.540> pcs<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.680> idea<00:02:53.190> of

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
really a renaissance in pcs the idea of

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.790 
really a renaissance in pcs the idea of
these<00:02:53.640> ultrabooks<00:02:54.210> super<00:02:54.570> power<00:02:54.800> super

of<00:03:02.340> course<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.610> more<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.820> cram<00:03:03.060> into

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
of course the more you cram into

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.280 
of course the more you cram into
something<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.600> more<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.110> cost

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
something the more it's going to cost

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.420 
something the more it's going to cost
but<00:03:05.150> when<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:07.260> Apple<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.860> certainly<00:03:08.220> not<00:03:08.370> in

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
but when the Apple is certainly not in

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.430 
but when the Apple is certainly not in
that<00:03:08.820> range<00:03:08.880> but<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.870> depends<00:03:10.140> on<00:03:10.200> what<00:03:10.350> you

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
that range but it depends on what you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.530 
that range but it depends on what you
want<00:03:10.710> from<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.980> computer<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:12.000> some<00:03:12.210> people<00:03:12.420> I
