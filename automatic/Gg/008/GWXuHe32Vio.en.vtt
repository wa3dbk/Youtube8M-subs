00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860 

I<00:00:00.829> was<00:00:01.829> recently<00:00:02.010> asked<00:00:02.460> about<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:03.090> effects

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
I was recently asked about the effects

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.720 
I was recently asked about the effects
of<00:00:03.959> heavy<00:00:04.140> metal<00:00:04.529> toxins<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.370> body<00:00:05.490> and

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
of heavy metal toxins in the body and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.080 
of heavy metal toxins in the body and
how<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> detox<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.629> hydro<00:00:06.960> void<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:08.090> coming

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
how to detox and hydro void and coming

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.310 
how to detox and hydro void and coming
into<00:00:09.240> contact<00:00:09.450> with<00:00:09.660> having<00:00:09.990> methyls

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
into contact with having methyls

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.070 
into contact with having methyls
ingesting<00:00:10.830> them<00:00:10.920> etc<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.910> thought<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.929> is

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
ingesting them etc so I thought this is

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.259 
ingesting them etc so I thought this is
something<00:00:13.380> worth<00:00:13.530> sharing<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.610> sure<00:00:14.790> because

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
something worth sharing for sure because

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.740 
something worth sharing for sure because
heavy<00:00:15.599> metals<00:00:15.990> are<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.890> serious<00:00:17.640> issue<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
heavy metals are a serious issue in the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.700 
heavy metals are a serious issue in the
world<00:00:18.900> right<00:00:19.080> now<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:21.260> here<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.590> because

world right now and here really because

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.009 
world right now and here really because
we're<00:00:23.010> taking<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.519> taking<00:00:24.150> them<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.390> much<00:00:24.689> more

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
we're taking in taking them in much more

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.560 
we're taking in taking them in much more
through<00:00:25.439> what's<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> sphere<00:00:26.730> through

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
through what's in the a sphere through

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.080 
through what's in the a sphere through
the<00:00:28.019> foods<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.680> eat<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> water<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.220> drink<00:00:29.250> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the foods we eat the water we drink it

excuse me what we put on our body and
they<00:00:33.719> only<00:00:33.840> get<00:00:34.140> soaked<00:00:34.380> through<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> skin<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
they only get soaked through the skin so

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
they only get soaked through the skin so
we're<00:00:35.460> getting<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.820> heavy<00:00:36.030> metals<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.630> big

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
we're getting a heavy metals in big

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
we're getting a heavy metals in big
doses<00:00:37.530> from<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.460> lot<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.940> different<00:00:39.270> places<00:00:39.390> in

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
doses from a lot of different places in

doses from a lot of different places in
the<00:00:39.989> workplace<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.710> we're<00:00:40.890> working<00:00:41.280> with

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the workplace if we're working with

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.760 
the workplace if we're working with
heavy<00:00:41.640> metals<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.120> well<00:00:42.410> they're<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.530> into

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
heavy metals as well they're going into

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.310 
heavy metals as well they're going into
our<00:00:43.860> body<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.329> anyone<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.570> sort<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> work<00:00:46.140> we

do so yes it is an issue and you know
something<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> don't<00:00:51.120> worry<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.660> having

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
something I don't worry about having

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.920 
something I don't worry about having
metals<00:00:52.199> because<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.980> i<00:00:53.430> go<00:00:53.850> by<00:00:54.030> detoxing<00:00:54.600> them

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
metals because I i go by detoxing them

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.240 
metals because I i go by detoxing them
and<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> don't<00:00:55.320> come<00:00:55.469> into<00:00:55.590> contact<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.070> them

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and I don't come into contact with them

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
and I don't come into contact with them
as<00:00:56.430> much<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.969> maybe<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> lot<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.539> people<00:00:57.629> will<00:00:57.870> do

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
as much as maybe a lot of people will do

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.189 
as much as maybe a lot of people will do
and<00:00:58.260> through<00:00:59.219> my<00:00:59.699> diet<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> lifestyle<00:01:00.930> things

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.830 
and through my diet and lifestyle things
like<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.129> I'd<00:01:03.090> only<00:01:03.180> worry<00:01:03.629> about

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
like that so and so I'd only worry about

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
like that so and so I'd only worry about
them<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.920> don't<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.400> worry<00:01:05.549> about

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
them and you don't have to worry about

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.429 
them and you don't have to worry about
them<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.540> maybe<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.960> follow<00:01:07.200> some<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
them if you do maybe do follow some of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.070 
them if you do maybe do follow some of
the<00:01:07.560> same<00:01:07.740> sort<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.070> protocols<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:09.990> give

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the same sort of protocols but just give

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.609 
the same sort of protocols but just give
you<00:01:10.140> an<00:01:10.229> idea<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.920> having<00:01:11.189> metals<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
you an idea what are having metals and

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.929 
you an idea what are having metals and
even<00:01:13.619> aluminium<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:14.640> having<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
even aluminium it's not having that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.310 
even aluminium it's not having that
looks<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.840> al<00:01:15.960> ammonium

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
looks like that's the right al ammonium

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.580 
looks like that's the right al ammonium
but<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.650> actually<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.270> work<00:01:19.229> here

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
but it's actually I don't know work here

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.550 
but it's actually I don't know work here
boy<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.280> metals<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.780> suddenly

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
boy it's just metals but they suddenly

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.380 
boy it's just metals but they suddenly
called<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> heavy<00:01:23.310> metals<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.270> read

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
called a heavy metals but it's just read

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.690 
called a heavy metals but it's just read
metals<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.020> aluminum<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.130> part<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
metals because aluminum is part of the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
metals because aluminum is part of the
metals<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.150> go<00:01:27.689> into<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> system<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.500> we're

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
metals that go into a system so we're

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.760 
metals that go into a system so we're
talking<00:01:28.770> about<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.520> am<00:01:29.960> mercury<00:01:30.960> we're

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
talking about here I am mercury we're

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.200 
talking about here I am mercury we're
talking<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.280> cadmium<00:01:33.320> barium<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:35.210> lead

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
talking about a cadmium barium and lead

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.109 
talking about a cadmium barium and lead
and<00:01:37.130> even<00:01:38.130> even<00:01:38.400> even<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.909> an<00:01:39.000> excess<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
and even even even are in an excess and

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.420 
and even even even are in an excess and
yeah<00:01:42.119> aluminium<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.869> well<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.979> serious

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
yeah aluminium as well this is a serious

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.359 
yeah aluminium as well this is a serious
one<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.790> sure<00:01:45.229> so<00:01:46.229> basically<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:47.100> place

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
one for sure so basically this one place

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.010 
one for sure so basically this one place
we're<00:01:47.610> getting<00:01:47.880> these<00:01:47.970> heavy<00:01:48.240> metals<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
we're getting these heavy metals in is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.350 
we're getting these heavy metals in is
from<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> atmosphere<00:01:50.369> there<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
from the atmosphere there there in the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.819 
from the atmosphere there there in the
air<00:01:51.479> especially<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> live<00:01:52.740> anywhere

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
air especially if you live anywhere

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
from their planes which are basically

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.380 
from their planes which are basically
letting<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.180> aluminium<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.649> barium<00:01:59.270> to<00:02:00.270> the

had a methyl that are coming out of the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.520 
had a methyl that are coming out of the
plane<00:02:02.920> desire<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.730> for<00:02:04.720> whatever<00:02:04.870> reason<00:02:05.050> you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
plane desire and for whatever reason you

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.090 
plane desire and for whatever reason you
know<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:07.180> so<00:02:07.450> they're<00:02:07.630> basically<00:02:07.930> going<00:02:08.740> into

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
know and so they're basically going into
