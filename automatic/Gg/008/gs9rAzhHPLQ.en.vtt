00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
simple to get to that point this piece

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.980 
simple to get to that point this piece
very<00:00:22.279> slightly<00:00:23.279> pops<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.420> out<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.900> you

where<00:00:47.579> they<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.239> lot<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.870> times<00:00:48.989> taking

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
where they go a lot of times taking

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.010 
where they go a lot of times taking
pictures<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:51.090> individual<00:00:51.780> screws

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
pictures as you take individual screws

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.619 
pictures as you take individual screws
out<00:00:52.230> works<00:00:53.100> well<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.120> too<00:00:54.360> tedious

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629

we have it to the hard drive and it's

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.909 
we have it to the hard drive and it's
case<00:04:15.979> so<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:18.109> being<00:04:19.109> said<00:04:19.199> this<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.709> hard

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
case so that being said this is the hard

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.680 
case so that being said this is the hard
drive<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.280> want<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.609> use<00:04:20.820> since<00:04:21.150> I'm<00:04:21.299> switching

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
drive I want to use since I'm switching

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.400 
drive I want to use since I'm switching
hard<00:04:21.870> drives<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.440> our<00:04:22.710> units<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:24.600> I'm<00:04:25.020> going<00:04:25.350> to

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
hard drives in our units so I'm going to

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.330 
hard drives in our units so I'm going to
go<00:04:25.590> ahead<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.479> move<00:04:27.479> this<00:04:27.840> guy<00:04:28.139> out<00:04:28.979> of<00:04:29.190> our

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
go ahead and move this guy out of our

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:42.690 
go ahead and move this guy out of our
way<00:04:29.520> since<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.389> one<00:04:30.870> we're<00:04:31.050> replacing

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.250 

and<00:04:43.700> this<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.210> new<00:04:44.390> one<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.960> reason

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
and this is the new one and the reason

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.660 
and this is the new one and the reason
why<00:04:48.380> we're<00:04:48.590> doing<00:04:48.620> this<00:04:49.010> is<00:04:49.220> because<00:04:49.250> we've

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
why we're doing this is because we've

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.810 
why we're doing this is because we've
already<00:04:49.850> built<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.270> operation
