00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
torn and this one I believe happened

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.770 
torn and this one I believe happened
last<00:00:52.079> year<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.829> recall<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:54.239> come<00:00:54.420> back<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
last year as I recall we come back and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.180 
last year as I recall we come back and
record<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.530> destruction<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.149> time<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
record the destruction all the time and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
record the destruction all the time and
there's<00:00:59.190> Aspen's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.969> force<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.390> Aspen's<00:01:00.840> all

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
there's Aspen's a force to Aspen's all

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.930 
there's Aspen's a force to Aspen's all
around<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.100> seems<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
around here but it seems like the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.210 
around here but it seems like the
destructions<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:04.220> territorial

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
destructions in this little territorial

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
destructions in this little territorial
grove<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> first<00:01:06.960> times<00:01:07.170> back<00:01:07.530> here

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
grove one of the first times back here

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.670 
grove one of the first times back here
at<00:01:08.040> Jenny<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.880> found<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.380> footprint<00:01:10.380> back

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
at Jenny and I we found a footprint back

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.480 
at Jenny and I we found a footprint back
in<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.510> thought<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> would<00:01:13.340> since<00:01:14.340> I'm

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
in here but I thought I would since I'm

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.950 
in here but I thought I would since I'm
up<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.880> anyway<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.270> thought<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> would<00:01:15.720> look

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
up here anyway I thought I would look

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.399 
up here anyway I thought I would look
around<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:17.220> new<00:01:17.369> evidence<00:01:17.640> possibly

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
around for new evidence possibly

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.690 
around for new evidence possibly
footprints<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:19.979> gonna<00:01:20.130> walk<00:01:20.310> through

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
footprints but I'm gonna walk through

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.670 
so I'm even going to set the tripod down
for<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> second<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.430> before<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:54.410> there's<00:02:55.410> one

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
for a second and before I do there's one

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.050 
for a second and before I do there's one
right<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:57.709> then<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:59.280> want<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> set<00:02:59.970> it

anyway let me just set this down one

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.570 
anyway let me just set this down one
more<00:05:45.699> time<00:05:45.909> I'd<00:05:46.810> like<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.080> show<00:05:48.069> you<00:05:48.129> guys<00:05:48.250> the

more time I'd like to show you guys the
size<00:05:48.849> of<00:05:49.060> this<00:05:52.770> there's<00:05:53.770> one<00:05:53.949> that's<00:05:54.069> quite

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
size of this there's one that's quite

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.399 
size of this there's one that's quite
old<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:55.110> here's<00:05:56.110> one<00:05:56.319> that<00:05:57.129> isn't<00:05:57.370> as<00:05:57.610> old

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
old and here's one that isn't as old

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.719 
old and here's one that isn't as old
four<00:05:59.409> or<00:05:59.500> five<00:05:59.650> years<00:05:59.680> old<00:06:00.069> it<00:06:00.280> looks<00:06:00.310> like<00:06:00.580> it

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
four or five years old it looks like it

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.240 
four or five years old it looks like it
was<00:06:00.849> snapped<00:06:01.150> off<00:06:01.330> but<00:06:02.050> it's<00:06:02.650> as<00:06:03.219> if<00:06:04.860> it<00:06:05.860> comes

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
was snapped off but it's as if it comes

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.070 
was snapped off but it's as if it comes
through<00:06:06.610> making<00:06:06.940> a<00:06:07.029> territorial<00:06:07.659> display<00:06:07.960> a

through making a territorial display a

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.570 
through making a territorial display a
power<00:06:08.409> or<00:06:09.370> perhaps<00:06:09.580> it's<00:06:10.650> showing<00:06:11.650> off<00:06:11.919> to

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
power or perhaps it's showing off to

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.029 
power or perhaps it's showing off to
breeding<00:06:12.969> females<00:06:13.569> I<00:06:13.810> don't<00:06:14.560> know<00:06:14.710> what<00:06:14.889> it<00:06:15.009> is

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
breeding females I don't know what it is

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.360 
breeding females I don't know what it is
but<00:06:15.479> it<00:06:16.479> comes<00:06:16.750> through<00:06:17.050> displaying<00:06:17.620> power

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
but it comes through displaying power

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.029 
but it comes through displaying power
and<00:06:18.789> size<00:06:19.090> in<00:06:19.509> my<00:06:20.289> opinion<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:22.529> I've<00:06:23.529> heard<00:06:23.860> of

these places from other researchers and

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.689 
these places from other researchers and
this<00:06:28.569> is<00:06:28.719> one<00:06:29.199> of<00:06:29.319> the<00:06:29.409> first<00:06:29.699> large
