friendship really that is what was

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.330 
friendship really that is what was
bicycles<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.030> fundamentally<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
friendship and music I think no matter

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.319 
friendship and music I think no matter
what<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.100> whether<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> solo<00:00:42.149> or

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
what we do there whether it is solo or

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
what we do there whether it is solo or
group<00:00:42.500> will<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.620> pop<00:00:43.829> down<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.370> each

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
group will all pop down and see each

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.490 
group will all pop down and see each
other<00:00:44.840> be<00:00:45.840> at<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> front<00:00:46.140> gate<00:00:46.260> ah<00:00:48.140> but<00:00:49.140> odors
