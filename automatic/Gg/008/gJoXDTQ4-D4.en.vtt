00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
actually see a leaked screenshot of a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.580 
actually see a leaked screenshot of a
PlayStation<00:03:23.000> free<00:03:23.270> version<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.200> Xbox

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.160 
PlayStation free version and the Xbox
360<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.490> I<00:03:25.640> thought<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.120> was<00:03:26.330> actually<00:03:26.930> really

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
360 and I thought it was actually really

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.410 
360 and I thought it was actually really
terrible<00:03:27.739> but<00:03:28.250> then<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.459> saw<00:03:28.700> some<00:03:28.910> gameplay

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
terrible but then I saw some gameplay

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.150 
terrible but then I saw some gameplay
and<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.750> really<00:03:30.110> didn't<00:03:30.440> look<00:03:30.500> as<00:03:30.800> bad<00:03:31.100> as

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
and it really didn't look as bad as

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.880 
and it really didn't look as bad as
everyone<00:03:31.700> was<00:03:31.850> saying<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.480> all<00:03:33.260> fairness<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
everyone was saying in all fairness I

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.920 
everyone was saying in all fairness I
actually<00:03:34.130> think<00:03:34.580> Ubisoft<00:03:35.209> did<00:03:35.420> do<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.600> decent

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
actually think Ubisoft did do a decent

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.740 
actually think Ubisoft did do a decent
job<00:03:36.230> for<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.620> past<00:03:36.770> gen<00:03:37.130> consoles<00:03:37.670> but<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.480> lot

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
job for the past gen consoles but a lot

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.300 
job for the past gen consoles but a lot
of<00:03:38.840> people<00:03:39.140> are<00:03:39.290> saying<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.830> graphics

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
of people are saying that the graphics

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.490 
of people are saying that the graphics
do<00:03:40.610> look<00:03:40.819> like<00:03:40.970> PlayStation<00:03:41.420> 2<00:03:41.810> graphics<00:03:42.140> but

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
do look like PlayStation 2 graphics but

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.590 
do look like PlayStation 2 graphics but
I<00:03:42.530> do<00:03:42.680> disagree<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.880> if<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.300> had<00:03:44.450> to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
I do disagree this and if I had to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.240 
I do disagree this and if I had to
compare<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:45.050> to<00:03:45.200> another<00:03:45.230> large<00:03:45.980> an

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
compare it to another large an

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.550 
compare it to another large an
open-world<00:03:46.790> game<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.390> would<00:03:47.840> have<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.170> say<00:03:48.350> that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
open-world game I would have to say that

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.490 
open-world game I would have to say that
the<00:03:48.650> graphics<00:03:49.160> do<00:03:49.400> look<00:03:49.610> like<00:03:49.790> GTA<00:03:50.239> fours<00:03:50.660> but

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
the graphics do look like GTA fours but

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.900 
the graphics do look like GTA fours but
that's<00:03:51.739> just<00:03:51.920> my<00:03:52.070> opinion<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.670> if<00:03:52.790> you're

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
that's just my opinion and if you're

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.250 
that's just my opinion and if you're
allowed<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.120> go<00:03:53.360> ahead<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.780> check<00:03:53.959> them<00:03:54.170> out

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260
