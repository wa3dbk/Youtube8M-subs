00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.910
 Roman way bouchet you started 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:17.360
 by the nutella 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:17.360
 here is your tail then the butter 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:41.570

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:48.670
 and finally the engine finally the wii on 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:52.549
 it stinks is well felt and so here 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.710
 I prepared my super sandwich very beautiful 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.149
 tartine 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.479
 so here I change a little bit for 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.390
 not to do too many bazas here is here 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.899
 my super spread nutella soft butter 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.280
 pie 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.600
 good by cons I do not eat a 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.509
 tool because I would not want to throw up 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.989
 afterwards but hey I think I'm eating there 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:26.000

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:28.330

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.330
 open 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.939
 well I think it's more thrills 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.180
 storm the guitar does not hide all the taste 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.650
 of the other two foods so in fact 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:04.940
 it's like you want to eat bread the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:08.780
 mustard or month you will see a barrel my 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:17.000
 of fire to eat a slice of butter 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:19.909
 mustard and chocolate directly past 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.930
 at the second challenge which is to drink a 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.230

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.730

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.579

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.689

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:38.829

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:41.120

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.470

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.819

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.940

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.319
 1 my god i love it in one go because 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.700
 that otherwise I feel that I'm going to scream 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.019
 in front of the camera you know yeah I 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.989
 speak rather than make fun of me 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:19.030
 there behind your screen 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:21.570

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.570
 substitute 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.710
 crazy good it was not that bad 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.780
 that this is my first ever 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.110
 video and my first two challenges succeeded 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.509
 I hope you enjoyed it so 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.639

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.699
 all three or four girls videos 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.870
 so that's going to tell about videos I pretty much 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.830
 think I will make videos of two 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.659
 challenges at the same time in 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.400

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.840

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.240
