is what they call a wedge design so at

the bottom of the television it is quite
a<00:00:35.430> lot<00:00:35.760> deeper<00:00:36.180> than<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.780> conventional<00:00:36.989> flat

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

a lot deeper than a conventional flat
panel<00:00:38.309> television<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.629> reason<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
panel television and the reason for that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.220 
panel television and the reason for that
is<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.680> put<00:00:40.860> extra<00:00:41.570> large<00:00:42.570> speakers<00:00:43.079> in

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is they put extra large speakers in

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.229 
is they put extra large speakers in
there<00:00:43.410> which<00:00:44.040> gives<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> more<00:00:44.730> powerful

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
there which gives you a more powerful

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
there which gives you a more powerful
sound<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.079> does<00:00:46.230> give<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> better<00:00:46.770> bass

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100

television they mount further in left
and<00:01:06.270> right

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and right

if<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> wall<00:01:08.310> mount<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> TV

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
if you're going to wall mount the TV

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.560 
if you're going to wall mount the TV
because<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.580> thicker<00:01:11.580> base<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
because of the thicker base at the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
because of the thicker base at the
bottom<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> does<00:01:13.380> mean<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> TV

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
bottom here it does mean that the TV

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
bottom here it does mean that the TV
will<00:01:14.430> stick<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.150> from<00:01:15.299> them<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> little

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
will stick out from them all a little

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.420 
will stick out from them all a little
bit<00:01:16.080> further<00:01:16.439> than<00:01:16.830> you'd<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
bit further than you'd get on a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.120 
bit further than you'd get on a
conventional<00:01:18.420> flat<00:01:18.689> pan<00:01:18.960> panel<00:01:19.530> television

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
conventional flat pan panel television

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.710 
conventional flat pan panel television
it<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.270> an<00:01:21.420> LED<00:01:21.720> television<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.159> Full<00:01:23.340> HD

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
it is an LED television and it's Full HD

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.770 
it is an LED television and it's Full HD
and<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.930> 3d<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.799> 1080p<00:01:25.979> its<00:01:26.970> passive<00:01:27.479> 3d

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and it's 3d so it's 1080p its passive 3d

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.950 
and it's 3d so it's 1080p its passive 3d
which<00:01:28.500> means<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.250> uses<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.060> non<00:01:30.479> battery

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
which means it uses the non battery

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
which means it uses the non battery
power<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> standard<00:01:31.890> cinema<00:01:32.220> glasses<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
power to the standard cinema glasses and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.859 
power to the standard cinema glasses and
it<00:01:32.850> comes<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.119> two<00:01:33.270> pairs<00:01:33.720> included<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
it comes with two pairs included it's a

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.649 
it comes with two pairs included it's a
400<00:01:36.869> Hertz<00:01:37.049> motion<00:01:37.650> flow<00:01:37.979> TV<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.360> not

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
400 Hertz motion flow TV so it's not

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.530 
400 Hertz motion flow TV so it's not
quite<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.020> high<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.060> previous<00:01:42.060> model<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
quite as high as the previous model to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.389 
quite as high as the previous model to
this<00:01:42.659> which<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.020> 800<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.799> certainly<00:01:44.280> on

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
this which was 800 but certainly on

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.249 
this which was 800 but certainly on
sport<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.329> we've<00:01:45.450> seen<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.899> store

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
sport and from what we've seen in store

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.609 
sport and from what we've seen in store
it<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:47.759> good<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.180> quick<00:01:48.420> motion<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it is very very good on quick motion it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.480 
it is very very good on quick motion it
uses<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.220> triluminos<00:01:50.970> display<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.930> was

uses the triluminos display that was
introduced<00:01:53.490> last<00:01:53.759> year<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.720> gives<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.049> a
