00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.459 

I<00:00:00.089> don't<00:00:00.480> know<00:00:00.539> if<00:00:00.599> anyone<00:00:00.840> else<00:00:00.989> has<00:00:01.199> found

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
I don't know if anyone else has found

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.169 
I don't know if anyone else has found
this<00:00:01.709> but<00:00:02.100> I've<00:00:02.190> managed<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.580> find<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.879> way<00:00:03.000> of

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
this but I've managed to find a way of

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.360 
this but I've managed to find a way of
turning<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.140> button<00:00:04.470> into<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.710> switch<00:00:05.040> the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
turning a button into a switch the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.549 
turning a button into a switch the
tuples<00:00:05.580> on<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.000> off<00:00:08.960> rather<00:00:09.960> than<00:00:10.110> being<00:00:10.320> on

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
tuples on and off rather than being on

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.850 
tuples on and off rather than being on
for<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.860> few<00:00:10.980> seconds<00:00:11.429> then<00:00:11.580> off<00:00:11.730> again<00:00:12.860> which

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
for a few seconds then off again which

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.829 
for a few seconds then off again which
causes<00:00:14.460> some<00:00:14.670> problems<00:00:14.790> with<00:00:15.179> things<00:00:15.750> like

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
causes some problems with things like

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.590 
causes some problems with things like
this<00:00:15.960> hidden<00:00:16.740> stairways<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.460> door<00:00:17.640> where

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
this hidden stairways in the door where

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.070 
this hidden stairways in the door where
I've<00:00:18.779> used<00:00:19.020> button<00:00:19.439> normally<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.670> would<00:00:21.080> mess

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
I've used button normally it would mess

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.689 
I've used button normally it would mess
up<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> circuit<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:25.859> I'm<00:00:26.039> showing<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:26.550> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
up the circuit so I'm showing you how it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.150 
up the circuit so I'm showing you how it
works<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.300> press<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> button<00:00:27.660> once<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:29.010> opens

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
works you press the button once it opens

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.030 
works you press the button once it opens
up<00:00:29.750> then<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:30.960> press<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> again<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.650> closed

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
up then you can press it again it closed

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.479 
up then you can press it again it closed
up<00:00:32.189> again<00:00:33.829> this<00:00:34.829> will<00:00:34.980> work<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.160> most<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
up again this will work for most of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.130 
up again this will work for most of
limpets<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.239> saw<00:00:36.420> before<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> works

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
limpets as you saw before so it works

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.440 
limpets as you saw before so it works
from<00:00:37.290> inside<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.920> from<00:00:38.100> outside<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:45.030> i'll<00:00:45.360> be

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
from inside and from outside so i'll be

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.790 
from inside and from outside so i'll be
showing<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> how<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.260> circuit<00:00:46.739> works<00:00:51.800> so

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
showing you how this circuit works so

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.369 
showing you how this circuit works so
here<00:00:53.039> i<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.520> constant<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.710> loop<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:57.379> an

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
here i have a constant on loop and an

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
here i have a constant on loop and an
and<00:00:58.559> gate<00:00:59.539> which<00:01:00.539> powers<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.960> piston<00:01:02.420> that's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and gate which powers a piston that's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.030 
and gate which powers a piston that's
practically<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> power<00:01:07.380> comes<00:01:07.740> from

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
practically it so the power comes from

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.210 
practically it so the power comes from
these<00:01:08.970> two<00:01:09.210> yellow<00:01:09.510> blocks<00:01:10.010> which<00:01:11.010> are<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
these two yellow blocks which are the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:21.980 
these two yellow blocks which are the
buttons<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.000> splits<00:01:21.299> off<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.750> two

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
buttons so it splits off on to two

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.859 
buttons so it splits off on to two
separate<00:01:22.860> sections<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:24.090> goes<00:01:24.299> off<00:01:24.450> into<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
separate sections one goes off into this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.920 
separate sections one goes off into this
or<00:01:25.110> am<00:01:25.290> constant<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.400> loop<00:01:32.150> which<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.420> powers

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
or am constant on loop which then powers

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.069 
or am constant on loop which then powers
these<00:01:34.700> repeaters<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.450> delay<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
these repeaters which just delay the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.560 
these repeaters which just delay the
circuit<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.520> power<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.119> right<00:01:39.360> hand

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
circuit to power on this right hand

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.030 
circuit to power on this right hand
torch<00:01:40.460> or<00:01:41.460> power<00:01:41.909> off<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.360> case<00:01:43.040> and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
torch or power off it in this case and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.420 
torch or power off it in this case and
then<00:01:44.280> loops<00:01:44.549> round<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:46.009> stairs<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
then loops round to the stairs in that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.690 
then loops round to the stairs in that
door<00:01:47.640> which<00:01:48.060> always<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:49.280> which<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.520> by

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
door which always on which are on by

door which always on which are on by
default<00:01:50.880> sorry<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.509> other<00:01:54.600> circuit

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
default sorry you know the other circuit

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800 
default sorry you know the other circuit
goes<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.710> sell<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> torch<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.540> doesn't

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
goes to sell the torch but it doesn't

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
goes to sell the torch but it doesn't
quite<00:01:58.049> reach<00:01:58.110> when<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.189> always-on<00:01:59.610> circuits

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
quite reach when the always-on circuits

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.109 
quite reach when the always-on circuits
on<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.200> 16<00:02:02.189> blocks<00:02:02.369> away<00:02:02.670> whereas

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
on because it's 16 blocks away whereas

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.420 
on because it's 16 blocks away whereas
redstone<00:02:03.689> power<00:02:03.869> carries<00:02:04.290> 15<00:02:04.649> blocks

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.150 

so<00:02:10.290> circuit<00:02:11.290> reaches<00:02:11.590> up<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.830> that<00:02:11.980> point

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
so circuit reaches up to that point

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.860 
so circuit reaches up to that point
there<00:02:12.630> but<00:02:13.630> when<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.870> power<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:15.040> circuit<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
there but when you power the circuit the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.750 
there but when you power the circuit the
redstone<00:02:17.230> power<00:02:17.410> reaches<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.130> torch<00:02:18.460> and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
redstone power reaches that torch and

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.820 
redstone power reaches that torch and
turns<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.030> off<00:02:19.150> powering<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.750> piston<00:02:20.080> as<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
turns it off powering the piston as the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.170 
turns it off powering the piston as the
always-on<00:02:23.830> circuit<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
always-on circuit is on and and the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.750 
always-on circuit is on and and the
button<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.450> pressed<00:02:29.340> raise<00:02:30.340> if<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.520> press<00:02:30.730> it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
button is pressed raise if you press it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.930 
button is pressed raise if you press it
again<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.090> turns<00:02:31.420> off<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.780> always-on<00:02:32.080> circuit

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.120 

so<00:02:39.940> that's<00:02:40.090> pretty<00:02:40.510> much<00:02:40.570> how<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.080> works

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.280 

I'll<00:02:45.130> quickly<00:02:45.340> show<00:02:45.490> you<00:02:45.810> how<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:46.959> all<00:02:47.080> wired

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
I'll quickly show you how it's all wired

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.120 
I'll quickly show you how it's all wired
up<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.900> have<00:02:50.050> these<00:02:50.260> two<00:02:50.820> set<00:02:51.820> for<00:02:52.090> ticks

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
up so you have these two set for ticks

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:05.340 
up so you have these two set for ticks
and<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.220> rest<00:02:54.430> are<00:02:54.760> set<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.209> one<00:02:55.390> tick<00:03:04.350> and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
and the rest are set to one tick and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.820 
and the rest are set to one tick and
that's<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.830> thanks<00:03:06.670> for<00:03:06.700> watching
