great<00:02:19.400> thing<00:02:19.670> about<00:02:19.700> back<00:02:20.239> chaining<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.930> that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
great thing about back chaining is that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.440 
great thing about back chaining is that
the<00:02:21.410> dog<00:02:21.620> learns<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.220> routine<00:02:22.640> really<00:02:23.060> well

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the dog learns the routine really well

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.590 
the dog learns the routine really well
the<00:02:24.290> drawback<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:24.829> that<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.730> dog<00:02:25.940> learns<00:02:26.299> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
the drawback is that the dog learns the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.380 
the drawback is that the dog learns the
routine<00:02:27.019> really<00:02:27.620> well

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.390 
and it looks great all five times then
you<00:05:23.669> did<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:24.120> wonderful<00:05:24.389> job<00:05:24.750> if<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:26.100> fourth

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
you did a wonderful job if the fourth

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.879 
you did a wonderful job if the fourth
and<00:05:26.580> fifth<00:05:26.700> time<00:05:27.090> looks<00:05:27.630> sloppy<00:05:27.930> or<00:05:28.289> is<00:05:28.500> not<00:05:28.680> as

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
and fifth time looks sloppy or is not as

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.040 
and fifth time looks sloppy or is not as
good<00:05:29.070> as<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.340> first<00:05:29.520> three<00:05:29.910> tries<00:05:30.210> then<00:05:30.930> you

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
good as the first three tries then you

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.719 
good as the first three tries then you
probably<00:05:31.380> have<00:05:31.590> not<00:05:31.740> trained<00:05:32.100> a<00:05:32.220> piece<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.639> the

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
probably have not trained a piece of the

probably have not trained a piece of the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
have if this happens just go back and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.670 
have if this happens just go back and
retrain<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.350> piece<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.979> is<00:05:38.039> breaking<00:05:38.370> down

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680
