00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.200
 hello and welcome to this lesson I 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.450
 will tell you how to make an agreement 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.939
 like introduction i'm just going to you 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.460
 state the fact that an agreement is 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.939
 in other words a harmony so it's 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.880
 several notes that go well together 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.640
 there are a multitude of agreements 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.309
 different so a multitude of harmony 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.920
 different 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.649
 chords or harmony but I will speak 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 all the time okay in the sequel 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.089
 chords and more common used 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.440
 are what are called agreements 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.579
 major minor agreements 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 that's what we'll see in this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.980
 video how to make a major chord and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:00.030
 a minor agreement a major deal for 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.999
 start this with three notes 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 different 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.829
 there is what is called a fundamental 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.659
 a piece is a fifth 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.920
 no need to remember the names it takes 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.290
 just remember that the fundamental 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.299
 it's the note that gives its name to the agreement 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.509
 and this is the first date we played it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.979
 in this agreement for example if I want 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.360
 the accord of C major 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.520
 I will have to play a fundamental 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.899
 or who will be the doubs since I say that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.939
 the fundamental thing was the note that 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.950
 overlooked the agreement as long as 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.500
 the so noble agreement of major water the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.310
 fundamental and so the back and I'm going 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.710
 play it with the thumb of your right hand 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.670
 the middle back so I'm on the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.670
 back of the middle of the keyboard 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.180
 so I say there were two more 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.409
 notes matter is the fifth that we 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.240
 found 7-6 7/4 and I'm leaving 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.920
 this fundamental that I found the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.009
 doubs and I count 4 2 me including 4 2 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.170
 million which after this note serge does 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.970
 there I do not include it in the account 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.950
 so that's 1 2 3 4 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.470
 this is my second note sees the matter 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:18.500
 I will lean on it with the middle finger 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:21.440
 3rd 2 for the crowd for the fifth of the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.069
 last note always the same I count 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.870
 after the third I counted him 3 2 mi 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.870
 time 1 2 3 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.230
 did I have to puurai with the little finger 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.760
 remember this fingering is the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.050
 fingering that we find for each agreement 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.890
 major the miners also a 3.5 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.959
 remember the first me are 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.580
 stayed well rounded story to be 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.080
 very flexible so it's not natural 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.240
 intel fingering so you have to train 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.490
 what to do with the left hand by hand 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.860
 left it's easy to spot you 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.140
 the two extreme notes of the agreement to the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.620
 right hand and you do them by hand 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.540
 left an octave lower like this 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.680
 so here I had a back and insolent with 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.629
 the 1 and the 5 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.720
 I'm going to have a two one with the 5 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.920
 and the 20th I do not put the third because 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:20.920
 that she is already present in the hand 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:23.260
 right and that's a little bit a little 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.019
 too many notes in the bass if I put 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.190
 add again the third so in 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.349
 other circumstances we the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.579
 will add but to start notes 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.790
 left hand 3 hand notes 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.790
 right 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.019
 that's it for a major deal so this 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.230
 is not because we say major that he 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.790
 there are no black notes 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.269
 for example if I want a mid deal 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.370
 major 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.080
 so I put my pot on the mile 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.959
 I count four half tone for the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:55.080
 second note 1 2 3 4 assists and 1 only 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:59.010
 piece and 3.8 have for the last 1 2 3 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.010
 I could be but extreme 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:06.920
 so here is an E major for martine a 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.209
 black note for a minor now 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.889
 it's very simple once you 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.650
 know how to make your major chords and well 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.849
 let's go back on the major back for example 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.440
 there is only one note that will change 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.669
 it's the middle note of the agreement 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.789
 so as she is not played at the 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.490
 left hand the left is not going to change 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.349
 in this case and the right hand she so 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.520
 the middle note we'll get it down 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:35.310
 a half time so joy place here the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.830
 middle plays enemy flat here is a 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.160
 agreement to dominate for the friend for example 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.440
 so I come back to my picture 1 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.240
 and if he wants to lead to minors must 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.920
 that I go down the latiÃ¨re it's a 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.920
 middle man of a half tone 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:01.480
 this is the minor so that's a 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.870
 method that will follow us during all 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.490
 the method I propose is the whole 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.440
 all the lessons I take you there 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.360
 will have to know these agreements well I 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.780
 offers you an alternative method 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.950
 to find a minor chord a 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.640
 method that is not going to go through 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.860
 the major agreement 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.330
 in fact it's really stupid you 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.010
 remember for the major chord for 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.330
 always take back 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.330
 you remember you put the sure 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.920
 the fundamental count 4 to have the 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.960
 second since three for the last 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.700
 for a minor it's going to be one pour of 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.740
 count them 3 for the second and 4 for 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.250
 the last 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.720
 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.050
 so make sure you do not have 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.509
 forgot notes between 2 1 2 2 when you 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.490
 count 3 then 4 4 then 3 make sure 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.840
 not to forget 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.250
 there are blacks from time to time from 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.419
 time there is not so be well 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.250
 be careful take the time to 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.660
 count so that's it for our miners 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.030
 it was just a small method 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.099
 alternative for the better this will give 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.539
 so see so 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:05.849
 but my possible yes I count three 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:07.740
 first for the minor one of auto123 and 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.389
 I remind you that for an agreement for 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.919
 to know if it's an agreement is minor or 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.440
 major when he simply writes 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.940
 for middle finger he just wrote the name 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.789
 okay for the minor is with the name 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.789
 accor +1 small m next to it
