00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.180
 rg media 3 june 91 we are told either 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.770
 21 years the immediate costs very well 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.079
 so I was wrong ok and the 21 then by 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.930
 compared to that is fifty fifty plus and 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.520
 if he started early to be pro gamer and 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.750
 well five years 50 and besides I had 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.460
 read something about the cups anna tu 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.780
 will not get that one I'll leave 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.670
 sure life which is actually the second 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.920
 youngest player to have won a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.589
 major title namely the gsl behind 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.050
 kinnock line and not behind flash on 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:53.559
 broodwar so much as to say that the little 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 life 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.600
 if they continue a portrait 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.280
 it could become a huge legend 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.630
 it is true that he is only 16 years old and even 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.000
 if he is led 2 to 0 he has a potential 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.920
 huge that I imagine you would have known 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 appreciate during all these squid terms 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.460
 voice made noise in honor of this 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.460
 young prodigy 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.750
 and who knows maybe in a few 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.370
 years well he will send roustes to 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.250
 all the taste buds of electronic sport 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.900
 his name is nestea 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.510
 what is his name of auxerre or flash 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.600
 So here it is born live it is only the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.360
 start anyway and we wish him 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.530
 a successful and successful career 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.960
 also has good 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.520
 can not I look forward to seeing what they 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.119
 will give on heart of the swarm 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.710
 all his players while the party 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.320
 starts on a map we do not have 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.710
 many saw windmill because she 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.890
 is very very big so we have 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.930
 in the top right the player the young 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.360
 prodigy of the star team tel 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.360
 it is strong 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.110
 while at the bottom right 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.899
 the red zerg player of the team mvp a 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:18.760
 the best zerg players in the world 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:23.080
 a goal pu tong taste and on camera 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:31.709
 we have a very brave tehran player 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.709
 this is league 1 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.390
 and big up to egor igor the warrior so if 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.849
 you are on the stream 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.030
 go make a big up to igorre you're 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:55.280
 30000 does then fart his cat 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:55.280
 that will please him honestly yes 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.579
 you get it do not stand out it goes very 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.439
 very quickly understand one to the hen who 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.870
 has just been posed by rg and rg 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.400
 which leads 2 to 0 in this country to 7 on 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.849
 reminds that it is the first to 4 points 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.870
 so everything remains is still possible 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.959
 we saw where we must go back to 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.090
 inextricable situations studies by 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.250
 example when it was conducted 2 to 0 by 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.450
 flash inflating precisely and who him 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.709
 had put four rounds in the mouth 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.019
 just behind what made him win 4 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.849
 at 2 everything is possible with that but who 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.819
 can if we want chained 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:37.139
 Catherine in a row does not make her 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.510
 problem after it's rg in the face and 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.129
 rg he still has a little side a 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.379
 little safe side what is to say 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.330
 if you do not have the right composition the 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.490
 good 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.460
 combination and well it's impossible to 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.680
 to get what and then there look 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.530
 the gifts of overlord who saw Drago 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.940
 life was gone on hatch first and who 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.060
 so lets go into the arena 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.070
 who checks the timing of the gas that is going to have 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.620
 the timing of this feeling and that spring 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.960
 so rg who has all the information 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.810
 on his opponent's head while 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.630
 this is not the case for life life good 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.270
 does not have scouts yet and the base of 2 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.980
 rg and he does not know what he has 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.090
 to do 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.989
 in the facts and in the analyzes of 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.989
 god are and laroche 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.600
 no no the two vo are very close the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.220
 speedling will be globally at the same time 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.370
 for both players and both 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.840
 Players are drone train too 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.690
 funny london 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.980
 for now it's drones and 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.250
 still some zerglings that are 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:41.390
 by train came out by rg but drg 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.990
 admin admin more gas he stopped 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.410
 to mine and do a lot of zerglings 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.290
 light all in 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.669
 yes it smells the all in is that there 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.600
 what is this side all that I have 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.790
 the impression he has of the breeders 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.470
 order on the path of shaded taste and 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.540
 a gray also in its base 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.040
 go the five minutes of play and that 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.140
 from actually it's very early 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.880
 show us chilly case does that show 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.669
 will be seen the player block at all costs 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.870
 what are we costing is going to edge lodges 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.610
 that will see live from the donation database 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.880
 drag or not that's not what we want 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.340
 see 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.900
 to leuze aline who moves I believe 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.430
 that in any case he did not have 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.930
 in rage I believe they devices 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.610
 should who did not see them no and the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.690
 devices what does it react in all 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.910
 case not if there is still disappeared 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.590
 from the usso he felt it to the breeder the 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.480
 hall and zerglings to mow sewer 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.610
 who is heading straight for the base of life 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.870
 will life be able to defend in 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.690
 anyway he blocked his pocket 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.790
 much doubt about the attack to his 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.610
 shows here 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.530
 and where he did not lose his seat a 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.600
 funny an embroidery that has just been 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.550
 given here the queen leaving titans who 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.810
 tank and all the ego tongs push of the 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.460
 blow that goes a little impaled on the 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.970
 queen's unless she gets into a fight 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.970
 expensive 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:58.720
 hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi life 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.639
 which is falling apart 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.270
 truly in this final 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:09.460
 it's a psychological war all to 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:14.289
 made of andré taste that leads 3 to 0 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:17.759
 it's hard 3 0 1 because it's 3-0 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:20.229
 what the heroes is not very much a 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:23.130
 clearly in terms of points this is 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.130
 it's the minimum 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.139
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.669
 so luckily there caf who re my 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.350
 I'm going to the front row since 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.310
 way we when we make jokes on 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.449
 is based only on the first rank 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.979
 us if the more than fifty laugh 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.979
 we did the others 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.860
 very well so 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.599
 3 0 it's hot so there low neck life 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.340
 and good to redo a little clichés 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.729
 must win four games in a row 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.729
 above them
