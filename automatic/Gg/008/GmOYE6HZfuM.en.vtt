a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.230> bit<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.520> really

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
a little bit I think it was really

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.889 
a little bit I think it was really
starting<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> die<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> forget<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> little<00:00:57.690> bit

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
starting to die I forget a little bit

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.569 
starting to die I forget a little bit
but<00:00:58.020> repetitive<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.949> promo<00:00:59.250> after

promo<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:01.050> was<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> good<00:01:01.320> segment<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
promo but that was a good segment I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.130 
promo but that was a good segment I
think<00:01:02.129> dispute<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.760> good<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.809> long-term

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140

that'll<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.790> with

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that'll be it but now you can see with

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.350 
that'll be it but now you can see with
this<00:01:41.970> one

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this one

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
this one
three<00:01:42.780> pay-per-view<00:01:43.200> matches<00:01:43.460> evolution<00:01:44.460> the

three pay-per-view matches evolution the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.069

shield they're having their second

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.899 
shield they're having their second
pay-per-view<00:01:46.409> match<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
pay-per-view match so I do like the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.539 
pay-per-view match so I do like the
long-term<00:01:48.500> booking<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
long-term booking and they in the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.940 
long-term booking and they in the
extended<00:01:51.119> feuds<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:52.649> happy

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
extended feuds I like that so I'm happy

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.120 
extended feuds I like that so I'm happy
with<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> third<00:01:53.460> match<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:54.630> fourth<00:01:55.259> match<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
with the third match a fourth match I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.060 
with the third match a fourth match I
can't<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> fan<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.869> four<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.920> if

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
can't I'm not a fan of four because if

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.440 
can't I'm not a fan of four because if
they<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.340> four<00:01:59.579> they<00:01:59.850> need<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.180> five

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
they have four they need to have five

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.749 
they have four they need to have five
and<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.740> think<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.100> better<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> end<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and I think it's better the end of the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.170 
and I think it's better the end of the
three<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> feud<00:02:04.560> warrants<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> you

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
three but if the feud warrants it you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.419 
three but if the feud warrants it you
know<00:02:06.329> why<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.840> guess<00:02:07.290> more<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
know why not I guess more is more the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.510 
know why not I guess more is more the
merrier<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.849> guess<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.709> their<00:02:10.709> last<00:02:10.950> match<00:02:11.160> at

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
merrier I guess but their last match at

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.140 
merrier I guess but their last match at
Extreme<00:02:11.819> Rules<00:02:12.090> kind<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.720> really

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
Extreme Rules kind of really

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.819 
Extreme Rules kind of really
turn<00:02:13.299> me<00:02:13.420> off<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.659> food<00:02:13.840> quite<00:02:14.079> big-time<00:02:14.590> that

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
turn me off the food quite big-time that

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.979 
turn me off the food quite big-time that
match<00:02:15.010> was<00:02:15.250> terrible<00:02:15.700> but<00:02:16.420> hopefully<00:02:16.840> this

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
match was terrible but hopefully this

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.509 
match was terrible but hopefully this
one<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.379> Last<00:02:17.560> Man<00:02:17.680> Standing<00:02:17.769> matches<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> little

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
one a Last Man Standing matches a little

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.410 
one a Last Man Standing matches a little
better<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.909> really<00:02:19.599> do<00:02:19.840> hope<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:21.150> Eric<00:02:22.150> Rowan

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
better I really do hope that Eric Rowan

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.869 
better I really do hope that Eric Rowan
and<00:02:22.780> Luke<00:02:22.810> Harper<00:02:23.260> do<00:02:23.769> not<00:02:24.010> get<00:02:24.250> involved<00:02:24.549> I

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
and Luke Harper do not get involved I

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.699 
and Luke Harper do not get involved I
hope<00:02:25.209> some<00:02:25.510> way<00:02:25.689> they<00:02:25.959> kind<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.230> keep<00:02:26.409> them<00:02:26.530> out

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
hope some way they kind of keep them out

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.350 
hope some way they kind of keep them out
of<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.099> just<00:02:27.610> let<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:27.879> be<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.060> one-on-one

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
of it and just let it be a one-on-one

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.210 
of it and just let it be a one-on-one
Last<00:02:28.989> Man<00:02:29.140> Standing<00:02:29.290> match<00:02:29.709> obviously

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
Last Man Standing match obviously

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.190 
Last Man Standing match obviously
they'll<00:02:30.400> probably<00:02:30.579> be<00:02:30.909> a<00:02:30.939> run<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.359> at<00:02:31.569> some

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
they'll probably be a run in at some

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.250 
they'll probably be a run in at some
stage<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:32.799> if<00:02:32.950> there's<00:02:33.129> a<00:02:33.189> run<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:34.049> let<00:02:35.049> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
stage but if there's a run in let the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.259 
stage but if there's a run in let the
Usos<00:02:35.829> or<00:02:36.040> whatever<00:02:36.280> come<00:02:36.519> out<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.819> stop<00:02:37.090> them

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
Usos or whatever come out and stop them

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.750 
Usos or whatever come out and stop them
so<00:02:37.569> that's<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.470> really<00:02:38.530> killed<00:02:39.159> last<00:02:39.430> match

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
so that's what really killed last match

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.599 
so that's what really killed last match
the<00:02:40.090> steel<00:02:40.299> cage<00:02:40.510> match<00:02:40.780> when<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.859> constant

the steel cage match when the constant

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.250 
the steel cage match when the constant
