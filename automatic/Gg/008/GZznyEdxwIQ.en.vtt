00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.520
 If the updates for World of Tanks had names, update 9.8 would best describe "Delicate". 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 It doesn't bring much new, but the little it brings is excellent. 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.680
 A new gaming event, a new way to invite players to the platoon, 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.460
 personal reserves and division of the game client into two versions. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.980
 Learn more in this review. 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.280
 A new gaming event, Dominance, was introduced. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.020
 In this mode you only have to shoot the enemy. 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.620
 And that is the only thing that has to do with the standard battles regime. 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.300
 The possibilities and ways to achieve victory are not like anything we had here before. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.480
 Battles take place with X-level vehicles. 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.740
 These tanks are special versions T110E5, AMX 50 B and Object 140. 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.320
 Their characteristics are similar to those of their relatives who go to explore. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 However, they can only be used in Dominance mode. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.000
 These tanks will be available to all players. 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.800
 So, if you're thinking about trying out these tanks or not, 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.580
 you'll be able to try them before you decide. 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.460
 The battle will take place as a duel of two teams 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.880
 15 to 15, or 10 to 10, which will depend on the map. 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.160
 The team that earns the most points won. 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.240
 Points will be earned for bringing the map to a special zone 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820
 and for destroying enemy tanks. 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.820
 If the team reaches the necessary score before the end of the battle, the battle ends. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.820
 This mode has its own unique game style 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.000
 because you don't have to worry about your vehicle being destroyed. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.500
 After a few seconds you will be able to re-enter the same battle and avenge yourself. 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.620
 Battleship Mode Domination 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620
 we have added the opportunity to be born again. 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.880
 These are the so-called "Garage Battles". 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.900
 After your tank is destroyed, a menu appears. 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.020
 You'll have 10 seconds to choose a new tank. 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.300
 The vehicle that has just been destroyed will be unavailable for selection for 30 seconds. 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.140
 The tank appears in battle with full hold points, ammunition and consumables. 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.040
 Consumer Options is a player's choice. 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.720
 As usual, you can choose consumer accessories before the Battle of Garage. 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.820
 The number of times you can be born again into battle is unlimited. 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.700
 There will be a few points in the battles that will allow the vehicles to be repaired and retrofitted. 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.220
 These points will give the possibility of intrigue. 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.140
 A badly damaged tank can rise from the ashes as well as the Phoenix! 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.540
 All you have to do is reach the yellow circle, 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.420
 which is shown on the map by a special icon, and wait 5 seconds. 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.620
 Just remember that if you are inside a circle, you must not get damaged or get out of the circle within 5 seconds. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.720
 You need to wait 60 seconds before you can use the same repair point again. 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.660
 Several tanks can be repaired at one point at a time 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.080
 even allied and hostile. 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.760
 The number of vehicles limits only the size of the circle. 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.340
 Dominance mode comes soon. Follow updates. 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.140
 Further: 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.040
 Distribution of client to HD and SD versions. Who wants what quality? 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.400
 Personal reserves. Now anyone can get what the clan has. 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.220
 Dynamic platoons. Together we win! 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.320
 In addition to a few major changes, Update 9.8 will bring many smaller ones. 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.840
 We've added to the game 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.980
 Battle Performance Badges 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.980
 which will show the player's effective actions in battle. 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.700
 Many personal missions have been fixed and improved. 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.920
 Range of automatic small caliber weapons was raised to 400 meters. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.460
 Many vehicles have been redesigned. 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.860
 For example, the IS-7 tank was diminished by the measurement of the gun while driving and the focus time was reduced. 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.600
 Scattering and focus time was increased for Conqueror GC. 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.600
 See the update notes for more details. 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.860
 Battles are now available in Fortifications for levels 5 to 7 with Level VIII vehicles. 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.880
 Komarin has been removed from random battles mode. 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.740
 Many vehicles have been redesigned into HD quality. 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.820
 Ability to choose between HD 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.640
 and the SD game client has been added to the installation and to the game launch. 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.500
 The HD version includes higher quality textures that take up much more disk space. 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.780
 If your PC's specifications don't allow you to play at the highest settings, 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.840
 it will be a better choice for a more compact SD client version. 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.400
 We got to Dynamic Chats. What is it and how does it change the game? 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.820
 We will also tell you about Personal Reserves. 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.480
 All players will be able to earn more experience points. 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.080
 So, Dynamic Platoon. 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.080
 Basically it is the same group of two or three players as before, but is formed differently. 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.680
 Imagine you are in battle. There are only two allies left. 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.600
 Great enemy forces are approaching. In most situations, this means defeat. 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.520
 But now we will be able to join forces in the platoon together 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.760
 start communicating with voice chat, coordinate actions 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.160
 and destroy an enemy that exceeds you in number but is not so organized. 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.940
 Of course, you don't have to wait for such a desperate situation. 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.760
 You can enter the platoon straight. 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.080
 This is effective when you fight on the wing 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.040
 or you play one type of vehicle. For example, Artillery, or Light Tanks. 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.180
 Available when the countdown is running. 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.500
 You just have to click on the player's nickname and invite him or her to the platoon. 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.920
 Players can both accept and decline the invitation. 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.560
 The platoon is not dissolved after the battle. 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.100
 So, if you think you've found the right brothers in the gun, you can continue playing together. 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.560
 Let's proceed to the Personal Reserves. 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.160
 Basically they are consumable accessories. 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.680
 If you activate them, you get more experience in battle 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.560
 experience. 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.960
 Personal reserves are very similar to those 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.920
 which clans are in Fortification mode 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.180
 except that such Reserves are personal. 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.380
 To receive Personal Reserves, you must complete special Random Battles missions. 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.800
 It's important to remember that the Reserve has an expiration date 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.260
 which is given in its description. 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.500
 You can activate Personal Reserves from the Garage menu. 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.940
 That's all for the moment. Good luck on the battlefield!
