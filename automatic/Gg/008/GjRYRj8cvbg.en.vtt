00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
rehearsing another is different because

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.480 
rehearsing another is different because

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
started a little bit not terribly

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.850 
started a little bit not terribly
positively<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.570> second<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.530> played

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
positively and the second time I played

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
positively and the second time I played
the<00:01:23.010> whole<00:01:23.160> Symphony<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:24.060> terrific<00:01:24.450> very

the whole Symphony was terrific very

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.560 
the whole Symphony was terrific very
quick<00:01:28.340> sometimes<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:30.119> we're<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
quick sometimes because we're not a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.800 
quick sometimes because we're not a
professional<00:01:31.020> group<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:33.210> know<00:01:33.330> where<00:01:33.690> of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
professional group and you know where of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.150 
professional group and you know where of
a<00:01:33.930> very<00:01:34.110> high<00:01:34.410> standard<00:01:34.470> each<00:01:34.920> one

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
a very high standard each one

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.710 
a very high standard each one
individually<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.390> work<00:01:36.540> together

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
individually but we don't work together

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450 
individually but we don't work together
very<00:01:36.930> often<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.440> come<00:01:37.619> together<00:01:37.800> for<00:01:38.100> specific

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
very often we come together for specific

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.109 
very often we come together for specific
projects<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.280> difficult<00:01:41.430> task<00:01:41.790> in

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
projects so it's a difficult task in

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.150 
projects so it's a difficult task in
terms<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:43.290> all<00:01:43.380> need<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:43.979> each

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
terms of we all need to get to know each

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.670 
terms of we all need to get to know each
other's<00:01:44.369> playing<00:01:44.610> very<00:01:44.820> quickly<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:46.500> we

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
other's playing very quickly and then we

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.340 
other's playing very quickly and then we
also<00:01:46.830> need<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.160> get<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:48.420> certain

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
also need to get to know a certain

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.040 
also need to get to know a certain
conductors<00:01:49.950> particular<00:01:50.220> style<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.810> how

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
conductors particular style and just how

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.350 
conductors particular style and just how
they<00:01:52.229> work<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.950> their<00:01:53.100> tempers<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
they work what their tempers are so and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.389 
they work what their tempers are so and
it's<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.229> lot<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> information<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> process<00:01:56.130> in

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it's a lot of information to process in

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
it's a lot of information to process in
a<00:01:56.460> very<00:01:56.610> short<00:01:56.670> space<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.900> things<00:01:58.350> can

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
a very short space of time so things can

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.649 
a very short space of time so things can
sometimes<00:01:58.680> grow<00:01:59.040> slightly<00:01:59.250> askew<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.090> by<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
sometimes grow slightly askew but by the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.810 
sometimes grow slightly askew but by the
end<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:00.960> rehearsal<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.820> everyone

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
end of the rehearsal I think everyone

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.789 
end of the rehearsal I think everyone
was<00:02:03.000> quite<00:02:03.570> pleased<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.229> having<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.799> go

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
was quite pleased with having to go

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.100 
was quite pleased with having to go
after<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.190> first<00:02:08.399> three<00:02:08.580> hours<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> bit

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
after the first three hours it was a bit

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.259 
after the first three hours it was a bit
of<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.260> shock<00:02:10.290> but<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.040> but<00:02:11.580> then<00:02:11.610> buy<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:11.940> by

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
of a shock but then but then buy it by

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.289 
of a shock but then but then buy it by
the<00:02:12.500> by<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.560> evening<00:02:13.830> rehearsal<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.760> think<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
the by the evening rehearsal I think it

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.430 
the by the evening rehearsal I think it
came<00:02:15.480> together<00:02:15.660> really<00:02:15.810> well<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.230> everyone

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
came together really well and everyone

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.380 
came together really well and everyone
understood<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.040> he<00:02:17.190> wanted<00:02:17.519> from<00:02:17.790> from<00:02:18.299> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
understood what he wanted from from the

understood what he wanted from from the
music<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.870> from<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.170> particular<00:02:19.830> moment<00:02:20.430> so

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
music and from the particular moment so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:39.440 
music and from the particular moment so
which<00:02:21.570> was<00:02:21.720> really<00:02:21.870> enjoyable<00:02:22.230> actually

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.030 

Rahim<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.780> lot<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.170> me<00:02:41.290> because<00:02:41.440> I'm<00:02:41.830> Russian

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
Rahim is a lot to me because I'm Russian

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.119 
Rahim is a lot to me because I'm Russian
and<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:43.299> sort<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.720> part<00:02:44.349> of<00:02:44.500> my<00:02:46.739> psyche<00:02:47.739> I

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
and so it's sort of part of my psyche I

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.320 
and so it's sort of part of my psyche I
suppose<00:02:48.700> from<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.540> very<00:02:49.810> early<00:02:50.140> childhood

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
suppose from the very early childhood
