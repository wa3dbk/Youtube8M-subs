we<00:04:16.390> should<00:04:16.419> take<00:04:16.720> some<00:04:16.900> inspiration<00:04:17.079> from

we should take some inspiration from

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.580 
we should take some inspiration from
Iggy<00:04:18.130> Azalea<00:04:18.519> by<00:04:18.760> quoting<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.390> lyrics<00:04:19.780> I'm<00:04:20.289> in
