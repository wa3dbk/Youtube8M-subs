00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
days so I'm about five to seven times

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.990 
days so I'm about five to seven times
you<00:01:12.930> got<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.830> black<00:01:14.010> ops<00:01:14.220> 2<00:01:14.430> days<00:01:14.640> doing

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you got this in black ops 2 days doing

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.870 
you got this in black ops 2 days doing
about<00:01:15.119> five<00:01:15.409> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
about five if you just got this it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
about five if you just got this it
shouldn't<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.479> doing<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.680> trick<00:01:19.979> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
shouldn't be doing it like this trick is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.590 
shouldn't be doing it like this trick is
only<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.580> old<00:01:20.700> X<00:01:20.970> boxes<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:23.330> once<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.450> feel

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
only for old X boxes so once you feel

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.179 
only for old X boxes so once you feel
right<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:24.900> five<00:01:25.200> times<00:01:25.380> there's<00:01:25.680> no<00:01:25.860> disc

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
right about five times there's no disc

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.130 
right about five times there's no disc
in<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.430> because<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> disc<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
in it because if you do a disc in it it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.270 
in it because if you do a disc in it it
will<00:01:28.320> maybe<00:01:28.950> corrupt<00:01:29.430> your<00:01:29.579> disc<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:31.280> opening

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
will maybe corrupt your disc so opening

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
will maybe corrupt your disc so opening
up<00:01:33.950> it's<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.130> closed<00:01:35.520> tray<00:01:35.960> everything's<00:01:36.960> okay

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
up it's a closed tray everything's okay

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.469 
up it's a closed tray everything's okay
right<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:38.119> but<00:01:39.119> when<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> put<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:39.750> disc<00:01:40.079> in

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
right now but when you put your disc in

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.960 
right now but when you put your disc in
advanced<00:01:42.479> warfare<00:01:42.619> just<00:01:43.619> slide<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.220> make
