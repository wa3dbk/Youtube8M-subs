00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
talk open closest to the athlete we

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.540 
talk open closest to the athlete we
talked<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.270> making<00:00:18.869> athletes<00:00:19.800> better<00:00:21.140> and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
talked about making athletes better and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.550 
talked about making athletes better and
this<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.150> core<00:00:24.449> value<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.230> been<00:00:25.439> the

this is the core value it's been the

this is the core value it's been the

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.400 

I<00:00:30.490> think<00:00:31.120> it's<00:00:31.270> not<00:00:31.480> rocket<00:00:31.690> science<00:00:32.110> everyone

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
I think it's not rocket science everyone

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.560 
I think it's not rocket science everyone
knows<00:00:32.560> I<00:00:32.740> cam<00:00:32.920> is<00:00:33.070> 90<00:00:33.340> minutes<00:00:33.640> but<00:00:34.270> to<00:00:34.390> break

down those 90 minutes for an individual
players<00:00:37.000> actually<00:00:37.180> means<00:00:37.510> 90<00:00:37.720> seconds<00:00:38.230> on<00:00:38.320> the

players actually means 90 seconds on the
ball<00:00:38.560> that<00:00:38.770> equates<00:00:39.700> to<00:00:39.790> roughly<00:00:39.880> sixty<00:00:40.630> to

eighty<00:00:40.870> four<00:00:41.080> contacts<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.180> means<00:00:43.330> every

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
eighty four contacts so it means every

count we had a vision to allow the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.770 
count we had a vision to allow the
predator<00:00:48.040> lethal<00:00:48.250> zones<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.790> be<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.570> most

innovative product that we've created so
far<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.920> started<00:00:54.430> very<00:00:54.580> much<00:00:54.730> with<00:00:54.850> an

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
far we started very much with an

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.869 
far we started very much with an
analysis<00:00:55.540> of<00:00:55.720> modern<00:00:56.199> football<00:00:56.640> there<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.850> a

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
analysis of modern football there is a

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.780 
analysis of modern football there is a
need<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.690> understand<00:00:59.320> statistics<00:00:59.790> however

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
need to understand statistics however

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.090 
need to understand statistics however
that's<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.570> analytical<00:01:01.989> side<00:01:02.170> of<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:02.379> reality

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
that's the analytical side of it reality

that's the analytical side of it reality

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
for us testing is also one of those key

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.160 
for us testing is also one of those key
topics<00:01:36.429> that<00:01:36.670> will<00:01:37.390> go<00:01:37.509> hand<00:01:37.750> in<00:01:37.840> hand<00:01:37.899> with

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
enabled us to really take the concept a

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.089 
enabled us to really take the concept a
step<00:02:01.149> further<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.869> first<00:02:05.140> generation

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
step further it's the first generation

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.569 
step further it's the first generation
of<00:02:06.130> zoning<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.569> really<00:02:07.750> know<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:09.310> players
