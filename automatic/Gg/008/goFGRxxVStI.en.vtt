grow<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.370> put<00:00:38.519> them<00:00:38.730> there<00:00:39.890> hmm<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.040> wonder

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
grow if you put them there hmm I wonder

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.030 

another<00:02:30.850> method<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.420> called<00:02:31.780> parent<00:02:32.650> plant

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
another method is called parent plant

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.020 
another method is called parent plant
there<00:02:33.970> are<00:02:34.090> two<00:02:34.330> types<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.780> parent<00:02:35.290> plants

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
there are two types of parent plants

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.240 
there are two types of parent plants
explorers<00:02:37.030> which<00:02:37.480> open<00:02:37.900> forcefully<00:02:38.590> shooting

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
their seeds in many directions and the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.760 
their seeds in many directions and the
other<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.310> self<00:02:42.880> planting<00:02:43.570> some<00:02:44.320> plants

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
other is self planting some plants

themselves<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.950> peanut<00:02:48.520> plants<00:02:49.500> Wow

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
themselves like peanut plants Wow

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.380 
themselves like peanut plants Wow
there<00:02:51.100> are<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.490> many<00:02:51.760> different<00:02:52.240> methods

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
there are so many different methods

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.480 
there are so many different methods
plants<00:02:53.110> use<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.530> get<00:02:53.680> their<00:02:53.890> seeds<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.370> the

seed dispersal each plant uses and

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.850 
seed dispersal each plant uses and
remember<00:03:15.430> always<00:03:15.880> keep<00:03:16.600> wondering<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:19.860> think

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
remember always keep wondering I think
