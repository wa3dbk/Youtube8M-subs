00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you know inside of a clock appliances

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.499 
you know inside of a clock appliances
technology<00:01:29.310> things<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.450> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
technology things like that so think of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.780 
technology things like that so think of
like<00:01:30.689> bolts<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.650> nuts<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
like bolts and you know nuts and all of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
like bolts and you know nuts and all of
these<00:01:32.939> straight<00:01:33.299> lines<00:01:33.329> switchboards<00:01:34.200> things

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
these straight lines switchboards things

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.450 
these straight lines switchboards things
like<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.860> creative<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
like that so be creative about it you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
like that so be creative about it you
can<00:01:35.549> also<00:01:35.700> google<00:01:36.119> images<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.810> help<00:01:37.290> figure

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
can also google images to help figure

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.749 
can also google images to help figure
out<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:37.979> shapes<00:01:38.189> create<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
out what kind of shapes create on the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.310 
out what kind of shapes create on the
inside<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.689> once<00:01:39.900> you're<00:01:40.020> done<00:01:40.170> creating

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
inside so once you're done creating

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.929 
inside so once you're done creating
these<00:01:40.590> shapes<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.340> start<00:01:41.549> adding<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
these shapes you can start adding in

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
these shapes you can start adding in
your<00:01:42.119> silver<00:01:42.659> which<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> fun<00:01:43.380> part<00:01:43.409> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
your silver which is the fun part so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.260 
your silver which is the fun part so
I've<00:01:44.130> got<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> darkest<00:01:44.729> over<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> lighter

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270

liquid I'm going to add the pigment and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
liquid I'm going to add the pigment and
the<00:01:49.049> mayor<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.350> mixing<00:01:49.680> liquid<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.340> together

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
mix it up really nicely and that gives

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
mix it up really nicely and that gives
me<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.100> nice<00:01:53.430> silver<00:01:54.210> kind<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.659> paste<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
me this nice silver kind of paste and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.319 
me this nice silver kind of paste and
it's<00:01:55.470> very<00:01:55.890> intense<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:57.090> why<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
it's very intense and that's why you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.520 
it's very intense and that's why you
need<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> mixing<00:01:57.780> liquid<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.350> want

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
need the mixing liquid because you want

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.039 
need the mixing liquid because you want
to<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.579> metal<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.689> basically

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
to have it look like metal so basically

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.780 
to have it look like metal so basically
the<00:02:01.320> ones<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.770> you've<00:02:01.890> drawn<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.579> you're

and you're going to fill it in with
darker<00:02:05.670> solvers<00:02:06.000> lighter<00:02:06.180> silvers<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.719> give

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
darker solvers lighter silvers to give

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.510 
darker solvers lighter silvers to give
us<00:02:06.930> some<00:02:07.049> depth<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.439> dimension<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:08.310> you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
us some depth and dimension because you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.710 
us some depth and dimension because you
really<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.879> add<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.509> give<00:02:09.690> it

really want to add to it and give it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.570 
really want to add to it and give it
like<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> three-dimensional<00:02:10.770> look<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.190> don't

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
like a three-dimensional look and don't

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.530 
like a three-dimensional look and don't
worry<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.760> he<00:02:11.849> gets<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.150> messy<00:02:12.239> because

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
worry if he gets a little messy because

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.520 
worry if he gets a little messy because
we're<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.870> outline<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
we're going to outline it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.199 
we're going to outline it
the<00:02:13.620> black<00:02:13.890> liquid<00:02:14.130> liner<00:02:14.250> again<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.910> look<00:02:15.090> at

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
the black liquid liner again and look at

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.340 
the black liquid liner again and look at
how<00:02:15.330> amazing<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.870> looks<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.319> looks<00:02:17.300> amazing

how amazing it looks and looks amazing
then<00:02:19.350> we're<00:02:19.470> going<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.620> take<00:02:19.680> our<00:02:19.770> silicone

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
then we're going to take our silicone

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.640 
then we're going to take our silicone
compound<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.910> add<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.270> around<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.080> area<00:02:22.500> if

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
compound and add that around the area if

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.020 
compound and add that around the area if
you<00:02:22.709> want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> know<00:02:23.040> how<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.190> mix<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.610> silicone

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you want to know how to mix the silicone

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.730 
you want to know how to mix the silicone
compound<00:02:24.270> correctly<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.350> doesn't<00:02:25.590> cure

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
compound correctly so it doesn't cure

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.320 
compound correctly so it doesn't cure
