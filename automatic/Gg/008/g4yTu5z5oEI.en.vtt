00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
because I for this trick my thought was

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.569 
because I for this trick my thought was
the<00:00:37.230> trucks<00:00:37.530> are<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.399> be

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the trucks are just going to have to be

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.850 
the trucks are just going to have to be
so<00:00:38.820> tight<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.540> my<00:00:39.719> board<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.710> go

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
so tight because I'm my board if I go

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.420 
so tight because I'm my board if I go
like<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:42.290> goes<00:00:43.290> doesn't<00:00:44.280> do

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
like that it just goes doesn't do

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.790 
like that it just goes doesn't do
anything<00:00:44.789> wheel<00:00:45.180> bite<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
anything wheel bite so I'm just going to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
anything wheel bite so I'm just going to
go<00:00:46.920> ahead<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.309> tighten<00:00:47.539> tighten<00:00:48.539> Lance's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989

go ahead and tighten tighten Lance's
trucks<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.500> even<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:51.500> it's<00:00:52.500> also<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.920> 8<00:00:53.160> 8

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
trucks up even more so it's also an 8 8

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.020 
trucks up even more so it's also an 8 8
inch<00:00:53.969> wide<00:00:54.239> boards<00:00:54.690> gives<00:00:54.960> me<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.320> more

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
inch wide boards gives me a little more

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.290 
inch wide boards gives me a little more
space<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> boat<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.500> saying

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
space on the boat for that I'm saying

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.990 
space on the boat for that I'm saying
you<00:01:00.300> roll<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> boat<00:01:01.289> over<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> had<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> name

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.219 
you roll the boat over if I had to name
this<00:01:03.239> trick<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.600> would've<00:01:03.780> called<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.110> like

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this trick I would've called it like

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.050 
this trick I would've called it like
capsized<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> first<00:01:05.670> thing<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
capsized so the first thing I'm going to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.749 
capsized so the first thing I'm going to
do<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.420> try<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> barrel<00:01:07.500> roll
