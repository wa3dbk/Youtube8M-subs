the battle set set you know that stuff

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.000 
the battle set set you know that stuff
is<00:04:20.830> pretty<00:04:21.130> freakin<00:04:21.700> cool<00:04:22.170> then<00:04:23.170> and<00:04:23.530> the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
is pretty freakin cool then and the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.650 
is pretty freakin cool then and the
other<00:04:24.130> nice<00:04:24.340> thing<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:24.850> fact<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.240> it's

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
got access to all the loop features here

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.150 
got access to all the loop features here
these<00:04:28.750> six<00:04:29.050> sets<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.350> buttons<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.740> here<00:04:29.770> they

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
these six sets of buttons in here they

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.950 
these six sets of buttons in here they
can<00:04:30.190> basically<00:04:30.490> change<00:04:30.970> setup<00:04:31.480> and<00:04:31.660> define

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
can basically change setup and define

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.900 
can basically change setup and define
the<00:04:32.110> set<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.440> loops<00:04:32.620> you<00:04:33.220> know<00:04:33.340> if<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.790> know

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
the set of loops you know if you know

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.080 
the set of loops you know if you know
like<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.210> see<00:04:34.420> a<00:04:34.450> mom<00:04:34.750> list<00:04:34.990> of<00:04:35.050> all<00:04:35.140> my<00:04:35.230> mixes

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
like you see a mom list of all my mixes

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:44.190 
like you see a mom list of all my mixes
zip<00:04:37.090> back<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.450> beginning<00:04:37.600> here<00:04:43.080> we've<00:04:44.080> got

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
zip back to the beginning here we've got

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.930 
zip back to the beginning here we've got
a<00:04:44.230> loop<00:04:44.410> go<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.710> there<00:04:44.950> so<00:04:45.790> I<00:04:45.820> can

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
a loop go in there so I can

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.559 
a loop go in there so I can
automatically<00:04:46.810> change<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.320> loops<00:04:47.590> size

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.999

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
without having to click on the keyboard

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.700 
without having to click on the keyboard
anymore<00:04:53.780> which<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:54.810> awesome

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710

I<00:04:55.740> can<00:04:56.659> just<00:04:57.659> mess<00:04:58.020> around<00:04:58.050> with<00:04:58.409> it<00:04:58.530> as<00:04:58.650> much

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
I can just mess around with it as much

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.320 
I can just mess around with it as much
as<00:04:58.979> I<00:04:59.039> want<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.520> can<00:04:59.699> turn<00:04:59.849> it<00:04:59.969> off<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.300> don't

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
as I want and I can turn it off I don't

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
have to use the keyboard for any of that

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.209 
have to use the keyboard for any of that
stuff<00:05:01.949> anymore<00:05:02.900> then<00:05:03.900> there's<00:05:04.650> also<00:05:04.949> the

cue points you see those little over

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:10.550 
cue points you see those little over
here<00:05:09.629> we're<00:05:09.719> going<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.900> go<00:05:09.990> over<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.169> deck<00:05:10.379> a

blurry but you can see the blue bars
those<00:05:17.370> are<00:05:17.490> Q<00:05:17.699> points<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.150> preset<00:05:18.750> inside

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
those are Q points so that preset inside

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.429 
those are Q points so that preset inside
of<00:05:19.349> tractor<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.150> can<00:05:21.419> do<00:05:21.539> some<00:05:21.780> fancy
