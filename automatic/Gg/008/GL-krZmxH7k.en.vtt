 photo of the car closed in cash 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.850
 the end of the genre is like this 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:53.240
 it's a thousand 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.400
 ruca gloves as the hulk make a 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.560
 picnic in the park with naiÃ¡ rosita 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.270
 I was very excited to 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.270
 Try your new one to pay for it 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.960
 said it looks good 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.910
 How did we say a picnic was? 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:18.950
 There , my parrot was thrown there. 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:20.810
 It's the dog, we had lunch already because I'm 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.580
 there not giving mom 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.580
 you must first see if the child is 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:38.990
 fulfilled soon enough so already 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:49.160
 is to take a few steps can crush try 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:51.710
 run a little ready and go annan the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.759
 parrot did not fly and the hulk was very 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.350
 pressed or not copyright trodden 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.570
 looks spoiled 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.979
 only at this moment there is no wind and the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.520
 parrots need the event to 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.550
 kept on the air and launched to pay and 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.160
 Now, if we wait a little, we can 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.160
 be that the wind returns who wants to reach 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.420
 The hulk was annoying and it's not that I 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.820
 this is not a way to see if the wind 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.860
 back to looking at the clouds did as 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:35.910
 they are still 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:38.070
 Look where I do not go out in the sky and look at 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.030
 me is that cloud looks like a 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.130
 side 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.140
 If you read thankless, look at me, it's the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.770
 Hulk was so fun to watch the clouds 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.110
 Who forgot the parrot? 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:03:01.860
 Look, it's neymar, a strike. 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:10.340
 Look, it 's a train. It's going to catch rosita ii. 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.340
 and iii also touch the sky 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:23.989
 but it does not look like this foam plane 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.650
 seems to come out often look pro 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.650
 sky 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.409
 the clouds are moving if it's really there 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.939
 people listen I think it's a good time 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:43.389
 to experience neither porto gaia where 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:51.049
 are also increased pay is quite another 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:52.040
 Baylon is'll leave power find 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.129
 sells alone 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.129

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.919
