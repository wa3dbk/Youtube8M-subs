00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
well I thought about for a while and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:29.620 
well I thought about for a while and
some<00:01:28.549> of<00:01:28.639> the<00:01:28.700> other<00:01:28.850> dreamwave<00:01:29.179> guys<00:01:29.389> have

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
some of the other dreamwave guys have

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.510 
some of the other dreamwave guys have
talked<00:01:29.869> about<00:01:30.020> telling<00:01:30.560> some<00:01:30.709> stories<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.039> and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
talked about telling some stories to and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.519 
talked about telling some stories to and
part<00:01:32.389> of<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.539> reason<00:01:32.569> was<00:01:32.899> I'm<00:01:33.079> doing<00:01:33.319> a<00:01:33.380> few

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:33.529 
part of the reason was I'm doing a few

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.550 
part of the reason was I'm doing a few
new<00:01:33.649> projects<00:01:34.340> like<00:01:34.999> doing<00:01:35.630> Bravo<00:01:36.020> man<00:01:36.259> for

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
Namco things like that and I thought

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.899 
Namco things like that and I thought
well<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:39.889> is<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.009> good<00:01:40.130> time<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.340> bring<00:01:40.670> some

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909
