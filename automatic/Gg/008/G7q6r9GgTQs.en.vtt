fine<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:31.980> didn't<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.640> any<00:02:32.790> beef<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.390> but

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
fine I didn't have any beef with it but

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.800 
fine I didn't have any beef with it but
this<00:02:33.840> movie<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.380> really<00:02:34.560> gets<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.459> right

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
this movie I think really gets it right

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.199

it<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.470> also<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.130> think<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:38.819> hard<00:02:39.090> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
it and also I think it's really hard to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.690 
it and also I think it's really hard to
turn<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.690> 30-page<00:02:40.290> children's<00:02:41.130> book<00:02:41.310> into

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
turn like a 30-page children's book into

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.790 
turn like a 30-page children's book into

a 90-minute movie and this film does a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.860 
a 90-minute movie and this film does a
really<00:02:43.950> good<00:02:44.160> job<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.550> sort<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.819> like<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.269> uses

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
really good job of sort of like it uses

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.020

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
also has stuff before and after it to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.759
