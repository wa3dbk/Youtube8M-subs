 this meeting is empirical jorge castro is a specialist in oriental medicine in 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.940
 quantum medicine that ee quantum medicine and oriental medicine and how 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.219
 the practice 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.379
 in oriental medicine is the same as they need 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.130
 nor have many techniques been developed in Japan and China 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.689
 within which culture is the most important in Japan essences 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.869
 a technique that you imagine is a crime approach to quantum medicine said 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.019
 which is a modern approach to science based on mathematics and physics 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.030
 we understand radio waves generators that allow to kill a thousand spores 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.060
 encapsulate certain types of cancer 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.330
 all this is endorsed by the health secretariat 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.790
 in the health cgt 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.790
 has made impressive efforts to recognize acupuncture from the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.480
 the next year 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.060
 i quantum medicine too 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.630
 Piñera has been recognized 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.950
 and partly also because it makes him grow work as readings 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.220
 Cuba to patients as a disease diagnosis can be like which 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.110
 even disease that are 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.760
 incurable in what has like him cancer or some cancers or the company 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.880
 diabetes 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.960
 in my group we have collected different types of very old diagnoses 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.250
 with the allows 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.900
 maybe I lied to you that there is in the organism 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.900
 for example we have seven focus is on 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.660
 information on crude diagnosis 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.030
 two oriental approaches on a magnet 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.970
 this allows us to know which organ of your organism ordered the organism of 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:34.820
 anyone 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.030
 what is failing and even more that is falling are difficult 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.250
 we make a diagnosis 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.290
 we propose a treatment 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.820
 i at the end 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.970
 We perform 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.619
 percent and already running that treatment and I have a result 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.140
 in the same session 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.640
 what happened to you here 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.110
 but basically it was an accident jun 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.330
 it's not new puncturing position I took the tendon 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.530
 the flexor and extensive nerve 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.870
 and this record is good thanks to the work and culotte la pgr received from part of 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:05.170
 God 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.550
 recovery this left very good all this because product of the doctor 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.479
 Castro had not been trying 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:18.149
 since it is that before that day I had also had a problem that 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:19.829

 of seizures nap and have special 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.979
 the wonderful world 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.889
 but you have a pretty impressive resume, tell us that to our 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.010
 friends to our viewers please and that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.199
 where he studies art as this fair conducted in Japan 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.109
 that's my cock 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.639
 I was a year in Japan 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.869
 with the experience the wonderful people that a hospital and notice that they were 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.169
 putting acupuncture 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.679
 for as an anesthetic 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:02.959
 and it is that it has frizz 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.609
 but not heart punch arias 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.949
 that was amazing to see the person who was awake 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.750
 it was covered 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.319
 here with a curtain 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.209
 and suddenly acupuncture was well operating the heart that was really 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.139
 amazing 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.139
 then I have dedicated myself to study this scientific point of view 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.519
 these tools 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.719
 and what this use of the science faculty has helped me 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.620
 certainly a great opportunity to be a direct disciple of Dr. Alberto 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.439
 barajas g 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.429
 studied with Albert Einstein 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.779
 then you create with this great scientist 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.829
 he studied physics and medicine in the faculty of sciences there was no 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:40.759
 biomechanics 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.159
 it has allowed me 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.950
 and beyond and depth 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.590
 treatments not under tools state 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.980
 developing tools that there is no 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.189
 from 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.769
 this kind of experience 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.879
 because you arrive with the dr 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.049
 well I arrived because I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis but with the 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.120
 treatment that I receive weekly are still working 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:07.049
 percent and had much improvement four months ago kelly who has 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.319
 certainly very affected of the legs with a grid is total and now it is 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.289
 good what surprised me very much was a-dating therapy terenci a massage 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.279
 this means 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.089
 that can select the restless legs news that I want to go prey 

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:24.719
 I four months commented 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.840
 for example from Estepona 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.629
 pay less maybe have a little 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.059
 and keep the balance a little bit but not much 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:36.249
 last days on this plane road with walker 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.120
 you need Spain yes that's the goal 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.770
 make him walk in a normal way martifer 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.819
 almagro with a coman will lighten but not so much but 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.360
