00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.890
 Year is worthwhile here is hobo and I welcome my first to my 

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.270
 Power video 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.030
 yes I have one here in the game 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.409
 Porsche expects to build and although the 2 we ask all together expect 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:20.099
 and the last one you can spend as high time then is therefore 30 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.310
 yes and gave the little peculiarity and although I can set the time 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.170
 want to save and then with the calculators and I can save the result 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.650
 through you times 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.700
 4 to 2 2 percent a year is all Algiers are their stores and that 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.380
 i can speak here spokesman arm 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.550
 to calculate the term at the c- and d- 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.540
 and 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.100
 I can then get the result that I have received here then 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.000
 save with the calculator can not plus and minus signs 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 and Duisburg Munich 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
 I'll do my 8 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.930
 that's so 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.520
 Now you have to see the ad better 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.360
 October 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.490
 Munich 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.630
 Bonn 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.090
 b bets 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.340
 Meppen 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.740
 to no 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.840
 on 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.060
 BU 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.340
 and so 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.590
 So then I save times in accordingly from the number 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.360
 was set accordingly 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.570
 if I'm now behind the bars, the number is in the theater 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.380
 and if I am now the numbers affected the pond not easy 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.240
 yes a + 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.640
 none of the two and it indicates 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.540
 in the SENSEX and that's why the number is now 6 Eutin 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.340
 Nathan legally just continues »the memory Maren cn the number 5 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.760
 1 is filled here 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 I have 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.359
 b 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.399
 so worried 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.399
 it must therefore be the magazine appears 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.669
 needed something 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:20.650
 Yes 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.619
 that's true 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.939
 and if I want to calculate the second time I just have to 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.939
 here there plus 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.729
 Computers and thanked 11 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.199
 so 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.949
 I can now save the number again with her I go 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.599
 just a b 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.390
 this must wake up to the century that I have here in the normal day here 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.299
 the normal input of the board x 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.789
 I've chosen and then you just have to spike 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.429
 m 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.649
 Zuckerberg is 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:04.109
 as from Melle then there should also 11 10 yes it applies 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.279
 Yes 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.279
 Burgkirchen 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.499
 if I can too - calculators and awarded here 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.739
 that count 11- five times 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.739
 so even if they start - select and then 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.269
 depends on the result 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.819
 6 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.819
 + dived with the two numbers 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.849
 that's 16 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.340
 js 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.120
 Unfortunately, this 16 no longer save because discourse 15 is what 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.269
 one over theirs 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.420
 Clutter probably come from 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.589
 1 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.959
 b 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.510
 I believe in it and what will come later 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.250
 Yes 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.889
 what ever 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.469
 and then 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:06.400
 was it actually already I show you shortly behind it behind 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:07.949
 the 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.249
 Screen from Sirte 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.249
 TB Windelen ads 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.470
 I make shortly timid as I once over 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.740
 So you 7 the latter and have 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.740
 the first go to memory 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.080
 and see the successes has sense that here are the four memory ABC &amp; d 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.789
 Each time with 4 the flip-flops 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.669
 to save the number 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.520
 inside every Devlet Klopp did not come save a bit 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.990
 if I then 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.240
 the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.490
 Accordingly, say Velvet I do not reckon with the two speakers 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.539
 then i can do this here 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.330
 forward to the calculator as earlier to the actual 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.279
 computer unit 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.849
 and 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.849
 it depends on Rome 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.789
 now have for plus and Niederaussem 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.949
 if this is different then that will be 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.449
 - our right - in the end is out is André Knust Plus 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.289
 After having spent two hours with each other 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.569
 she is already trembling 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.110
 Coupling Smartrac but the rear of the vehicle I have that 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.499
 he also has to go to his canal because you can do everything again 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.099
 has done and you can too expensive for income 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.999
 more that's when is going to be old 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.469
 the 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.799
 GCL enter the child numbers in the charts 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.829
 It goes through quite a lot of pay and depending on what number I get here 

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:54.050
 So I've been right here 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.639
 comes in it is then with the appropriate escapes and SG then 

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:01.949
 that is, if I now, for example, the 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.560
 17 min the one who would have given then that would be yes and 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.089
 would then be forwarded trains 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.409
 Display free beer 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.259
 this is not the same again only 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.449
 "That's just the right one 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.040
 Segments from the ad here 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.040
 Thann turns on and off 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.240
 I can show that for a short time 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.240
 because I just paid it the zero 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.740
 and it has to get away so it will be here 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.439
 others go DSK like and bring underdog do Schleicher it is awakened 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:43.289
 the carport and the 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.960
 Counter no more 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.290
 For example, Wenger decorates the lever for the three presses, so he starts 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.449
 Nolan 01 12 Here I have the lever for the three dead people 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.039
 then there should be the 3 as well 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.199
 that's so 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.639
 which adorns the 5 because I am here 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.199
 then the four should be here too 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.199
 and that's the way it is 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:35.590
 Yates was already saying what you wanted to show you I hope you have 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.590
 please, Marco explains shortly what was built here 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.930
 maybe until the 7 this time maybe I'll do some videos 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.350
 ending
