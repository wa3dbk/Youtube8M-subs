I<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:26.909> survive<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.380> decide<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.829> set<00:01:29.159> up<00:01:29.280> so

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I would survive so I decide to set up so

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.420 
I would survive so I decide to set up so
I<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.610> outspeed<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:31.560> poke<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.009> line<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.340> the

I can outspeed that poke in line and the
others<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.180> come<00:01:33.450> after<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.439> knew

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
others that come after it because I knew

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.789 
others that come after it because I knew
that<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:35.490> pokemon<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.509> slow<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.140> I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that this pokemon is really slow so I

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.350 
that this pokemon is really slow so I
decided<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> drain<00:01:38.369> punch<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> gain<00:01:39.180> back

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
decided to drain punch it to gain back

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.560 
decided to drain punch it to gain back
some<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> health<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.060> knocked<00:01:42.390> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
some of the health and I knocked that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.249 
some of the health and I knocked that
out<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> again<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.659> my

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
out with with these so again this my

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.429 
out with with these so again this my
second<00:01:46.770> over<00:01:47.100> confidence<00:01:47.700> boost<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.290> at

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
second over confidence boost so I'm at

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.749 
second over confidence boost so I'm at
plus<00:01:49.740> three<00:01:49.979> attacks<00:01:50.340> oh<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.210> plus<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.140> speed

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
plus three attacks oh and plus one speed

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.090 
plus three attacks oh and plus one speed
so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.820> decided<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.590> would<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.829> safe<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so I decided I think it would be safe to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.090 
so I decided I think it would be safe to
set<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.640> again<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.799> because<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.950> knew

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
set up again just to see because I knew

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580
