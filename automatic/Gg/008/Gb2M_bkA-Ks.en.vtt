 between smartphones with windows phone 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 even with the launch of the year and 21 929 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.449
 can be considered one of the top of the line 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.490
 of the Finnish company the cellular 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 featured powerful camera hardware with 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.390
 design piu piu technology is 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 spectacular and much more 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.160
 all the positive and negative points of the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.550
 you check this nose 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.770
 the first thing you notice in 1920 and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 that he is the big smartphone 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.790
 The cell phone is 130,000 meters high and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.550
 70mm wide 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.430
 the same size as the Samsung Galaxy S 4g the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.300
 cell phone also a bit heavy 385 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.129
 grams 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.989
 but this does not bring that feeling of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 fragility we have in holding a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.520
 very light smartphone 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.460
 the design of the handset is impressive 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.960
 no doubt lu 1920 years smartphones 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.430
 most beautiful on the market 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.320
 the body of the apparatus is formed by a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.989
 piece of polycarbonate which in the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.330
 black your matte finish to the rear 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.880
 of the cell phone is round with that beyond 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.979
 edges is perfect and the camera has a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.049
 very beautiful metallic detail 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.659
 in addition the smartphone is very firm 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.659
 because it increases the feeling of resistance 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.750
 the 1920's design was inspired by nokia 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.420
 n9 released in 2010 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.600
 in addition to the 1920s and other 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 Nokia also inherited the design of ie9 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.570
 as 1,800 in 1990 1020 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.280
 even it is used enough time this 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.740
 design continues to impress and is 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.880
 considered one of the most beautiful among 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.290
 smartphones 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.390
 the screen certainly one of the great 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:49.770
 Highlights of the 1920s it ipf lcd with 4.5 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.860

 ctec technology the screen quality of the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.990
 1920 and the definition of the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.509
 images reproduced by the device is 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.189
 very good the clearblack technology is 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.489
 responsible for making the public more 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.720
 I live stronger and consequently 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.450
 bring a contrast and saw the pictures 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.569
 displays 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.150
 this screen everything that is reproduced in the 1920 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.730
 and has a lot of sharpness and even pixels 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.430
 the screen also has the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.860
 pinocchio hd technology that makes the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.319
 system to run at 60 frames per second and 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.269
 with more fluid movement without 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.390
 effects of blu while you use the menu 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.700
 or applications in addition the display 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.920
 also has gorilla glass 2 which 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.250
 makes it much more resistant to 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.099
 breaks the number 920 account with hardware 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.340
 very powerful smartphone processor one 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.910
 cualcomm snapdragon 1.5 ghz dual-core 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.829
 with 1 GB of RAM 32GB of storage 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.620
 even with the launch of new models 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.299
 of the lumix line 1920 remains a 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.860
 of the manufacturer's top line 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.110
 Finnish 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.239
 the smartphone is capable of playing games with 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.459
 high level of graphics without 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.099
 present law even at the high level 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.450
 details your smartphone does not display 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.250
 gagging 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.920
 the multi- tasking system is very 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.720
 fast nokia 1920 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.060
 even using applications that use 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.319
 enough processing the transition before 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.600
 of applications will always be very 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.639
 efficiently without any 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.500
 transitions or resume the point where the 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.019
 application was before it was 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.660
 minimized something strange that we perceive 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.299
 is that when they were in the years mars phone 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.730
 to run some heavy game the part of 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.209
 well behind the changes located 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.650
 processor was very hot but not 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.660
 should be something of concern what is going to 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.120
 impair smartphone performance 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.220
 will run windows phone 8 is not a chore 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.049
 very difficult since the system is very 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.970
 lightweight and optimized 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.239
 but it's worth remembering that the system runs 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.489
 very well on hardware 1920 everything runs 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.829
 very same device giving the sensation of 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.230
 that the system is floating on the screen 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.130
 the smartphone also has 32 gb of 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.450
 storage 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.000
 the amount more than enough 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.310
 to install multiple games apps 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.400
 take lots of photos fill your cell phone 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.859
 songs not the entry for sd card 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.959
 but memory is not necessary after all 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:18.049
 The internal message already gives the message 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.090
 the camera dome 928.7 megapixels 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.449
 with Pio technology saw this 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.479
 technology Sunday 20 the photos 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.940
 captured in 1920 are very beautiful 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.550
 with vivid colors and very clean images 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.560
 no noise and distortion 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.849
 the camera is undoubtedly among the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.979
 best on the market 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:40.340
 the picture quality is very good 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.319
 even more so the camera also films 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.139
 in full hd and has a very 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:47.900
 good image stabilization 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.150
 the front camera with 1.3 megapixels and 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.159
 quality is of great size 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.629
 whether to take pictures or make video 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:59.090
 battery calls not that 1920 in 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.849
 2001 tennis and is one of the good points 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.069
 using your smartphone with the 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.419

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.139
 difficulty 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.419
 making moderate use using 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.039
 battery life can last up to two 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.590
 days or even more 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.419
 it is also worth remembering that the number 920 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.039
 has loading areas 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.520
 however the charger is sold 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.740

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.020
 smartphone with the market rumors 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.460
 after all, with the arrival of new models of 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.580
 lumix line its reduced price 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.279
 considerably but even so the
