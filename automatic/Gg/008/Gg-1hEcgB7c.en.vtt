00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hey YouTube this is die fly-fish just

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.350 
hey YouTube this is die fly-fish just
want<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.340> show<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:02.520> something<00:00:02.939> here's<00:00:03.270> a

want to show you something here's a
little<00:00:04.350> plasma<00:00:04.589> toy<00:00:05.779> it<00:00:06.779> has<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.790> constrained

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
little plasma toy it has a constrained

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.720 
little plasma toy it has a constrained
glass<00:00:09.210> layer<00:00:09.450> plasma<00:00:10.080> that's<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.309> know<00:00:11.400> you

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
glass layer plasma that's you know you

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.190 
glass layer plasma that's you know you
can<00:00:11.849> play<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.269> sort<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.509> like<00:00:12.570> those<00:00:12.809> spheres

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
can play with sort of like those spheres

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.340 
can play with sort of like those spheres
but<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.679> all<00:00:14.660> encased<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.870> glass<00:00:15.900> and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
but this is all encased in glass and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.500 
but this is all encased in glass and
it's<00:00:16.500> planar<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.699> its<00:00:17.869> function<00:00:19.070> here's<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
it's planar in its function here's a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.880 
it's planar in its function here's a
some<00:00:21.510> neodymium<00:00:22.020> magnets<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.439> I've<00:00:22.529> encased

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
some neodymium magnets that I've encased

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.880 
some neodymium magnets that I've encased
an<00:00:23.070> epoxy<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> Teflon<00:00:24.590> slide<00:00:25.590> from<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
an epoxy and on a Teflon slide from a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.609 
an epoxy and on a Teflon slide from a
previous<00:00:26.490> project<00:00:26.930> magneto<00:00:27.930> hydrodynamics<00:00:28.050> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
previous project magneto hydrodynamics a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
previous project magneto hydrodynamics a
drive<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> put<00:00:29.519> together<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.000> no<00:00:30.599> event

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
drive that I put together but no event

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.939 
drive that I put together but no event
just<00:00:30.990> want<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> show<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> some<00:00:31.590> interesting

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
just want to show you some interesting

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:41.410 
just want to show you some interesting
effects<00:00:34.730> using<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.790> Neos<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> depending<00:00:38.969> upon

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.100 

its<00:00:42.420> position<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.260> definitely<00:00:43.469> dial<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
its position we can definitely dial in a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.700 
its position we can definitely dial in a
differential<00:00:46.110> effect<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.670> plasma<00:00:48.710> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
differential effect on the plasma and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.729 
differential effect on the plasma and
again<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.480> magnetic<00:00:52.760> effect<00:00:54.559> it's<00:00:55.559> rather

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
again this magnetic effect it's rather

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.069 
again this magnetic effect it's rather
fascinating<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> planar<00:00:58.469> form

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
fascinating and in the planar form

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.619 
fascinating and in the planar form
appearing<00:01:01.309> quite<00:01:02.309> fractal<00:01:02.879> they're<00:01:03.480> gonna

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
appearing quite fractal they're gonna

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.090 
appearing quite fractal they're gonna
not<00:01:04.019> able<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.939> really<00:01:06.020> focus<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.409> well<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
not able to really focus as well and the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.320 
not able to really focus as well and the
detail<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.670> see<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> bare

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
detail that you can see with that bare

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
detail that you can see with that bare
eye<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:10.260> suffice<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> say<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:11.100> by<00:01:11.220> doing

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
eye but suffice to say just by doing

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
eye but suffice to say just by doing
that<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.930> how<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.080> culminates<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that you can see how it culminates the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.350 
that you can see how it culminates the
plasma<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.909> move<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> ever<00:01:18.150> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
plasma and if I just move it ever so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.420 
plasma and if I just move it ever so
slightly<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.740> field<00:01:23.009> lines<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:24.210> affected<00:01:24.600> so

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
slightly the field lines are affected so

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.249 
slightly the field lines are affected so
but<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> field<00:01:26.700> lines<00:01:26.880> are<00:01:27.000> constraining<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
but the field lines are constraining and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.130 
but the field lines are constraining and
accommodating<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.729> plasma<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:33.140> again

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
accommodating the plasma so again

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.910 
accommodating the plasma so again
depending<00:01:34.259> upon<00:01:35.119> which<00:01:36.119> way<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:36.920> good

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
depending upon which way we get good

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.499 
depending upon which way we get good
lines<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.369> produce<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.820> whole<00:01:39.090> slew<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
lines we can produce a whole slew of

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.980 
lines we can produce a whole slew of
different<00:01:40.250> radiating<00:01:41.250> effects

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.190 

that's<00:01:45.990> vice<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.380> say<00:01:47.659> it<00:01:48.659> will<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.840> very

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's vice to say it will be very

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.569 
that's vice to say it will be very
fascinating<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> larger<00:01:51.720> variant<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.229> made

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
fascinating and a larger variant is made

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.770 
fascinating and a larger variant is made
able<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> larger<00:01:54.540> magnetic

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
able to do this with a larger magnetic

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
able to do this with a larger magnetic
field<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.590> thought<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> might<00:01:56.159> find<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
field so I thought you might find this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.530 
field so I thought you might find this
interesting

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.109 

just<00:02:00.540> another<00:02:01.310> indicator<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.579> me<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.820> far<00:02:03.030> as

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
just another indicator to me as far as

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.200 
just another indicator to me as far as
what<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.450> capacity<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:04.820> magnetism<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
what the capacity for magnetism and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
what the capacity for magnetism and
plasma<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> interaction<00:02:07.350> between<00:02:07.670> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
plasma in the interaction between the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.230 
plasma in the interaction between the
two<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
two and

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.590 
two and
where<00:02:11.240> am<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.450> go<00:02:11.600> have<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> great<00:02:12.380> team
