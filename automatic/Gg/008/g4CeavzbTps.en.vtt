00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
wires that are on the side of well I'll

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.000 
wires that are on the side of well I'll
just<00:00:33.660> start<00:00:33.989> screen<00:00:34.230> grab<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.710> guys<00:00:34.800> know

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
just start screen grab up you guys know

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610 
just start screen grab up you guys know
that<00:00:35.040> works<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.960> lines<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.170> wires<00:00:37.350> were

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that works but lines and wires were

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.260 
that works but lines and wires were
probably<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.520> their<00:00:38.670> version<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
probably with their version of the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.660 
probably with their version of the
marionette<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:40.559> there's<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> couple<00:00:41.399> issues

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
marionette now there's a couple issues

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.190 
marionette now there's a couple issues
with<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.510> I'll<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.840> those<00:00:42.960> right

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
with this and I'll get to those right

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
with this and I'll get to those right
now<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:44.219> issues<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.760> number<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
now the issues with that number one is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.270 
now the issues with that number one is
we<00:00:45.629> don't<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.649> marionette<00:00:47.129> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
we don't know that the marionette is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.950 
we don't know that the marionette is
even<00:00:47.550> around<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.030> five<00:00:48.270> nights<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.690> Freddy's<00:00:48.930> 3

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
even around in five nights at Freddy's 3

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590 
even around in five nights at Freddy's 3
we<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.379> assume<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:51.120> haven't<00:00:51.270> seen

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
we can assume so but we haven't seen

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
we can assume so but we haven't seen
them<00:00:51.750> I'll<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> video<00:00:53.100> covering<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
them I'll make a video covering the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.130 
them I'll make a video covering the
other<00:00:53.820> animatronics<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.629> five<00:00:54.809> nights<00:00:55.020> at

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
other animatronics and five nights at

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
other animatronics and five nights at
Freddy's<00:00:55.379> 3<00:00:55.610> probably<00:00:56.610> two<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:56.850> three<00:00:57.030> days

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
Freddy's 3 probably two or three days

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.630 
Freddy's 3 probably two or three days

to watch this one but I don't know guys
we<00:01:03.300> really<00:01:03.539> haven't<00:01:03.899> seen<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> marionette<00:01:04.589> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
we really haven't seen the marionette it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.399 
we really haven't seen the marionette it
could<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.159> burned<00:01:05.780> we<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:07.170> it's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
could be burned we don't know it's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.890 
could be burned we don't know it's
really<00:01:07.590> happened<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.420> we<00:01:09.420> don't<00:01:09.540> even<00:01:09.750> know

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
really happened to it we don't even know

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
really happened to it we don't even know
if<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.409> around<00:01:10.740> anymore<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
if it's around anymore and if it is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
if it's around anymore and if it is
there's<00:01:12.720> no<00:01:13.020> guarantee<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.920> been

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
there's no guarantee that it's been

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
there's no guarantee that it's been
withered<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.729> bad<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> point<00:01:15.450> where<00:01:15.869> its

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
withered that bad to the point where its

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.370 
withered that bad to the point where its
arms<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.500> shredded<00:01:17.270> we<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:19.350> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
arms are shredded we do also know that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.700 
arms are shredded we do also know that
the<00:01:20.040> marionette<00:01:20.670> had<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.450> probably<00:01:22.439> had

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the marionette had to have probably had

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.499 
the marionette had to have probably had
an<00:01:22.860> endoskeleton<00:01:23.310> considering<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> fact

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
an endoskeleton considering the fact

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.850 
an endoskeleton considering the fact
that<00:01:24.659> foam<00:01:25.590> guy<00:01:25.830> did<00:01:26.189> say<00:01:26.430> officially<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.860> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that foam guy did say officially in a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859 
that foam guy did say officially in a
phone<00:01:29.280> call<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> second<00:01:30.299> game<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
phone call for the second game that it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.260 
phone call for the second game that it
is<00:01:30.990> animatronic<00:01:31.740> animatronic<00:01:32.340> 72<00:01:32.759> skeletons

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
is animatronic animatronic 72 skeletons

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.149 
is animatronic animatronic 72 skeletons
thus<00:01:33.600> meaning<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> marionette<00:01:34.920> would

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
thus meaning that the marionette would

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.929 
thus meaning that the marionette would
have<00:01:35.280> had<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.759> contain<00:01:36.570> an<00:01:36.750> endoskeleton<00:01:37.290> so

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
have had to contain an endoskeleton so

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.450 
have had to contain an endoskeleton so
what<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.119> assume<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.720> all<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
what can we assume from all this if you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.710 
what can we assume from all this if you
analyze<00:01:41.820> five<00:01:42.030> nights<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.450> Freddy's<00:01:42.689> 2

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
analyze five nights at Freddy's 2

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
analyze five nights at Freddy's 2
there's<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.409> animatronic<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.549> has

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
there's one animatronic that has

animatronic<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.709> haven't<00:02:10.950> seen<00:02:11.160> any<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
animatronic we haven't seen any of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.880 
animatronic we haven't seen any of
and<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.390> likely<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.930> her<00:02:13.319> parts<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.800> been

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and it's likely that her parts have been

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.530 
and it's likely that her parts have been
used<00:02:14.130> somewhere<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.910> add<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
used somewhere just to add to the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.559 
used somewhere just to add to the
creepiness<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:17.160> horror<00:02:17.580> attraction

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
creepiness of the horror attraction

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.500 
creepiness of the horror attraction
because<00:02:19.380> we<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.709> know<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.360> place<00:02:21.360> is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
because we do know that place is

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.510 
because we do know that place is
supposed<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.870> be<00:02:21.959> decently<00:02:22.350> scary<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:23.069> putting

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
supposed to be decently scary of putting

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.370 
supposed to be decently scary of putting
wires<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.390> spot<00:02:24.660> would<00:02:24.840> definitely<00:02:25.230> give

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
wires on that spot would definitely give

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.710 
wires on that spot would definitely give
it<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> little<00:02:25.740> bit<00:02:25.920> more<00:02:26.040> atmosphere<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.880> I

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
it a little bit more atmosphere and I

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.180 
it a little bit more atmosphere and I
think<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.050> definitely<00:02:28.560> something<00:02:28.739> creative

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
think it's definitely something creative

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.860 
think it's definitely something creative
to<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.459> considering<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.239> fact<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.569> we

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
to do considering the fact that we

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.949 
to do considering the fact that we
haven't<00:02:31.080> seen<00:02:31.440> chica<00:02:31.830> yet<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.569> we<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.720> assume

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
haven't seen chica yet so we can assume

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.120 
haven't seen chica yet so we can assume
that<00:02:34.110> she<00:02:34.260> scrapped<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:34.950> all<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
that she scrapped just like all the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.770 
that she scrapped just like all the
other<00:02:35.340> ones<00:02:35.580> are<00:02:35.760> being<00:02:35.850> used<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.390> some<00:02:36.600> sort

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
other ones are being used in some sort

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.570 
other ones are being used in some sort
of<00:02:36.840> weird<00:02:36.959> way<00:02:37.170> anyways<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.250> want<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.489> see
