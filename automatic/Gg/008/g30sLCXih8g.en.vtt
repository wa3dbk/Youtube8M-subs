Primus pot slash kettle I eat out of
this<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> spout<00:00:23.970> there<00:00:24.300> here's

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
this as well for the spout there here's

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.730 
this as well for the spout there here's
the<00:00:25.050> top<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:26.960> guess<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.109> could<00:00:28.260> eat<00:00:28.289> out<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the top I guess I could eat out of that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.160 
the top I guess I could eat out of that
but<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:29.189> cheap<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:31.380> handles

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
but it's really cheap and the handles

for the $8 us that I paid for it that's

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.140 
for the $8 us that I paid for it that's
steel<00:01:03.199> these<00:01:04.199> slide<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:08.150> those

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
steel these slide out like so and those

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.620 
steel these slide out like so and those
flip<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.470> give<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> more<00:01:11.119> space<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
flip out to give you more space for the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.890 
flip out to give you more space for the
pot<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.490> an<00:01:14.909> electric<00:01:16.009> spark<00:01:17.009> II<00:01:17.369> thing

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
pot it has an electric spark II thing

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.620 
pot it has an electric spark II thing
like<00:01:18.900> electric<00:01:19.830> starter<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> let's<00:01:23.509> put<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
like electric starter so let's put it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.920 
like electric starter so let's put it
onto<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.020> fuel<00:01:25.640> now<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.000> website<00:01:27.540> does<00:01:27.780> not

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
onto the fuel now the website does not

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.620 
onto the fuel now the website does not
tell<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> how<00:01:28.439> many<00:01:28.470> BTUs<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:35.630> we'll

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
tell you how many BTUs this is so we'll

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
tell you how many BTUs this is so we'll
see<00:01:36.810> how<00:01:36.869> long<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.290> takes<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> boil<00:01:37.890> we'll<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
see how long it takes to boil we'll do a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.830 
see how long it takes to boil we'll do a
half<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.119> liter<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.420> water<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:43.700> here's<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.119> half

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
half a liter of water so here's the half

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.980 
half a liter of water so here's the half
liter<00:01:46.170> water<00:01:47.210> I'm<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.450> start<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> out

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
liter water I'm going to start it out

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.060 
liter water I'm going to start it out
first<00:01:49.470> so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.910 

here's<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.250> fuel<00:01:56.860> regulator<00:01:59.500> so<00:02:00.500> we're<00:02:00.830> gonna

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
here's the fuel regulator so we're gonna

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.440 
here's the fuel regulator so we're gonna
turn<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.729> on<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:03.440> here<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.740> gas<00:02:03.920> coming<00:02:04.250> out

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
turn it on and here the gas coming out

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.020 
turn it on and here the gas coming out
and<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.659> starts<00:02:06.080> anything<00:02:06.800> one<00:02:07.549> shot<00:02:10.030> buck

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
and it starts anything one shot buck

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.949 
and it starts anything one shot buck
never<00:02:11.810> dope<00:02:12.489> so<00:02:13.489> let's<00:02:14.000> fill<00:02:14.239> up<00:02:14.390> my<00:02:14.630> water

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
never dope so let's fill up my water

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.190 
never dope so let's fill up my water
container<00:02:15.890> with<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.520> half<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.150> liter<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.540> water

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.509 

put<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.350> onto<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> stove<00:02:24.160> once<00:02:25.160> we'll<00:02:25.340> crank

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
put it onto the stove once we'll crank

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.380 
put it onto the stove once we'll crank
it<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.760> full<00:02:28.330> its<00:02:29.330> noisy

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
it on full its noisy

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.900 
it on full its noisy
but

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.510 

pull<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.330> off

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.210 

and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:52.930 

keep<00:02:43.610> an<00:02:43.730> eye<00:02:43.880> on

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.500 

okay<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:53.660> it's<00:02:54.110> been<00:02:54.320> two<00:02:54.680> minutes<00:02:54.910> 45<00:02:55.910> seconds

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
okay so it's been two minutes 45 seconds

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.060 
okay so it's been two minutes 45 seconds
and<00:02:56.870> we<00:02:57.590> have<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:59.140> rolling<00:03:00.140> boil<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:03.710> shut<00:03:03.920> this

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
and we have a rolling boil to shut this

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.060 
and we have a rolling boil to shut this
off

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.980 

so<00:03:10.070> 2<00:03:10.130> minutes<00:03:10.550> 45<00:03:10.820> seconds<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.750> boil<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:14.030> half<00:03:14.900> a

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
so 2 minutes 45 seconds to boil a half a

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.700 
so 2 minutes 45 seconds to boil a half a
liter<00:03:16.480> half<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.510> liter<00:03:17.750> water<00:03:17.960> actually<00:03:18.530> a

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
liter half a liter water actually a

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.540 
liter half a liter water actually a
little<00:03:18.890> bit<00:03:18.980> more<00:03:19.100> than<00:03:19.190> half<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> liter

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
little bit more than half a liter

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.790 
little bit more than half a liter
because<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.820> had<00:03:19.970> put<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.270> to<00:03:20.420> 600<00:03:20.660> milliliters

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.510 

really<00:03:24.800> true<00:03:25.130> test<00:03:25.550> because<00:03:26.000> I'm<00:03:26.180> inside<00:03:27.520> you
