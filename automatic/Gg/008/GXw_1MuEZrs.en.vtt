three times a week but from 16 to 17
right<00:00:27.730> till<00:00:27.970> now<00:00:28.119> has<00:00:28.390> been<00:00:28.600> the<00:00:28.720> exact<00:00:28.930> same

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
right till now has been the exact same

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.439 
right till now has been the exact same
certainly<00:00:30.130> one<00:00:30.310> body<00:00:30.550> part<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.940> day<00:00:31.119> sometimes

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
two but that's it you so I think that if

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.209 
two but that's it you so I think that if
that's<00:00:34.510> what<00:00:34.629> he's<00:00:34.809> asking<00:00:34.989> us<00:00:35.379> Li<00:00:35.680> which<00:00:35.890> we
