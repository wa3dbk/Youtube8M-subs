just going to leave plane so they're

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.540 
just going to leave plane so they're
going<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.259> go<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.560> fridge<00:02:08.740> channel<00:02:09.040> 4<00:02:09.220> 30

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
going to go in the fridge channel 4 30

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.340 
going to go in the fridge channel 4 30
minutes<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.210> when<00:02:10.600> they<00:02:10.690> come<00:02:10.869> out<00:02:10.899> we'll<00:02:11.200> see

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
minutes and when they come out we'll see

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.770 
minutes and when they come out we'll see
how<00:02:11.530> they<00:02:11.650> turn<00:02:11.830> out<00:02:11.890> when<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.100> slice<00:02:12.340> up<00:02:12.780> okay

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
how they turn out when I slice up okay

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.060 
how they turn out when I slice up okay
so<00:02:13.840> I've<00:02:14.080> taken<00:02:14.290> them<00:02:14.440> out<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> fridge<00:02:14.860> now

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
so I've taken them out of the fridge now

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.160 
so I've taken them out of the fridge now
it's<00:02:15.250> been<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.580> half<00:02:15.820> hour<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.780> said<00:02:17.020> get

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
it's been about a half hour it said get

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.600 
it's been about a half hour it said get
it<00:02:17.260> 20<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.620> 30<00:02:17.860> minutes<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.580> have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
it 20 to 30 minutes then you just have

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.640 
it 20 to 30 minutes then you just have
to<00:02:18.730> cut<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:18.940> into<00:02:19.120> slices

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.470 

which<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.220> apparently<00:02:26.459> easier<00:02:27.030> said<00:02:27.299> than

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
which is apparently easier said than

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.869 
which is apparently easier said than
done<00:02:31.909> that<00:02:32.909> caramel<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.750> really<00:02:34.409> hard<00:02:34.879> okay

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
done that caramel is really hard okay

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.369 
done that caramel is really hard okay

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
that's the first one and the caramels

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.369 
that's the first one and the caramels
knots<00:02:37.650> really<00:02:38.040> sticking<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> Apple

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
knots really sticking in the Apple

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.949 
knots really sticking in the Apple
that's<00:02:40.379> not<00:02:40.650> going<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.890> be<00:02:40.950> good<00:02:41.099> for<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
that's not going to be good for this

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:59.950 
that's not going to be good for this
this<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.140> not<00:02:43.349> good<00:02:43.409> at<00:02:43.950> all<00:02:44.150> okay

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.630 

yeah<00:03:00.960> now<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.500> one<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.770> snap<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.070> apple
