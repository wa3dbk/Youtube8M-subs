00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello, I'm a doctor to come to the kitchen 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.210
 for everyone today we are going to make churros 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.830
 fillings or nutella rolls and for 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.170
 Do it as you need the following 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.599
 ingredients a slice of bread 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.510
 mold for each roll in my case are 6 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.970
 to which I have removed the edges 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.950
 a teaspoon of cocoa butter and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.950
 hazelnuts as nutella can be 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.190
 every roll 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.490
 an egg 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.860
 a splash of milk to fry the 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.030
 let's use a little oil or 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.010
 butter and to coat the sugar and 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.320
 cinnamon to taste in my case is a 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.510
 teaspoon the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.520
 is to press the bread mold I'm going to 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.310
 do with a roller but you can do it 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.329
 with a glass or by hand 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.550
 [Music] 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.710
 and now let's move on to extend a 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 teaspoon of cocoa cream 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.440
 hazelnuts in each mold loaf well in 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.500
 this part only 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.980
 [Music] 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.920
 and we roll it up 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.380
 [Music] 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.380
 and so we will do with everyone once 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.900
 we have all the rites ready we beat 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.380
 the egg and we add the trickle of 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.280
 milk 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 and we mix it 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 a ready we passed the roll by the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.350
 mixture 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.810
 we take them out 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.490
 we suppose in a little dish and we are going to do 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.440
 the same with everyone once we have 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.990
 passed all the rolls by the egg 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.670
 we put oil in a pan we put it 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.750
 on a high heat and wait until 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.220
 be hot 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.470
 once hot we put it on fire 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.750
 medium and we're going to put all the rolls 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.940
 [Music] 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.340
 once placed we're going to wait for it 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.800
 brown once they are golden brown for this 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.030
 face let's go turning and dorando 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.030
 the other ways 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.310
 and once they are golden brown for all 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.310
 the faces we put out the fire and we take it out 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.530
 Now let's move on to mix the sugar 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.530
 with cinnamon 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.910
 and we passed the rolls by the mixture 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.910
 on the sides and around here 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.230
 and so we will do with everyone and we have 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.569
