start<00:02:23.819> up<00:02:23.940> our<00:02:24.030> Minecraft<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.740> then<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.100> goes

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
start up our Minecraft so then it goes

through<00:02:29.550> all<00:02:29.580> its<00:02:29.760> loading<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.600> use<00:02:30.750> this

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
through all its loading and I use this

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.199 
through all its loading and I use this
to<00:02:31.140> size<00:02:31.470> my<00:02:31.709> minecraft<00:02:31.920> better<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.730> actually

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
works quite well doing them so now you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.880 
works quite well doing them so now you
can<00:02:37.800> see<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.610> u<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.959> UI<00:02:40.170> has<00:02:40.620> been

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
can see that the u the UI has been

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.010 
can see that the u the UI has been
completely<00:02:41.220> overhauled<00:02:41.610> now<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:42.450> will<00:02:42.810> take

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
completely overhauled now we will take

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.740 
completely overhauled now we will take
it<00:02:43.170> back<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.890> other<00:02:44.100> clip<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.489> made<00:02:44.750> all

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
it back to the other clip we made all

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.670 
it back to the other clip we made all
right<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.050> now<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.350> have<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.530> mod

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
now one thing it is not compatible with

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.840 
now one thing it is not compatible with
completely<00:03:40.590> yet<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.010> theme<00:03:41.610> maker

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
completely yet and the theme maker

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.340 
completely yet and the theme maker
himself<00:03:41.940> has<00:03:42.269> said<00:03:42.450> he<00:03:42.600> was<00:03:42.750> working<00:03:43.109> on<00:03:43.200> this

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
himself has said he was working on this

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.069 
himself has said he was working on this
is<00:03:43.700> Optifine<00:03:44.700> settings<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.720> when<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.900> go<00:03:45.959> into

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079

is Optifine settings so when you go into
video<00:03:46.350> settings<00:03:46.769> you'll<00:03:46.950> notice<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.519> all

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
video settings you'll notice that it all

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.780 
video settings you'll notice that it all
goes<00:03:47.880> back<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.359> how<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.690> normally<00:03:48.840> looks

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
goes back to how it normally looks

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.979 
goes back to how it normally looks
especially<00:03:50.790> when<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.239> go<00:03:51.359> into<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.630> specific

photo video picture editing knowledge in
order<00:06:25.300> to<00:06:25.420> do<00:06:25.600> that

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
order to do that

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.980 
order to do that
as<00:06:26.650> far<00:06:26.950> as<00:06:26.980> I've<00:06:27.280> tested<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.150> does<00:06:28.360> not<00:06:28.660> work

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
as far as I've tested it does not work

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.840
