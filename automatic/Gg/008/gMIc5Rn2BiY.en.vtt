Personality and Social Psychology and
basically<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.320> study<00:00:10.559> looked<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.219> determine

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
basically the study looked to determine

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.560 
basically the study looked to determine
how<00:00:12.360> rich<00:00:12.780> people<00:00:12.809> view<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.889> world<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.570> I

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
how rich people view the world and I

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.040 
how rich people view the world and I
mean<00:00:15.750> they<00:00:15.870> kind<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.440> posed<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> basic

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
mean they kind of posed the basic

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.070 
mean they kind of posed the basic
question<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.730> think<00:00:21.060> your<00:00:21.240> success<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
question do you think your success is

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.210 
question do you think your success is
based<00:00:22.470> more<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:22.800> nature<00:00:23.670> or<00:00:24.300> nurture<00:00:25.099> it's<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
based more on nature or nurture it's the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
based more on nature or nurture it's the
old<00:00:26.939> question<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.630> used<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> debate

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
old question I know we used to debate

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
old question I know we used to debate
that<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.529> high<00:00:29.519> school<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.820> also<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.570> college

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
that in high school and also in college

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.600 
that in high school and also in college
in<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.410> psychology<00:00:31.769> class<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.430> it's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
in my psychology class and I think it's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.639 
in my psychology class and I think it's
a<00:00:32.640> rather<00:00:32.790> interesting<00:00:33.059> debate<00:00:33.530> but<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
a rather interesting debate but the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.040 
a rather interesting debate but the
findings<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.640> are

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
findings of this I think are

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.630 
findings of this I think are
unsurprising<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.829> also<00:00:37.980> shows<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
unsurprising but it also shows you that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.729 
unsurprising but it also shows you that
one<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> main<00:00:39.510> stereotypes<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> rich

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
one of the main stereotypes of the rich

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.490 
one of the main stereotypes of the rich
is<00:00:41.899> totally<00:00:42.899> true<00:00:43.430> they<00:00:44.430> say<00:00:44.460> quote

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
is totally true they say quote

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.290 
is totally true they say quote
upper-class<00:00:46.500> individuals<00:00:47.309> were<00:00:47.760> more<00:00:48.059> likely

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
upper-class individuals were more likely

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.779 
upper-class individuals were more likely
to<00:00:48.600> endorse<00:00:48.989> beliefs<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.860> social<00:00:50.309> class<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
to endorse beliefs that social class is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.260 
to endorse beliefs that social class is
an<00:00:51.059> inherent<00:00:51.860> stable<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.270> biologically

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
an inherent stable and biologically

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.470 
an inherent stable and biologically
determined<00:00:54.559> thing<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:56.699> richer<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.270> more

educated a person was the more that he

he attributed his being upper-class to

turned out to be the best golfer in the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.910 
turned out to be the best golfer in the
world<00:02:30.700> if<00:02:31.360> his<00:02:31.720> father<00:02:31.900> didn't<00:02:32.290> do<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
world if his father didn't do that and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.320 
world if his father didn't do that and
didn't<00:02:33.310> teach<00:02:33.490> him<00:02:33.610> all<00:02:33.760> these<00:02:33.880> things<00:02:33.940> it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
didn't teach him all these things it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.690 
didn't teach him all these things it
didn't<00:02:34.570> instill<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.020> belief<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.470> him<00:02:35.700> who

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
didn't instill this belief in him who

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.220 
didn't instill this belief in him who
knows<00:02:36.910> where<00:02:37.120> he'd<00:02:37.300> be<00:02:37.450> probably<00:02:37.930> wouldn't<00:02:38.170> be

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
knows where he'd be probably wouldn't be

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.330 
knows where he'd be probably wouldn't be
the<00:02:38.320> best<00:02:38.470> golfer<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.890> world<00:02:39.040> so

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the best golfer in the world so

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.890 
the best golfer in the world so
obviously<00:02:39.790> your<00:02:40.000> environment<00:02:40.450> helps<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
obviously your environment helps you and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.690 
obviously your environment helps you and
obviously<00:02:41.020> nature<00:02:41.500> plays<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.710> part<00:02:41.980> too<00:02:42.190> but

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
obviously nature plays a part too but

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.640 
obviously nature plays a part too but
see<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.630> why<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.810> pisses<00:02:44.500> me<00:02:44.620> off

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
see and this is why this pisses me off

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.030 
see and this is why this pisses me off
the<00:02:45.100> findings<00:02:45.460> of<00:02:45.550> this<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.770> hard

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
the findings of this it's not that hard

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.130 
the findings of this it's not that hard
to<00:02:48.310> realize<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.910> obvious<00:02:49.420> truth<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.960> not

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
to realize the obvious truth that not

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.170 
to realize the obvious truth that not
everything<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:51.040> meritocracy<00:02:51.790> not

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
everything is a meritocracy not

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.820 
everything is a meritocracy not
everything<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.540> biologically<00:02:53.050> driven<00:02:53.200> but

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
everything is biologically driven but

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.240 
everything is biologically driven but

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
it's all my biology it's got nothing to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.890 
it's all my biology it's got nothing to
do<00:03:06.610> with<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.820> fact<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.270> was<00:03:07.420> born<00:03:07.600> with<00:03:07.750> a
