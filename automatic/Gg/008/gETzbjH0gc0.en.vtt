 hello to all three planet friends are 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.960
 francesco and today i'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.090
 install a glass film on the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.139
 our new iphone 6 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.440
 I remember our links www.treccani.it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.140
 our ebay store 3 planet dash 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.640
 florence where you can find the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.750
 film instead of working with oneself and for 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.760
 other products 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.039
 specifically iphone 6 at a cost of 9 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.720
 euro as you see this film in 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.529
 glass presented in the center package 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.529
 a film itself 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.890
 here it is, there is also a kit for the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.890
 cleaning 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:51.210
 here we have two separate envelopes la 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.110
 first the number one with a cloth 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.870
 moistened to clean the surface well 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.340
 especially from grease and oil residues 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.710
 so to make the second adhere better 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 to dry to speed we have 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 already done this step then 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 we're just going to apply the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.689
 film these films the difference 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.689
 of the traditional ones have only one 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.369
 screen protector to remove that one 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.159
 in the lower part that will go to 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.159
 contact with our display then 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:33.270
 one last clean remove the film 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.810
 not completely not touching 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.450
 obviously the lower part 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.750
 we position the first from above 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.150
 centering the speaker hole e 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.000
 camera 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:53.420
 gently we go to support the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.420
 slide 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:14.730
 removing the screen protector as 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:20.010
 see the film applies by itself 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:29.670
 without leaving any halo or bubble here 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:33.410
 crush ready thanks thank you 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.410
