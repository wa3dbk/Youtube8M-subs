00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hey and welcome here at kicker.de 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.970
 today the 1800 euro gamer pc as 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.670
 processor of intel core i7 49 30 km with 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.030
 a basic rate of 3.4 ghz and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.740
 a clocking of 3.9 ghz at 6 kg and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.660
 threads, this processor offers one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.430
 very good performance both for current 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.960
 games as well as for demanding video 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.210
 editing by the current 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.660
 manufacturing process of 22 nanometers 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.519
 a tdp of 130 watts is reached 1 12 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
 megabyte large l3-cache joins 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.690
 also on an intel hd graphics 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.460
 However, you have to do without a unit 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.960
 by that the processor designation can 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 This processor can be over the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
 freely adjustable multiplier whole 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.940
 just overclock 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.649
 this cpu will be in the box version 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.730
 delivered but this is not a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.890
 cooler included 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.020
 as a working memory corsa vengeance loud 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.850
 profile with a total of 16 gb 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
 storage capacity of one speed 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.460
 of 1,600 megahertz and the ten new ones 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.289
 latency times the 16 gb kit consisting of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.180
 Two memory modules allow one 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.070
 dual channel operation for optimum 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.809
 Connection through the low memory 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.880
 height can also be larger processor cooler 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.030
 be easily installed as a mainboard 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 the gigabyte x79 ud3 equipped with 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.710
 the 20 11 socket and the support 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.080
 of a maximum of 32 GB of RAM in the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.540
 channel mode for current graphics cards 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.150
 there are four pci express 3.0 ports 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.299
 available for an optional se resp 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.640
 crossfirex system for hard drives offers 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.799
 the ud 38 esata connections with the sata 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 2 and sata 3 standard peripheral 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.360
 Connections such as twice usb 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.549
 3.0 plan as well as hd audio are located 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.189
 in the area of ​​the housing a corsa 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.619
 tie 200r features this atx tower 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.329
 twice usb 3.0 microphone and 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.630
 Headphone jack on the friend and 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.880
 Two 120 mm fans are already ex works 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.829
 built one of each at the front and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 backside processor cooler with a 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.909
 maximum height of 16 cm and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.570
 graphics cards with a length of up to 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.710
 43 cm fit in the 200 r of course 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.329
 the housing is as always 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.710
 matter of taste and therefore you can too 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.610
 like to choose another 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.799
 as graphics card the gigabyte gtx 780 ti 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.619
 she offers a pci express 3.0 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.350
 connection 3 gb graphic memory and the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.810
 wind voßkühler configuration 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.480
 a basic clock of 1020 megahertz one 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.970
 384 bit memory interface as well as the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.490
 directx 11 support in the area 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.200
 twice dvi once hdmi and once 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.150
 Displayport connection for all common 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.830
 Monitor available this card 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.010
 Tells in games like Battlefield 4 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.110
 about 75 to 90 ps of course dependent 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.380
 from the settings made that 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.930
 power supply be a be quiet straight power e9 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.060
 With 580 watts this offers an 80 plus 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.400
 Gold certification so with one 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.020
 efficiency of up to 90 percent 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.870
 So the whole thing is also energy efficient 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.700
 a quiet 135 millimeter fan as well 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.410
 a part modular construction 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.080
 that means unneeded cables 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.970
 can easily be deducted 580 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.500
 Watts are also more than here 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.790
 sufficient for sufficient 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.410
 storage space is provided by the seagate 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.120
 barracuda with two terabytes 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.670
 storage capacity with one 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.580
 speed of 7200 revolutions per 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.830
 minute a 64 mb cache as well 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.120
 the sata 600 connection is this 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.710
 hard disk not only fast but 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.940
 also pleasantly quiet 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.530
 the samsung 840 pro 256 gb ssd serves as 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.240
 Disk for windows and programs 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.460
 with a reading speed of over 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.860
 550 mb second and one 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.540
 write speed of over 530 mb 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.280
 second is the waiting time of 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.170
 programs and feces shortened significantly 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.150
 Data generally does not benefit from 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.530
 a ssd and should therefore preferably 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.180
 on a classic hard drive 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.100
 The Alpenfoehn are stored 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.110
 matterhorns on the rack tower cooler 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.120
 the cpu even at maximum load 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.460
 permanently cows the heat sink consists 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.070
 made of 24 aluminum slats with one 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.560
 flag apply copper plate as well as 6 mm 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.080
 strong heatpipes the whole six times for 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.570
 optimal heat dissipation the two 120 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.030
 mm wing boost fans have one 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.500
 Speed ​​range from 500 to 1200 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.630
 turns per minute one 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.240
 Air flow rate of a maximum of 100 cubic meters 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.060
 the hour and generate a maximum of 23 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.950
 decibel both fans will be over a 4 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.840
 connected via pwm connection 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.010
 as an optical drive comes a lg 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.050
 ready for use 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.600
 this reads and burns everything with cd 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.460
 Unfortunately , blu rays does not do that and dvd 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.720
 that is what it should have been, thank you 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.940
 I would watch myself over 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.590
 a positive rating as well as an abo 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.130
 rejoice from you and then to the next 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.430
 times 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.430
 pure skin
