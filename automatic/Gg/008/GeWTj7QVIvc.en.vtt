00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.869
 group notice and all times and if it is 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 ridiculous guilty of music to the cities 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:21.409

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.409
 played 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.130
 yes yes yes good news but all the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.320
 producers tell me the same thing 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.330
 we are good but do not know us 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.580
 none but nobody 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.280
 instead it flies back to paci knows 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.190
 well everyone who likes 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.460
 too bad since even the easy 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.049
 bubbles of music yes but we understand 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.880
 as spectators they are the animals that 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.619
 look after my father, you're better right 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.909
 we continue solar in your garage not 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.970
 we will go anywhere 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.950
 we have to find ways to get into 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.200
 right mechanic we acted bonardo 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.569
 won bonzo i'm talking about 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.670
 advertising would take a campaign 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.380
 promotional stellar with the name of 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.430
 garages everywhere time and radio news 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.019
 estimated money where we find them 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.489
 okay it's not like i can always think of a 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.739
 all the pd has idea 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.480
 then everyone laughs 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.910
 we ask the jars for air with 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.069
 the positive energy and you sell it is 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.989
 now that he saw it better because the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.989
 let's see umberto on the internet like theirs 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.560
 garden as a good excuse but 9 of 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.360
 Internet 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.930
 We could open a site for free and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.510
 I arrive all over the world 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.239
 tucson's game is your guitar he knows 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:45.540
 I'll do that from the manager 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:47.370
 internet is an idea absolutely where 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.709
 I was going to say I just wanted to 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.109
 see if my band was ahead like me 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.599
 I put myself to work right away is one 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.000
 length you sure understand us something 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.519
 computer for toma sure I understand 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.590
 of computers as you get certain ideas 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.120
 maybe because this morning I found the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.120
 my mouse on the edge of the bathtub 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.560
 bettoni call objects to shave 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.689
 among other things, neither did you work 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.430
 You can't be my sister 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.430
 how I wish I had been rejected 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.400
 guys as I 'm a manager 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.139
 illuminated 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.549
 I thought it was right that everyone of 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.530
 you freely express your da 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.629
 about the purple site 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.209
 let's put a background with a rainbow of 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.599
 seven colors that blend together into 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.319
 a single embrace of peace in Rome 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.969
 next idea 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.639
 we could put some photos to say that 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:40.340
 we play but as you know trivial we must 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.959
 to distinguish ourselves to capture attention 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.420
 right my name is the photo of lucrezia that 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.610
 sunbathe in a bonzo swimsuit 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.560
 miss is neither lucrezie of maggie 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.090
 swimsuit 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.959
 oh well if you care we also put your own 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.970
 photo in bikini 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.530
 to me it sucks but the boys don't 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.870
 let us forget that first of all it is a 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.330
 so we put 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.550
 a background with a rainbow of seven 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.800
 colors that no traces of peace but no 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.120
 we put the mp3s of our songs but 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.250
 you're off the compression format 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.170
 that is, it creates as much cup 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.790
 second ability has a very bad quality 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.959
 audio put a photo of length that 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.239
 take in bathing suits 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.579
 that's your idea and then I am 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.680
 all with too many bitmap images 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.250
 mine guys we're not ours 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.860
 mm3 music just a link to the 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.200
 Estense cellar clearly with the plata 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.520
 in play and a rainbow of seven colors 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.830
 that merge in a manner 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.380
 you know what I tell you that you must race 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.060
 at least I go alone go go not 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:49.850
 I absolutely need no one up 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:49.850
 away well but now how soon is what 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:05:02.300

 gate and the race inscription is there 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.060
 no rainbow but certainly to be done 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.889
 to know on the net you have to intrigue the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.680
 great public but without making them understand 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.289

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.620
 cursed the garage site for 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.560
 that of a fat a distributor of 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.420

 I was looking for the garage band but a 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.979
 apparently they happened in the place 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.490
 mistaken 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:22.600
