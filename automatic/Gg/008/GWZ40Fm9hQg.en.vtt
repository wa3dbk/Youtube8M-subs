system Gina tell us about this g3 hi how
are<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> new<00:00:27.509> it's<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> RS

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
are you so we have the new it's the RS

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.820 
are you so we have the new it's the RS
800<00:00:29.240> unit<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:30.509> came<00:00:30.839> out<00:00:30.869> last<00:00:31.019> fall<00:00:31.589> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
800 unit which came out last fall and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.600 
800 unit which came out last fall and
now<00:00:32.580> it<00:00:32.730> comes<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.240> the<00:00:33.270> g3<00:00:33.960> gps<00:00:34.590> sensor<00:00:34.860> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
now it comes with the g3 gps sensor so

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.950 
now it comes with the g3 gps sensor so
it<00:00:35.640> really<00:00:36.059> becomes<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.570> complete

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
it really becomes the complete

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.410 
it really becomes the complete
multi-sport<00:00:37.620> training<00:00:38.040> system<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:39.149> any

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
runner so someone who's looking for

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
runner so someone who's looking for
diversity<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.829> their<00:00:46.949> training<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.550> looking

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
diversity in their training and looking

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
diversity in their training and looking
for<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.030> flexibility<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> speed

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
for that flexibility you can get a speed

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
for that flexibility you can get a speed
and<00:00:49.920> distance<00:00:50.010> measurement<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> g3

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and distance measurement with the g3

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.740 
and distance measurement with the g3
sensor<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.770> also<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.430> RS<00:00:53.760> 800<00:00:54.059> unit

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
sensor and then we also the RS 800 unit

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.319 
sensor and then we also the RS 800 unit
also<00:00:55.289> works<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.920> our<00:00:56.100> s3<00:00:56.640> stride<00:00:57.000> sensor

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
also works with our s3 stride sensor

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
also works with our s3 stride sensor
which<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.199> give<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> speed<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.980> distance

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
which will give you speed and distance

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.060 
which will give you speed and distance
but<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.090> measuring<00:01:00.690> your<00:01:01.469> stride<00:01:01.769> length

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
but it's measuring your stride length

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.170 
but it's measuring your stride length
and<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> give<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> running

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and it's going to give you running

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.299 
and it's going to give you running
cadence<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.320> you're<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> true<00:01:04.800> hardcore

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
cadence so if you're a true hardcore

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.610 
cadence so if you're a true hardcore
runner<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.330> stride<00:01:06.600> sensor<00:01:06.900> would<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.470> your

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
runner the stride sensor would be your

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.530 
runner the stride sensor would be your
choice<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.130> training<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.300> really

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
choice for training but if you're really

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
choice for training but if you're really
looking<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.200> diversity<00:01:10.620> and<00:01:10.830> flexibility<00:01:11.490> in

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
looking for diversity and flexibility in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
looking for diversity and flexibility in
your<00:01:11.610> training<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.420> you'd<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.870> go<00:01:12.930> with

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
your training then you'd want to go with

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.640 
your training then you'd want to go with
the<00:01:13.170> g3<00:01:13.680> gps<00:01:14.640> sons<00:01:14.880> now<00:01:15.210> how<00:01:15.540> does<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.960> GPS

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the g3 gps sons now how does this GPS

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.550 
the g3 gps sons now how does this GPS
sensor<00:01:17.040> work<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.730> with<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.810> watch<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.350> does

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
sensor work with with the watch and does

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.400 
sensor work with with the watch and does
it<00:01:19.820> does<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.850> actually<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.020> can

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
it does it actually you know can you can

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.170 
it does it actually you know can you can
you<00:01:22.530> map<00:01:22.800> you<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.460> take<00:01:23.730> take<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you map you know take take the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
you map you know take take the
coordinates<00:01:24.690> afterwards<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:25.440> say<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
coordinates afterwards and say this is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.790 
coordinates afterwards and say this is
where<00:01:26.190> I<00:01:26.220> ran<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:27.780> map<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
where I ran you can actually map but the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.750 
where I ran you can actually map but the
RS<00:01:29.130> 800<00:01:29.370> has<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:29.970> barometer<00:01:31.250> measurement<00:01:32.250> so

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
RS 800 has a barometer measurement so

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.970 
RS 800 has a barometer measurement so
you<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> altimeter<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.140> from<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
you get the altimeter and from that you

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.070 
you get the altimeter and from that you
can<00:01:35.160> download<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.880> into<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.480> our<00:01:36.600> protein

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
can download that into the our protein

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.930 
can download that into the our protein
or<00:01:37.230> five<00:01:37.380> software<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.160> from<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.910> can

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
or five software and from there you can

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.450 
or five software and from there you can
map<00:01:39.330> your<00:01:39.360> route<00:01:39.720> profile<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.920> from<00:01:41.130> purely

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
map your route profile but from purely

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.420 
map your route profile but from purely
from<00:01:41.670> an<00:01:41.760> altitude<00:01:42.210> standpoint<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.800> polar<00:01:44.160> is

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
from an altitude standpoint now polar is

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.330 
from an altitude standpoint now polar is
known<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.660> years<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.800> know<00:01:46.860> making<00:01:47.040> great

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340

yourself<00:03:43.720> from<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.410> know<00:03:44.500> running<00:03:44.800> into

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
yourself from you know running into

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.640 
yourself from you know running into
trees<00:03:45.430> or<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.209> know<00:03:46.360> focusing<00:03:47.200> on<00:03:47.380> actually

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
trees or you know focusing on actually

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.890 
trees or you know focusing on actually
working<00:03:48.489> out<00:03:48.640> well<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.060> great<00:03:49.239> thing<00:03:49.270> is<00:03:49.420> it's

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
working out well the great thing is it's

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.020 
working out well the great thing is it's
continuous<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:50.770> you<00:03:51.220> can<00:03:51.340> put<00:03:51.489> have<00:03:51.790> an<00:03:51.850> auto

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
continuous so you can put have an auto

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.160 
continuous so you can put have an auto
program<00:03:52.450> start<00:03:52.720> where<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.020> just

software and see exactly how you did on

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.490 
software and see exactly how you did on
your<00:04:13.150> word<00:04:13.360> aptly<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:13.750> in<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.200> software

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
your word aptly and in the software

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500 
your word aptly and in the software
itself<00:04:14.620> there's<00:04:15.130> four<00:04:15.519> different<00:04:15.549> graphs<00:04:16.330> you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
itself there's four different graphs you

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.039 
itself there's four different graphs you
can<00:04:16.690> have<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:17.229> heart<00:04:17.680> rate<00:04:17.830> graph<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.459> pace<00:04:18.729> chart

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
can have a heart rate graph a pace chart

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.840 
can have a heart rate graph a pace chart
timing<00:04:20.049> as<00:04:20.200> own<00:04:20.410> charts<00:04:20.919> so<00:04:21.489> there's<00:04:21.729> a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
timing as own charts so there's a

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.340 
timing as own charts so there's a
multiple<00:04:22.300> two<00:04:22.360> ways<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.540> can<00:04:22.750> view<00:04:23.260> the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
multiple two ways you can view the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.510 
multiple two ways you can view the
information<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:24.010> improve<00:04:24.310> your<00:04:24.430> running

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
information and improve your running

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.909 
information and improve your running
okay<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:25.240> that<00:04:25.540> takes<00:04:26.020> care<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.350> running<00:04:26.740> but

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
okay so that takes care of running but

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.130 
okay so that takes care of running but
as<00:04:27.070> we<00:04:27.250> said<00:04:27.490> it's<00:04:27.700> also<00:04:27.850> good<00:04:28.210> for<00:04:28.240> folks<00:04:28.990> who

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
as we said it's also good for folks who

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.050 
as we said it's also good for folks who
are<00:04:29.290> you<00:04:29.919> know<00:04:29.979> training<00:04:30.430> out<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.880> water

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
are you know training out on the water

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.719 
are you know training out on the water

which<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.550> going<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:39.700> give<00:04:39.940> you<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.330> smaller

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
which is going to give you a smaller

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.590 
which is going to give you a smaller
points<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.340> intersection<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.300> you're<00:04:43.479> in<00:04:43.540> a

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
points of intersection so you're in a

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.700 
points of intersection so you're in a
much<00:04:43.780> better<00:04:44.050> accuracy<00:04:44.260> of<00:04:44.440> measurement

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
much better accuracy of measurement

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.880 
much better accuracy of measurement
speeding<00:04:45.550> distance<00:04:45.940> as<00:04:46.180> far<00:04:46.810> as<00:04:46.870> altitude<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
speeding distance as far as altitude the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.650 
speeding distance as far as altitude the
wash<00:04:48.100> actually<00:04:48.550> has<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.700> very<00:04:49.180> much<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.330> pressure

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
wash actually has a very much a pressure

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.180 
wash actually has a very much a pressure
sensor<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.140> it<00:04:50.229> so<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.470> other<00:04:50.590> is<00:04:50.860> much<00:04:51.040> more

sensor in it so the other is much more

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.080 
sensor in it so the other is much more
accurate<00:04:51.580> than<00:04:51.729> some<00:04:51.880> of<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.000> other
