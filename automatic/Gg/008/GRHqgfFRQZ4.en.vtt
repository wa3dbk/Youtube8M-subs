00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
why our weekly videos look exactly the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.660 
why our weekly videos look exactly the
same<00:03:09.780> even<00:03:10.440> though<00:03:10.500> we<00:03:10.650> moved<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:10.950> Los<00:03:11.160> Angeles

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
same even though we moved to Los Angeles

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.430 
same even though we moved to Los Angeles
and<00:03:11.850> our<00:03:11.910> kitchen<00:03:12.269> set<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.660> exactly<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.260> same

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
and our kitchen set is exactly the same

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.410 
and our kitchen set is exactly the same
as<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.709> was<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:13.920> Oregon<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.880> reason<00:03:15.180> for<00:03:15.330> this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
as it was in Oregon the reason for this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.870 
as it was in Oregon the reason for this
is<00:03:15.480> because<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:16.110> taped<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.769> bunch<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:17.790> episodes

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
is because we taped a bunch of episodes

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.970 
is because we taped a bunch of episodes
before<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:18.989> moved<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:19.680> didn't<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:19.860> to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
before we moved so we didn't have to

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.890 
before we moved so we didn't have to
worry<00:03:20.070> about<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.790> during<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.480> filming<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
worry about that during the filming and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.020 
worry about that during the filming and
the<00:03:21.989> transitioning<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.459> can<00:03:23.580> still<00:03:23.850> share

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the transitioning so we can still share

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.120 
the transitioning so we can still share
weekly<00:03:24.390> content<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.049> guys<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.769> these
