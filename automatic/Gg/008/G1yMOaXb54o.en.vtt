00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.860 

first<00:00:54.910> we'll<00:00:55.090> trace<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:55.450> shape<00:00:55.480> of<00:00:55.840> your

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
first we'll trace the shape of your

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.170 
first we'll trace the shape of your
block<00:00:56.290> so<00:00:56.980> we<00:00:57.010> have<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.190> pattern<00:00:57.400> when<00:00:57.880> we<00:00:57.970> cut

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
block so we have a pattern when we cut

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:19.929 
block so we have a pattern when we cut
the<00:00:58.360> new<00:00:58.480> pin<00:00:58.690> block

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.059 

all<00:01:20.840> right<00:01:20.990> now<00:01:21.140> we've<00:01:21.350> got<00:01:21.499> the<00:01:21.619> pin<00:01:21.890> block

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
all right now we've got the pin block

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.429 
all right now we've got the pin block
cut<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:23.179> have<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.450> fit<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.929> to<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.229> other<00:01:24.350> side

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
cut you have to fit it to the other side

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.919 
cut you have to fit it to the other side
of<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.770> plate<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:25.420> we've<00:01:26.420> talked<00:01:26.719> to<00:01:26.840> the

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
of the plate so we've talked to the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.440 
of the plate so we've talked to the
underside<00:01:27.259> of<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.380> plate<00:01:27.649> so<00:01:28.159> we<00:01:28.189> can<00:01:28.450> see

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
underside of the plate so we can see

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.609 
underside of the plate so we can see
where<00:01:29.569> the<00:01:29.659> high<00:01:29.750> spots<00:01:30.049> are<00:01:30.229> on<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.439> pin

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
where the high spots are on the pin

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:47.300 
where the high spots are on the pin
watch

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.220 

we<00:01:48.310> didn't<00:01:48.520> sand<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.970> high<00:01:49.120> spots<00:01:49.480> anywhere

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
we didn't sand the high spots anywhere

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.770 
we didn't sand the high spots anywhere
there's<00:01:50.470> food<00:01:50.710> chalk<00:01:51.010> mark<00:01:51.340> test<00:01:52.210> fit<00:01:52.480> and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
there's food chalk mark test fit and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.600 
there's food chalk mark test fit and
sand<00:01:53.050> again<00:01:53.320> until<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:53.950> see<00:01:54.190> an<00:01:54.280> even

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
sand again until I see an even

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.550 
sand again until I see an even
distribution<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:55.420> blue<00:01:55.660> chalk<00:01:55.900> marks<00:01:56.260> across

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.990 

by<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.650> way<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.340> attempt<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.850> on

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
by the way do you know attempt this on

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:32.440 
by the way do you know attempt this on
your<00:02:09.150> piano<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.720> home

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.790 

next<00:02:33.450> we'll<00:02:33.540> mark<00:02:33.750> grill<00:02:34.080> locations<00:02:34.620> other

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
next we'll mark grill locations other

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
location of the tuning pin holes now we

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.130 
location of the tuning pin holes now we
only<00:03:12.280> have<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.519> drill<00:03:12.700> about<00:03:12.879> 230<00:03:13.569> holes<00:03:13.810> for

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
only have to drill about 230 holes for

only have to drill about 230 holes for
the<00:03:14.290> tuning<00:03:14.590> pins<00:03:40.680> now<00:03:41.680> we<00:03:41.739> can<00:03:41.950> start<00:03:42.099> fitting

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
the tuning pins now we can start fitting

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.129 
the tuning pins now we can start fitting
the<00:03:42.459> pin<00:03:42.579> block<00:03:42.700> unipi<00:03:43.209> now<00:03:43.329> so<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.959> plate

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
the pin block unipi now so the plate

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.750 
the pin block unipi now so the plate
will<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.409> in<00:03:44.470> exactly<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.040> same<00:03:45.099> position<00:03:45.370> it

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
will be in exactly the same position it

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.509 
will be in exactly the same position it
was<00:03:45.909> with<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.510> old<00:03:46.540> pin<00:03:46.840> block<00:03:47.079> our<00:03:48.069> first<00:03:48.310> fit

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
was with the old pin block our first fit

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.970 
was with the old pin block our first fit
of<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:48.700> pin<00:03:48.909> block<00:03:49.090> we<00:03:49.599> can<00:03:49.629> see<00:03:49.930> using<00:03:50.680> our
