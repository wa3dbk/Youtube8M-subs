00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 and how about youtube friends today I'm going 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.750
 to teach to play the song I love you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.000
 so much dv7 this song is a classic of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.920
 Mexican pop can not miss in our 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.389
 repertoire here I will teach them 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.059
 step by step to dominate 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.920
 perfectly this strum well let's go to 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 start with the song song is going to be 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.580
 necessary our capo fret and then 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.710
 positioned in what would be the first 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.010
 fret chords that we will use go 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.010
 to be 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.390
 real 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.270
 the least 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.579
 and two let's start with the strumming that 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.079
 is what gives the style to the song and 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.559
 well let's position our the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.559
 censors and we started 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.559
 ah 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.540
 ok here what we have to understand is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.610
 that we're going to make two soft features for 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.030
 each chord change because it's going to 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 explain little by little we start in sun 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.940
 we started a strum down and another one 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.130
 down we go back and to do the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.420
 change of chord we make two radios very 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.420
 soft and very fast 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.920
 okay 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.030
 here in re let's make a hard sea in 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.130
 what would be the first rope towards the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.440
 third fret 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.880
 in the second strum 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.880
 ok we are putting together the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.780
 really for re let's do the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.210
 quick strumming to switch to the chord 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.780
 of what would be the least 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780
 to 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.420
 and we're not going to do the same hammer and 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.099
 we are going to do this in what would be 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.030
 and this we are going to do in what would be 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.030
 the fourth string 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.819
 and it's the same in the second strum 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.700
 ok then he will do it again 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.120
 no no no 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.189
 ok this part is going to be our part of the 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.859
 Intro let's use the same strum 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.780
 and nothing else instead of 2 we're going to move on 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.129
 network for what would be the part of the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.129
 stanza we begin 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.850
 ok now let's start with what 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.130
 would be the part of the pre chorus we are going to 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.130
 use my ninth minor 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.940
 yes minor 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.440
 of the minor 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.440
 I will go 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.540
 all right 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.760
 and so comes what would be part of the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.769
 chorus for this we continue to use another 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.400
 strum we are going to position our 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.400
 fingers if the sun and we start 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400
 ah 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.079
 hey 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.710
 all right 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.910
 i 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.910
 Let's see 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:41.809
 and here would come what would be the part 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.809
 of the inter use the minor 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.010
 and then we will use again what 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.010
 that would be part of the intro ok 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.060
 ok and so the song keeps repeating itself 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.030
 cycles again either in that if they have 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.770

 form videos that go up to him 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:27.480

 all for today take care
