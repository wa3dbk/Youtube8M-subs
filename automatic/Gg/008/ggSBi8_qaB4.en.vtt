00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.320
 After this weekend the so-called bad 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.150
 Soden could already present and this 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.880
 thanks to a three-pack by tim mulfinger 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.070
 Also impressive was doing had the sv 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720
 follow suit and receive with the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.810
 sg ehrenberg also a right one 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.820
 Brocken edgar nix this time not 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.080
 even played from the beginning 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.080
 following eleven into the race 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.170
 alba lay in the gate in the defense basile 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 konietzny and was defensive midfield 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.670
 hasanovic and manns during 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.230
 offensive power coach for saints around 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.480
 morality were used 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.700
 and in the storm görner and kabel played 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.930
 at the sg ehrenberg took the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 hibernation the longest 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.430
 that's what robert schorstein's eleven were for 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.710
 the hotter with the first game 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.670
 Michael Geier was allowed a new entry of 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.250
 start at ran 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.430
 the start elf of the sg ehrenberg with röder 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.230
 in the gate you stand moritz shepherd wiegand 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 and marius shepherd formed the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.670
 defense chain new arrival geyer was with 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.930
 bread &amp; butter used in midfield 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.970
 and carel metzler formed the attack 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.740
 and off we go would be new on this 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.520
 Game would win the lead up 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.560
 the second 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.049
 Bad soden again amounts to three points 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.290
 and a guest victory would be Neuhof 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.270
 soden and ehrenberg point immediately after 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.159
 the impetus of the ehrenberger fought 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.110
 The new one is in front of the ball and captain 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.420
 radi Gorner missed after long to 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.540
 playing conet never honor berger 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.650
 just close 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.900
 wait a little later for the guests 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.009
 Note first thrusts in the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.829
 opposing half 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.840
 time and again it was johannes metzler the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.500
 over left tried the ball in front of the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.369
 europe box after one 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.159
 standard situation in the twelfth minute 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.140
 Moritz had shepherd the leadership of his 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.210
 teams on the foot but the ball went 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.740
 over the gate 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.490
 directly in connection with panic in the Ehrenberger 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 penalty area 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.079
 konietzny does not want a corner 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.909
 Customers find up to the ball on cables 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.079
 ends up with full force in the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.659
 ehrenberger defense row then shoots 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.910
 sudden pass from niklas saint in 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.099
 The point on rhade görner of the ball 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.110
 from well over 40 meters away 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.950
 Outrushing goalie lures into the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.170
 The 1 0 shoots shortly before the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.970
 Johann Wiegand tried half-time break 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.739
 even with a fallback compensation to 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.920
 achieve but hit the ball just to 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.810
 confesses and missed the gate as well 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.300
 passage one ended sat down 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.670
 passage two ford berenberg made 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.720
 continued pressure and came through 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.379
 Standards situations are dangerously close 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.739
 Gate in minute 57 was then only on 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.200
 handle 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.150
 Kabul sprints across right up to in 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.700
 the ehrenberger penalty area and put 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.530
 sent off on görner of the ball 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.590
 out of place on goal and thus the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.730
 Röders pushes in the other 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.989
 Spielverlauf gave the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.360
 nothing more 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.129
 it followed violent battles the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.940
 umpire leon rooms with a 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.550
 yellow card moved and after a foul 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.200
 As you know, a free kick follows suit 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.360
 niklas saint corrects the ball 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.310
 and worst of 17 meters the ball 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.459
 go past schlussmann röder 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.260
 ehrenberger gate the 2 0 in the 84 minute 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.209
 It stayed six minutes and Ehrenberg 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.400
 threw everything once again to the front 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.560
 Namely, good opportunities were yet 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.659
 always a new defender stood the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.330
 connecting hit away shortly before 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.730
 gambling initiated new radomir flac 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.069
 short and ran to honor gate 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.930
 But Schlussmann röder voted out 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.370
 his chest and made sure that himself 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.190
 of profit nothing changed 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.760
 So ended the game with 2 0 for the sv 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.379
 Neuhof from our point of view you have to say 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.690
 that was a bit unhappy 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.049
 because I think as neutral 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.610
 spectator I think that was difficult too 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.599
 say who today at the top of the table 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.129
 stands and who is in position three and 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.209
 The boys of us are passionate 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.640
 everyone has shown for the other 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.260
 We fought what we did 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.940
 we just wanted the little bit of luck from 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.970
 Tor has missed the last compelling 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.099
 action but otherwise to the conclusion 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.489
 again completely satisfied and have 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.470
 nothing was to blame for the first 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.650
 play very playfully for us too 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.600
 unfortunately not strong from our point of view 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.289
 was rewarded 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.850
 Guttenberg was expected heavy 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.419
 opponent as I imagined 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.550
 have 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.350
 I already have the boys before the game 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.729
 I'm trying to tune to that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.320
 must say ehrenberg was in the first 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.000
 half-time aggressive was better 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.100
 as well as we are well positioned 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.960
 I did not play that well in the front 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.940
 fallen also know happy 1 0 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.400
 by a rade patron in leadership 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.990
 not necessarily gone 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.910
 in which may have to pay 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.440
 one would have remained on the line 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.419
 half time I think synonymous relative 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.910
 balanced and then a bit 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.070
 More train to gate around gate had 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.660
 then think in the second half 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.800
 I then invested a bit more 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.200
 and I do not quite think so 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.550
 unfortunate then won 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.650
 ehrenberg also a few opportunities has 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.479
 in 16 and if one or the other things 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.889
 know more luck would have come then 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.370
 this will surely be another one 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.370
 very tight box 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.389
