hi I'm John from growing life London UK

urban<00:00:11.970> and<00:00:12.150> indoor<00:00:12.450> growing<00:00:12.690> specialists

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
urban and indoor growing specialists

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.350 
urban and indoor growing specialists
we're<00:00:14.220> here<00:00:14.430> to<00:00:14.580> talk<00:00:14.760> about<00:00:14.790> drying

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
we're here to talk about drying

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.750 
we're here to talk about drying
mushrooms<00:00:15.870> at<00:00:16.020> home<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:17.070> reason<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.550> dry

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
mushrooms at home the reason we dry

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.390 
mushrooms at home the reason we dry
mushrooms<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.140> keep<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.560> bacteria<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
mushrooms is to keep the bacteria and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.190 
mushrooms is to keep the bacteria and
microorganisms<00:00:20.820> from<00:00:21.600> growing<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
microorganisms from growing and

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.359 
microorganisms from growing and
basically<00:00:22.950> making<00:00:23.700> our<00:00:23.970> mushrooms<00:00:24.330> go<00:00:24.509> off

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
basically making our mushrooms go off

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.040 
basically making our mushrooms go off
when<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.460> dried<00:00:26.730> them<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.480> use<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
when we dried them we can use them for a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.560 
when we dried them we can use them for a
lot<00:00:28.230> longer<00:00:28.439> period<00:00:29.040> of<00:00:29.099> time<00:00:29.400> drying<00:00:30.390> them

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
lot longer period of time drying them

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.080 
lot longer period of time drying them
also<00:00:30.900> locks<00:00:31.169> in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> flavor<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.220> mushrooms

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
also locks in the flavor and mushrooms

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.680 
also locks in the flavor and mushrooms
that<00:00:33.240> have<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> very<00:00:33.780> intense<00:00:34.200> flavor<00:00:34.380> once<00:00:34.800> dry

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
that have a very intense flavor once dry

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
that have a very intense flavor once dry
drying<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.170> mushrooms<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.800> remove<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
drying the mushrooms will remove the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.490 
drying the mushrooms will remove the
moisture<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> dry

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
moisture and then we will have a dry

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560 
moisture and then we will have a dry
product<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.460> store<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:42.120> use

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
product that we can store or use

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.040 
product that we can store or use
immediately<00:00:43.550> when<00:00:44.550> drying<00:00:44.820> mushrooms<00:00:45.390> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
immediately when drying mushrooms you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.080 
immediately when drying mushrooms you
want<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> wash<00:00:46.500> them<00:00:46.740> thoroughly<00:00:47.090> removing

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
want to wash them thoroughly removing

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.550 
want to wash them thoroughly removing

placing them in a food dehydrator as
such<00:00:59.510> we<00:01:00.510> want<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> evenly<00:01:01.140> space<00:01:01.470> them<00:01:01.530> out

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
such we want to evenly space them out

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.690 
such we want to evenly space them out

are<00:01:27.509> two<00:01:27.659> varieties<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.289> we<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.799> dried<00:01:29.069> out

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
are two varieties that we have dried out

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.969 
are two varieties that we have dried out
as<00:01:29.520> many<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.240> them<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.509> poisonous<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.289> best<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
as many of them are poisonous is best to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
as many of them are poisonous is best to
check<00:01:32.189> which<00:01:32.579> variety<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.509> drying<00:01:33.780> out
