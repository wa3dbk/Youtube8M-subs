00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.400
 droid and we are in one more boxing in this 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.640
 occasion is what is the mechanical keyboard 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.890
 here 901 which was very very good that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.330
 I also bought it on your best since 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.950
 I recently broke this clear said 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.750
 I need a keyboard and the truth is that 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.150
 keyboard is very very good since it has 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 6 light modes before starting the booty 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.930
 attention does not have six modes of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.320
 different apart than all keys 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.699
 they have lights also have what is 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.379
 Fully programmable keys can be 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.550
 detaching and cleaning also has what 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.680
 which is a support for any system 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 operative without the need for disks or 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 nothing is more let's open it once 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.010
 to show you how the box works 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.860
 it's huge this is the box in which 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 comes does not bring this then nothing else 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.100
 it comes like that with pictures or anything like that is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.079
 a simple and good box here is 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.899
 can see the inside 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.429
 let's remove this and here is what 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.159
 is the keyboard the truth is a package 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.930
 very simple but it comes well protected already 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.790
 that brings cushions and everything was afraid that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.920
 I was breaking or something said I will not have 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.000
 the broken keyboards and well we have 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.950
 here what is the keyboard 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.720
 and these reach to see the keys of 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.460
 is it removed and inside the box 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.320
 we also have what is the usb cable 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.210
 that has a magnetic protection 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.340
 special as it says here in the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.350
 instructions and we also have what 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.300
 is a brush to clean it and the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.940
 tools to be able to detach it and 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.760
 open it and clean it easily one 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.619
 that we have what is the instructive in 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.500
 where he explains that they have six modes 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.580
 different light with the fn key more 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.530
 other keys that you see on the screen 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.390
 so saying that we are going to do the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.240
 plastic and let's try what 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.670
 it works for the moment that's how it goes 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.899
 watching with the lights on and you 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.450
 will pay what is light so that 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.630
 you reach to appreciate all the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.210
 lighting and other is a gamer keyboard 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.979
 so I said ok the truth that I was 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.320
 very very economical in yebes and I said 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.000
 I need to try it because then the truth 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.210
 I tell them my keyboard broke and this is 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.610
 of aluminum to mention 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.679
 it is solid is very heavy it is not 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.500
 feels like it's going to break easily 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.870
 the keys are very parents too 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.560
 They learn to teach how we learn 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.560
 the back 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.120
 does not have much on it is that what 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.739
 they are watching on screen 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.150
 and let's continue with what is the 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.310
 light test 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.230
 and one for this part of the review turn off 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.519
 what are the lights and connect it to what 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.530
 what is envy and the tablet so that 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.780
 see that your keyboard works on android 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.730
 on computers in birds wherever 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.739
 simply connect and ready not 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.239
 they need discs or drivers and nothing and 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.420
 as the instruction sheet says 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.230
 we occupy the key fn + delete the key 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.349
 define is below the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.680
 we selected more the key of was going to 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.590
 activate the lights program 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.890
 what good is it called let's see fn and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.659
 erase is what the flying dragon is 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.980
 called one of the six effects that it has 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.980
 let's activate it 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.329
 there is one of them to see and 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.890
 good also to see that it works 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.049
 while it is doing its light effect 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.829
 I'm walking what is minecraft without 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.829
 problem some 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.280
 they do not have any kind of anything and so 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.080
 has those uses that I loved 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.830
 quite the truth and another of the 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.230
 programs would be this one 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.920
 martins in this every key that 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.920
 select 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.050
 this is incredible criticism the truth 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.550
 loved it and well he's also using 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.110
 with the sketches vital but more than anything 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.370
 with my counted desk because it 's 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.590
 where I could not play that 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.930
 skyrim and minecraft all this then 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.160
 let's use another program that would be fn 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.160
 and peru 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.640
 although this program what it does is nothing 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.440
 more turn on you the typical keys to 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.320
 walk in any game that are these 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.320
 and well let's put what is efe n 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.050
 and well I liked that a lot because it 's 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.760
 like the little vibrator as I tell you 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.359
 keyboard works perfectly where 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.359
 want to try 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:30.130
 this is an offer in all offers 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.389
 which has been in yebes for it 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.310
 acquire everything I need for this 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.520
 that improve the channel this is state 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.169
 lately in plan so delay more 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.750
 that nothing the quality the channel does not and so 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.060
 see this orchestra as doing 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.100
 all the light show the keyboard which 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.070
 I love let's focus it 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.190
 directly there 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.780
 and they can see if it looks amazing 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.280
 the truth as I say are six focuses of 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.400
 lights fnyh em 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.780
 It is another more 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.080
 That's the one I also liked a lot 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.789
 because each key you select 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.789
 does this matter of 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.910
 the truth is very cool so nothing 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.830
 because despite everything by study after 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.780
 I liked gentlemen I know he's going to say 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.160
 monster detritus a boxing but I 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.660
 love this kind of things because they 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.820
 I say I want to share it with you already 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.400
 which are things that one wants to 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.580
 improve the channel then let's hope if 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.400
 already 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.259
 now I can play more but in the 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.780
 minecraft and skyteam and all this that 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.419
 game on keyboard and then also more than 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.550
 nothing this to be able to play again I started 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.930
 not that he missed quite a bit that and 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.340
 good either all perceived or has 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.199
 liked new the sense take care 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.090
 at the end comment or by villager 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.590
 so he says necessary that more in the end 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.590
 they take care and bye
