check what you did now you see your

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.860 
check what you did now you see your
problem<00:03:56.760> yo<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.180> you're<00:03:57.269> multiplying<00:03:57.480> our

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
problem yo and you're multiplying our

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.390 
problem yo and you're multiplying our
brackets<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.409> have<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.620> remember<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:59.099> you

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
brackets you have to remember you you

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.159 
brackets you have to remember you you
multiply<00:03:59.790> each<00:04:00.000> term<00:04:00.359> by<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.659> other<00:04:00.870> term

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
multiply each term by the other term

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:07.280 
multiply each term by the other term
right<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.680> you've<00:04:01.799> got<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.980> 7x<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:05.959> now<00:04:06.959> can<00:04:07.199> you

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
right so you've got a 7x and now can you

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.020 
right so you've got a 7x and now can you
take<00:04:07.500> your<00:04:07.650> her<00:04:07.769> butt<00:04:07.979> up<00:04:08.099> no<00:04:08.280> it's<00:04:08.430> not<00:04:08.519> 10x

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.360 

now<00:04:16.019> when<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.230> factorize<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.980> don't<00:04:17.220> be

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
now when you factorize and don't be

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.039 
now when you factorize and don't be
afraid<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.730> use<00:04:17.910> your<00:04:17.940> minus<00:04:18.390> B<00:04:18.540> plus<00:04:18.570> or<00:04:18.989> minus
