news that reminds us how messed up our
environment<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:15.150> but<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.540> week<00:00:15.750> let's<00:00:15.990> talk

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.689 
environment is but this week let's talk
about<00:00:16.379> something<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.859> thought<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.460> had

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
about something we thought we had

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.029 
about something we thought we had
started<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.359> fix<00:00:18.660> plastic<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.920> it

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
started to fix plastic you see it

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.529 
started to fix plastic you see it
everywhere<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.670> over<00:00:21.029> your<00:00:21.180> grocery

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
everywhere it's all over your grocery

everywhere it's all over your grocery
store<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> at<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> target<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.920> Walmart

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
store and at the target in the Walmart

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.029 
store and at the target in the Walmart
didn't<00:00:23.850> also<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.900> roadways<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.830> the

didn't also on the roadways and in the
water<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> problem<00:00:27.449> because

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
water and this is a problem because

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.580 
water and this is a problem because
plastic<00:00:27.960> doesn't<00:00:28.439> biodegrade

microorganisms can't eat plastic so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
microorganisms can't eat plastic so
those<00:00:41.550> grocery<00:00:41.969> bags<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.360> shampoo<00:00:42.840> bottles

that you throw away just hang out until

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
that you throw away just hang out until
they're<00:00:45.329> broken<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:45.660> by<00:00:46.020> heat<00:00:46.440> or<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> sun's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
ultraviolet radiation and that can take

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.660 
ultraviolet radiation and that can take
centuries<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:50.219> why<00:00:50.370> you've<00:00:50.520> probably

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
centuries that's why you've probably

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.279 
centuries that's why you've probably
started<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.660> things<00:00:51.899> made<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
started to see more things made of

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
started to see more things made of
biodegradable<00:00:52.559> plastic<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:54.120> usual

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
biodegradable plastic it's your usual

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.970 
biodegradable plastic it's your usual
run-of-the-mill<00:00:54.930> plastic<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.649> treated

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

with chemical additives that allow it to
biodegrade<00:00:58.260> faster<00:00:59.039> sounds<00:00:59.460> great<00:00:59.640> right

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
biodegrade faster sounds great right

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
began weakening rapidly in the 1970s

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.400 
began weakening rapidly in the 1970s
then<00:03:16.940> in<00:03:17.030> 1990<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.810> dipped<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.079> its<00:03:18.199> lowest

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
then in 1990 it dipped to its lowest

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.020 
then in 1990 it dipped to its lowest
point<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.919> more<00:03:19.040> than<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.220> millennium<00:03:19.400> it's

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
point in more than a millennium it's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.610 
point in more than a millennium it's
rebounded<00:03:20.269> slightly<00:03:20.540> since<00:03:21.019> then<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.440> it's

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
rebounded slightly since then but it's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.199 
rebounded slightly since then but it's
still<00:03:21.829> in<00:03:22.010> decline<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.669> the<00:03:22.760> researchers

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
still in decline and the researchers

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.759 
still in decline and the researchers
think<00:03:23.449> that<00:03:23.569> it's<00:03:23.690> all<00:03:23.840> due<00:03:24.109> to<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.379> rapid

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
think that it's all due to the rapid

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.559 
think that it's all due to the rapid
melting<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.370> Greenland<00:03:25.609> ice<00:03:26.090> sheet

of fresh water into the ocean which is

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.819
