link to my patreon page in the
description

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.790 

so<00:02:00.510> I'm<00:02:00.660> done<00:02:00.840> mixing<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.440> here<00:02:01.590> are<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
so I'm done mixing and here are the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:31.210 
so I'm done mixing and here are the
songs<00:02:02.040> before<00:02:02.490> after

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:03:07.040 

you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.540

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
so another important part of making a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.160 
so another important part of making a
video<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.030> choosing<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.510> location<00:03:10.599> where<00:03:11.110> you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
video is choosing the location where you

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.110 
video is choosing the location where you
want<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.470> film<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.069> for<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.370> video<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.730> found<00:03:13.000> a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
want to film so for this video I found a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.430 
want to film so for this video I found a
bridge<00:03:13.330> near<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.660> water<00:03:13.840> tower<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.319> was

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
bridge near the water tower that was

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.970 
bridge near the water tower that was
pretty<00:03:14.650> cool

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
pretty cool

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.339 
pretty cool
so<00:03:16.790> what<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.209> synchronize<00:03:17.810> my<00:03:18.050> plane

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
so what I do to synchronize my plane

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.960 
so what I do to synchronize my plane
with<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> original<00:03:19.129> audio<00:03:19.430> as<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.670> use<00:03:19.849> the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
with the original audio as I use the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.729 
with the original audio as I use the
small<00:03:20.209> Bluetooth<00:03:20.629> speaker<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.230> synchronize

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
small Bluetooth speaker to synchronize
