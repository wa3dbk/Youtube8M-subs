this<00:00:01.140> screencast<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.949> going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.310> cover

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:02.689 
this screencast is going to cover

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:05.660 
this screencast is going to cover
antibody<00:00:03.689> mediated<00:00:03.929> immunity<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:05.040> would

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
antibody mediated immunity I would

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.519 
antibody mediated immunity I would
recommend<00:00:06.210> listening<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.109> cell<00:00:07.350> mediated

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
recommend listening to the cell mediated

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.790 
recommend listening to the cell mediated
immunity<00:00:08.990> screencast<00:00:09.990> first<00:00:10.349> since<00:00:10.590> that's

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
immunity screencast first since that's

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.320 
immunity screencast first since that's
the<00:00:10.950> first<00:00:11.160> one<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.429> went<00:00:11.550> over<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.940> lecture

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
the first one we went over in lecture

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.879 
the first one we went over in lecture
and<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.660> went<00:00:12.900> over<00:00:12.990> some<00:00:13.290> things<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.710> more

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
and I went over some things in more

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.150 
and I went over some things in more
detail<00:00:14.340> now<00:00:15.330> antibody<00:00:16.320> mediated<00:00:16.529> immunity

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
detail now antibody mediated immunity

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.269 
detail now antibody mediated immunity
deals<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.300> fighting<00:00:18.660> off<00:00:18.930> bacteria<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
deals with fighting off bacteria and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.490 
deals with fighting off bacteria and
remember<00:00:20.970> bacteria<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.810> different<00:00:22.320> from

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
remember bacteria are different from

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.009 
remember bacteria are different from
viruses<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.939> respect<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.840> they

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
viruses in one respect in that they

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.320 
viruses in one respect in that they
don't<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.710> live<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.220> cells<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.300> can

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
don't have to live in cells they can

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450 
don't have to live in cells they can
freefloat<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.560> here<00:00:28.740> they<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:28.890> they're<00:00:29.189> small

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
freefloat so here they are they're small

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.150 
freefloat so here they are they're small
they're<00:00:29.699> sly<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.240> they<00:00:30.330> multiply<00:00:30.949> but<00:00:31.949> also

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
they're sly and they multiply but also

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.549 
they're sly and they multiply but also
remember<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.300> macrophages<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.440> other

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
remember that macrophages and other

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.350 
remember that macrophages and other
types<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> white<00:00:35.190> blood<00:00:35.219> cells<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.210> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
types of white blood cells are going to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660 
types of white blood cells are going to
engulf<00:00:36.690> through<00:00:37.140> phagocytosis<00:00:37.670> these

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
engulf through phagocytosis these

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.479 
engulf through phagocytosis these
bacteria<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.660> order<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.710> try<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.250> rid<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
bacteria in order to try to get rid of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.490 
bacteria in order to try to get rid of
them<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.989> things<00:00:43.260> these

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
them and one of the things these

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.889 
them and one of the things these
macrophages<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.520> other<00:00:45.149> white<00:00:45.420> blood<00:00:45.539> cells

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
macrophages or other white blood cells

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.380 
macrophages or other white blood cells
that<00:00:46.110> use<00:00:46.289> phagocytosis<00:00:47.039> will<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.940> they

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that use phagocytosis will do is they

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
that use phagocytosis will do is they
will<00:00:48.420> put<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> piece<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.440> bacteria<00:00:50.039> on

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
will put a piece of the bacteria on

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.959 
will put a piece of the bacteria on
their<00:00:50.730> MHC<00:00:51.449> proteins<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.920> case<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.370> MHC

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
their MHC proteins in this case it's MHC

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.270 
their MHC proteins in this case it's MHC
2<00:00:54.020> proteins<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.860> you've<00:00:55.980> got<00:00:56.129> them

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
2 proteins so you've got them

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
2 proteins so you've got them
free-floating<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:57.899> engulfed

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
free-floating and you have them engulfed

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.160 
free-floating and you have them engulfed
in<00:00:58.770> these<00:00:59.039> white<00:00:59.250> blood<00:00:59.430> cells<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
in these white blood cells what has to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.500 
in these white blood cells what has to
happen<00:01:01.199> once<00:01:02.100> they've<00:01:02.399> been<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:03.149> once

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
happen once they've been they once

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.850 
happen once they've been they once
they've<00:01:03.719> been<00:01:03.930> exposed<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.619> they're<00:01:04.739> out

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
they've been exposed and they're out

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.640 
they've been exposed and they're out
there<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> find<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> correctly

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
there is we have to find the correctly

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.640 
there is we have to find the correctly
fitting<00:01:08.040> helper<00:01:08.430> T<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.970> remember<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:10.530> are

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
fitting helper T and remember there are

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.000 
fitting helper T and remember there are
several<00:01:11.420> several<00:01:12.420> hundred<00:01:12.930> different<00:01:13.470> helper

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
several several hundred different helper

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
several several hundred different helper
T<00:01:14.189> cells<00:01:14.460> each<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.760> different<00:01:15.360> helper<00:01:16.049> T

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
T cells each with different helper T

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.859 
T cells each with different helper T
cell<00:01:16.590> receptor<00:01:17.159> shapes<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> body<00:01:18.540> has<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
cell receptor shapes so the body has to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.600 
cell receptor shapes so the body has to
find<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.310> fits<00:01:21.500> also<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.070> body<00:01:23.340> has

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
find the one that fits also the body has

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
find the one that fits also the body has
to<00:01:23.640> find<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:24.450> plasma<00:01:25.320> B<00:01:25.500> cell<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.280> has

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
to find the right plasma B cell that has

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.929 
to find the right plasma B cell that has
the<00:01:26.640> right<00:01:27.030> antibody<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.110> fits<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.939> again

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the right antibody that fits and again

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.700 
the right antibody that fits and again
there<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.390> several<00:01:31.140> hundred<00:01:31.530> different

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
there are several hundred different

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.160 
there are several hundred different
plasma<00:01:32.070> B<00:01:32.430> cells<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.630> there's<00:01:33.900> only<00:01:34.020> one

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
plasma B cells but there's only one

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.300 
plasma B cells but there's only one
that's<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> fit<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.119> bacteria<00:01:37.310> once

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that's going to fit this bacteria once

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.510 
that's going to fit this bacteria once
we<00:01:38.520> find<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.270> helper<00:01:39.869> T<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:41.100> find

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
we find the right helper T and we find

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.850 
we find the right helper T and we find
the<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:42.000> plasma<00:01:42.600> B<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.500> will<00:01:43.649> Co

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the right plasma B and they will Co

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
the right plasma B and they will Co
stimulate<00:01:44.430> each<00:01:44.460> other<00:01:44.820> through<00:01:45.180> cytokines

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
stimulate each other through cytokines

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
stimulate each other through cytokines
and<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.950> induce<00:01:47.280> these<00:01:47.579> plasma<00:01:48.090> B

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and that will induce these plasma B

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.109 
and that will induce these plasma B
cells<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:49.140> go<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.560> mitosis<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
cells to go through mitosis and to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.830 
cells to go through mitosis and to
produce<00:01:51.329> more<00:01:51.899> plasma<00:01:52.229> B<00:01:52.590> cells<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
produce more plasma B cells and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
produce more plasma B cells and
antibodies<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.079> remember<00:01:55.829> antibodies<00:01:56.549> are

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
antibodies and remember antibodies are

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.020 
antibodies and remember antibodies are
free-floating<00:01:58.100> t-cell<00:01:59.100> receptors<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.880> only

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
free-floating t-cell receptors can only

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.569 
free-floating t-cell receptors can only
be<00:02:00.210> stuck<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> T<00:02:00.960> cell<00:02:01.399> antibodies<00:02:02.399> can

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
be stuck to a T cell antibodies can

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850 
be stuck to a T cell antibodies can
freefloat<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:03.930> these<00:02:04.140> antibodies

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
freefloat so we get all these antibodies

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.190 
freefloat so we get all these antibodies
and<00:02:05.159> all<00:02:05.340> these<00:02:05.520> plasma<00:02:06.030> b-cells<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.049> will

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and all these plasma b-cells that will

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.150 
and all these plasma b-cells that will
then<00:02:07.350> go<00:02:07.590> after<00:02:08.000> these<00:02:09.000> bacteria<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
then go after these bacteria and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.820 
then go after these bacteria and
hopefully<00:02:11.160> rid<00:02:11.430> them<00:02:11.700> from<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> body

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
hopefully rid them from the body

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
hopefully rid them from the body
we'll<00:02:14.010> also<00:02:14.220> happen<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.880> we'll<00:02:15.090> get<00:02:15.240> memory

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
we'll also happen is we'll get memory

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.320 
we'll also happen is we'll get memory
b-cells<00:02:16.220> these<00:02:17.220> memory<00:02:17.640> b-cells

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
b-cells these memory b-cells

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.570 
b-cells these memory b-cells
kind<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.080> hang<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.770> bloodstream<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
kind of hang out in the bloodstream and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.030 
kind of hang out in the bloodstream and
what<00:02:21.300> happens<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.870> again<00:02:22.290> if<00:02:22.530> you're<00:02:22.650> attacked

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
what happens is again if you're attacked

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.140 
what happens is again if you're attacked
by<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.550> same<00:02:24.120> bacteria<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:25.440> same<00:02:25.860> bacteria

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
by that same bacteria that same bacteria

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.490 
by that same bacteria that same bacteria
you<00:02:27.150> won't<00:02:27.420> have<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.840> go<00:02:27.990> through<00:02:28.320> this

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
you won't have to go through this

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.860 
you won't have to go through this
process<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:29.280> finding<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.820> right<00:02:29.910> helper<00:02:30.510> T<00:02:30.720> in

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
process of finding the right helper T in

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.170 
process of finding the right helper T in
the<00:02:30.960> right<00:02:31.140> plasma<00:02:31.650> B<00:02:31.830> these<00:02:32.430> cells<00:02:32.760> will<00:02:33.000> just

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the right plasma B these cells will just

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.390 
the right plasma B these cells will just
go<00:02:33.330> through<00:02:33.540> mitosis<00:02:33.830> produce<00:02:34.830> antibodies

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
go through mitosis produce antibodies

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.970 
go through mitosis produce antibodies
and<00:02:35.790> those<00:02:36.180> antibodies<00:02:36.870> will<00:02:37.380> attack<00:02:37.740> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
and those antibodies will attack the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.520 
and those antibodies will attack the
bacteria<00:02:38.450> before<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.840> even<00:02:40.020> know<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.440> you

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
bacteria before you even know that you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.890 
bacteria before you even know that you
have<00:02:40.740> an<00:02:40.860> infection<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:42.270> one<00:02:42.510> thing<00:02:42.750> that

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
have an infection and one thing that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.690 
have an infection and one thing that
happens<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.830> same<00:02:44.070> for<00:02:44.370> memory

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
happens and this is the same for memory

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210 
happens and this is the same for memory
T<00:02:44.910> cells<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.990> if<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.260> bacteria<00:02:46.890> or<00:02:47.130> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
T cells is that if the bacteria or the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.240 
T cells is that if the bacteria or the

infected<00:02:50.790> by<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.000> again<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.480> let's<00:02:51.630> say<00:02:51.780> you

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
infected by it again so let's say you

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.800 
infected by it again so let's say you
get<00:02:52.050> an<00:02:52.170> infection<00:02:52.470> now<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:54.330> get<00:02:54.480> memory

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
get an infection now you get memory

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.590 
get an infection now you get memory
b-cells<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.620> then<00:02:55.950> six<00:02:56.370> years<00:02:56.640> from<00:02:56.820> now<00:02:57.030> you

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
b-cells and then six years from now you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.480 
b-cells and then six years from now you
get<00:02:57.750> attacked<00:02:58.110> by<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.350> same<00:02:58.620> bacteria<00:02:58.860> but

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
get attacked by the same bacteria but

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.730 
get attacked by the same bacteria but
it's<00:02:59.670> slightly<00:02:59.940> mutated<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:01.080> memory<00:03:01.500> b-cells

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
it's slightly mutated the memory b-cells

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.360 
it's slightly mutated the memory b-cells
may<00:03:02.340> not<00:03:02.550> recognize<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.390> bacteria<00:03:04.340> or<00:03:05.340> a

might<00:03:08.220> not<00:03:08.430> recognize<00:03:09.270> them<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.140> that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
might not recognize them and in that

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.080 
might not recognize them and in that
case<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.950> would<00:03:11.070> have<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.370> go<00:03:11.670> through<00:03:11.940> this

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
case you would have to go through this

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.660 
case you would have to go through this
step-by-step<00:03:12.390> process<00:03:13.320> again<00:03:13.770> in<00:03:14.040> order<00:03:14.520> to

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
step-by-step process again in order to

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.440 
step-by-step process again in order to
fight<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.150> infection<00:03:16.940> like<00:03:17.940> with<00:03:18.239> cell

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
fight that infection like with cell

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.850 
fight that infection like with cell
mediated<00:03:18.630> immunity<00:03:19.080> we<00:03:19.380> also<00:03:19.560> have

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
mediated immunity we also have

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.060 
mediated immunity we also have
regulatory<00:03:20.250> t-cells<00:03:21.060> those<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.830> cell

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
regulatory t-cells those like in cell

regulatory t-cells those like in cell
mediated<00:03:23.280> immunity<00:03:23.820> do<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> same<00:03:24.510> thing<00:03:24.840> they

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
mediated immunity do the same thing they

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.290 
mediated immunity do the same thing they
stop<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.980> process<00:03:26.459> they<00:03:26.730> control<00:03:27.150> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
stop the process they control the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.509 
stop the process they control the
process<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.380> when<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.680> infection<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.340> gone

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
process so when the infection is gone

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.360 
process so when the infection is gone
then<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.300> process<00:03:30.780> stops<00:03:31.110> then<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.890> process

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
then the process stops then the process

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460 
then the process stops then the process
stops<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.060> immune<00:03:33.209> system<00:03:33.690> has<00:03:33.720> there<00:03:34.350> is

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
stops so the immune system has there is

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.520 
stops so the immune system has there is
some<00:03:34.680> control<00:03:35.190> over<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:36.180> immune<00:03:36.480> system<00:03:39.530> now

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
some control over the immune system now

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.620 
some control over the immune system now
what<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:41.010> antibodies<00:03:41.550> do<00:03:41.820> they<00:03:42.330> can<00:03:42.510> do

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
what can antibodies do they can do

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.660 
what can antibodies do they can do
several<00:03:42.900> things<00:03:43.050> they<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.680> neutralize<00:03:44.220> they

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
several things they can neutralize they

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.670 
several things they can neutralize they
can<00:03:44.880> neutralize<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.930> pathogen<00:03:46.470> by

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
can neutralize the pathogen by

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.310 
can neutralize the pathogen by
surrounding<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.400> agglutination<00:03:48.360> which<00:03:49.110> we

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
surrounding it agglutination which we

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.650 
surrounding it agglutination which we
talked<00:03:49.590> about<00:03:49.739> with<00:03:50.340> red<00:03:50.640> blood<00:03:50.880> cells<00:03:51.239> they

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
talked about with red blood cells they

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.300 
talked about with red blood cells they
can<00:03:51.810> attack<00:03:52.140> those<00:03:52.410> cells<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.830> grab<00:03:53.100> them

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
can attack those cells and grab them

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.970 
can attack those cells and grab them
they<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.600> induce<00:03:55.350> what's<00:03:55.650> called<00:03:55.860> a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
they can induce what's called a

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.670 
they can induce what's called a
complement<00:03:56.519> system<00:03:56.730> which<00:03:57.660> if<00:03:57.930> you're<00:03:58.050> in<00:03:58.170> 107

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
complement system which if you're in 107

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.470 
complement system which if you're in 107
you<00:03:58.920> don't<00:03:59.070> need<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.340> worry<00:03:59.519> about<00:03:59.580> this<00:03:59.940> but

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
you don't need to worry about this but

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.600 
you don't need to worry about this but
basically<00:04:00.540> what<00:04:01.260> they<00:04:01.440> do<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:02.010> they<00:04:02.310> can

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
basically what they do is they can

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.570 
basically what they do is they can
enhance<00:04:03.209> other<00:04:03.989> immune<00:04:04.590> system<00:04:04.980> processes

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
enhance other immune system processes

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.060 
enhance other immune system processes
like<00:04:05.760> phagocytosis<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.930> inflammation<00:04:07.260> or

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
like phagocytosis and inflammation or

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.720 
like phagocytosis and inflammation or
they<00:04:08.760> can<00:04:08.970> also<00:04:09.560> lead<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.799> cell<00:04:11.040> lysis<00:04:11.310> which

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
they can also lead to cell lysis which

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.990 
they can also lead to cell lysis which
is<00:04:11.880> basically<00:04:12.360> just<00:04:12.840> killing<00:04:13.620> those<00:04:14.010> cells<00:04:14.400> so

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
is basically just killing those cells so

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.360 
is basically just killing those cells so
antibodies<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:16.019> many<00:04:16.890> different

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
antibodies have many different

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.930 
antibodies have many different
mechanisms<00:04:17.549> they<00:04:18.180> can<00:04:18.419> use<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:19.010> neutralize<00:04:20.010> to

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
mechanisms they can use to neutralize to

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.930 
mechanisms they can use to neutralize to
neutralize<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:22.080> bacteria<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.100> again<00:04:23.760> if

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
neutralize the bacteria and again if

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.090 
neutralize the bacteria and again if
