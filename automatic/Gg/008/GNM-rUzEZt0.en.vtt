00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
have to identify the function before

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.130 
have to identify the function before
surgery<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:51.150> from<00:00:52.150> those<00:00:52.360> I<00:00:52.600> would<00:00:52.900> guess

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
surgery and from those I would guess

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.720 
surgery and from those I would guess
that<00:00:53.350> approximately<00:00:53.920> twenty<00:00:54.340> percent

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
that approximately twenty percent

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.400 
that approximately twenty percent
somewhere<00:00:55.480> between<00:00:55.750> eighteen<00:00:56.470> 120<00:00:57.310> cases<00:00:58.410> are

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
somewhere between eighteen 120 cases are

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.740 
somewhere between eighteen 120 cases are
really<00:00:59.850> tumors<00:01:00.850> where<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.300> tumor<00:01:01.540> is<00:01:01.570> located

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
really tumors where the tumor is located

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.350 
really tumors where the tumor is located
in<00:01:02.290> eloquent<00:01:02.950> areas<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:03.640> therefore<00:01:03.940> needs<00:01:04.149> a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
in eloquent areas and therefore needs a

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.380 
in eloquent areas and therefore needs a
special<00:01:04.809> diagnostic<00:01:05.710> procedure<00:01:06.100> before<00:01:06.390> we

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
special diagnostic procedure before we

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.050 
special diagnostic procedure before we
decide<00:01:07.899> to<00:01:08.080> operate<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:08.680> how<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:08.860> operate<00:01:09.310> we

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
decide to operate and how to operate we

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.609 
decide to operate and how to operate we
are<00:01:10.180> using<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.600> system<00:01:10.960> now<00:01:11.110> for<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.410> last

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
are using the system now for the last

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.639 
are using the system now for the last
three<00:01:11.920> years<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:16.540> became<00:01:16.899> evident<00:01:17.380> quite

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
three years and it became evident quite

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.060 
three years and it became evident quite
soon<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.640> has<00:01:18.880> dramatically<00:01:19.450> changed

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
soon that it has dramatically changed

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.520 
soon that it has dramatically changed
the<00:01:21.070> way<00:01:21.700> how<00:01:21.940> we<00:01:22.000> approach<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.140> tumors

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
the way how we approach the tumors

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.060 
the way how we approach the tumors
before<00:01:24.250> surgery<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:25.750> intellectual<00:01:26.440> workup

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
before surgery the intellectual workup

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.390 
before surgery the intellectual workup
and<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:28.690> decision<00:01:29.140> making<00:01:29.350> how<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.830> operate

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
and the decision making how to operate

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.270 
and the decision making how to operate
the<00:01:30.580> tumor<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:32.110> decide<00:01:32.500> how<00:01:32.740> aggressive

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
the tumor and to decide how aggressive

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.160 
the tumor and to decide how aggressive
we<00:01:33.310> can<00:01:33.610> be<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.090> individual<00:01:34.510> tumor<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.110> on

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
we can be on the individual tumor and on

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.770 
we can be on the individual tumor and on
the<00:01:35.260> individual<00:01:35.619> patient<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:37.000> now<00:01:37.420> three

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
the individual patient so now three

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.980 
the individual patient so now three
years<00:01:37.810> from<00:01:38.490> since<00:01:39.490> we<00:01:39.970> have<00:01:40.150> started<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.869> use

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
years from since we have started to use

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.080 
years from since we have started to use
it<00:01:41.290> on<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.470> routine<00:01:41.680> basis<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.460> can<00:01:42.520> really<00:01:42.820> say

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
it on a routine basis I can really say

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.240 
it on a routine basis I can really say
that<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.420> has<00:01:43.750> become<00:01:44.110> an<00:01:44.200> integral<00:01:44.560> part<00:01:45.040> of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
that it has become an integral part of

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.450 
that it has become an integral part of
our<00:01:45.990> pre<00:01:46.990> surgical<00:01:47.439> workup<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.070> helps<00:01:48.340> us

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
our pre surgical workup and it helps us

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.730 
our pre surgical workup and it helps us
tremendously<00:01:48.970> if<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.780> go<00:01:50.439> through<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
tremendously if you go through the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.429 
tremendously if you go through the
history<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.540> different<00:01:52.540> strategies<00:01:53.200> to

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
history of different strategies to

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.130 
history of different strategies to
identify<00:01:53.790> function<00:01:54.790> before<00:01:54.939> surgery<00:01:55.360> or<00:01:55.780> to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
identify function before surgery or to

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.160 
identify function before surgery or to
either<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.860> localize<00:01:57.850> function<00:01:58.360> with<00:01:58.689> respect

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
either to localize function with respect

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
just use the anatomic information number

been<00:02:38.269> many<00:02:38.629> times<00:02:38.739> disappointed<00:02:39.879> either<00:02:40.879> by

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
been many times disappointed either by

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.929 
been many times disappointed either by
the<00:02:41.299> fact<00:02:41.689> that<00:02:42.079> it<00:02:42.379> was<00:02:42.620> very<00:02:43.340> difficult<00:02:43.579> to

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
the fact that it was very difficult to

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.619 
the fact that it was very difficult to
get<00:02:44.180> reliable<00:02:44.719> results<00:02:45.400> or<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.909> has<00:02:47.419> been

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
get reliable results or it has been

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.520 
get reliable results or it has been
difficult<00:02:47.840> really<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:50.120> replicate<00:02:51.079> the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
difficult really to replicate the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.349 
difficult really to replicate the
imaging<00:02:52.219> findings<00:02:52.459> than<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.239> the

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
imaging findings than in the

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.000 
imaging findings than in the
intraoperative<00:02:53.859> situation

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
intraoperative situation

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.640 
intraoperative situation
so<00:02:55.700> apart<00:02:56.090> from<00:02:56.209> Anatomy<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.109> functional

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
so apart from Anatomy and functional

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.830 
so apart from Anatomy and functional
neuroimaging<00:02:57.769> there<00:02:58.370> not<00:02:58.489> many<00:02:58.790> or<00:02:59.480> there's

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
neuroimaging there not many or there's

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.199 
neuroimaging there not many or there's
non<00:03:00.079> technique<00:03:00.439> that<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.739> know<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:01.219> that<00:03:02.060> we

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
non technique that I know and that we

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.390 
non technique that I know and that we
have<00:03:02.359> used<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:02.840> compared<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.859> those<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.250> can

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
have used and compared to those I can

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.709 
have used and compared to those I can
really<00:03:04.549> say<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.939> the<00:03:05.030> new<00:03:05.150> system<00:03:05.329> is

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:05.719 
really say that the new system is

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.069 
really say that the new system is
clearly<00:03:06.530> advantageous
