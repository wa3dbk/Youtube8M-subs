00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.459
 welcome to my cook 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.039
 channel my name is khan on 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:15.379
 Today we do a mango sheikh for it 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.779
 we need a mature first and foremost 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.890
 mango she is ready if she is a little bit 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.490
 has become soft 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:29.449
 of which sugar yogurt sugar or 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:38.540
 Add honey and water first 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:40.519
 we peel our mango and we have to 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.620
 you try to peel very thin because 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.629
 In the mango it really is 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.879
 the fruit is sweetest under the peel 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:52.369
 Normally it is with kernobst 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.049
 so that around the core the cutest 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:56.900
 But fruit is in the mango it is 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.790
 There is really something else there 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.619
 sweet fruit just below the peel and 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.989
 therefore peel as thin as possible then 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.909
 do you have the cutest fruit yes yes that 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.610
 does not work as well as i want me 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.939
 usually has to do fast exactly 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.329
 we should also make it thinner that way 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.000
 and then just on the board with one 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.969
 try larger knife in easy 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.649
 pieces to share and of course in the 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.100
 middle is the core therefore you can 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:30.770
 do not halve and just like me 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.159
 here now just show with the knife 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.229
 separate the pieces like this and the closer we get 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.969
 get to the core the more difficult it gets 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.469
 but the mango should not be too 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.719
 get lost and therefore as much as 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.590
 possible to do with a small then off 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.590
 better continue 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.350
 just now we are reasonably 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.520
 but I still make that 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.280
 Not that I give my children 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.910
 to nibble next we take 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:15.280
 One can and give all mango pieces 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:20.760
 into it and the other other ingredients 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 So too sugar vanilla sugar yogurt 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.890
 we also give in and puree 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.890
 first with the mango 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.110
 water will come in next 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.680
 and we will go with the water again 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.680
 together 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.120
 a little more water so every one has to 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.599
 also determine the water in the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.980
 mosque comes some like very liquid 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.840
 some rather viscous and depending 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.319
 can you do that the amount of water itself 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.319
 determine 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.500
 so so who can like a little bit 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.330
 lime juice or lemon juice 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.099
 give in who is fresher like 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.420
 who likes it a little sweeter 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.420
 should do without it 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.130
 so now is our way finished and yes and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.709
 then maybe with one 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.940
 small coin fresh mint easy 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.940
 serve your guests 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.160
