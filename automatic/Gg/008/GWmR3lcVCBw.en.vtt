some extra safety in there with this one

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.429 
some extra safety in there with this one

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
switch the one in the front so it's

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
switch the one in the front so it's
easier<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.890> carry<00:01:59.100> added<00:01:59.909> some<00:02:00.060> good<00:02:00.210> deck

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
easier to carry added some good deck
