00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.870
 Hello, everyone, what a pleasure it gives me 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.580
 always say hello today I'm going to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.939
 present a very easy design of 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.849
 realize how much camouflage this 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.869
 combination had already been presented 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:27.910
 in another in another video in another design 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.160
 only with smooth enamel even with 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.560
 stained glass enamel and today I'm going to 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.180
 present with textured glaze gives them 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.860
 a different touch to me I liked a lot and 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.719
 it's very easy let's start with 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.080
 our nails totally clean and 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.700
 completely dry we will apply a 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.550
 Enamel base preferably 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.580
 nourishing on all our nails and 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.860
 later we will apply one or two 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.490
 layers of colored glaze I chose this 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.980
 pink color of visu 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.980
 let dry perfectly and I'll 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.989
 make use of a black graphic style 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.830
 to mark the lines I intend 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.360
 in 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.730
 textured 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.160
 the stroke of the lines of the next 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.280
 way down the center of the nail 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.550
 vertical let's apply a line 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.710
 We are going to draw the fence and 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.620
 the sides of each part we go to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.550
 draw two more lines in this way 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.610
 let's leave six spaces 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.860
 and can add more spaces can 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.470
 make it more wavy or less wavy 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.070
 and the result will be different in 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.070
 each 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.840
 we wait for it to dry 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.790
 and later we are going to make use of a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.540
 textured enamel in this case I chose 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.990
 the Grey 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.000
 and here yes for the application I'm going to 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.400
 use a pointer so that the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.680
 application is more detailed since as 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.990
 it has many waves the lines have 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.159
 Many waves will be easier to apply 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.810
 what with the brush 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.030
 It is important that you choose the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.970
 six parts of the six former segments that 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.299
 we have in our nail choose only three 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.670
 and that is separated from each other since 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.879
 if you find two sections that 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.480
 Textured moscow glaze is very 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.010
 likely to be lost in the parts that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.769
 we want to emphasize 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.280
 we do it in detail we do it with 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.530
 calm let it dry and here if it is 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.540
 optional if you can apply and 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.480
 they want to apply top coat so that 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.239
 Design lasts longer is acceptable only 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.420
 that is noticed and a little bit that the 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.659
 Textured enamel tends to disappear 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.930
 a little bit of if we want to keep this 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.709
 texture perfectly well and that looks 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.829
 that you notice with the ready texture with the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.730
 ready of the pink enamel I would prefer not 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.060
 apply top coat 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.349
 although I am the taste of everyone 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.090
 This is the design that I present to you 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.489
 today I send you a huge kiss and 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.489
 see you very soon, chao
