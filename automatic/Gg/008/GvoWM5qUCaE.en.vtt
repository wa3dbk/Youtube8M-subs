00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.459
 after cases like my present 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.279
 I never meditated 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.470
 I understand that you do not talk to the press highlighting cattle 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.599
 the midfielder charged the foul at the entrance of the area 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.599
 on the afternoon of this Sunday 4 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.380
 so now to u 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.089
 this is a very strong attacker demand 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.009
 and it is good to settle down 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.350
 linked to the academic that was October 14 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 have 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.110
 project 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.929
 Gregory 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:44.929
 other deputy 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 click here to understand that you need to learn to read and write 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.680
 presenting a project that has almost 50% off the tariff 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.630
 speech-impaired people who suffer from 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.590
 of stuttering 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.450
 it's an unprecedented project 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 true purity we seek to lower the barriers 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.470
 A person 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.150
 from the beginning of speech 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.810
 it produces 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.080
 it consumes much more time 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.830
 everything a person 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.550
 it's a normal apple thing 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.980
 because of that 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.610
 are those presented to the project 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 as well as other legal requirements that 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.190
 the implementation of this project as it would have to be evaluated 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.610
 was not a good match is specialized speech influence 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.299
 It's with this clean certificate of the world. 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.760
 this was increased by 50% since our project was approved unanimously 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.000
 now gives commission to constrain it extinction 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.149
 we were invited to be a speaker 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.080
 in Rio de Janeiro at the Brazilian stuttering association where he was 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.899
 there the doctors 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.309
 the doctors the Jewish state 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.879
 in the state of california that we are more advanced and sweat 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.849
 doctors of people and youth 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.379
 doctor of israel 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.760
 was all in left crissiumal pike with the fantastic 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.579
 because it is a subject that awakens 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.999
 the interest even because what madness everything in the hands 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.940
 romeu by the relative who now abandoned the second year 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.000
 of the federal university of mato grosso do sul 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.919
 I started it here 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.020
 I went after them 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.810
 says the agreement with the syntonic jacob psychologist only the confusion of others 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.810
 and are discovering that stuttering is a pathology 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.819
 There is no cure here. 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.260
 can be lightened today there is a device 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.519

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.519
 presented at the second conference of Open Stuttering 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.169
 also directed by the federal council through the month 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.999
 of Brasilia that was also in Rio de Janeiro if we understand the 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.270
 constitutionality of the project 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.509
 because 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.969
 it is because the law of concessions provides 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.909
 special rates 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.439
 already the youth of the tariffs 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.529
 granted when they can choose to grant the concession 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.200
 to private initiative 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.520
 the phases 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.819
 the premier telephone companies that exploit telephony 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.380
 is very demanding representing us other projects 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.690
 the sense of decreasing barriers decreases 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.790
 and the differences 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.790
 after forging the difference how 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.680
 ohio who suffers with embarrassment 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.069
 of difficulty 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.229
 and could not pronounce 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.069
 I'm just the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.860
 and opening a debate 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.439
 actually trying a seed 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.419
 to wake up 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.350
 to our society the problem is that it is very serious 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.580

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.330

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.209

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.139
 or chemical dependence 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.309
 Crack today 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.449
 haha ha 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.609

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.849

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.710
 by the hands of the state 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.660
 Yesterday through zon it says 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.280

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.670
 through the churches 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.809
 ChÃ¡vez whose state life 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.889

 drug users 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.050
 of the cracker who has access to crack stones and the cheap cost 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.449
 is easy to acquire 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.860
 had who produced very good chemical dependency fast 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.569

 as well as the lack 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.010
 of health functionality at the regional level 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.129
 now 2 5 ambulances 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.000

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.300
 state not only the problem and complete the programs all the problems of 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.460
 mental health 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.339
 election in one month. 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.539
 I have a certain pressure 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.560
 voting took place at school certain pressure 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.660
 turkey per kilo now as president I am talking and I am already knowing 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.789

 there is no end 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.139
 she edinho treatments that unfortunately to prosper 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.229
 are treatments in the reds 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.999
 I think in politicians 

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.319
 Let's create the problem. 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.990
 was going to be a problem and we have to have the necessary competence 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.860
 I believe very much in the governor andrÃ© pucinelli in his determination in his 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.759
 capacity since this year is to give things to see problems like this. 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.400
 as he has now criticized 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.669
 our police like never before all security 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.520
 and now we have to deal 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.349
 unfortunately our chemical dependents 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:13.990
