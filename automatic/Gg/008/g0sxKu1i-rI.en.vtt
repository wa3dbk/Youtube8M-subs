00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
think any time it's brand new it may be

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.640 
think any time it's brand new it may be
a<00:04:33.950> little<00:04:34.220> slick<00:04:34.520> but<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.810> proved<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.260> come

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
a little slick but it proved to come

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.070 
a little slick but it proved to come
right<00:04:36.830> up<00:04:37.010> on<00:04:37.160> us<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.580> give<00:04:38.510> us<00:04:38.630> good<00:04:38.690> adhesion

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
right up on us and give us good adhesion

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.689 
right up on us and give us good adhesion
right<00:04:39.410> away<00:04:39.590> yesterday<00:04:39.830> we're<00:04:40.490> right<00:04:40.669> close

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
right away yesterday we're right close

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.670 
right away yesterday we're right close
to<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.240> record<00:04:41.360> here<00:04:41.810> with<00:04:42.410> smaller

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
to the record here with smaller

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.580 
to the record here with smaller
carburetors<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.310> smaller<00:04:43.669> engine<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.660> think

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
carburetors a smaller engine and I think

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.650 
carburetors a smaller engine and I think
the<00:04:46.100> track<00:04:46.340> surface<00:04:46.700> in<00:04:46.850> four<00:04:47.120> or<00:04:47.180> five<00:04:47.330> races

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
the track surface in four or five races

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.690 
the track surface in four or five races
is<00:04:47.720> gonna<00:04:47.900> be<00:04:48.020> excellent<00:04:48.530> well<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.340> guess

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
is gonna be excellent well I guess

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.190 
is gonna be excellent well I guess
that's<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:50.030> pretty<00:04:50.240> good<00:04:50.479> endorsement<00:04:50.810> for
