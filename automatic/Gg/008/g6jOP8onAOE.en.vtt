hi<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:07.649> mr.<00:00:07.890> Andersen<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.400> is

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
hi it's mr. Andersen and this is

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.410 
hi it's mr. Andersen and this is
chemistry<00:00:08.730> essentials<00:00:09.030> video<00:00:09.630> 36<00:00:11.300> and<00:00:12.300> we

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
chemistry essentials video 36 and we

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.690 
chemistry essentials video 36 and we
have<00:00:12.540> solids<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.170> liquids<00:00:13.230> right<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:14.009> water

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
have solids and liquids right here water

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.099 
have solids and liquids right here water
in<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.150> both<00:00:15.480> liquid<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.100> solid<00:00:17.100> phase<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.869> so

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
in a both liquid and solid phase and so

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.660 
in a both liquid and solid phase and so
when<00:00:19.560> we're<00:00:19.710> looking<00:00:20.010> at<00:00:20.130> solids<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.609> liquids

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
when we're looking at solids and liquids

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
when we're looking at solids and liquids
it's<00:00:21.060> almost<00:00:21.300> easier<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> compare<00:00:22.170> them<00:00:22.350> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
it's almost easier to compare them so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
it's almost easier to compare them so
we're<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> use<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> Venn<00:00:23.189> diagram<00:00:23.359> so

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
we're going to use a Venn diagram so

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.730 
we're going to use a Venn diagram so
we've<00:00:24.449> got<00:00:24.570> solids<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.140> liquids<00:00:25.199> how<00:00:25.619> are

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
we've got solids and liquids how are

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.620 
we've got solids and liquids how are
they<00:00:25.859> alike<00:00:26.250> well<00:00:26.640> they're<00:00:26.970> both<00:00:27.300> made<00:00:27.599> of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
they alike well they're both made of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.900 
they alike well they're both made of
matter<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.529> both<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> specific<00:00:29.670> molar

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
matter they both have a specific molar

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.160 
matter they both have a specific molar
volume<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.449> other<00:00:30.570> words<00:00:30.750> they're<00:00:30.900> close

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
volume in other words they're close

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.550 
volume in other words they're close
enough

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
enough

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.319 
enough
whether<00:00:32.099> molar<00:00:32.399> volumes<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> be

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
whether molar volumes are going to be

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
whether molar volumes are going to be
about<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.750> same<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.290> they're<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
about the same and they're all going to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.950 
about the same and they're all going to
be<00:00:35.160> made<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.550> particles<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.600> matter

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
be made of particles so is all matter

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.900 
be made of particles so is all matter
but<00:00:37.230> what's<00:00:37.410> different<00:00:37.950> between<00:00:38.040> liquids<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
but what's different between liquids and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.900 
but what's different between liquids and
solids<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.500> intermolecular<00:00:40.890> forces<00:00:41.670> are

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
solids is the intermolecular forces are

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.220 
solids is the intermolecular forces are
going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.210> slightly<00:00:42.450> different<00:00:42.930> between<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
going to be slightly different between a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.049 
going to be slightly different between a
solid<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.860> liquid<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.760> look<00:00:44.940> at

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
solid and a liquid and so if we look at

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.400 
solid and a liquid and so if we look at
solids<00:00:45.510> they're<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.960> highly

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
solids they're going to be highly

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
solids they're going to be highly
ordered<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.730> means<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.270> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
ordered and what that means is that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.000 
ordered and what that means is that
their<00:00:48.690> atoms<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.530> locked<00:00:49.739> into

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
their atoms are going to be locked into

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.700 
their atoms are going to be locked into
a<00:00:50.219> specific<00:00:50.579> matrix<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.170> vibrate<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
a specific matrix they can vibrate in

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
a specific matrix they can vibrate in
fact<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.250> vibrate<00:00:53.579> over<00:00:54.059> time<00:00:54.329> but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
fact they have to vibrate over time but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.060 
fact they have to vibrate over time but
as<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> result<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:55.920> two

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
as a result they really are two

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.290 
as a result they really are two
different<00:00:56.399> types<00:00:56.520> amorphous<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
different types amorphous and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
different types amorphous and
crystalline<00:00:57.930> solids<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:59.160> we're<00:00:59.309> looking<00:00:59.579> at

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
crystalline solids if we're looking at

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.849 
crystalline solids if we're looking at
liquids<00:01:00.180> they're<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:00.930> disordered<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.739> they

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
liquids they're more disordered and they

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.560 
liquids they're more disordered and they
can<00:01:02.100> show<00:01:02.309> what's<00:01:02.520> called<00:01:02.699> translation<00:01:03.420> where

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
can show what's called translation where

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140 
can show what's called translation where
they<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> move<00:01:04.019> around<00:01:04.199> each<00:01:04.739> other<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
they can move around each other and as a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.630 
they can move around each other and as a
result<00:01:06.630> they're<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.470> take<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
result they're going to be take the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
result they're going to be take the
shape<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.240> whatever<00:01:09.510> container<00:01:09.869> they're<00:01:10.350> in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
shape of whatever container they're in

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
shape of whatever container they're in
and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.310> they're<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.700> properties

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and then they're going to be properties

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
and then they're going to be properties
based<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:12.960> intermolecular<00:01:13.320> forces

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
based on these intermolecular forces

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
based on these intermolecular forces
like<00:01:14.400> surface<00:01:14.850> tension<00:01:14.960> viscosity<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
like surface tension viscosity and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
like surface tension viscosity and
volume<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> mixing<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.250> talked<00:01:17.490> about

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
volume of mixing that we talked about

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.249 
volume of mixing that we talked about
with<00:01:17.909> liquids<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.509> don't<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> talk

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
with liquids that we don't have to talk

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
with liquids that we don't have to talk
about<00:01:19.290> when<00:01:20.009> we're<00:01:20.159> talking<00:01:20.189> about<00:01:20.549> solids

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
about when we're talking about solids

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.899 
about when we're talking about solids
and<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.990> how<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.250> two<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and so how do we look at these two and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.670 
and so how do we look at these two and
how<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.150> move<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.780> into<00:01:25.049> another<00:01:25.080> well

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
how they move from one into another well

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260 
how they move from one into another well
we<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.950> look<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> heating<00:01:26.610> curve<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
we can look at a heating curve or if you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.850 
we can look at a heating curve or if you
just<00:01:27.420> turn<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.720> around<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.259> cooling<00:01:28.650> curve

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
just turn that around a cooling curve

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.810 
just turn that around a cooling curve
and<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> show<00:01:29.520> us<00:01:29.670> this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
and it's going to show us this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.910 
and it's going to show us this
transition<00:01:30.420> between<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.810> two<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.860> if

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
transition between the two and so if

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.469 
transition between the two and so if
we're<00:01:32.040> looking<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.490> phases<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.030> matter<00:01:33.240> its

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
we're looking at phases of matter its

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
we're looking at phases of matter its
first<00:01:33.720> best<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.439> come<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:34.829> some<00:01:35.100> kind<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
first best to come up with some kind of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.800 
first best to come up with some kind of
a<00:01:35.430> representation<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:36.509> look<00:01:36.750> like

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
a representation of what they look like

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.330 
a representation of what they look like
and<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.229> we're<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> use<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> simulation

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and so we're going to use a simulation

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.690 
and so we're going to use a simulation
here<00:01:38.549> from<00:01:38.790> pH<00:01:39.090> et<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.750> Colorado<00:01:40.200> edu<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.100> so

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
here from pH et at Colorado edu and so

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
here from pH et at Colorado edu and so
we've<00:01:41.880> got<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> bunch<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> water<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
we've got here is a bunch of water in a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.679 
we've got here is a bunch of water in a
solid<00:01:44.460> phase<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
solid phase and so you can see that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
solid phase and so you can see that
they're<00:01:45.810> locked<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.320> position<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.159> we

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
they're locked in position and as we

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
they're locked in position and as we
move<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.820> liquid<00:01:48.030> now<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.049> translate

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
move it to liquid now they can translate

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
move it to liquid now they can translate
they<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.920> move<00:01:50.009> around<00:01:50.310> each<00:01:50.549> other<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:50.939> this

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
they can move around each other now this

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
they can move around each other now this
is<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> great<00:01:51.750> model<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> liquid<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
is a not a great model of a liquid it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
is a not a great model of a liquid it
should<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.189> flow<00:01:53.430> down<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> bottom

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
should kind of flow down to the bottom

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.850 
should kind of flow down to the bottom
but<00:01:54.869> at<00:01:54.960> least<00:01:55.079> we're<00:01:55.320> seeing<00:01:55.530> what's<00:01:55.710> going

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
but at least we're seeing what's going

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.679 
but at least we're seeing what's going
on<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> particle<00:01:56.670> phase<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.509> we

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
on at the particle phase and then as we

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.020 
on at the particle phase and then as we
look<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> gas<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.040> increase<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.579> energy

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
look at a gas as we increase the energy

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.270 
look at a gas as we increase the energy
again<00:02:00.350> now<00:02:01.350> they're<00:02:01.530> moving<00:02:01.619> all<00:02:01.920> over<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
again now they're moving all over the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.830 
again now they're moving all over the
place<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.670> we'll<00:02:02.759> talk<00:02:02.880> about<00:02:03.000> gases<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
place and we'll talk about gases in the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.870 
place and we'll talk about gases in the
next<00:02:04.079> video<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.430> we're<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.700> do

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
next video and so what we're going to do

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.069 
next video and so what we're going to do
is<00:02:06.090> we're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> take<00:02:06.600> some<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> that

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
is we're going to take some of that

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.630 
is we're going to take some of that
energy<00:02:07.259> away<00:02:07.649> we're<00:02:07.979> going<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> take<00:02:08.340> some<00:02:08.550> of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
energy away we're going to take some of

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.029 
energy away we're going to take some of
that<00:02:08.729> heat<00:02:09.060> away<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.319> cool<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.649> down

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that heat away and as we cool it down

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.720 
that heat away and as we cool it down
you<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.459> here

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
you can see here

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.059 
you can see here
that<00:02:11.909> we're<00:02:12.030> measuring<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.629> Kelvin<00:02:13.319> as

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
that we're measuring this in Kelvin as

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.740 
that we're measuring this in Kelvin as
we<00:02:14.310> cool<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.550> down<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.879> turns<00:02:15.239> into<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.540> liquid

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
we cool it down it turns into a liquid

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.600 
we cool it down it turns into a liquid
and<00:02:16.080> now<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:16.409> into<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> solid<00:02:17.159> you<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.459> see

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and now it's into a solid you can see

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.670 
and now it's into a solid you can see
even<00:02:17.909> at<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> solid<00:02:18.330> phase<00:02:18.720> though<00:02:19.019> still<00:02:19.349> we're

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
even at a solid phase though still we're

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.470 
even at a solid phase though still we're
seeing<00:02:19.890> vibrations<00:02:20.549> within<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:21.060> but<00:02:21.239> as<00:02:21.360> we

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
seeing vibrations within there but as we

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.460 
seeing vibrations within there but as we
approach<00:02:21.870> Absolute<00:02:22.590> Zero<00:02:23.390> all<00:02:24.470> molecular

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
approach Absolute Zero all molecular

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.259 
approach Absolute Zero all molecular
motion<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.980> eventually<00:02:26.489> going<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.730> come<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.239> a

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
motion is eventually going to come to a

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.930 
motion is eventually going to come to a
stop<00:02:27.659> when<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.230> reach<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.470> point<00:02:29.040> okay<00:02:29.760> so

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
stop when we reach that point okay so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.490 
stop when we reach that point okay so
when<00:02:30.180> we're<00:02:30.330> looking<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.660> solids<00:02:31.080> solids<00:02:31.230> are

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
when we're looking at solids solids are

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.530 
when we're looking at solids solids are
going<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> specific<00:02:32.129> matrix<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.420> other

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
going to have a specific matrix in other

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.570 
going to have a specific matrix in other
words<00:02:33.780> all<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.319> atoms<00:02:34.890> molecules<00:02:35.099> are

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
words all of the atoms molecules are

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.220 
words all of the atoms molecules are
going<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.849> put<00:02:36.060> together<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.629> a<00:02:36.959> specific

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
going to be put together in a specific

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.559 
going to be put together in a specific
shape<00:02:37.829> if<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.519> amorphous<00:02:39.150> there's<00:02:39.420> not

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
shape if it's amorphous there's not

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.119 
shape if it's amorphous there's not
going<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> repeating<00:02:40.319> pattern<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.980> this

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
going to be a repeating pattern to this

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.160 
going to be a repeating pattern to this
and<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:41.640> amorphous<00:02:42.150> right<00:02:42.629> here<00:02:42.959> so

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
and so this is amorphous right here so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.750 
and so this is amorphous right here so
you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.379> see<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.799> made<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.129> silicon<00:02:44.579> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
you can see it's made of silicon and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
you can see it's made of silicon and
oxygen<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:46.290> they're<00:02:46.440> going<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.739> put

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
oxygen but they're going to be put

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.680 
oxygen but they're going to be put
together<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.400> all<00:02:47.519> different<00:02:47.819> shapes<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.599> as

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
together in all different shapes and as

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.270 
together in all different shapes and as
a<00:02:48.720> result<00:02:49.170> we<00:02:49.349> get<00:02:49.530> what's<00:02:49.739> called<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.040> morph

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
a result we get what's called a morph

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.520 
a result we get what's called a morph
it's<00:02:50.489> quartz<00:02:50.970> or<00:02:51.720> sometimes<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.260> call<00:02:52.290> this

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
it's quartz or sometimes we call this

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.500 
it's quartz or sometimes we call this
glassy<00:02:53.069> quartz<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.209> going<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.359> be

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
glassy quartz and so it's going to be

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.449 
glassy quartz and so it's going to be
really<00:02:54.780> brittle<00:02:55.049> really<00:02:55.620> easy<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:56.010> break<00:02:56.190> and

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
really brittle really easy to break and

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.490 
really brittle really easy to break and
so<00:02:56.579> some<00:02:56.819> solids<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.359> rubber<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:58.049> example

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
so some solids like rubber for example

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500 
so some solids like rubber for example
is<00:02:58.709> going<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.160> be<00:02:59.370> an<00:02:59.579> amorphous<00:03:00.030> solid

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
is going to be an amorphous solid

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.509 
is going to be an amorphous solid
doesn't<00:03:01.109> mean<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.410> not<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.620> solid<00:03:02.069> it's

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
doesn't mean that it's not a solid it's

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.190 
doesn't mean that it's not a solid it's
just<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:02.879> going<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.269> as<00:03:03.359> an<00:03:03.480> organized<00:03:04.019> and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
just not going to be as an organized and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.380 
just not going to be as an organized and
if<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.410> look<00:03:04.560> at<00:03:04.650> crystalline<00:03:05.280> structure<00:03:05.760> like

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
if we look at crystalline structure like

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.420 
if we look at crystalline structure like
that<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:06.959> crystalline<00:03:07.560> quartz<00:03:08.129> it's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
that in this crystalline quartz it's

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.979 
that in this crystalline quartz it's
going<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.609> be<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.819> same<00:03:09.030> atoms<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:09.810> see

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
going to be the same atoms you can see

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.210 
going to be the same atoms you can see
but<00:03:10.319> they're<00:03:10.440> arranged<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.069> repeating

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
but they're arranged in a repeating

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.949 
but they're arranged in a repeating
pattern<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.269> now<00:03:12.390> we<00:03:12.450> get<00:03:12.599> these<00:03:12.750> beautiful

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
pattern and now we get these beautiful

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.960 
pattern and now we get these beautiful
crystals<00:03:13.440> right<00:03:13.859> here<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.670> going<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.849> be

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
crystals right here it's going to be

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.420 
crystals right here it's going to be
harder<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> diamond<00:03:16.410> for<00:03:16.680> example<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.310> going

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
harder so a diamond for example is going

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.759 
harder so a diamond for example is going
to<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.669> something<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.569> would<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.109> in<00:03:19.650> a

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
to be something that would be in a

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.039 
to be something that would be in a
crystalline<00:03:20.310> solid<00:03:20.579> as<00:03:20.970> we<00:03:21.690> move<00:03:21.900> into

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
crystalline solid as we move into

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.720 
crystalline solid as we move into
liquids<00:03:22.560> what<00:03:22.739> they<00:03:22.859> can<00:03:23.040> show<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.430> something

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
liquids what they can show is something

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.460 
liquids what they can show is something
called<00:03:23.910> translation<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:24.989> means<00:03:25.230> that

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
called translation so that means that

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.020 
called translation so that means that
let's<00:03:25.709> say<00:03:25.799> we<00:03:25.919> have<00:03:26.010> these<00:03:26.130> water<00:03:26.430> molecules

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
let's say we have these water molecules

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.300 
let's say we have these water molecules
right<00:03:27.299> here<00:03:27.810> they're<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:28.290> locked<00:03:28.859> in<00:03:29.130> those

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
right here they're not locked in those

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.620 
right here they're not locked in those
positions<00:03:29.549> in<00:03:30.000> other<00:03:30.120> words<00:03:30.329> they<00:03:30.480> can

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
positions in other words they can

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.390 
positions in other words they can
translate<00:03:31.049> about<00:03:31.530> each<00:03:31.739> other<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.190> as<00:03:32.370> a

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
translate about each other and as a

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.890 
translate about each other and as a
result<00:03:32.849> liquids<00:03:33.329> are<00:03:33.389> going<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.569> take<00:03:33.780> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
result liquids are going to take the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.170 
result liquids are going to take the
shape<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.290> their<00:03:34.530> container<00:03:34.700> now<00:03:35.700> depending

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
shape of their container now depending

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.610 
shape of their container now depending
on<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.389> forces<00:03:36.900> between<00:03:37.230> those<00:03:37.380> water

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
on the forces between those water

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.080 
on the forces between those water
molecules<00:03:37.739> we're<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.609> have<00:03:38.730> different

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
molecules we're going to have different

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.460 
molecules we're going to have different
properties<00:03:39.299> one<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.930> first<00:03:40.139> ones<00:03:40.349> is

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
properties one of the first ones is

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.979 
properties one of the first ones is
going<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.769> viscosity<00:03:41.639> viscosity<00:03:41.819> is<00:03:42.450> how

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
going to be viscosity viscosity is how

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.559 
going to be viscosity viscosity is how
easily<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.829> liquid<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.370> able<00:03:44.639> to<00:03:44.819> flow<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.389> so

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
easily a liquid is able to flow and so

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.089 
easily a liquid is able to flow and so
right<00:03:45.780> here<00:03:45.989> we've<00:03:46.109> got<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.260> picture<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.650> pitch

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
right here we've got a picture of pitch

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.099 
right here we've got a picture of pitch
pitch<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.090> going<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.419> have<00:03:48.599> really<00:03:49.079> high

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
pitch is going to have really high

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.289 
pitch is going to have really high
viscosity<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:50.400> means<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.730> really<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.120> going

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
viscosity that means it really is going

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.080 
viscosity that means it really is going
to<00:03:51.359> flow<00:03:51.569> at<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.019> real<00:03:52.290> slow<00:03:52.829> rate<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.849> still

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
to flow at a real slow rate it's still

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.129 
to flow at a real slow rate it's still
going<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.359> take<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.660> shape<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.049> container

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
going to take the shape of the container

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.589 
going to take the shape of the container
you<00:03:55.620> can<00:03:55.739> see<00:03:55.950> down<00:03:56.190> here<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.150> something

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
you can see down here and so something

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.569 
you can see down here and so something
that<00:03:57.780> would<00:03:57.959> have<00:03:58.169> for<00:03:58.470> example<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:59.069> real<00:03:59.250> low

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
that would have for example a real low

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.369 
that would have for example a real low
viscosity<00:03:59.790> might<00:04:00.450> be<00:04:00.629> water<00:04:00.959> it's<00:04:01.200> going<00:04:01.319> to

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
viscosity might be water it's going to

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.849 
viscosity might be water it's going to
easily<00:04:02.010> flow<00:04:02.669> um<00:04:03.260> alcohol<00:04:04.260> might<00:04:04.470> be<00:04:04.590> one<00:04:04.739> that

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
easily flow um alcohol might be one that

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.890 
easily flow um alcohol might be one that
has<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> low<00:04:05.250> viscosity<00:04:05.519> another<00:04:06.359> property<00:04:06.720> is

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
has a low viscosity another property is

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.240 
has a low viscosity another property is
going<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.049> be<00:04:07.139> surface<00:04:07.650> tension<00:04:08.010> surface

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
going to be surface tension surface

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.220 
going to be surface tension surface
tension<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.849> going<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.150> be<00:04:09.329> based<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.079> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
tension is going to be based on the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.589 
tension is going to be based on the
intermolecular<00:04:10.620> forces<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.579> liquid<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.150> so

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
intermolecular forces in a liquid and so

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.180 
intermolecular forces in a liquid and so
these<00:04:12.810> different<00:04:13.379> molecules<00:04:13.560> are<00:04:14.010> going<00:04:14.069> to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
these different molecules are going to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.189 
these different molecules are going to
be<00:04:14.310> attracted<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:15.030> one<00:04:15.180> another<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.780> they're

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
be attracted to one another and they're

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.509 
be attracted to one another and they're
also<00:04:16.380> going<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.680> be<00:04:16.829> attracted<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.340> one

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
also going to be attracted to one

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.550 
also going to be attracted to one
another<00:04:17.549> at<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.000> surface<00:04:18.449> and<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:18.930> surface

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
another at the surface and so surface

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.039 
another at the surface and so surface
tension<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.430> going<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.669> be<00:04:20.760> almost<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:21.329> layer

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.170 
tension is going to be almost this layer
of<00:04:22.500> chemical<00:04:23.070> attraction

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
of chemical attraction

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.240 
of chemical attraction
over<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.660> surface<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.229> liquid<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:26.220> a

over the surface of a liquid and so a

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.430 
over the surface of a liquid and so a
water<00:04:26.729> Strider<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.419> this<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.840> able<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.169> float

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
water Strider like this is able to float

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.710 
water Strider like this is able to float
on<00:04:28.590> top<00:04:28.860> of<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.250> surface<00:04:29.699> tension<00:04:29.880> if<00:04:30.509> we

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.300 
on top of that surface tension if we
were<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.900> break<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.410> surface<00:04:31.620> tension<00:04:31.800> one

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
were to break the surface tension one

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.620 
were to break the surface tension one
way<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.669> that<00:04:32.820> would<00:04:32.940> be<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.120> add<00:04:33.360> something

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
way to do that would be to add something

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.360 
way to do that would be to add something
like<00:04:33.870> soap<00:04:34.229> it's<00:04:34.770> going<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:34.979> break<00:04:35.190> those

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
like soap it's going to break those

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.370 
like soap it's going to break those
intermolecular<00:04:35.789> forces<00:04:36.449> and<00:04:36.570> trust<00:04:37.169> me<00:04:37.350> that

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
intermolecular forces and trust me that

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.260 
intermolecular forces and trust me that
water<00:04:37.860> Strider<00:04:38.220> is<00:04:38.310> going<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.520> quickly<00:04:38.820> sink

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
water Strider is going to quickly sink

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.029 
water Strider is going to quickly sink
to<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.479> bottom<00:04:39.509> of<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.900> lake<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.320> then<00:04:40.919> the

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
to the bottom of the lake and then the

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.560 
to the bottom of the lake and then the
last<00:04:41.280> thing<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.580> called<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.090> volume<00:04:42.419> of

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
last thing is called the volume of

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.170 
last thing is called the volume of
mixing<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:43.289> this<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.560> its<00:04:44.310> best<00:04:44.669> easily

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
mixing and this is its best easily

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.640 
mixing and this is its best easily
understood<00:04:45.539> if<00:04:45.660> we<00:04:45.750> use<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> demonstration

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
understood if we use a demonstration

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.200 
understood if we use a demonstration
this<00:04:46.949> is<00:04:47.009> one<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.490> use<00:04:47.669> in<00:04:47.820> my<00:04:47.940> class

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
this is one that I use in my class

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.779 
this is one that I use in my class
imagine<00:04:49.169> I<00:04:49.259> were<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.470> take<00:04:49.650> some<00:04:49.860> pure<00:04:50.220> water

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
imagine I were to take some pure water

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.610 
imagine I were to take some pure water
so<00:04:51.090> we<00:04:51.180> have<00:04:51.270> distilled<00:04:51.690> water<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.410> were<00:04:52.530> to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
so we have distilled water and I were to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.290 
so we have distilled water and I were to
put<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.919> in<00:04:53.039> a<00:04:53.130> graduated<00:04:53.669> cylinder<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.090> I

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
put it in a graduated cylinder and I

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.939 
put it in a graduated cylinder and I
were<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.539> be<00:04:54.600> real<00:04:54.930> precise<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.650> measure<00:04:55.800> at

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
were to be real precise and measure at

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.480 
were to be real precise and measure at
exactly<00:04:56.400> 250<00:04:57.270> milliliters<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.020> water<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.889> were

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
exactly 250 milliliters of water I were

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.520 
exactly 250 milliliters of water I were
then<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.880> take<00:05:00.060> some<00:05:00.330> ethyl<00:05:00.720> alcohol<00:05:00.930> so

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
then to take some ethyl alcohol so

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.230 
then to take some ethyl alcohol so
ethanol<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.699> were<00:05:02.789> to<00:05:02.880> measure<00:05:03.030> out

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
ethanol and I were to measure out

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.870 
ethanol and I were to measure out
exactly<00:05:03.810> 250<00:05:04.530> milliliters<00:05:05.220> of<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.520> as<00:05:05.669> well

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
exactly 250 milliliters of that as well

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.120 
exactly 250 milliliters of that as well
so<00:05:06.120> let's<00:05:06.270> say<00:05:06.389> I'm<00:05:06.479> very<00:05:06.660> precise<00:05:07.139> have<00:05:07.410> 250

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
so let's say I'm very precise have 250

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.770 
so let's say I'm very precise have 250
mils<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.460> each<00:05:08.610> what<00:05:09.270> do<00:05:09.330> you<00:05:09.419> think<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:09.660> going

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
mils of each what do you think is going

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.540 
mils of each what do you think is going
to<00:05:09.870> happen<00:05:10.199> if<00:05:10.289> we<00:05:10.320> combine<00:05:10.800> those<00:05:11.099> two

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
to happen if we combine those two

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.879 
to happen if we combine those two
amounts<00:05:11.970> together<00:05:12.599> in<00:05:12.930> another<00:05:13.050> graduated

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
amounts together in another graduated

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.950 
amounts together in another graduated
cylinder<00:05:14.340> well<00:05:14.970> when<00:05:15.240> you<00:05:15.330> do<00:05:15.509> this<00:05:15.690> if<00:05:15.870> you

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
cylinder well when you do this if you

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.140 
cylinder well when you do this if you
have<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.080> large<00:05:16.349> enough<00:05:16.500> amount<00:05:16.979> you're<00:05:17.910> not

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
have a large enough amount you're not

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.300 
have a large enough amount you're not
going<00:05:18.389> to<00:05:18.449> get<00:05:18.570> 500<00:05:19.080> milliliters<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:19.860> so

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
going to get 500 milliliters and so

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.560 
going to get 500 milliliters and so
that's<00:05:20.490> weird<00:05:20.789> it<00:05:21.060> seems<00:05:21.210> like<00:05:21.449> it

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
that's weird it seems like it

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.420 
that's weird it seems like it
disappeared<00:05:21.840> but<00:05:22.620> really<00:05:22.919> what's<00:05:23.099> going<00:05:23.250> on

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
disappeared but really what's going on

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.580 
disappeared but really what's going on
is<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.880> water<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:24.599> alcohol<00:05:24.870> are<00:05:25.110> able<00:05:25.440> to

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
is the water and the alcohol are able to

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.080 
is the water and the alcohol are able to
fit<00:05:25.860> within<00:05:26.310> each<00:05:26.490> other<00:05:26.639> there's<00:05:26.940> going<00:05:27.030> to

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
fit within each other there's going to

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.870 
fit within each other there's going to
be<00:05:27.180> room<00:05:27.539> within<00:05:28.139> there<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:29.159> that's<00:05:29.460> based

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
be room within there and so that's based

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.909 
be room within there and so that's based
on<00:05:30.030> those<00:05:30.210> intermolecular<00:05:30.599> forces<00:05:31.349> as<00:05:31.680> well

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
on those intermolecular forces as well

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.920 
on those intermolecular forces as well
if<00:05:32.370> we<00:05:32.460> were<00:05:32.580> to<00:05:32.639> combine<00:05:32.820> water<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:33.510> water<00:05:33.720> we

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
if we were to combine water and water we

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.570 
if we were to combine water and water we
get<00:05:34.080> five<00:05:34.260> hundred<00:05:34.409> mils<00:05:34.740> but<00:05:35.070> because<00:05:35.430> we

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
get five hundred mils but because we

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.339 
get five hundred mils but because we
have<00:05:35.729> less<00:05:36.030> attraction<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.780> those<00:05:36.930> alcohol

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
have less attraction in those alcohol

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.839 
have less attraction in those alcohol
and<00:05:37.500> molecules<00:05:37.889> the<00:05:38.070> water<00:05:38.250> molecules<00:05:38.760> can

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
and molecules the water molecules can

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.820 
and molecules the water molecules can
kind<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.210> get<00:05:39.419> in<00:05:39.599> there<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:39.990> so<00:05:40.560> how<00:05:40.680> do<00:05:40.740> we

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
kind of get in there and so how do we

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.920 
kind of get in there and so how do we
look<00:05:41.130> at<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.430> transition<00:05:41.699> from<00:05:42.360> solid<00:05:42.780> to

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
look at that transition from solid to

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.390 
look at that transition from solid to
liquid<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.380> back<00:05:43.590> again<00:05:43.919> we<00:05:44.070> use<00:05:44.220> something

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
liquid and back again we use something

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.920 
liquid and back again we use something
called<00:05:44.550> a<00:05:44.729> heating<00:05:45.090> curve<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.570> so<00:05:45.659> what<00:05:45.810> we

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
called a heating curve and so what we

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.480 
called a heating curve and so what we
have<00:05:46.110> down<00:05:46.289> here<00:05:46.349> is<00:05:46.710> heat<00:05:46.979> so<00:05:47.190> we're<00:05:47.340> adding

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
have down here is heat so we're adding

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.000 
have down here is heat so we're adding
heat<00:05:47.789> in<00:05:48.270> this<00:05:48.539> direction<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:49.349> then<00:05:49.889> we've

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
heat in this direction and then we've

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.469 
heat in this direction and then we've
got<00:05:50.099> the<00:05:50.250> temperature<00:05:50.699> on<00:05:50.849> the<00:05:50.940> side<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.389> the

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
got the temperature on the side and the

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:52.610 
got the temperature on the side and the
heating<00:05:51.720> curve<00:05:51.870> I'm<00:05:52.050> going<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.289> show<00:05:52.380> you<00:05:52.409> is

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
heating curve I'm going to show you is

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.290 
heating curve I'm going to show you is
the<00:05:52.710> heating<00:05:52.979> curve<00:05:53.159> for<00:05:53.490> water<00:05:53.789> so<00:05:54.150> if<00:05:54.210> we

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
the heating curve for water so if we

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.360 
the heating curve for water so if we
look<00:05:54.449> at<00:05:54.539> the<00:05:54.599> heating<00:05:54.900> curve<00:05:55.110> for<00:05:55.440> water<00:05:55.740> it's

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
look at the heating curve for water it's

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.040 
look at the heating curve for water it's
going<00:05:56.520> to<00:05:56.580> look<00:05:56.699> something<00:05:56.940> like<00:05:57.180> that<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.840> so

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
going to look something like that and so

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.320 
going to look something like that and so
what<00:05:58.289> happens<00:05:58.710> below<00:05:59.220> zero<00:05:59.699> degrees<00:05:59.849> Celsius

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
what happens below zero degrees Celsius

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.089 
what happens below zero degrees Celsius
well<00:06:00.900> that's<00:06:01.139> going<00:06:01.289> to<00:06:01.380> be<00:06:01.470> a<00:06:01.500> solid<00:06:01.949> it's

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
well that's going to be a solid it's

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.219 
well that's going to be a solid it's
going<00:06:02.220> to<00:06:02.280> be<00:06:02.370> ice<00:06:02.639> what<00:06:03.389> happens<00:06:03.690> as<00:06:03.840> we<00:06:03.870> go

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
going to be ice what happens as we go

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.080 
going to be ice what happens as we go
above<00:06:04.740> it<00:06:05.009> it's<00:06:05.220> going<00:06:05.430> to<00:06:05.490> turn<00:06:05.669> into<00:06:05.849> water

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
above it it's going to turn into water

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.060 
above it it's going to turn into water
and<00:06:06.389> then<00:06:06.539> above<00:06:06.840> a<00:06:07.050> hundred<00:06:07.169> degrees<00:06:07.620> Celsius

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
and then above a hundred degrees Celsius

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.189 
and then above a hundred degrees Celsius
going<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.340> turn<00:06:08.520> into<00:06:08.699> vapor<00:06:08.940> but<00:06:09.690> why<00:06:09.870> is<00:06:09.930> the

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
going to turn into vapor but why is the

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.649 
going to turn into vapor but why is the
why<00:06:10.590> is<00:06:10.650> it<00:06:10.800> a<00:06:10.860> flat<00:06:11.250> line<00:06:11.580> here<00:06:11.610> seems<00:06:12.479> like

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
why is it a flat line here seems like

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.480 
why is it a flat line here seems like
we're<00:06:12.840> just<00:06:12.990> losing<00:06:13.289> energy<00:06:14.009> in<00:06:14.159> other<00:06:14.280> words

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
we're just losing energy in other words

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.659 
we're just losing energy in other words
we're<00:06:14.610> adding<00:06:15.060> energy<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.539> whole<00:06:15.780> way<00:06:16.169> across

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
we're adding energy the whole way across

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.399 
we're adding energy the whole way across
why<00:06:17.669> isn't<00:06:18.030> the<00:06:18.150> temperature<00:06:18.720> increasing

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
why isn't the temperature increasing

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.129 
why isn't the temperature increasing
here<00:06:19.770> well<00:06:20.280> what's<00:06:20.460> happening<00:06:20.909> is<00:06:21.120> as<00:06:21.479> we<00:06:21.840> move

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
here well what's happening is as we move

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.560 
here well what's happening is as we move
add<00:06:22.349> energy<00:06:22.800> to<00:06:23.070> ice<00:06:23.490> as<00:06:23.820> we<00:06:23.970> reach<00:06:24.240> that<00:06:24.270> point

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
add energy to ice as we reach that point

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.749 
add energy to ice as we reach that point
what<00:06:25.169> we<00:06:25.320> have<00:06:25.500> right<00:06:25.740> here<00:06:25.919> is<00:06:26.039> both<00:06:26.220> ice<00:06:26.430> and

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
what we have right here is both ice and

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.999 
what we have right here is both ice and
water<00:06:26.940> so<00:06:27.449> we<00:06:27.570> see<00:06:27.720> a<00:06:27.750> transition<00:06:28.050> from<00:06:28.860> a

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
water so we see a transition from a

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.370 
water so we see a transition from a
solid<00:06:29.370> to<00:06:29.400> a<00:06:29.520> liquid<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:30.120> so<00:06:30.539> that<00:06:30.690> energy<00:06:31.110> is

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
solid to a liquid and so that energy is

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.519 
solid to a liquid and so that energy is
going<00:06:31.770> into<00:06:32.159> the<00:06:32.669> molecular<00:06:33.419> motion<00:06:33.810> of<00:06:34.200> that

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
going into the molecular motion of that

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.159 
going into the molecular motion of that
solid<00:06:35.010> becoming<00:06:35.370> a<00:06:35.610> liquid<00:06:36.060> likewise<00:06:36.810> where

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
solid becoming a liquid likewise where

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:37.640 
solid becoming a liquid likewise where
is<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:37.380> N

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
is the N

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.469 
is the N
going<00:06:38.070> here<00:06:38.340> it's<00:06:38.460> going<00:06:38.610> into<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.030> energy<00:06:39.210> of

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
going here it's going into the energy of

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.689 
going here it's going into the energy of
those<00:06:39.750> vapour<00:06:40.110> molecules<00:06:40.290> as<00:06:41.009> they<00:06:41.040> jump<00:06:41.490> off

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
those vapour molecules as they jump off

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.730 
those vapour molecules as they jump off
and<00:06:42.000> so<00:06:42.479> as<00:06:42.570> you<00:06:42.690> heat<00:06:42.960> water<00:06:43.259> it's<00:06:43.530> going<00:06:43.650> to

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
and so as you heat water it's going to

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.189 
and so as you heat water it's going to
increase<00:06:44.160> to<00:06:44.370> around<00:06:44.880> 100<00:06:45.479> degrees<00:06:45.540> Celsius

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
increase to around 100 degrees Celsius

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.140 
increase to around 100 degrees Celsius
depending<00:06:46.620> on<00:06:46.740> your<00:06:46.860> elevation<00:06:47.130> but<00:06:47.910> at<00:06:48.000> that

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
depending on your elevation but at that

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.120 
depending on your elevation but at that
point<00:06:48.419> it<00:06:48.630> eventually<00:06:48.900> jumps<00:06:49.410> into<00:06:49.710> a<00:06:49.740> vapor

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
point it eventually jumps into a vapor

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.279 
point it eventually jumps into a vapor
and<00:06:50.520> so<00:06:51.030> we<00:06:51.150> can<00:06:51.270> look<00:06:51.389> at<00:06:51.539> a<00:06:51.570> heating<00:06:51.930> curve<00:06:52.110> to

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
and so we can look at a heating curve to

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.350 
and so we can look at a heating curve to
see<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:52.560> transition<00:06:53.100> between<00:06:53.280> both<00:06:53.789> solid

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
see the transition between both solid

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.510 
see the transition between both solid
and<00:06:54.389> liquid<00:06:54.840> and<00:06:55.289> then<00:06:55.500> our<00:06:55.830> next<00:06:56.009> video<00:06:56.340> which

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
and liquid and then our next video which

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.640 
and liquid and then our next video which
is<00:06:56.550> going<00:06:56.669> to<00:06:56.820> be<00:06:56.940> on<00:06:57.120> gases<00:06:57.750> if<00:06:58.020> we<00:06:58.139> flip<00:06:58.500> this

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
is going to be on gases if we flip this

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.930 
is going to be on gases if we flip this
thing<00:06:58.710> around<00:06:58.979> then<00:06:59.340> we've<00:06:59.490> got<00:06:59.639> just<00:06:59.850> a

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
thing around then we've got just a

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.390 
thing around then we've got just a
cooling<00:07:00.419> curve<00:07:00.750> and<00:07:01.110> then<00:07:01.800> did<00:07:02.160> you<00:07:02.250> learn

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
cooling curve and then did you learn

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.279 
cooling curve and then did you learn
this<00:07:02.669> that<00:07:02.940> we<00:07:03.030> can<00:07:03.150> use<00:07:03.270> a<00:07:03.300> particulate<00:07:03.930> model

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
this that we can use a particulate model

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.680 
this that we can use a particulate model
so<00:07:04.500> we<00:07:04.620> use<00:07:04.740> that<00:07:04.770> model<00:07:05.160> that<00:07:05.400> Paet<00:07:06.090> model<00:07:06.570> to

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
so we use that model that Paet model to

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.120 
so we use that model that Paet model to
explain<00:07:06.810> the<00:07:07.110> difference<00:07:07.410> between<00:07:07.500> solid<00:07:07.919> and

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
explain the difference between solid and

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.890 
explain the difference between solid and
liquid<00:07:08.220> remember<00:07:08.880> that<00:07:09.030> big<00:07:09.240> point<00:07:09.509> is<00:07:09.720> when

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
liquid remember that big point is when

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.090 
liquid remember that big point is when
we<00:07:10.020> move<00:07:10.199> to<00:07:10.229> a<00:07:10.380> liquid<00:07:10.590> they<00:07:10.860> show

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
we move to a liquid they show

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.620 
we move to a liquid they show
translation<00:07:11.789> that<00:07:11.910> can<00:07:12.030> move<00:07:12.150> around<00:07:12.419> each

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
translation that can move around each

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.860 
translation that can move around each
other<00:07:12.840> and<00:07:13.020> I<00:07:13.410> hope<00:07:13.560> that<00:07:13.710> was<00:07:13.830> helpful
