wing under you know a lot of compression
and<00:02:22.079> tire<00:02:22.320> expansion<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.430> what<00:02:23.790> we've

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and tire expansion right and what we've

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.550 
and tire expansion right and what we've
done<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.269> we've<00:02:24.600> figured<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.320> know<00:02:25.380> the
