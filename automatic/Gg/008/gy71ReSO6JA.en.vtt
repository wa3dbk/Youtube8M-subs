00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.930 
max rigging chapter 7 and this chapter
will<00:00:07.950> move<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:09.559> tour<00:00:10.559> support<00:00:11.010> for

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
will move on to the tour support for

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:23.029 
will move on to the tour support for
creating<00:00:12.090> their<00:00:15.470> controllers<00:00:21.199> just<00:00:22.199> align

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
creating their controllers just align

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.169 
creating their controllers just align
them<00:00:26.210> spine<00:00:27.210> bones<00:00:28.640> spirit<00:00:29.640> point<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.029> be

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
them spine bones spirit point to be

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.010 
them spine bones spirit point to be
point<00:00:31.489> right<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:35.000> just<00:00:36.000> scale<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.300> down<00:00:39.020> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
point right now just scale it down so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.080 
point right now just scale it down so
they<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.410> easily<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.770> selected<00:00:41.329> f3

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
they can easily be selected f3

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.310 
they can easily be selected f3
everything<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.239> outside<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> body<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> this

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
everything is outside the body so this

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.600 
everything is outside the body so this
will<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.620> another<00:00:50.280> spine<00:00:50.850> controller<00:00:51.440> and

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
will be another spine controller and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:00.049 
will be another spine controller and
just<00:00:54.140> duplicate<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> copy<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:59.059> align

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
just duplicate this so copy and align

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.039 
just duplicate this so copy and align
this<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.230> next<00:01:05.510> right<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:06.990> will

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
this to the next right now what we will

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.160 
this to the next right now what we will
do<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:08.000> select<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.270> debones<00:01:10.729> animation

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
do is select the debones animation

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.429 
do is select the debones animation
constrain<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.070> Orion<00:01:14.400> constraint<00:01:15.439> select

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
constrain and Orion constraint select

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.640 
constrain and Orion constraint select
the<00:01:17.210> controllers<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> will<00:01:19.409> flip

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the controllers we will see it will flip

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.510 
the controllers we will see it will flip
down<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:21.090> happened<00:01:21.540> because<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:22.619> use<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
down this happened because we use the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.960 
down this happened because we use the
auto<00:01:23.790> setting<00:01:24.090> value<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.740> setting<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.979> can

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
auto setting value or setting so we can

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.190 
auto setting value or setting so we can
fix<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.740> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.509> motion<00:01:36.509> panel<00:01:37.159> and

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
fix this up in the motion panel and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.870 
fix this up in the motion panel and
under<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> rotation<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.369> used<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
under the rotation as we have used the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.460 
under the rotation as we have used the
orientation<00:01:42.479> constraint<00:01:44.659> C<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:46.049> an<00:01:46.170> option

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
orientation constraint C is an option

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.920 
orientation constraint C is an option
called<00:01:46.500> keep<00:01:46.950> initial<00:01:47.520> offset<00:01:47.750> switch<00:01:48.750> on

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
called keep initial offset switch on

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.819 
called keep initial offset switch on
this<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.350> you'll<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.360> problems<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.509> gone

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
this and you'll see the problems be gone

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.580 
this and you'll see the problems be gone
same<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:53.070> will<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.560> next

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
same thing will do with this next

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.859 
same thing will do with this next
joint<00:01:59.009> constraint<00:02:00.009> select<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.539> first<00:02:01.780> you

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
joint constraint select so first you

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.630 
joint constraint select so first you
have<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.020> select<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.439> child<00:02:02.950> one<00:02:03.219> then<00:02:03.490> we

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
have to select the child one then we

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.770 
have to select the child one then we
have<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.880> select<00:02:04.000> with<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.359> controller<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:10.209> now

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
have to select with a controller so now

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.070 
have to select with a controller so now
this<00:02:10.959> has<00:02:11.019> been<00:02:11.580> connected<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.569> thing<00:02:14.049> is

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
this has been connected but the thing is

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.949 
this has been connected but the thing is
you'll<00:02:14.860> see<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.840> rotation<00:02:16.840> has<00:02:16.930> been

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
you'll see that the rotation has been

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.920 
you'll see that the rotation has been
done<00:02:17.290> with<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.680> individual<00:02:18.190> joints<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
done with the individual joints but the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.160 
done with the individual joints but the
entire<00:02:20.140> body<00:02:20.379> is<00:02:20.530> not<00:02:20.769> actually<00:02:21.430> following

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
entire body is not actually following

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.259 
entire body is not actually following
for<00:02:23.170> click<00:02:23.349> for<00:02:23.799> creating<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.430> connection<00:02:24.819> I

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
for click for creating that connection I

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.220 
for click for creating that connection I
have<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.049> select<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:28.140> controller<00:02:29.370> link

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
have to just select the controller link

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.890 
have to just select the controller link
make<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.590> child<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.280> lower<00:02:33.459> one<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.540> right

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
make the child of the lower one so right

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.370 
make the child of the lower one so right
now<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.319> we'll<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:35.709> if<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.430> select<00:02:37.380> this

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
now what we'll see if I select this

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.830 
now what we'll see if I select this
controller<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.099> rotating<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.299> entire<00:02:40.329> body

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
controller and rotating the entire body

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:53.000 
controller and rotating the entire body
or<00:02:41.349> upper<00:02:42.250> body<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:42.610> actually<00:02:42.910> rotating<00:02:44.790> so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.170 

okay<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.420> make<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.170> right<00:02:56.040> click<00:02:56.370> I'll

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
okay I can make this right click I'll

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.149 
okay I can make this right click I'll
try<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.629> please<00:02:58.080> transporation<00:03:01.489> fine<00:03:02.519> and

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
try to please transporation fine and

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.640 
try to please transporation fine and
this<00:03:05.159> is<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> pelvis<00:03:05.640> one<00:03:06.049> sorry<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.260> hip<00:03:07.409> one

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
this is the pelvis one sorry the hip one

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.420 
this is the pelvis one sorry the hip one
and<00:03:09.080> right<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:10.230> I'm<00:03:10.410> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.739> create<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.250> a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and right now I'm going to create the a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
and right now I'm going to create the a
pelvis<00:03:11.910> joint<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.540> pillow<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.110> controlled

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
pelvis joint or pillow is controlled

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.990 
pelvis joint or pillow is controlled
outside<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:15.150> creating<00:03:15.450> pelvis<00:03:16.940> center<00:03:17.940> of

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
outside so for creating pelvis center of

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.229 
outside so for creating pelvis center of
gravity<00:03:18.330> will<00:03:18.959> use<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.709> new<00:03:20.459> star<00:03:20.819> or<00:03:21.180> maybe

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
gravity will use a new star or maybe

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.449 
gravity will use a new star or maybe
rectangle<00:03:21.959> whatever<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.379> want<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.860> use<00:03:25.459> find

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
rectangle whatever you want to use find

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.569 
rectangle whatever you want to use find
and<00:03:28.489> make<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:30.650> maybe<00:03:31.970> five<00:03:32.970> points<00:03:34.489> with<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
and make it maybe five points with the

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.110 
and make it maybe five points with the
six<00:03:35.819> no<00:03:36.030> problem<00:03:36.359> okay<00:03:37.109> now<00:03:37.560> select<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.790> and

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
six no problem okay now select this and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.190 
six no problem okay now select this and
just<00:03:40.019> line<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:41.250> tell<00:03:41.879> this<00:03:43.250> okay<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:45.079> scale<00:03:46.079> it

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
just line to tell this okay and scale it

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.710 
just line to tell this okay and scale it
down<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.440> bit

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
down a bit

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:56.750 
down a bit
f3<00:03:48.739> see<00:03:50.540> visible<00:03:51.739> clearly<00:03:52.739> right<00:03:53.489> now<00:03:55.760> now

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
f3 see visible clearly right now now

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.449 
f3 see visible clearly right now now
what<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.030> will<00:03:57.120> do<00:03:57.950> will<00:03:58.950> not<00:03:58.980> going<00:03:59.400> to

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
what you will do will not going to

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.059 
what you will do will not going to
orient<00:03:59.849> this<00:04:00.389> because<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.799> joint

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
orient this because this is the joint

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.479 
orient this because this is the joint
which<00:04:02.720> through<00:04:03.720> which<00:04:03.870> we<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.530> want<00:04:05.340> to

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
which through which we can I want to

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.199 
which through which we can I want to
move<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.450> entire<00:04:06.480> body<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:08.579> movement<00:04:09.090> is

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
move the entire body the movement is

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.979 
move the entire body the movement is
also<00:04:09.419> will<00:04:10.290> be<00:04:10.470> added<00:04:10.980> towards<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.630> for

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
also will be added towards this so for

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.809 
also will be added towards this so for
creating<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.620> will<00:04:13.799> just<00:04:13.829> simply<00:04:14.340> make

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
creating that I will just simply make

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.870 
creating that I will just simply make
this<00:04:16.729> joint<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.940> child<00:04:18.329> of<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:19.880> controller

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
this joint this child of the controller

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.960 
this joint this child of the controller
so<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.930> controller<00:04:22.289> this<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.560> actually<00:04:23.340> have

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
so the controller this is actually have

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.560 
so the controller this is actually have
the<00:04:24.180> rotation<00:04:24.479> power<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.200> also<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.400> movement

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.580 

so<00:04:31.430> let's<00:04:32.430> see<00:04:32.669> yeah<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:34.050> body<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.380> moving

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
so let's see yeah that body is moving

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.040 
so let's see yeah that body is moving
but<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.700> controllers<00:04:36.210> are<00:04:36.360> not<00:04:36.539> connected

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
but the controllers are not connected

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.740 
but the controllers are not connected
with<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.349> the<00:04:38.190> pelvis<00:04:38.550> so<00:04:39.150> what<00:04:39.419> we<00:04:39.539> will<00:04:39.599> do

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
with the the pelvis so what we will do

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.320 
with the the pelvis so what we will do
is<00:04:39.930> select<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.740> controller<00:04:41.099> I<00:04:41.190> am<00:04:41.400> just<00:04:41.789> the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
is select the controller I am just the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.320 
is select the controller I am just the
hip<00:04:42.479> controller<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.200> just

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
hip controller and just

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:52.720 
hip controller and just
linkages<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:50.680> police<00:04:51.680> one<00:04:51.890> for

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
linkages to the the police one for

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.380 
linkages to the the police one for
linking<00:04:53.180> what<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:53.900> are<00:04:53.990> doing<00:04:54.140> we<00:04:54.530> have<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:55.390> we

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
linking what we are doing we have to we

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:44.369 
linking what we are doing we have to we
have<00:04:56.450> to<00:04:56.540> first<00:04:57.170> select<00:04:57.650> on<00:04:58.160> the

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:44.379 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.279 

as<00:05:45.379> the<00:05:46.069> pelvis<00:05:46.490> is<00:05:46.610> moving<00:05:46.969> so<00:05:47.629> that's<00:05:47.960> what<00:05:48.259> I

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
as the pelvis is moving so that's what I

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:59.950 
as the pelvis is moving so that's what I
wanted<00:05:48.830> and<00:05:49.569> right<00:05:50.569> now<00:05:57.460> shoulder<00:05:58.460> one<00:05:58.639> or<00:05:59.210> the

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
wanted and right now shoulder one or the

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:35.260 
wanted and right now shoulder one or the
clavicle<00:06:00.439> one<00:06:00.589> for<00:06:01.309> clavicle

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:46.809 

okay<00:06:36.789> okay<00:06:37.789> I<00:06:39.039> think<00:06:40.039> I<00:06:40.280> have<00:06:40.460> to<00:06:45.130> okay<00:06:46.130> I<00:06:46.400> just

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
okay okay I think I have to okay I just

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:48.460 
okay okay I think I have to okay I just
break<00:06:47.030> that<00:06:47.300> connection

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
break that connection

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.430 
break that connection
so<00:06:49.190> just<00:06:49.699> select<00:06:50.000> this<00:06:50.330> and<00:06:50.630> just<00:06:50.900> make<00:06:51.199> the

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
so just select this and just make the

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.900 
so just select this and just make the
child<00:06:51.889> of<00:06:56.590> okay

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
child of okay

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.390 
child of okay
I<00:06:58.940> just<00:06:59.539> controls<00:07:00.080> it<00:07:00.319> I<00:07:00.560> push<00:07:00.860> the<00:07:01.009> controls

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 
I just controls it I push the controls

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.659 
I just controls it I push the controls
it<00:07:01.550> for<00:07:01.789> more<00:07:02.240> than<00:07:05.380> mine<00:07:06.380> now<00:07:06.620> this<00:07:06.800> is<00:07:06.949> done

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
it for more than mine now this is done

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:13.960 
it for more than mine now this is done
so<00:07:10.599> now<00:07:11.599> we<00:07:12.080> move<00:07:12.440> on<00:07:12.650> to<00:07:12.830> the<00:07:12.979> clavicle<00:07:13.759> ones

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970 
so now we move on to the clavicle ones

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:19.750 
so now we move on to the clavicle ones
and<00:07:14.560> we'll<00:07:15.560> see<00:07:16.009> in<00:07:16.970> the<00:07:17.120> next<00:07:17.150> chapter
