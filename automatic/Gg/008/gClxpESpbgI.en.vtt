00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.120 

well<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:24.479> actually<00:01:24.690> surprisingly<00:01:25.590> last<00:01:25.890> night

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
well it actually surprisingly last night

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.890 
well it actually surprisingly last night
when<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> started<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.940> up<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> actually<00:01:27.479> turned

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
when I started it up it actually turned

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.800 
when I started it up it actually turned
over<00:01:28.170> quite<00:01:28.440> a<00:01:28.590> bit<00:01:28.710> slowly<00:01:28.979> slower<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.030> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
over quite a bit slowly slower and it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.780 
over quite a bit slowly slower and it
actually<00:01:30.960> whined<00:01:31.380> quite<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.280> more<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.610> belt

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
actually whined quite a bit more to belt

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.149 
actually whined quite a bit more to belt
or<00:01:33.690> power<00:01:33.930> steering<00:01:34.290> pump<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.590> guess<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.950> was

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
or power steering pump I guess that was

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.160 
or power steering pump I guess that was
so<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.270> time<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.540> actually<00:01:36.659> started<00:01:37.020> up

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
so this time it actually started up

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.800 
so this time it actually started up
quite<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.440> bit<00:01:37.619> easier<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.479> got<00:01:39.479> about<00:01:39.600> six
