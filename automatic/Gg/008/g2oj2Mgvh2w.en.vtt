00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.100 
alright next mode up panorama mode a
panorama<00:04:29.160> mode<00:04:29.280> is<00:04:29.550> pretty<00:04:29.820> cool<00:04:30.110> basically

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
panorama mode is pretty cool basically

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.290 
panorama mode is pretty cool basically
you<00:04:31.380> take<00:04:31.710> three<00:04:32.100> shots<00:04:32.370> from<00:04:32.640> left<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.060> right

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
you take three shots from left to right

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.630 
you take three shots from left to right
and<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:34.260> camera<00:04:34.620> will<00:04:34.740> paste<00:04:35.040> them<00:04:35.280> together

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
and the camera will paste them together

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.150 
and the camera will paste them together
so<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:37.170> know<00:04:37.260> you<00:04:37.320> find<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.830> more<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.070> more

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
so it you know you find it more and more

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.010 
so it you know you find it more and more
often<00:04:38.490> on<00:04:38.610> point<00:04:38.850> two<00:04:39.030> cameras<00:04:39.450> not<00:04:39.630> all<00:04:39.840> of

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
often on point two cameras not all of

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.990 
often on point two cameras not all of
them<00:04:40.170> have<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:41.010> nice<00:04:41.370> little<00:04:41.790> feature

to<00:04:42.150> have<00:04:42.510> now<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.230> couple<00:04:44.010> other<00:04:44.190> modes<00:04:44.900> let's

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
to have now a couple other modes let's

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.770 
to have now a couple other modes let's
get<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.380> right<00:04:47.070> here<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.580> ISO<00:04:48.330> mode<00:04:48.570> this
