00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.740 
see in the picture it looks like a funny
car<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> stock<00:01:02.370> car<00:01:05.090> and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.570 

this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.810> probably<00:01:10.320> why<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.890> quit<00:01:11.549> making

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
this is probably why they quit making

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.820 
this is probably why they quit making
PlayStation<00:01:12.570> 1<00:01:12.780> games<00:01:16.369> because<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:18.830> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
PlayStation 1 games because of the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.230 
PlayStation 1 games because of the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.640 

I've<00:03:07.860> hit<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> wall

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.580 

let's<00:03:13.129> see<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.549> kind<00:03:13.819> of<00:03:13.909> the<00:03:14.090> power<00:03:14.840> slide

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
let's see it's kind of the power slide

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.470 
let's see it's kind of the power slide
of<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.730> turn<00:03:17.000> when<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.510> turn<00:03:17.810> so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
of a turn when you turn so

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.890 
of a turn when you turn so
it's<00:03:20.260> kind<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.560> hard<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.129> catch

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.140 

is<00:03:26.019> nothing<00:03:26.470> like<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:27.069> real<00:03:27.099> thing

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.270 

the<00:03:31.540> graphics<00:03:31.959> are<00:03:32.140> pretty<00:03:32.290> decent<00:03:32.620> but

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.970 

for<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:36.910> game<00:03:37.150> made<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.510> 2002<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:38.770> like

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
for a game made in 2002 this is like

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.809 
for a game made in 2002 this is like
NASCAR<00:03:39.370> 99<00:03:40.150> which<00:03:40.450> was<00:03:40.630> made<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:42.030> 98

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
NASCAR 99 which was made in 98

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.179 
NASCAR 99 which was made in 98
so<00:03:45.390> that's<00:03:45.780> about<00:03:46.019> five<00:03:46.469> to<00:03:46.680> six<00:03:46.890> years

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
so that's about five to six years

00:03:47.189 --> 00:04:00.110 
so that's about five to six years
difference<00:03:47.819> that's<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.360> horrible

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.390 

and<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.629> see<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:01.050> makes<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.470> awful<00:04:02.220> noise

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
and you see it makes that awful noise

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.240 
and you see it makes that awful noise
