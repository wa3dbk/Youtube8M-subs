00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.870
 Oh 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.220
 know I am origin 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.870
 so 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.750
 from the 2nd edition I started to 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.180
 participate in this adventure and I believe 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.730
 that I missed it only twice 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.650
 since the birth of the festival and it's 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.050
 because of my work and more because 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.430
 I really arrange myself I put myself in 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.270
 the provisions to be present at 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.670
 each edition 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.130
 so yes I am a very big fan for 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.230
 do not say fanatics there is a catch 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.190
 between the two but that makes the whole 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.680
 difference and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.199
 it's really a very very beautiful 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.519
 adventure in the space of fifteen years 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.629
 now that's it took a real 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.670
 extraordinary dimension every year a 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.769
 new challenge with new 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.510
 artists and is growing more and more 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.930
 I knew the festival there was 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.940
 5000 people and the second year one 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.600
 had fifty thousand etc etc 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.600
 so yes it's special 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.619
 I will finish a series with 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.969
 in the united states with the actor who was playing 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.610
 within 24 hours kiefer sutherland 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.960
 is called touch and I play a priest a 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.030
 Hispanic priests we are in the process of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.469
 make the second season meanwhile 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.179
 I started a new series with 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.520
 the English who turns 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.280
 in belgium and london it's for the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.759
 bbc it's called hayden and I play a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.740
 police officer who investigates the disappearance 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.149
 of a girl is with actors 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.039
 English there is a French actor who 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.929
 called TchÃ©ky Karyo and the rest of it 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.280
 castagne and international so we 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.840
 work hard 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.939
 not easy between europe and america 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.789
 but the lady of lille da as they say 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.189
 will never complain and I am very 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.619
 very happy to be able now 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.239
 to also play roles diametrically 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.989
 opposed to me for a long time 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.159
 I played Maghreb Arabs 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.780
 terrorists finally all that kind of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.459
 character but intelligently I 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.899
 tried to do it intelligently and 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.590
 today now that's it opens 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.000
 and I play priests policemen and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.319
 maybe one day a Moroccan 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.790
 anyway I would like it from the bottom of 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.109
 heart and I throw a call from elsewhere 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.150
 to all young Moroccan filmmakers 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.190
 do not hesitate because the fact that I 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.840
 works in America they think I 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.000
 am inaccessible because if they 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.769
 think that is expensive and that and 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.690
 that blah blah and blah blah blah finally 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.079
 no we are first and foremost 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.850
 Human being 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.560
 we are actors we are all 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.139
 God's children after that is the project 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.630
 who defines it's not the budget it's 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.760
 really the role that will propose me 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.950
 the story that will be offered to me and not 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.379
 the sum of the budget I'm still 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.000
 very sensitive to all this and I would like 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.299
 to make a Moroccan film in not very 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.099
 long time 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.689
 the last one I did was ali 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.939
 zaoua who was a very very beautiful 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.950
 adventure is a very good memory and he 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.970
 pulls aside that I will reconnect with the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.620
 Moroccan cinema but it's a story 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.280
 of time what and dating actually 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.280
 especially meetings
