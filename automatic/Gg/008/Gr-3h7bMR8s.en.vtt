00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
maybe that's my knife saving up thing

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
maybe that's my knife saving up thing
right<00:01:36.659> now<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.350> said<00:01:37.530> before<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
right now but as I said before this

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.280 
right now but as I said before this
applicator<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.090> super<00:01:39.509> duper<00:01:39.630> thin<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
applicator is like super duper thin and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
applicator is like super duper thin and
so<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.619> pretty<00:01:40.799> easy<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> use<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so it's pretty easy for me to use you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
so it's pretty easy for me to use you
can<00:01:42.299> apply<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> line<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.740> thin

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
can apply a line that it's this thin

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.249 
can apply a line that it's this thin
it's<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.579> millimeter<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.140> don't

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
it's like one millimeter and so I don't

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.899 
it's like one millimeter and so I don't
know<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.369> thinner<00:01:47.610> look

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
know I just like kind of a thinner look

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
know I just like kind of a thinner look
sometimes<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.040> if

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
sometimes and so I like this and then if

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.530 
sometimes and so I like this and then if
you<00:01:50.310> want<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> thicker<00:01:50.970> look<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.390> can

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you want like a thicker look you can

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.510 
you want like a thicker look you can
just<00:01:51.570> press<00:01:51.899> down<00:01:52.140> harder<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.189> goes<00:01:53.340> on

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
just press down harder and it goes on

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.340 
just press down harder and it goes on
thicker<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.970> course<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.869> isn't<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
thicker of course but this isn't like a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.620 
thicker of course but this isn't like a
felt<00:01:55.710> tip<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.850> flexible<00:01:57.420> it's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
felt tip so it's not as flexible it's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.200 
felt tip so it's not as flexible it's
more<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> calligraphy<00:01:59.670> brush<00:01:59.939> or

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
more like a like a calligraphy brush or

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.480 
more like a like a calligraphy brush or
something<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.960> yeah<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.009> felt<00:02:02.250> tip

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.759 
like put this on over it so I just start
off<00:03:43.940> here<00:03:44.120> by<00:03:44.299> taking<00:03:44.510> my<00:03:44.810> liner<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.440> drawing

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
off here by taking my liner and drawing

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.550 
off here by taking my liner and drawing
a<00:03:45.860> completely<00:03:46.430> straight<00:03:46.820> line<00:03:47.480> across<00:03:47.900> my<00:03:48.019> lid

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
a completely straight line across my lid

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.280 
a completely straight line across my lid
and<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:49.250> also<00:03:49.489> with<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.150> regular<00:03:50.540> liner<00:03:50.750> I'll<00:03:51.049> do

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
and I also with a regular liner I'll do

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.440 
and I also with a regular liner I'll do
my<00:03:51.650> tight<00:03:52.010> line<00:03:52.220> underneath<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.150> makes<00:03:53.299> my

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
my tight line underneath so it makes my

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.970 
my tight line underneath so it makes my
lashes<00:03:53.660> look<00:03:53.870> fuller<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.860> definitely

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
lashes look fuller and it definitely

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.770 
lashes look fuller and it definitely
looks<00:03:55.370> fuller<00:03:55.580> with<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:55.910> top<00:03:56.120> liner<00:03:56.360> effect

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
looks fuller with the top liner effect

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.390 
looks fuller with the top liner effect
and<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.410> here<00:03:57.650> I'm<00:03:57.799> just<00:03:57.860> making<00:03:58.250> sure

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
and so here I'm just making sure

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.520 
and so here I'm just making sure
everything's<00:03:58.850> even<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.330> filled<00:03:59.540> in<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.959> then

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
everything's even and filled in and then

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.830 
everything's even and filled in and then
I<00:04:00.620> start<00:04:00.890> crossing<00:04:01.250> over<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.060> diagonal<00:04:02.420> line

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
I start crossing over in a diagonal line

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.199 
I start crossing over in a diagonal line
and<00:04:03.110> then<00:04:03.560> I'm<00:04:03.680> gonna<00:04:03.769> start<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.430> form<00:04:04.760> kind<00:04:05.090> of

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
and then I'm gonna start to form kind of

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.600 
and then I'm gonna start to form kind of
a<00:04:05.330> triangle<00:04:05.989> here<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.320> then<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.799> just<00:04:07.010> fill<00:04:07.430> it

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
a triangle here and then I just fill it

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.270 
a triangle here and then I just fill it
in<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:08.000> that's<00:04:08.420> how<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.630> do<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:09.049> and<00:04:09.380> then<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.160> do

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
in and that's how I do it and then to do

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.780 
in and that's how I do it and then to do
my<00:04:10.430> other<00:04:10.610> eye<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:10.910> see<00:04:11.570> where<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.870> finished<00:04:12.320> my

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
my other eye I see where I finished my

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.789 
my other eye I see where I finished my
and<00:04:13.120> then<00:04:13.299> I<00:04:13.390> kind<00:04:13.629> of<00:04:13.719> estimate<00:04:14.349> where<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.709> is

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
and then I kind of estimate where it is

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.770 
and then I kind of estimate where it is
on<00:04:15.040> my<00:04:15.129> other<00:04:15.280> eye<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.209> draw<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.419> tiny

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
on my other eye and just draw a tiny

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.629 
on my other eye and just draw a tiny
little<00:04:17.019> dot<00:04:17.320> right<00:04:17.590> there<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.100> then<00:04:18.609> I

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
little dot right there and then I

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.129 
little dot right there and then I
started<00:04:18.970> doing<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.299> same<00:04:19.539> thing<00:04:19.870> just

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
started doing the same thing just

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.080 
started doing the same thing just
drawing<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.590> completely<00:04:21.130> straight<00:04:21.489> line<00:04:21.789> and

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
drawing a completely straight line and

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.090 
drawing a completely straight line and
making<00:04:22.750> sure<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.139> everything<00:04:23.590> is<00:04:23.800> nice<00:04:24.039> and

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
making sure that everything is nice and

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.730 
making sure that everything is nice and
filled<00:04:24.970> in<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.330> even<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.930> then<00:04:26.380> again<00:04:26.710> I

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
filled in and even and then again I

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.340 
filled in and even and then again I
start<00:04:27.160> crossing<00:04:27.430> over<00:04:27.729> diagonally<00:04:28.509> in<00:04:29.050> kind

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
start crossing over diagonally in kind

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.890 
start crossing over diagonally in kind
of<00:04:29.470> making<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:30.180> triangle<00:04:31.180> sort<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.600> just
