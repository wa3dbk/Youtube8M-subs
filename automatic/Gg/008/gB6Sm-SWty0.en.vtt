00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
quite small when he was born I think let

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.440 
quite small when he was born I think let
me<00:02:00.210> look<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:00.990> notes

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
I see he was 2.7 kilos at birth because

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.740 
I see he was 2.7 kilos at birth because
he<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.039> small<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.610> feeling<00:02:08.030> slowly<00:02:08.360> it's

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
he is so small and feeling slowly it's

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.140 
he is so small and feeling slowly it's
