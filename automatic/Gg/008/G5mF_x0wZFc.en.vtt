00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
hello my name is Joaquin Ian I would

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.730 
hello my name is Joaquin Ian I would
like<00:00:20.710> to<00:00:20.949> show<00:00:21.310> you<00:00:21.340> a<00:00:22.029> small<00:00:22.529> amplifier

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
like to show you a small amplifier

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.960 
like to show you a small amplifier
I<00:00:23.920> bought<00:00:25.140> battery<00:00:26.140> drive<00:00:26.560> driven<00:00:27.100> to<00:00:27.400> play<00:00:27.910> in

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
I bought battery drive driven to play in

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.450 
I bought battery drive driven to play in
the<00:00:28.120> streets<00:00:29.100> this<00:00:30.100> one<00:00:30.580> our<00:00:31.090> tech<00:00:31.450> and<00:00:32.460> let's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
the streets this one our tech and let's

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.549 
the streets this one our tech and let's
hear<00:00:33.760> now<00:00:33.789> how<00:00:34.180> it<00:00:34.329> sounds<00:00:34.690> first<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:35.020> will<00:00:35.260> let

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
hear now how it sounds first I will let

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.540 
hear now how it sounds first I will let
play<00:00:36.489> with<00:00:38.789> sure<00:00:39.789> green<00:00:40.179> bullet<00:00:40.539> microphone

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
play with sure green bullet microphone

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.889 
play with sure green bullet microphone
from<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.670> 1980s<00:00:43.390> with<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.899> original<00:00:44.859> element

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
from the 1980s with the original element

00:00:45.899 --> 00:01:21.580 
from the 1980s with the original element
it's<00:00:46.899> a<00:00:47.079> vintage

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.740 

then<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:22.920> try<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.240> stick<00:01:24.240> Mike<00:01:26.570> it's<00:01:27.570> an

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
then I will try this stick Mike it's an

00:01:27.750 --> 00:02:07.999 
then I will try this stick Mike it's an
ultimate<00:01:29.390> five<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.690> five<00:01:30.990> sure

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.330 

this<00:02:09.009> one<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.520> have<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.940> crystal<00:02:10.720> element<00:02:11.340> inside

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
this one I have a crystal element inside

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.500 
this one I have a crystal element inside
it's<00:02:12.580> an<00:02:12.820> MC<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.840> five<00:02:14.260> one<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.030> one<00:02:16.270> is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
it's an MC one five one and this one is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's an MC one five one and this one is
actually<00:02:17.550> XLR<00:02:18.930> connector<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.680> with<00:02:20.890> this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
actually XLR connector but with this

00:02:21.010 --> 00:03:12.900 
actually XLR connector but with this
adapter<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:24.330> use<00:02:25.330> this

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.699 

so<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.330> little<00:03:15.080> amplifier<00:03:15.349> is<00:03:17.410> called<00:03:18.410> our

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
so this little amplifier is called our

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.430 
so this little amplifier is called our
tech<00:03:19.420> PMD<00:03:20.420> 3<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:22.640> think<00:03:23.000> it's<00:03:23.209> 20<00:03:23.930> watt<00:03:24.080> or

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
tech PMD 3 and I think it's 20 watt or

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.620 
tech PMD 3 and I think it's 20 watt or
so

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
so

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.000 
so
normal<00:03:26.630> tube<00:03:26.870> that's<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.800> course<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:29.980> take<00:03:30.980> a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
normal tube that's of course and take a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.449 
normal tube that's of course and take a
look<00:03:31.250> here<00:03:36.610> here<00:03:37.610> we<00:03:38.060> have<00:03:38.180> three<00:03:38.540> different

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
look here here we have three different

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.620 
look here here we have three different
channels<00:03:42.160> here<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.310> have<00:03:43.489> what<00:03:44.030> i<00:03:44.060> use<00:03:44.390> for

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
channels here we have what i use for

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.070 
channels here we have what i use for
harmonica<00:03:45.200> is<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.620> high<00:03:46.310> impedance<00:03:46.900> input

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.210 

have<00:03:51.080> gain<00:03:51.880> treble<00:03:52.880> bass<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:55.420> level<00:03:57.099> for<00:03:58.099> the

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
have gain treble bass and level for the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.940 
have gain treble bass and level for the
channel<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:59.170> also<00:04:00.730> overall<00:04:01.730> level<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.950> volume

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
channel and also overall level of volume

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.490 
channel and also overall level of volume
and<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:06.739> next<00:04:07.040> channel<00:04:07.489> is<00:04:08.079> low<00:04:09.079> impedance

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
and the next channel is low impedance

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.640 
and the next channel is low impedance
for<00:04:10.130> XLR<00:04:11.859> or<00:04:12.859> low<00:04:13.130> impedance<00:04:13.519> for<00:04:14.650> guitar

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
for XLR or low impedance for guitar

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.590 
for XLR or low impedance for guitar
cable<00:04:19.419> here<00:04:20.419> we<00:04:20.570> have<00:04:20.750> we<00:04:21.470> can<00:04:21.739> connect<00:04:22.100> the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
cable here we have we can connect the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.130 
cable here we have we can connect the
mp3<00:04:23.600> player<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:24.970> also<00:04:25.970> one<00:04:26.180> another<00:04:26.690> low

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
mp3 player and also one another low

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.790 
mp3 player and also one another low
impedance<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:28.690> have<00:04:29.690> not<00:04:29.870> used<00:04:30.260> these<00:04:30.680> ones<00:04:30.950> so

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
impedance I have not used these ones so

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.140 
impedance I have not used these ones so
this<00:04:33.800> is<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.070> only<00:04:34.310> one<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.490> use<00:04:34.729> for<00:04:34.760> harmonic

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
this is the only one I use for harmonic

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.090 
this is the only one I use for harmonic
5<00:04:36.050> out<00:04:36.380> of<00:04:36.410> 10

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
a channel volume level at 40% but the

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.909 
a channel volume level at 40% but the
overall<00:04:48.620> volume<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.820> not<00:04:50.810> much<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.289> can<00:04:51.440> turn<00:04:51.830> it

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
overall volume is not much I can turn it

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.110 
overall volume is not much I can turn it
up<00:04:52.300> much<00:04:53.300> more<00:04:53.570> if<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.650> needed<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.010> but<00:04:55.340> of

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
up much more if I needed to but of

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.790 
up much more if I needed to but of
course<00:04:56.360> then<00:04:56.600> I<00:04:56.630> would<00:04:56.870> get<00:04:57.020> feedback<00:04:57.500> with

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
course then I would get feedback with

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.230 
course then I would get feedback with
this<00:04:58.180> amount<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.419> gain<00:04:59.860> here<00:05:00.860> is<00:05:00.889> also<00:05:01.490> line

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
this amount of gain here is also line
