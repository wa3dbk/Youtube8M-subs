00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590

booth<00:03:37.250> has<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.549> gorilla<00:03:37.909> glass<00:03:38.709> too<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.040> this

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
booth has a gorilla glass too so this

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.399

resistance<00:03:43.099> so<00:03:43.939> that's<00:03:44.299> not<00:03:44.480> gonna<00:03:44.629> like<00:03:45.079> give

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
resistance so that's not gonna like give

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.789 
resistance so that's not gonna like give
you<00:03:46.000> there<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.090> no<00:03:47.209> advantage<00:03:50.109> on<00:03:51.109> each<00:03:51.500> other

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
you there is no advantage on each other

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.940 
you there is no advantage on each other
so<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.970> both<00:03:53.150> has<00:03:53.389> sense<00:03:53.659> of<00:03:53.840> light<00:03:54.079> so<00:03:54.889> you

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
so and it both has sense of light so you

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.599 
so and it both has sense of light so you
can<00:03:55.190> see<00:03:55.670> everything<00:03:56.120> clearly<00:03:56.450> with<00:03:57.139> the<00:03:57.609> with

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
can see everything clearly with the with

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.819 
can see everything clearly with the with
the<00:03:58.700> phone<00:03:58.940> with<00:03:59.299> no<00:03:59.480> problems<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.470> camera

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
the phone with no problems the camera

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.129 
the phone with no problems the camera
with<00:04:01.989> Samsung<00:04:02.989> Galaxy<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:05.299> good<00:04:05.540> camera<00:04:05.930> but

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
with Samsung Galaxy it's good camera but

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.869 
with Samsung Galaxy it's good camera but
the<00:04:06.230> megapixel<00:04:06.859> that's<00:04:07.040> about<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.459> same<00:04:07.609> for

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
the megapixel that's about the same for

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.509 
the megapixel that's about the same for
the<00:04:08.030> back<00:04:08.209> camera<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:09.709> features<00:04:10.069> it<00:04:10.220> might<00:04:10.400> be

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
the back camera the features it might be

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.129 
the back camera the features it might be
different<00:04:10.939> you<00:04:11.359> know<00:04:11.480> what<00:04:11.569> I<00:04:11.599> mean<00:04:11.720> with<00:04:11.989> this

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
different you know what I mean with this

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.449

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
Samsung Galaxy it has the mode so you

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.580 
Samsung Galaxy it has the mode so you
can<00:04:16.729> choose<00:04:16.970> which<00:04:17.299> way<00:04:17.539> you<00:04:17.599> want<00:04:17.989> like<00:04:18.289> mode

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
can choose which way you want like mode

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.969 
can choose which way you want like mode
but<00:04:18.829> this<00:04:18.979> one<00:04:19.160> has<00:04:19.400> some<00:04:19.729> watts<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.810> but<00:04:21.560> it

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
but this one has some watts to but it

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.920 
but this one has some watts to but it
might<00:04:22.130> be<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.940> quality<00:04:23.270> makes<00:04:23.599> a<00:04:23.750> big

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
might be the quality makes a big

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.969 
might be the quality makes a big
difference<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:26.630> think<00:04:27.410> that's<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.770> for
