culture<00:02:04.290> today<00:02:04.580> it's<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:06.000> way<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.390> connect

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
culture today it's the way we connect

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.999 
culture today it's the way we connect
with<00:02:07.170> people<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.100> way<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.729> think<00:02:10.009> we

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
with people it's the way that I think we

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.010 
with people it's the way that I think we
even<00:02:11.250> earn<00:02:11.520> some<00:02:11.850> respect<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:12.840> they

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
even earn some respect you know if they

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.460 
even earn some respect you know if they
come<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:14.280> worship<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:16.260> can

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
come in to worship and you can

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.870 
come in to worship and you can
communicate<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.310> way<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.730> they're

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
communicate in a way that they're

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.210 
communicate in a way that they're
familiar<00:02:18.090> with<00:02:18.599> they<00:02:18.870> understand<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.650> think

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
familiar with they understand I think

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.680 
familiar with they understand I think
they're<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> little<00:02:20.459> bit<00:02:20.610> more<00:02:20.700> willing<00:02:21.600> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
they're a little bit more willing to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.570 
they're a little bit more willing to
listen<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.140> what<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.319> have<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> say<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.100> think

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
listen to what we have to say I think

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.860 
listen to what we have to say I think
the<00:02:23.670> church<00:02:23.850> needs<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.180> kind<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.390> adjust<00:02:24.510> their

the<00:02:50.819> church<00:02:51.060> obviously<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.290> more<00:02:53.160> pronounced

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
the church obviously is more pronounced

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.099 
the church obviously is more pronounced
than<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.850> ever<00:02:53.940> has<00:02:54.150> been<00:02:54.329> before<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.079> you

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
than it ever has been before but if you

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.720 
than it ever has been before but if you
think<00:02:55.380> about<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.890> fact<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.160> somebody<00:02:56.519> wrote

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
think about the fact that somebody wrote

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
think about the fact that somebody wrote
scripture<00:02:57.180> down<00:02:57.390> at<00:02:58.019> one<00:02:58.170> point<00:02:58.350> time<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.680> mean

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
scripture down at one point time I mean

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.170 
scripture down at one point time I mean
I<00:02:59.040> guess<00:02:59.220> God<00:02:59.430> was<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.700> first<00:02:59.880> one<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.150> use

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
I guess God was the first one to use

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.310 
I guess God was the first one to use
media<00:03:00.480> when<00:03:00.750> he<00:03:00.810> wrote<00:03:00.930> down<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.109> Ten

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
media when he wrote down the Ten

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.860 
media when he wrote down the Ten
Commandments<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:02.760> then<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.299> new<00:03:03.480> media<00:03:03.810> of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
Commandments and then the new media of

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.990 
Commandments and then the new media of
the<00:03:04.049> day<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.470> Rome<00:03:04.680> was<00:03:05.070> when<00:03:05.609> they<00:03:05.700> wrote<00:03:05.880> it

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the day in Rome was when they wrote it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.449 
the day in Rome was when they wrote it
on<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.049> scroll<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.220> now

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
on a you know on a scroll and so now

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.160 
on a you know on a scroll and so now
here<00:03:08.730> we<00:03:08.760> are<00:03:08.970> we<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.299> tell<00:03:09.480> people's<00:03:09.750> stories

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
here we are we can tell people's stories

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.550 
here we are we can tell people's stories
which<00:03:10.980> really<00:03:11.310> provide<00:03:11.700> hope<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.410> then

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
which really provide hope and and then

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.800 
which really provide hope and and then
with<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.280> broadcast<00:03:14.910> aspect<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.570> as

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
with the broadcast aspect to that as

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.140 
with the broadcast aspect to that as
well<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.590> can<00:03:16.829> take<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.459> message<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.000> hope

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
well you can take that message of hope

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.820 
well you can take that message of hope
and<00:03:18.269> put<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.570> out<00:03:18.690> quicker<00:03:19.620> than<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
and put it out quicker than the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.580 
and put it out quicker than the
any<00:03:21.340> other<00:03:21.670> form<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.360> communication<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:23.200> do

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
any other form of communication I do

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.580 
any other form of communication I do
think<00:03:24.040> there<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.400> danger<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:26.470> know

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
think there is a danger that you know

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.620 
think there is a danger that you know
media<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.070> tool<00:03:27.100> that's<00:03:27.790> really<00:03:28.090> all<00:03:28.270> it<00:03:28.300> is

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
media is a tool that's really all it is

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.370 
media is a tool that's really all it is
but<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:30.700> become<00:03:31.210> too<00:03:31.450> enamored<00:03:31.900> with<00:03:32.080> the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
but you can become too enamored with the

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.070 
but you can become too enamored with the
tool<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.650> forget<00:03:33.370> your<00:03:34.180> bigger<00:03:34.420> purpose<00:03:34.750> of

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
tool and forget your bigger purpose of

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.990 
tool and forget your bigger purpose of
trying<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.350> communicate<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:36.610> know<00:03:36.730> the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
trying to communicate you know the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.110 
trying to communicate you know the
message<00:03:37.570> of<00:03:37.720> Jesus<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:39.790> that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
message of Jesus and so it's that

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.260 
message of Jesus and so it's that
balancing<00:03:40.750> act<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.550> when<00:03:42.550> is<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.910> media

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
balancing act of when is the media

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.270 
balancing act of when is the media
serving<00:03:43.750> our<00:03:43.900> purposes<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.740> when<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.100> it

people as well and I think that's

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.850 
people as well and I think that's
something<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.170> have<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.320> constantly

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
something you have to constantly

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.410 
something you have to constantly
evaluate<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:07.270> be<00:04:07.450> sensitive<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.170> but<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.460> would

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
evaluate and be sensitive to but I would

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.340 
evaluate and be sensitive to but I would
say<00:04:10.630> for<00:04:10.900> most<00:04:11.110> churches<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:13.600> far<00:04:14.110> greater

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
say for most churches the far greater

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.830 
say for most churches the far greater
danger<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.130> not<00:04:15.430> utilizing<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.180> enough<00:04:16.540> I

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
danger is not utilizing it enough I

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.960 
danger is not utilizing it enough I
think<00:04:17.680> a<00:04:17.739> church<00:04:18.070> needs<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.489> weigh<00:04:18.730> their

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970

it well you got to do media with
excellence<00:04:55.030> or<00:04:55.330> you<00:04:56.050> lose<00:04:56.320> all<00:04:56.770> the
