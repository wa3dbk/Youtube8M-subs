00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello friends christians had from 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.759
 swiss-ski and today again 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.350
 representing the youngsters in the trade 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.800
 with the sixth episode of ours 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.290
 trading tips yes we have in this 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.199
 We have mainly and three followers 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.119
 so I have games in general 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.390
 This week not so much from cereal 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.279
 the reason because vacation had and there have 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 I preferred to play feverishly 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.310
 hanging around in the web, I say 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.759
 now and the three are playing it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.329
 itself is today the first states 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.940
 even that is a silvery striker of the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.270
 The year can be short for under 700 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.160
 then shop for 1000 100 coins 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.180
 By the way, there is still a sale here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 few games with which I sometimes 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.550
 a little bit of trading and noticed 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.579
 is that just being priced by 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.500
 certain people do not have me 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.300
 it just had to go down that you 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 whatever price is fixed by it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.189
 the simply times bought cheap and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.900
 again sold very expensive so very nice 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.720
 I made profits with the players 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.659
 could definitely look 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.310
 maybe also mars and cheap 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.869
 So players will see the direction 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.720
 the ones in the background are like that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.310
 Mary and Max at the second game 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.619
 I want to go 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.650
 apologize for the pronunciation of 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.570
 second game is heuberg I do not know 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.380
 whether it was pronounced correctly 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.750
 the big player of bayern munich den 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.270
 come buy 400,000 short so 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.740
 mostly and selling 4007 and art 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.659
 or what is also the case that a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.509
 the big part of the card is you can 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.439
 buy it for about 1700 and then 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.409
 selling for 2500 2016 always comes 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.159
 on how many contracts fitness the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.799
 player still has then the last player 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.439
 the Bernese is also a bronze player 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.120
 a defender of the man for 700 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.130
 konz can shop and 4000 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.170
 can sell sometimes you get the 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.570
 even cheaper because are just 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.510
 play bronze because do not always look 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.270
 Everyone in the market comes and comes 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.270
 but sometimes a foot even 300 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.530
 or so shopping with them 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:30.190
 These josef play fairly large 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.510
 profit potential and i am seeing im now 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.110
 background games now 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.970
 I sold that pretty much 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.980
 robertson from the last episode and the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.130
 we still have two fcz jerseys 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.830
 the problem is what he sells 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.080
 really want to say that you can already see 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.850
 on the balance that's not at all 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.790
 can vote and that is because 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:56.350
 yes yes from my main account certain 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.340
 I have the player at the price pixeln and 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.130
 So I wanted to ask if I have one 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.230
 other than that, I'm different now 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.610
 At times videos make small 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.770
 There is no question that she yes 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.690
 can see the profit and through the 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.340
 I did not want to give the place 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.280
 idea that i had my trading 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.830
 tactics with 2.5 million points on mine 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.870
 have made or make known 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.600
 should be so until I get the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.150
 pressed players have sold if I am 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.680
 the reveal so you will see 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.000
 will not bring anything that much 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.510
 I can tell you even if you 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.980
 The tactics you know will not be 25 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.350
 you will make millions 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.270
 probably do not do any art 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.890
 if likely to always lose 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.330
 even because the players are so 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.900
 Do you make normal profits like 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.709
 play you you now have with 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.780
 500,000 art equal to 2000 at most 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.080
 lose weight otherwise these are not 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.380
 make players or 50k profit or so 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.750
 and yes in the next video I'm going to 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.220
 I then do voting video what 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.310
 She would rather see if it continues 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.700
 simply to accept players from you 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.820
 or not or if he has my trading 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.700
 tactics should bet that 's it from then 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.620
 these short sentences follow ours 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.609
 Trading tip you hope you had fun 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.609
 See you next time
