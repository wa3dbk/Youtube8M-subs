mixed coat at UK thanks for watching

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.349 
mixed coat at UK thanks for watching
this<00:00:04.170> video<00:00:04.529> all<00:00:05.460> it<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:05.970> we<00:00:06.150> get<00:00:06.330> a

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
this video all it is is that we get a

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.120 
this video all it is is that we get a
lot<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.540> people<00:00:06.870> phone<00:00:07.109> us<00:00:07.259> up<00:00:07.470> because

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
lot of people phone us up because

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.259 
lot of people phone us up because
they're<00:00:08.519> finding<00:00:08.730> when<00:00:08.910> they're<00:00:09.030> doing<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
they're finding when they're doing a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.360 
they're finding when they're doing a
mobile<00:00:09.630> disco<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.800> they're<00:00:11.010> getting<00:00:11.309> an

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
mobile disco that they're getting an

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.580 
mobile disco that they're getting an
unwanted<00:00:11.880> hum<00:00:12.210> or<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> buzz<00:00:13.049> through<00:00:13.410> their

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
unwanted hum or a buzz through their

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.010 
unwanted hum or a buzz through their
sound<00:00:13.860> system<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:15.540> obvious<00:00:15.839> thing<00:00:15.990> that

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
sound system the obvious thing that

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.510 
sound system the obvious thing that
people<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.470> blame<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.100> speakers

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
people do is blame up on the speakers

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.650 
people do is blame up on the speakers
maybe<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.000> speakers<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
maybe it's the speakers it's the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.140 
maybe it's the speakers it's the
amplifier<00:00:19.170> more<00:00:19.920> often<00:00:20.310> than<00:00:20.460> not<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.760> isn't

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
amplifier more often than not it isn't

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.670 
amplifier more often than not it isn't
and<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> fact<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.439> you're

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and what it is is the fact that you're

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.070 
and what it is is the fact that you're
using<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.189> laptop<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.939> conjunction<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.630> your

using a laptop in conjunction with your
music<00:00:25.859> system<00:00:26.180> now<00:00:27.180> with<00:00:28.080> your<00:00:28.619> normal

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
music system now with your normal

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
music system now with your normal
equipment<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.550> your<00:00:29.760> amplifier<00:00:30.300> your<00:00:30.630> mixer

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
equipment like your amplifier your mixer

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.350 
equipment like your amplifier your mixer
all<00:00:31.500> that's<00:00:31.740> within<00:00:31.920> your<00:00:32.189> lighting<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.210> all

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
all that's within your lighting it all

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.270 
all that's within your lighting it all
shares<00:00:33.780> almost<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> common<00:00:34.950> type<00:00:35.250> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
shares almost like a common type of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.880 
shares almost like a common type of
impedance<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> ground<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
impedance on the ground now with a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.680 
impedance on the ground now with a
laptop<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.640> slightly<00:00:38.910> different<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
laptop it's slightly different and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.209 
laptop it's slightly different and
that's<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.320> comes<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.100> them

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that's where it comes in you get them

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.119 
that's where it comes in you get them
like<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> mismatch<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.750> impedance<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
like a mismatch of the impedance in it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.440 
like a mismatch of the impedance in it
means<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.579> you'll<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:44.940> getting<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
means that you'll actually getting in a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.229 
means that you'll actually getting in a
buzz<00:00:45.780> or<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> hum<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:46.980> sound<00:00:47.190> system<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
buzz or a hum for your sound system you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
buzz or a hum for your sound system you
probably<00:00:48.539> remember<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:49.140> ID<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.620> 20<00:00:50.039> years

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
probably remember like ID like 20 years

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.299 
probably remember like ID like 20 years
ago<00:00:50.370> when<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> boy<00:00:51.090> racer<00:00:52.039> put<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> big

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
ago when I was a boy racer put a big

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
ago when I was a boy racer put a big
pair<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.360> car<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.379> used

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
pair of in the back of my car and I used

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.229 
pair of in the back of my car and I used
to<00:00:55.680> find<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.610> used<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> rev<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to find is that when I used to rev the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
to find is that when I used to rev the
engine<00:00:57.270> up<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.350> actual<00:00:58.710> noise<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.399> actual

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
engine up the actual noise the actual

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
engine up the actual noise the actual
buzz<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> sound<00:01:00.809> system<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.289> increase

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
buzz for the sound system would increase

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
buzz for the sound system would increase
or<00:01:01.890> decrease<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.520> accelerator<00:01:03.000> pedal

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
or decrease with the accelerator pedal

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090 
or decrease with the accelerator pedal
which<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.960> weird<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
which is really weird but that's a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
which is really weird but that's a
similar<00:01:05.460> thing<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.790> great<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.119> ground<00:01:06.840> loop

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
similar thing in great and ground loop

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.520 
similar thing in great and ground loop
Isolators<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.760> only<00:01:09.090> used<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.750> car<00:01:10.170> audio

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
Isolators and not only used in car audio

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.640 
Isolators and not only used in car audio
systems<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.670> reason<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.840> also<00:01:12.900> in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
systems for that reason but also in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.969 
systems for that reason but also in
audio<00:01:14.250> systems<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.600> I've<00:01:16.350> got<00:01:16.530> I'll<00:01:16.710> show<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
audio systems so I've got I'll show you

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.399 
audio systems so I've got I'll show you
what<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> simple<00:01:18.330> device<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.259> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
what it is is a simple device all it is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.010 
what it is is a simple device all it is
is<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> ground<00:01:20.580> loop<00:01:20.820> isolator<00:01:21.540> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
is this this is a ground loop isolator a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.230 
is this this is a ground loop isolator a
very<00:01:22.860> small<00:01:23.189> box<00:01:23.400> automation<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.090> got<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
very small box automation it's got a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960 
very small box automation it's got a
coil<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.009> but<00:01:26.009> that's<00:01:26.310> neither<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.729> or

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
coil in it but that's neither here or

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
coil in it but that's neither here or
there<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.890> have

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
there so what you have on it is you have

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
there so what you have on it is you have
a<00:01:29.070> couple<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.430> RCA<00:01:29.790> sockets<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> couple<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
a couple of RCA sockets and a couple of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.399 
a couple of RCA sockets and a couple of
RCA<00:01:31.500> plugs<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.259> if

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
RCA plugs now all you have to do is if

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
RCA plugs now all you have to do is if
you're<00:01:34.560> say<00:01:34.829> using<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.579> instance<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> got

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you're say using for instance what I got

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.469 
you're say using for instance what I got
here<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.110> laptop<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.850> say<00:01:39.150> you're<00:01:39.329> running

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479

your audio straight from your laptop
straight<00:01:41.369> into<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:42.000> mixer<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.140> your

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
straight into your mixer or your

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
straight into your mixer or your
amplifier<00:01:44.130> most<00:01:44.880> people<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.360> they're<00:01:45.509> doing

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
amplifier most people if they're doing

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.819 
amplifier most people if they're doing
it<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.930> way<00:01:46.079> would<00:01:46.200> probably<00:01:46.530> plug<00:01:46.680> this

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it that way would probably plug this

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.889 
it that way would probably plug this
into<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.100> mixer<00:01:47.549> what<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
into a mixer what you would do is you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
into a mixer what you would do is you
would<00:01:49.020> plug<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.920> mean<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.549> isn't

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
would plug this I mean I know this isn't

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.270 
would plug this I mean I know this isn't
your<00:01:50.939> typical<00:01:51.060> mobile<00:01:51.540> mixer<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> give

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
your typical mobile mixer but to give

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.910 
your typical mobile mixer but to give
you<00:01:53.369> an<00:01:53.460> example<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:54.390> inputs<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.799> would

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you an example your inputs you would

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.520 
you an example your inputs you would
plug<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.700> ground<00:01:57.060> loop<00:01:57.329> isolator<00:01:57.930> into<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
plug the ground loop isolator into the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.770 
plug the ground loop isolator into the
inputs<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.969> instance<00:02:00.240> that's<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.570> line

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
inputs like for instance that's a line

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.020 
inputs like for instance that's a line
in<00:02:01.020> left<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.380> right<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.280> plug<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.790> into

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
in left to right so you plug this into

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.929 
in left to right so you plug this into
there<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:04.079> what<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.759> are

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
there then what you do is if you are

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
there then what you do is if you are
going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.270> doing<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.259> most

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
going to be doing it that way what most

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.169 
going to be doing it that way what most
people<00:02:07.829> will<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.190> plug<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> mini<00:02:08.729> stereo

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
people will do is plug a mini stereo

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.040 
people will do is plug a mini stereo
jack<00:02:09.539> into<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.110> headphone<00:02:10.319> output<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
jack into the headphone output like that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.920 
jack into the headphone output like that
to<00:02:13.350> bring<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.710> audio<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.510> what<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.840> would

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
to bring the audio so what you would

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.660 
to bring the audio so what you would
then<00:02:15.960> do<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.590> basically<00:02:16.830> plug<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.490> into

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
then do is basically plug that into

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.840 
then do is basically plug that into
there<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:19.410> you've<00:02:19.920> joined<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.430> up<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.730> all

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
there so you've joined it up and all

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.370 
there so you've joined it up and all
you're<00:02:21.030> doing<00:02:21.060> basically<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.900> putting<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
you're doing basically is putting the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.500 
you're doing basically is putting the
ground<00:02:22.680> loop<00:02:22.860> isolator<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.730> between<00:02:24.270> your

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
ground loop isolator in between your

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.890 
ground loop isolator in between your
laptop<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.230> your<00:02:25.440> mixer<00:02:25.830> or<00:02:26.660> directly<00:02:27.660> into

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
laptop and your mixer or directly into

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.300 
laptop and your mixer or directly into
an<00:02:28.020> amplifier<00:02:28.200> if<00:02:28.590> that's<00:02:28.800> what<00:02:28.950> you're<00:02:29.130> going

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
an amplifier if that's what you're going

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.460 
an amplifier if that's what you're going
to<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.490> doing<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> will<00:02:30.960> do<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.320> this

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
to be doing and what it will do is this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.340 
to be doing and what it will do is this
will<00:02:31.530> then<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.970> rid<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.240> any<00:02:33.510> unwanted<00:02:33.870> harm

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
will then get rid of any unwanted harm

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.800 
will then get rid of any unwanted harm
and<00:02:34.680> buzzing<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.610> find<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.540> been<00:02:36.780> a

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
and buzzing that you find this been a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.480 
and buzzing that you find this been a
kit<00:02:37.080> here<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.680> honest<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.160> pretty

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
kit here to be honest is pretty

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.970 
kit here to be honest is pretty
essential<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.450> go<00:02:39.630> into<00:02:39.960> any<00:02:40.110> mobile<00:02:40.410> DJ's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
essential to go into any mobile DJ's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.010 
essential to go into any mobile DJ's
toolbox<00:02:41.520> because<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.390> never<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.780> when<00:02:42.930> you

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
toolbox because you never know when you

toolbox because you never know when you
need<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.950> other<00:02:44.100> thing<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.370> it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
need it and the other thing is it

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.390 
need it and the other thing is it
doesn't<00:02:44.640> take<00:02:44.790> any<00:02:45.030> batteries<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.200> say<00:02:47.190> there

your inputs and leave them in there

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.570 
your inputs and leave them in there
forget<00:02:52.200> about<00:02:52.320> them<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.890> least<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.370> way<00:02:53.550> you

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
forget about them at least that way you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.160 
forget about them at least that way you
know<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.090> you'll<00:02:54.210> never<00:02:54.300> get<00:02:54.630> any<00:02:54.780> buzz<00:02:54.960> or

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
know that you'll never get any buzz or

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.500 
know that you'll never get any buzz or
hum<00:02:55.380> now<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.580> other<00:02:56.700> way<00:02:56.910> obviously<00:02:57.150> not

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
hum now the other way obviously not

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.110 
hum now the other way obviously not
everybody<00:02:58.050> does<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.250> way<00:02:59.490> obviously

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
everybody does it in this way obviously

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.620 
everybody does it in this way obviously
if<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.420> want<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.410> can<00:03:01.620> unplug<00:03:01.890> these<00:03:02.630> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
if you want to you can unplug these and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.180 
if you want to you can unplug these and
you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.020> do<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> different<00:03:04.470> way<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.770> can

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you can do it in a different way you can

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.370 
you can do it in a different way you can
actually<00:03:05.280> come<00:03:05.610> out<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.030> back<00:03:06.240> say<00:03:07.080> with

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
actually come out of the back say with

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.320 
actually come out of the back say with
the<00:03:07.470> RCA<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.040> out<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.460> your<00:03:08.610> MIDI<00:03:08.820> controller

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
the RCA is out of your MIDI controller

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.990 
the RCA is out of your MIDI controller
master<00:03:09.570> out<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.290> then<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.430> literally<00:03:11.850> then

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
master out and then you literally then

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600 
master out and then you literally then
plug<00:03:12.270> this<00:03:12.570> would<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.170> go<00:03:13.350> into<00:03:13.680> directly

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
plug this would have to go into directly

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.490 
plug this would have to go into directly
into<00:03:14.760> your<00:03:14.790> amplifier<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.930> what<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.230> could<00:03:16.410> do

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
into your amplifier so what you could do

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.530 
into your amplifier so what you could do
then<00:03:16.710> is<00:03:16.920> use<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> standard<00:03:17.670> set<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.880> our<00:03:18.090> CAS

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
then is use a standard set of our CAS

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.510 
then is use a standard set of our CAS
from<00:03:19.350> here<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.740> your<00:03:19.860> amplifier<00:03:20.400> or<00:03:20.780> even<00:03:22.520> say

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
from here to your amplifier or even say

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.970 
from here to your amplifier or even say
you've<00:03:23.700> got<00:03:23.910> some<00:03:23.940> XLR<00:03:24.900> which<00:03:25.320> go<00:03:25.620> into<00:03:25.770> your

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
you've got some XLR which go into your

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.340 
you've got some XLR which go into your
power<00:03:26.310> amp<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:26.820> you've<00:03:27.360> got<00:03:27.510> our<00:03:27.720> CAS<00:03:28.080> on<00:03:28.260> the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
power amp and you've got our CAS on the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.380 
power amp and you've got our CAS on the
other<00:03:28.470> end<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:29.040> can<00:03:29.520> plug<00:03:29.760> them<00:03:29.910> into<00:03:30.060> there

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
other end you can plug them into there

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.140 
other end you can plug them into there
and<00:03:30.630> just<00:03:30.930> adapt<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.010> main<00:03:32.250> thing<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.820> is

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
and just adapt but the main thing is is

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.210 
and just adapt but the main thing is is
the<00:03:33.300> fact<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.630> when<00:03:33.840> if<00:03:34.440> you've<00:03:34.650> got<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.890> sound

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
the fact that when if you've got a sound

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.090 
the fact that when if you've got a sound
system<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.030> are<00:03:36.180> using<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.780> laptop<00:03:37.100> then

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
system and you are using a laptop then

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.480 
system and you are using a laptop then
this<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:39.000> very<00:03:39.840> really<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.680> an<00:03:40.830> essential<00:03:41.340> bit

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
this is very really is an essential bit

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.720 
this is very really is an essential bit
of<00:03:41.580> kit<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.540> all<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.380> do<00:03:43.590> then<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:44.100> come<00:03:44.400> out<00:03:44.459> of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
of kit so all you do then is come out of

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.320 
of kit so all you do then is come out of
your<00:03:45.200> controller<00:03:46.610> straight<00:03:47.610> into<00:03:47.940> your<00:03:48.060> power

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
your controller straight into your power

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.840 
your controller straight into your power
amp<00:03:48.600> with<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:49.920> that's<00:03:50.160> how<00:03:50.400> you're<00:03:50.550> using

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
amp with this if that's how you're using

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.550 
amp with this if that's how you're using
it<00:03:51.120> or<00:03:51.240> of<00:03:51.480> course<00:03:51.660> if<00:03:51.810> you're<00:03:51.930> using<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.380> laptop

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
it or of course if you're using a laptop

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.290 
it or of course if you're using a laptop
straight<00:03:52.980> into<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.160> mixer<00:03:53.610> then<00:03:54.090> obviously

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
straight into a mixer then obviously

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.449 
straight into a mixer then obviously
whichever<00:03:55.080> cables<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.590> need<00:03:55.770> we<00:03:55.980> do<00:03:56.160> sell

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
whichever cables you need we do sell

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.940 
whichever cables you need we do sell
every<00:03:56.940> type<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.180> cable<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.660> can<00:03:57.750> think<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.350> but

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
every type of cable you can think of but

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.100 
every type of cable you can think of but
what<00:03:59.130> they've<00:03:59.310> done<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.880> obviously<00:04:00.570> had<00:04:00.870> two

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
what they've done is obviously had two

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.560 
what they've done is obviously had two
final<00:04:01.500> plugs<00:04:01.740> and<00:04:01.950> two<00:04:02.100> sockets<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:03.330> that

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
final plugs and two sockets so that

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.150 
final plugs and two sockets so that
gives<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.990> like<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.350> option<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.860> do<00:04:04.980> whatever
