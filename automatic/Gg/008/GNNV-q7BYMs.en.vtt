it's<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> lot<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.159> people<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.700> is

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
it's what I see a lot of people do is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.289 
it's what I see a lot of people do is
systematically<00:01:52.729> teaching<00:01:53.729> their<00:01:53.880> horse<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
systematically teaching their horse to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
systematically teaching their horse to
walk<00:01:54.479> off<00:01:54.750> when<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.369> then

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
walk off when they get on it and then

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.889 
walk off when they get on it and then
they<00:01:56.790> complain<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.149> their<00:01:57.479> horse<00:01:57.630> walking

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
they complain about their horse walking

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.319 
they complain about their horse walking
off<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.369> mean<00:01:59.520> systematically

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
off and what I mean systematically

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.539 
off and what I mean systematically
teaching<00:02:00.719> them<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:02.430> know

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
teaching them to do it is you know

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.190 
teaching them to do it is you know
horses<00:02:02.880> don't<00:02:03.180> learn<00:02:03.420> from<00:02:03.450> pressure<00:02:03.990> they

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
horses don't learn from pressure they

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.840 
horses don't learn from pressure they
learn<00:02:04.320> from<00:02:04.469> release<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.920> pressure<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
learn from release of pressure so what I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.960 
learn from release of pressure so what I
see<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> lot<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.360> people<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:07.039> is<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:08.819> get

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
see a lot of people do is they they get

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.520 
see a lot of people do is they they get
a<00:02:09.000> hold<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.270> these<00:02:09.390> reins<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:09.929> not<00:02:10.410> going

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.540 
to pull on them on this horse but they
get

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
get

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.910 
get
hold<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.790> reins<00:02:12.940> real<00:02:13.180> tight<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.720> get<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.560> and

hold the reins real tight and get on and
right<00:02:15.190> as<00:02:15.310> they<00:02:15.490> get<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.960> get<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.290> doop

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
right as they get on it get this doop

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.930 
right as they get on it get this doop
and<00:02:17.620> they<00:02:17.680> kick<00:02:17.920> your<00:02:18.070> horse<00:02:18.310> in<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.580> guts<00:02:18.760> and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
and they kick your horse in the guts and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.310 
and they kick your horse in the guts and
then<00:02:19.060> turn<00:02:19.240> loose<00:02:19.450> when<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.720> horse<00:02:19.870> walks<00:02:20.080> off

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
then turn loose when the horse walks off

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.530 
then turn loose when the horse walks off
and<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.310> you're<00:02:21.640> telling<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.000> horse<00:02:22.300> they're

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
and so you're telling that horse they're

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.850 
and so you're telling that horse they're
standing<00:02:22.900> still<00:02:22.960> right<00:02:23.200> here<00:02:23.440> there's<00:02:23.770> going

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
standing still right here there's going

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.160 
standing still right here there's going
to<00:02:23.920> be<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.040> lot<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.280> pressure<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:25.660> if<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.990> walk

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
to be a lot of pressure but if you walk

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.600 
to be a lot of pressure but if you walk
off<00:02:26.440> out<00:02:26.650> there<00:02:26.800> that's<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.160> let<00:02:27.370> go<00:02:27.400> now

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610

the first day you do it it doesn't
really<00:02:29.830> they<00:02:30.430> don't<00:02:30.610> learn<00:02:30.820> from<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:31.180> but<00:02:31.330> if

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
really they don't learn from it but if

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.660 
really they don't learn from it but if
you<00:02:31.780> do<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.230> every<00:02:32.590> single<00:02:32.770> day<00:02:33.010> pretty<00:02:33.430> soon

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.690 
ever going to let go here you're going
to<00:02:43.390> hang<00:02:43.600> on<00:02:43.780> here<00:02:44.080> get<00:02:44.860> your<00:02:45.040> stirrup<00:02:45.340> get

kick him in the gut so they go forward

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.820 
kick him in the gut so they go forward
so<00:02:49.210> just<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.930> know<00:02:49.960> you<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.590> see<00:02:50.740> how

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
so just you know you can you see how

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.810 
so just you know you can you see how
that<00:02:50.980> works<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.460> see<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.640> from<00:02:51.760> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
that works you can see it from the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.130 
that works you can see it from the
horse's<00:02:52.060> point<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.480> view<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:52.810> horse<00:02:52.990> is

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
horse's point of view that horse is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.410 
horse's point of view that horse is
going<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.410> think<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:54.400> sooner<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.820> get<00:02:55.090> up<00:02:55.240> there

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
going to think the sooner I get up there

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.230 
going to think the sooner I get up there
the<00:02:55.630> sooner<00:02:55.840> you're<00:02:55.960> going<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.170> let<00:02:56.290> go<00:02:56.700> um<00:02:57.700> so

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
the sooner you're going to let go um so

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.110 
the sooner you're going to let go um so
what<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> was<00:02:58.720> going<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.020> do<00:02:59.200> here<00:02:59.440> was<00:03:00.090> try<00:03:01.090> and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
what I was going to do here was try and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.240 
what I was going to do here was try and
get<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:02.200> him<00:03:02.320> walk<00:03:02.440> off<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:02.710> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
get on and have him walk off but you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.800 
get on and have him walk off but you
know<00:03:03.400> he's<00:03:03.760> been<00:03:03.940> well<00:03:04.150> sighted<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:04.690> he

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
know he's been well sighted so he
