 x 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.999
 h 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.649
 hello at the crossroads 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.669
 stop laughing with you alan tskurbayev 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.420
 fashion stores on the streets 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.140
 our city appear almost 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.270
 everyday 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.510
 and passing by the next boutique I 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540
 involuntarily you ask yourself who it is 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.980
 buy so would like to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.330
 talk about our appearance which 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.460
 There are many claims Vladikavkaz very 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.239
 fashionable city new trends in clothes 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.420
 few days distributed 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.200
 this is wonderful this is one of the signs 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.250
 urban culture change of appearance 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.460
 its inhabitants for the fashion interesting 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.270
 watch 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.110
 yesterday went wide pants 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.080
 scolded for any attempt to narrow them down 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.360
 Today we have news tight 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.070
 sports women like 8 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.080
 and no one is outraged not year 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.829
 changed 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.929
 or for example now all athletes go 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.300
 on their workouts with backpacks behind 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.390
 and a few years ago you can kill 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.500
 there was at least being ridiculed by people's tastes 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.930
 changing when the mid nineties 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.380
 wore the same hairstyle as now 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.480
 I wanted to win twice 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.170
 now half the town is walking like that and nobody 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.100
 indignant because it is fashionable 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.409
 I myself have nothing against long lanes 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.450
 but I can't stand it 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.470
 glamorous hairstyles under the motto of belanov 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.520
 lowered by investors and tail on 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.460
 nape 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.650
 but they were planned to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.310
 because I do not like 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.680
 Apparently it's not the length of the hair but the taste 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.020
 so if with a choice of clothes now problems 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.450
 getting less but tasteful problem 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.900
 continues 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.840
 I probably never understand this fashion on 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.900
 east from where people take any dolls 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.070
 with curled up socks just like 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.520
 a little flour on the air that passion 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.000
 Asian bloomers girls sent to 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.680
 boots boots like musketeers 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.119
 everywhere there are some rhinestones gilded as in 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.640
 a thousand and one nights 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.830
 visited the passion to dress like everyone 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.479
 be like the rest 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.129
 it is nice it gives a feeling of comfort 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.019
 sense of security 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.980
 wear a black leather jacket and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.150
 you feel like your boyfriend but still like 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.599
 known fashion and style are different things 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.599
 style can not be massive 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.409
 I would be very happy if we had 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.040
 more young people with high feelings 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.129
 style 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.739
 otherwise what is happening now is 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.769
 just blind following fashion in 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.869
 other cities from where comes second 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.209
 there is and always will be near it can be found 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.349
 and most 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.969
 I remember how I wore so old 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.989
 father political scientist she was very 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.790
 stylishly the other day our airport I met 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.139
 plane from Moscow 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.269
 the Ossetians who arrived there looked like 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.389
 like hollywood stars and it didn't go 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.839
 people travel around the world choose for themselves 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.819
 what they like in our city you can often 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.889
 see no one looks like people 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.399
 sometimes you can conclude 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.259
 And here lives in Moscow and similar moved in 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.809
 europe 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.590
 clothing style meets the market 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.670
 then the person will not come on 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.830
 university classes in a ball gown like 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.719
 it is sometimes a pavement 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.669
 on his floor provincialism 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.260
 the main thing to look expensive 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.229
 whether it is beautiful or not 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.809
 but modesty in clothes is not at all 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.889
 does it mean there is not enough money 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.849
 assign figure out why advertise them 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.779
 Ponty in this sense of life 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.709
 despite the fact that the choice of clothes now 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.190
 there is some kind of freedom 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.200
 most fashion boutiques do not shine 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.609
 variety 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.420
 or black clothes for men 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.139
 really sand for women 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.409
 and everything is expensive 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.229
 relatively speaking style from aloe markets 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.959
 as one friend of mine said right 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.819
 style must spend boutiques can also 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.619
 led this sense of taste 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:51.139
 Yes, I understand, ask who and 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.149
 sentences but sometimes it seems that 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.889
 no one watches 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.819
 just carry their nondescript forever 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.579
 selling and all no consumer care and 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.869
 so I'm dressing second hand 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.409
 so completely of course 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.189
 Thousands still there is full 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.739
 when these stores just started 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.430
 appearing on the net overwhelmed many 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.669
 complexes as you can see things that 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.069
 put themselves on the force 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.559
 but I think it's better than 20 stylish clothes 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:15.630
 past seasons 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.139
 what's wrong with him 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.349
 now those shops are everywhere and complex 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.009
 significantly diminished 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.029
 All the more so there in it is absolutely new 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.189
 things that are pumped by the most 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.169
 boutiques 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.419
 but yielding with them zeros on the price tag 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.360
 by the way, you can buy clothes and 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.620
 online and it gives an incredible choice but 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.789
 so far only for technical 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.669
 advanced youth 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.310
 This sweater didnâ€™t buy us konstyandyan for 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.689
 200 rubles 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.330
 Jesse 250 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.379
 and I feel extremely in these things 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:46.389
 comfortable 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.419
 because such in the city more precisely 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.659
 no one has 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.869
 let them wear for a long time unknown 

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:54.099
 a guy named Friedrich from a distant 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.789
 passed shares 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.930
 I can only say thanks to them 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.710
 I hope that they will never return 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.660
 times when urban water technicians 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.720
 competed in who is cooler 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.900
 padded jackets 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.740
 My name is Alan Tskhurbaev it was 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.449
 transmission will no longer cope 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.449
 after pe meeting 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.289
 m 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:22.479
 more often
