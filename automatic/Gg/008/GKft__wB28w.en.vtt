00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.890
 at galen center in los angeles where comes 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.099
 just to finish 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.440
 the big opening conference of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.480
 microsoft which was very very rich in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.890
 news in ads and especially 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 which was very very very big trout 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.869
 so microsoft this year to a message 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 to make you pass in 2015 it's about 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.410
 xbox to donkeys that's going to happen 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.680
 and for that he actually used 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.929
 two keywords xbox one exclusive 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 it's exclusive to xbox to donkeys either 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.070
 at first , totally 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 exclusive and he actually listed 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.390
 a lot of games with lausanne 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.489
 guardian who looks absolutely 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.200
 sumptuous which is very very 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.640
 impressive graphically which at 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.379
 level of gameplay looks very very 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.899
 nervous with novelties including 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.680
 it's a pseudo-charge system at 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.780
 ground with possibility of creating a union 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.760
 of choc 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.309
 there is also a breakdown the possibility 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.109
 to play in multiplayer and it's still 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.910
 up and that's still pretty much 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.189
 nice if you want to have fun at four 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.750
 friends and then we'll say other little ones 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.640
 favorites also announced big 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.040
 blockbusters which is an excluded xbox one 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.070
 and pc it's the new tomb raider the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.200
 ride bottom raider that continues this where 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 had begun 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.369
 crystal dynamics a few years ago 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.009
 where we continue to follow the progression 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.110
 the transformation of lara croft tomb 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.310
 raid she who we discovered him there 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.750
 a few years ago 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.460
 years in the early days of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 stiffness so really games that are 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.990
 very very beautiful or the beautiful lara is not 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.189
 at all to households and she 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.840
 jumps in all directions she takes herself 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.770
 shots and hanged by the feet 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.520
 in short, there would be piles 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.979
 of adventures it will be absolutely 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.289
 incredible a priori to play there joystick 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 hand in any case it is difficult to 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.350
 allah wait for his art he soon on 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.330
 xbox live and on pc 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.830
 there are obviously titles that are going 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.780
 arrive a little later in 2016 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.360
 including very independent games and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.280
 then also a gears 4 again gears of 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.619
 war a sort of reboot since 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.360
 go back to the origins of what happened 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.239
 past of how locusts took 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.000
 control of the world so we will see that 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.979
 in 2016 it is later microsoft ensures 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.049
 still afterwards but there was also 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.009
 a lot of material novelties when 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.260
 of this conference 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.790
 two big new material to ab 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.599
 remember first a new 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.420
 joystick that is thought so that they have 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.139
 called controllers and light elite who in 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.209
 wholesale designed to be more precise as to 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:30.000
 your game when playing with new 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.940
 trigger on the on the body of the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.010
 handle more precise triggers and 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.209
 also sticks that can be changed 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.430
 according to the games we play 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.510
 depending on whether you play fps or a game of 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.650
 fight we do not need the same 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.750
 sensations not need the same 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.310
 precision no need of even felt at 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.519
 level of the nuts by particular so 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.810
 really a very very high controller 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.569
 range really for the players 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.000
 hard on on xbox one and then the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.410
 second novelty that was also 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.359
 rather pretty nice in terms of 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.519
 material it's a demonstration of a 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.319
 minecraft version with all all ends 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.630
 and that's just bluffing 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.180
 because we start playing 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.099
 finally the person wearing the helmet the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.049
 slow the augmented reality headset 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.420
 microsoft starts playing on the wall 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.770
 as if the state a hitherto good screen 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.050
 impressive but it's enough 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.910
 classic and then he decides to 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.520
 move the world by which he plays 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.560
 on a flat surface a table and there we 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.810
 rocker locke in everything from 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.640
 crazy we see the world 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.400
 build 3d in front of you obviously 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.870
 when we board and kaskelot slow and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.280
 we can actually play with 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.650
 people playing on a table and 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.989
 surface and we can explore the world 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.400
 differently lift it to see this 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.680
 going on in the basement which is very 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.680
 important in minecraft for cuver of 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.850
 what kraft is so here it was 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.780
 words really very very impressive 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.690
 and very very nice 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.340
 and obviously the big hunk on 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.200
 want for the end it's an ad 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.569
 that we have been waiting and we have been hoping for 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.830
 moment and that was a bit put in the 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.239
 cartons apparently but who finally comes out 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.600
 now it's the meeting at 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.519
 360 game compatibility with xbox 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.989
 one then we do not have a lot of 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.650
 details but of what we believe to have 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.540
 including 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.030
 in fact just put the game we 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.280
 so has 360 in the xbox to the years and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.640
 then everything will happen via xbox live 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.890
 online and we can access this game 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.510
 if part of the support catalog 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.970
 at first we can 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.640
 access with all that offers the xbox 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.430
 one ie some graphics a little 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.590
 improved ie everything that is 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.450
 connectivity strengthen and so on and 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.880
 caetera and so that's a lot of 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.070
 new software games for 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.530
 2015 especially and mainly for 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.880
 2016 also and then news 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.400
 material that are really very 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.680
 promising for months and years to 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.169
 come if bethesda yesterday had put the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.200
 pretty high bar with very very games 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.890
 promising with his fallout his doom 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.560
 microsoft she's clearly a 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.210
 strong message to put those voices 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.130
 we may be a little late in 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.110
 terms of sales with 3 xbox one but one 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.000
