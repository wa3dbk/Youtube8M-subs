 Best regards to all good afternoon 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.290
 my name is lenin chaco let's do 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.769
 a video explains thorium about how 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.769
 open a lockable safe 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.230
 manual is a lagar brand lock that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.900
 It is in their safes 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.480
 keep in mind we have two lines one 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.520
 in the center that is a vertical line and 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.500
 an inclined one that is you should not 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.610
 take into account do not realize that 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.980
 there is the moment that you are going to 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.050
 endure the safe just take in 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.970
 mind this let's have an example 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.100
 we are doing it simply 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.739
 with a lock so you can do it 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.329
 we have a key let's say the key 80 20 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.390
 70 and the number with which it is going to 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.970
 endure your box is on 17 many times 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.829
 you give only these three numbers with this 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.449
 you can open the last one if 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.480
 you did well, you will be able to 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.700
 let open the safe in this case 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.520
 what it says 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.680
 the explanation that was sent to him 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.670
 previously turn the dial says four 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.980
 times to the left the second 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.130
 number three times to the right 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.140
 the third number twice to the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.360
 left again and the latter 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.310
 number is where it says turn the dial all to 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.230
 the right is to say once to the right 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.650
 is what will allow him to open 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.740
 the box we are going to do it with what is the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.510
 lock we have four times 80 to the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.140
 left of 0 where we are located 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.490
 we look for the number 80 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.490
 there would be a 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.360
 two 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.020
 3 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.190
 and 4 has to be exact please say 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.700
 3 times 20 to the right of where we are 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.380
 we look for the number 20 1 if it passes not 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.050
 come back please already account 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.930
 2 the third if it would be exact 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.050
 then twice seventy to the left 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.790
 where we were seventy again 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:19.370
 one does not need to stop either 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.200

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.170
 tour until this side of here arrives just 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.140
 to 17 and the lock is not going to spin anymore 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.790
 it's going to stay that way when you 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.859

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.980
 we turn handle or knob depending on 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.889
 what kind of safe is but in the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.739
 small safes are knobs 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:50.569
 we turn clockwise and open the 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.400
 door if you do not allow us is because the 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.909
