00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.259
 welcome to another magazine capsule 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.090
 official xbox this time 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.949
 we share with you some tips 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.800
 Practicals that will facilitate your journey 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.050
 by darksiders 2 one of the first 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.150
 things that we recommend is that from the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.910
 menu of options lower the volume to the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.919
 game music we create do not get lost 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.710
 of a lot and facilitates the location of 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.600
 certain collectibles because because 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.620
 they emit a characteristic sound that 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.620
 betrays its closeness 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.629
 we find not only help meet 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.489
 secondary missions is also reflected 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.300
 in the experience that helps to rise from 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.180
 level and get rare items 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.430
 otherwise we do not recommend that they accumulate 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.770
 weapons mostly because the amount that 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.490
 they can load is limited forcing us to 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.380
 discard or ignore new acquisitions 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.330
 the best technique to take advantage of 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.340
 this is that by having a 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.040
 merchant to take a look at the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.560
 arsenal are removed with imperative and 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.869
 the rest is sold in this way always 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.640
 there will be space in your inventory and money 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.310
 Enough to buy movements 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.960
 specials or weapons that are only available 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 with merchants 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.180
 Last but not least 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.820
 the quick trip when the flowers of a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.770
 dungeon a dungeon or if you have a 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.050
 I find dangerous and feel that I do not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 they are ready to unfold the map 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.330
 general and choose a zone previously 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.640
 visited when traveling may return to 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.399
 recently abandoned point in any 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.440
 clear game time as long as 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.110
 not subtle that travel well if a new 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.729
 jump eliminates the previous mark this 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.009
 technique is very important when your 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.130
 health is in danger or they need to buy or 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.539
 sell equipment if they know of other tips and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.560
 want to share them with our 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.940
 community visit or xcm dot com.mx
