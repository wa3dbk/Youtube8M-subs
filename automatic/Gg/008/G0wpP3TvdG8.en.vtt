00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
now and I thought it was about time I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.950 
now and I thought it was about time I
did<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.250> review<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.000> considering<00:01:30.780> I've

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
probably still plenty left in here but
I'm<00:01:35.549> debating<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:36.119> whether<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.420> should<00:01:36.690> carry

on<00:01:37.350> using<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> considering<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> goes<00:01:39.030> near<00:01:39.360> my

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
on using it considering it goes near my

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
applicator um

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.109 
applicator um
you<00:01:54.030> use<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:56.100> use<00:01:56.580> putting

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you use this like you will use putting

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.020 
you use this like you will use putting
eyeliner<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.080> on<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:59.520> close<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> your<00:02:00.000> lash

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
line as possible and then I just sort of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.780 
personally I think the brush is very
very<00:02:10.229> big<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.979> big<00:02:11.189> um<00:02:13.129> for<00:02:14.129> putting<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.549> close

to your lash line
on<00:02:17.340> several<00:02:17.610> occasions<00:02:17.730> I've<00:02:18.330> accidentally

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
on several occasions I've accidentally

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.190 
on several occasions I've accidentally
got<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:19.680> my<00:02:19.800> eye<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.209> stings<00:02:21.870> like

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.250 
got this into my eye and it stings like
hell<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.170> that's<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.380> thing<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> avoid

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
hell so that's one thing to avoid

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.730 
hell so that's one thing to avoid
because<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:28.950> really<00:02:29.220> does<00:02:29.459> sting<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
because it really really does sting and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.770 
because it really really does sting and
don't<00:02:31.740> pull<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.010> too<00:02:32.420> much

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
don't pull it too much

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.449 
don't pull it too much
on<00:02:33.840> your<00:02:34.080> skin<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.770> can<00:02:35.069> make<00:02:35.280> your

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
on your skin because it can make your

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.949 
on your skin because it can make your
skin<00:02:36.300> sting<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.140> bit<00:02:37.350> as<00:02:37.560> well<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.569> close

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
skin sting a bit as well and so as close

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.050 
skin sting a bit as well and so as close
to<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.290> lash<00:02:40.470> line<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:40.800> possible<00:02:40.910> which<00:02:41.910> is

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to the lash line as possible which is

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.030 
to the lash line as possible which is
very<00:02:42.239> difficult<00:02:42.480> considering<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.350> brush<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.860> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
very difficult considering a brush is so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.340 
very difficult considering a brush is so
thick<00:02:45.470> bottom<00:02:46.470> other<00:02:46.950> than<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.350> applicator

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
thick bottom other than the applicator

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.090 
thick bottom other than the applicator
what<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.100> actually<00:02:50.340> think<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.269> serum<00:02:52.100> when

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
what I actually think of the serum when

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.640 
what I actually think of the serum when
I<00:02:53.160> first<00:02:53.519> started<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.300> initially<00:02:54.959> use<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.440> I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
I first started to initially use it I

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.970 
I first started to initially use it I
did<00:02:56.340> see<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> difference<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.360> my<00:02:57.720> lashes<00:02:58.050> not

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
did see a difference to my lashes not

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.680 
did see a difference to my lashes not
the<00:02:59.160> length<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.640> haven't<00:03:00.060> seen<00:03:00.180> any<00:03:00.420> difference

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
the length I haven't seen any difference

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.440 
the length I haven't seen any difference
um<00:03:01.670> on<00:03:02.670> my<00:03:03.170> lash<00:03:04.170> length<00:03:04.470> using<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.160> but<00:03:05.970> my

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
um on my lash length using this but my

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.660 
um on my lash length using this but my
lashes<00:03:06.780> have<00:03:07.260> looked<00:03:07.620> more<00:03:07.980> thicker<00:03:08.340> and

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
lashes have looked more thicker and

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.300 
lashes have looked more thicker and
fuller<00:03:09.050> especially<00:03:10.050> at<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.290> base<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.650> my

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
fuller especially at the base of my

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.870 
fuller especially at the base of my
lashes<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.739> I've<00:03:13.739> seen<00:03:13.980> more<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.819> a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
lashes and I've seen more of a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.330 
lashes and I've seen more of a
difference<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.450> my<00:03:15.510> lower<00:03:15.870> lashes<00:03:16.140> but<00:03:17.100> that

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
difference on my lower lashes but that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.509 
difference on my lower lashes but that
could<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:17.940> because<00:03:18.120> my<00:03:18.930> lower<00:03:19.739> lash<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.130> very

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
could be because my lower lash is very

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.110 
could be because my lower lash is very
sparse

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
sparse

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.870 
sparse
there's<00:03:21.900> barely<00:03:22.290> any<00:03:22.680> there<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.670> very

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
there's barely any there and it's a very

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.229 
there's barely any there and it's a very
thin<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.890> I've<00:03:25.890> seen<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.220> difference<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.060> my

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
thin so I've seen a difference to my

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.870 
thin so I've seen a difference to my
lower<00:03:27.600> lashes<00:03:27.930> where<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.829> actually<00:03:29.160> looks

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
lower lashes where it's actually looks

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.180 
lower lashes where it's actually looks
thicker<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.480> looks<00:03:30.690> darker<00:03:31.380> blacker<00:03:31.709> than<00:03:32.010> it

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
thicker it looks darker blacker than it

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.729 
thicker it looks darker blacker than it
usually<00:03:32.400> does<00:03:32.910> look<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:36.120> my<00:03:36.269> brows<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:37.140> haven't

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
darker they do look they just look a bit

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.530 
darker they do look they just look a bit
more<00:03:52.560> glossy<00:03:52.829> err<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:55.880> yeah<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.359> only

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
more glossy err and yeah so the only

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.970 
more glossy err and yeah so the only
thing<00:03:57.810> different<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.350> I've<00:03:58.440> been<00:03:58.620> doing<00:03:58.859> to

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
thing different that I've been doing to

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.470 
thing different that I've been doing to
those<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.489> using<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.420> serum<00:04:00.930> um<00:04:01.700> but<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:03.030> think

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
those is using this serum um but I think

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.050 
those is using this serum um but I think
for<00:04:04.109> anyone<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.859> wants<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.220> see<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.549> major

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
for anyone that wants to see a major

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.330 
for anyone that wants to see a major
difference<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:07.260> their<00:04:07.440> lashes<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
difference to their lashes and to the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.240 
difference to their lashes and to the
brows<00:04:08.609> you're<00:04:09.540> not<00:04:09.750> going<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.019> see<00:04:10.250> that

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
brows you're not going to see that

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.069 
brows you're not going to see that
you're<00:04:11.700> not<00:04:11.850> going<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.030> see<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.150> really<00:04:12.600> really

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
you're not going to see a really really

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.289 
you're not going to see a really really
really<00:04:13.290> big<00:04:13.530> difference<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.370> makes<00:04:14.940> small

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
really big difference it makes small

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.840 
really big difference it makes small
subtle<00:04:15.780> differences<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.799> mean<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
subtle differences I mean it is just the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.800 
subtle differences I mean it is just the
lash<00:04:18.060> serum<00:04:18.709> so<00:04:19.709> there's<00:04:20.669> only<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.329> much<00:04:21.539> they

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
lash serum so there's only so much they

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.969 
lash serum so there's only so much they
can<00:04:21.989> do<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.229> think<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:23.729> um<00:04:23.970> if<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.690> have<00:04:25.050> really

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
can do I think but um if you have really

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.770 
can do I think but um if you have really
sparse<00:04:26.570> really<00:04:27.570> brittle<00:04:28.080> or<00:04:28.800> thin<00:04:29.340> lashes

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
sparse really brittle or thin lashes

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
sparse really brittle or thin lashes
and<00:04:30.870> then<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.980> also<00:04:32.490> go<00:04:32.880> ahead<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.570> try<00:04:34.140> this<00:04:34.200> it

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
and then I also go ahead and try this it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.720 
and then I also go ahead and try this it
does<00:04:35.190> make<00:04:35.580> your<00:04:35.760> lashes<00:04:35.970> look<00:04:36.530> thicker

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
does make your lashes look thicker

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.450 
does make your lashes look thicker
slightly<00:04:38.730> darker<00:04:39.360> which<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.250> gives<00:04:41.250> the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
slightly darker which and gives the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.730 
slightly darker which and gives the
illusion<00:04:41.850> of<00:04:43.190> more<00:04:44.190> lashes<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.760> guess<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:46.500> I'm

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
illusion of more lashes I guess but I'm

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.240 
illusion of more lashes I guess but I'm
assuming<00:04:47.160> as<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:48.120> any<00:04:48.450> of<00:04:48.930> these<00:04:49.710> types<00:04:50.130> of

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
um like I said I personally did see the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.220 
um like I said I personally did see the
lashes<00:05:17.850> looks<00:05:18.150> like<00:05:18.360> thicker<00:05:18.720> slightly

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
lashes looks like thicker slightly

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.760 
lashes looks like thicker slightly
fuller<00:05:20.090> especially<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.330> bottom<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:24.770> lashes

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
fuller especially the bottom the lashes

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.030 
fuller especially the bottom the lashes
closest<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.550> my<00:05:26.730> skin<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:28.440> because<00:05:28.890> of<00:05:28.920> that

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
closest to my skin and because of that

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.450 
closest to my skin and because of that
it<00:05:29.430> mate<00:05:30.000> against<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.660> illusion<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.460> more

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
it mate against the illusion of more

it mate against the illusion of more
thicker<00:05:33.120> lashes<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.780> think<00:05:34.460> lengthwise<00:05:35.460> like<00:05:35.820> I

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
thicker lashes I think lengthwise like I

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.400 
thicker lashes I think lengthwise like I
said<00:05:36.180> didn't<00:05:37.050> see<00:05:37.200> much<00:05:37.410> difference<00:05:37.950> in<00:05:38.190> that

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
said didn't see much difference in that

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.360 
said didn't see much difference in that
would<00:05:40.410> I<00:05:40.440> repurchase<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:41.750> probably<00:05:42.750> um<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.740> do

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
would I repurchase it probably um I do

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.690 
would I repurchase it probably um I do
have<00:05:44.700> a<00:05:44.730> back<00:05:44.940> of<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.330> I've<00:05:45.660> got<00:05:45.930> um<00:05:46.200> a<00:05:46.470> couple

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
have a back of this I've got um a couple

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.990 
have a back of this I've got um a couple
for<00:05:47.700> my<00:05:47.880> Christmas<00:05:48.270> present<00:05:48.690> and<00:05:49.850> chances<00:05:50.850> are

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
for my Christmas present and chances are

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.580 
for my Christmas present and chances are
I<00:05:51.210> would<00:05:51.600> we<00:05:51.720> would<00:05:51.960> keep<00:05:52.200> on<00:05:52.380> using<00:05:52.590> it<00:05:52.890> um<00:05:54.590> but

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
I would we would keep on using it um but

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.990 
I would we would keep on using it um but
that<00:05:55.740> doesn't<00:05:56.070> mean<00:05:56.220> I<00:05:56.400> won't<00:05:56.580> try<00:05:56.670> out

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
that doesn't mean I won't try out

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.360 
that doesn't mean I won't try out
another<00:05:57.240> lash<00:05:57.750> serum<00:05:58.050> first<00:05:58.710> before<00:05:59.190> we

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
another lash serum first before we

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.580 
another lash serum first before we
purchasing<00:06:00.090> this<00:06:01.100> I've<00:06:02.100> got<00:06:02.730> the<00:06:03.590> Elizabeth

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
purchasing this I've got the Elizabeth

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.510 
purchasing this I've got the Elizabeth
Arden<00:06:05.450> Prevage<00:06:06.590> lash<00:06:07.590> serum<00:06:07.950> I<00:06:08.220> think<00:06:08.400> it's

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
Arden Prevage lash serum I think it's

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.300 
Arden Prevage lash serum I think it's
called<00:06:08.730> and<00:06:09.170> I'm<00:06:10.170> probably<00:06:10.830> going<00:06:11.070> to<00:06:11.160> be

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
called and I'm probably going to be

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.190 
called and I'm probably going to be
trying<00:06:11.610> that<00:06:11.670> out<00:06:11.820> next<00:06:12.620> but<00:06:13.620> I<00:06:14.070> think<00:06:15.200> lash

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
trying that out next but I think lash

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.090 
trying that out next but I think lash
serums<00:06:16.890> in<00:06:17.130> general<00:06:17.760> are<00:06:18.420> quite<00:06:19.200> expensive<00:06:19.500> no

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
serums in general are quite expensive no

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.360 
serums in general are quite expensive no
matter<00:06:20.340> what<00:06:20.550> brand<00:06:20.910> you<00:06:21.090> buy<00:06:21.530> this<00:06:22.530> I<00:06:22.950> think

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
matter what brand you buy this I think

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:31.550 
matter what brand you buy this I think
is<00:06:23.610> a<00:06:24.030> more<00:06:24.510> affordable<00:06:25.670> brand<00:06:26.670> as<00:06:27.090> well<00:06:27.260> so<00:06:30.560> it

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
is a more affordable brand as well so it

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.410 
is a more affordable brand as well so it
might<00:06:32.340> be<00:06:34.550> mark<00:06:35.550> it<00:06:35.700> might<00:06:35.910> be<00:06:36.030> more<00:06:36.180> cost

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
might be mark it might be more cost

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.170 
might be mark it might be more cost
effective<00:06:36.990> to<00:06:37.200> try<00:06:37.710> something<00:06:38.220> like<00:06:38.340> the

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
effective to try something like the

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.690 
effective to try something like the
number<00:06:39.330> seven<00:06:39.750> brand<00:06:39.960> out<00:06:40.170> first<00:06:40.500> then<00:06:40.860> say

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700 
number seven brand out first then say

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.030 
number seven brand out first then say
the<00:06:42.210> Elizabeth<00:06:42.600> Arden<00:06:42.720> which<00:06:43.140> I<00:06:43.260> know<00:06:43.320> costs

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
the Elizabeth Arden which I know costs

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.580 
the Elizabeth Arden which I know costs
and

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
and

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.950 
and
a<00:06:45.010> mile<00:06:45.270> but<00:06:46.270> um<00:06:47.370> like<00:06:48.370> I<00:06:48.550> said<00:06:48.790> it's<00:06:49.090> not<00:06:49.570> a<00:06:49.630> bad

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
a mile but um like I said it's not a bad

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.310 
a mile but um like I said it's not a bad
serum<00:06:50.470> if<00:06:50.860> anything<00:06:51.790> it<00:06:52.030> does<00:06:52.419> make<00:06:52.960> your

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
serum if anything it does make your

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.430 
serum if anything it does make your
lashes<00:06:53.680> stroke<00:06:54.430> brows<00:06:54.790> look<00:06:55.570> more<00:06:56.139> healthy

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
lashes stroke brows look more healthy

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.700 
lashes stroke brows look more healthy
which<00:06:57.450> again<00:06:58.450> probably<00:06:58.750> makes<00:06:59.080> a<00:06:59.260> difference

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
which again probably makes a difference

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.480 
which again probably makes a difference
to<00:06:59.919> the<00:07:00.100> entire<00:07:00.460> look<00:07:00.820> of<00:07:01.210> the<00:07:01.419> eye<00:07:01.450> area<00:07:02.050> so<00:07:02.919> if

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
to the entire look of the eye area so if

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.900 
to the entire look of the eye area so if
you<00:07:04.090> want<00:07:04.270> to<00:07:04.389> try<00:07:04.570> a<00:07:04.600> lash<00:07:04.840> theorem<00:07:05.380> then<00:07:06.070> I

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
you want to try a lash theorem then I

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.330 
you want to try a lash theorem then I
definitely<00:07:07.870> suggest<00:07:07.990> this<00:07:08.500> would<00:07:08.770> probably<00:07:09.010> a

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
definitely suggest this would probably a

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.330 
definitely suggest this would probably a
good<00:07:09.669> option<00:07:10.030> to<00:07:10.240> try<00:07:11.169> first<00:07:11.530> because<00:07:12.130> it's

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
good option to try first because it's

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.320 
good option to try first because it's
one<00:07:12.550> of<00:07:12.639> those<00:07:12.760> in-between<00:07:13.770> brands<00:07:14.880> so<00:07:15.880> yeah

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
one of those in-between brands so yeah

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.040 
one of those in-between brands so yeah
