00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
out where to send that torque the next

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.869 
out where to send that torque the next
vehicle<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.889> want<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.159> show<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.700> going<00:02:34.819> to

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
vehicle we want to show you is going to

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.699 
vehicle we want to show you is going to
be<00:02:34.969> the<00:02:35.090> Audi<00:02:35.209> q5<00:02:35.569> okay<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.349> that's<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
be the Audi q5 okay and that's the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.709 
be the Audi q5 okay and that's the
Quattro<00:02:37.129> system<00:02:37.370> let's<00:02:38.150> watch<00:02:38.389> and<00:02:38.540> see<00:02:38.629> how

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
Quattro system let's watch and see how

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.080 
Quattro system let's watch and see how
it<00:02:38.900> stacks<00:02:39.170> up<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.469> 4<00:02:39.680> Matic<00:02:40.010> might<00:02:40.909> be<00:02:41.060> a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
it stacks up to 4 Matic might be a

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.090 
it stacks up to 4 Matic might be a
little<00:02:41.269> bit<00:02:41.450> different

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.950 

so<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.850> front<00:02:50.090> wheels<00:02:50.270> going<00:02:50.420> slower<00:02:50.720> now

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
so the front wheels going slower now

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.710 
so the front wheels going slower now
within<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.380> rear<00:02:51.560> wheels

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
within the rear wheels

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.200 
within the rear wheels
okay<00:02:54.320> just<00:02:55.130> trying<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.400> figure<00:02:55.610> out<00:02:55.760> where<00:02:56.090> is

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
okay just trying to figure out where is

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.330 
okay just trying to figure out where is
that<00:02:56.390> where's<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.810> traction<00:02:57.230> what's<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:58.250> the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
that where's that traction what's in the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.980 
that where's that traction what's in the
back<00:02:58.460> right<00:02:58.700> time

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.440 

so<00:03:08.990> it<00:03:09.050> made<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.610> my<00:03:10.730> question<00:03:11.120> for<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.330> is

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
so it made it so my question for you is

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
so it made it so my question for you is
how<00:03:11.780> would<00:03:11.960> you<00:03:12.050> like<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.170> have<00:03:12.350> that

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
how would you like to have that

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.720 
how would you like to have that
all-wheel<00:03:12.770> drive<00:03:12.980> system<00:03:13.010> when<00:03:13.460> you're<00:03:13.580> under

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
all-wheel drive system when you're under

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.950 
all-wheel drive system when you're under
wheel<00:03:13.880> slippage<00:03:14.180> coming<00:03:14.540> down<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:14.690> mountain

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
wheel slippage coming down a mountain

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.460 
wheel slippage coming down a mountain
road<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.730> don't<00:03:16.730> know<00:03:16.820> it's<00:03:17.750> it's<00:03:18.110> just<00:03:18.230> not

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
road I don't know it's it's just not

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.290 
road I don't know it's it's just not
it's<00:03:18.680> not<00:03:18.860> intelligent<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:19.550> not<00:03:19.700> proactive

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
it's not intelligent it's not proactive

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.210 
it's not intelligent it's not proactive
it's<00:03:20.930> an<00:03:21.020> excellent<00:03:21.290> system<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:21.920> again

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
it's an excellent system and this again

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.950 
it's an excellent system and this again
everyone<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.850> is<00:03:22.910> worst-case<00:03:23.360> scenario

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
everyone this is worst-case scenario

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.150 
everyone this is worst-case scenario
typically<00:03:24.440> you're<00:03:24.560> not<00:03:24.650> going<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:24.830> be<00:03:24.920> under

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
typically you're not going to be under

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.070 
typically you're not going to be under
such<00:03:25.610> an<00:03:25.760> extreme<00:03:26.150> where<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.450> only<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.780> one

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
such an extreme where you only have one

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.930 
such an extreme where you only have one
wheel<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.440> has<00:03:27.500> any<00:03:27.740> traction<00:03:28.040> at<00:03:28.280> all<00:03:28.370> but

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
wheel that has any traction at all but

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.710 
wheel that has any traction at all but
that's<00:03:29.030> what<00:03:29.210> we're<00:03:29.300> going<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.480> use<00:03:29.510> to

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
that's what we're going to use to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.090 
that's what we're going to use to
demonstrate<00:03:29.870> that's<00:03:30.350> why<00:03:30.470> we<00:03:30.590> control<00:03:30.980> this

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
demonstrate that's why we control this

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.280 
demonstrate that's why we control this
experiment<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.150> see<00:03:32.360> now<00:03:33.230> we

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
experiment so that you can see now we

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.050 
experiment so that you can see now we
left<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.710> Lexus<00:03:34.100> over<00:03:34.370> here<00:03:34.550> in<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.700> parking

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
left the Lexus over here in a parking

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.340 
left the Lexus over here in a parking
spot<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.750> see<00:03:35.900> it's<00:03:36.020> kind<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.200> on<00:03:36.320> the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
spot you see it's kind of on the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.160 
spot you see it's kind of on the
sidelines<00:03:37.480> we're<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.510> little<00:03:38.630> hesitant<00:03:39.080> to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
sidelines we're a little hesitant to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.720 
sidelines we're a little hesitant to
actually<00:03:39.470> bring<00:03:39.620> this<00:03:39.800> out<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.280> think<00:03:40.610> we're

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
actually bring this out I think we're

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.920 
actually bring this out I think we're
going<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:40.910> do<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> little<00:03:41.060> demonstration<00:03:41.300> for

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
going to do a little demonstration for

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.240 
going to do a little demonstration for
you<00:03:42.050> all<00:03:42.290> right<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:42.560> here's<00:03:42.590> your<00:03:42.890> active

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
you all right so here's your active

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
torque control you can see how it

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.180 
torque control you can see how it
responds<00:03:44.960> under<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.260> worst-case<00:03:45.590> scenario

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:43.529 

that's<00:04:34.689> off<00:04:35.789> there<00:04:36.789> we<00:04:36.909> go<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:43.120> difference<00:04:43.419> is

that's off there we go the difference is

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.059 
that's off there we go the difference is
incredible<00:04:43.960> right<00:04:44.139> that's<00:04:44.650> what<00:04:44.770> we<00:04:44.860> talk

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
incredible right that's what we talk

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.619 
incredible right that's what we talk
about<00:04:45.099> when<00:04:45.280> it's<00:04:45.520> proactive<00:04:45.729> is<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.360> under

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
about when it's proactive is that under

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.420 
about when it's proactive is that under

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
any hint of wheel slippage it's

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.520 
any hint of wheel slippage it's
instantly<00:04:48.909> able<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.300> detect<00:04:49.599> that<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.020> before

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
instantly able to detect that and before

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.619 
instantly able to detect that and before

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.300 
the wheel even starts to even starts to
move<00:04:52.750> too<00:04:52.930> far<00:04:53.110> off<00:04:53.289> plane<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:53.919> send<00:04:54.159> that

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
move too far off plane it can send that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.950 
move too far off plane it can send that
power<00:04:54.520> exactly<00:04:55.150> where<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.300> needs<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.539> go<00:04:55.629> I

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
power exactly where it needs to go I

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.320 
power exactly where it needs to go I
think<00:04:56.650> it's<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> good<00:04:56.919> demonstration<00:04:57.099> of<00:04:57.699> what

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
think it's a good demonstration of what

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.999 
think it's a good demonstration of what
you<00:04:58.569> have<00:04:58.870> would<00:04:59.139> have<00:04:59.259> available<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.800> you<00:04:59.919> an

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
you have would have available to you an

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.540 
you have would have available to you an
emergency<00:05:00.430> situation<00:05:00.639> since<00:05:01.449> the<00:05:01.750> xDrive

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
emergency situation since the xDrive

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.459 
emergency situation since the xDrive
works<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:03.759> quickly<00:05:04.180> definitely<00:05:05.050> would<00:05:05.229> feel

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
works so quickly definitely would feel

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.459 
works so quickly definitely would feel
safer<00:05:05.710> in<00:05:06.159> that<00:05:06.669> environment<00:05:06.969> so<00:05:07.900> I<00:05:07.930> feel<00:05:08.319> much

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
safer in that environment so I feel much

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.339 
safer in that environment so I feel much
safer<00:05:08.680> in<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.669> BMW<00:05:10.300> than<00:05:10.629> I<00:05:10.719> would<00:05:10.900> any<00:05:11.080> of<00:05:11.169> the

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
safer in the BMW than I would any of the

safer in the BMW than I would any of the

I'm in the Lexus I'm not going on
