highly<00:01:40.979> recommended<00:01:41.520> these<00:01:41.700> pumps<00:01:42.170> really

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
highly recommended these pumps really

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.260 
highly recommended these pumps really
good<00:01:43.350> they're<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:43.680> efficient<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.850> don't

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
good they're really efficient they don't

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.289 
good they're really efficient they don't
knock<00:01:45.540> when<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:45.930> come<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> off<00:01:47.299> super

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
knock when they come on and off super

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
knock when they come on and off super
quiet<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.840> can't<00:01:49.110> hear<00:01:49.320> them<00:01:49.500> at<00:01:49.710> all

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
quiet you can't hear them at all

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.130 
quiet you can't hear them at all
I<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.640> they're<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:50.880> bit<00:01:51.329> pricey<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.810> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
I know they're a little bit pricey but I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.830 
I know they're a little bit pricey but I
think<00:01:52.470> paying<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.460> something<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:54.060> little<00:01:54.750> bit

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
think paying for something a little bit

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.270 
think paying for something a little bit
more<00:01:55.020> than<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> normally<00:01:55.680> would<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.219> think

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
more than you normally would I think

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.770 
more than you normally would I think
it's<00:01:56.579> definitely<00:01:56.790> worth<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> especially<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it's definitely worth it especially the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's definitely worth it especially the
pumps<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
pumps because I know some of the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.670 
pumps because I know some of the
and<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.729> eBay<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.869> made<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.200> China<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and get on eBay that's made in China I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.999 
and get on eBay that's made in China I
mean<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:04.110> basically<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
mean it's just is just basically it

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.440

show you that's on five seconds if I
miss<00:03:20.989> pumper<00:03:21.320> come<00:03:21.470> on

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
miss pumper come on

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.860 
miss pumper come on
five<00:03:21.890> seconds<00:03:22.280> on<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.430> right-hand<00:03:22.760> side<00:03:22.870> and

five seconds on the right-hand side and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.060 
five seconds on the right-hand side and
now<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.170> one<00:03:24.350> will<00:03:24.500> come<00:03:24.650> on<00:03:24.769> four<00:03:24.920> five

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
you want or you can turn this dial here

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.720 
you want or you can turn this dial here
up<00:03:38.180> over<00:03:38.570> one<00:03:38.780> at<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:38.989> same<00:03:39.200> time<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:40.549> same

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
up over one at the same time the same

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.800 
up over one at the same time the same
amount<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.970> time<00:03:41.150> go<00:03:41.450> off<00:03:42.340> ever<00:03:43.340> say<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.540> time

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
amount of time go off ever say that time

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.860 
amount of time go off ever say that time
then<00:03:45.019> come<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:46.090> really<00:03:47.090> really<00:03:47.390> good<00:03:47.540> system

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
then come on really really good system

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.440 
then come on really really good system
will<00:03:48.110> you<00:03:48.260> turn<00:03:48.470> right<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.950> left<00:03:49.190> here

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
will you turn right to the left here

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.600 
will you turn right to the left here
while<00:03:50.450> you're<00:03:50.570> feeding<00:03:50.750> your<00:03:50.989> fish<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:52.519> the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
while you're feeding your fish and the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.550 
while you're feeding your fish and the
pumps<00:03:52.850> will<00:03:52.940> go<00:03:53.060> off<00:03:53.120> altogether<00:03:53.530> it's<00:03:54.530> a

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
pumps will go off altogether it's a

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.490 
pumps will go off altogether it's a
really<00:03:54.799> good<00:03:54.920> system<00:03:55.190> but<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.730> only<00:03:56.500> thing

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
really good system but the only thing

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.100 
really good system but the only thing
I'd<00:03:57.650> say<00:03:57.890> about<00:03:57.920> this<00:03:58.130> system<00:03:58.670> is<00:03:58.930> if<00:03:59.930> you're

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
I'd say about this system is if you're

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.069 
I'd say about this system is if you're
sliding<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.650> damp<00:04:00.890> hands<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.610> if<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.780> come<00:04:02.959> to

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
sliding to damp hands and if you come to

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.930 
sliding to damp hands and if you come to
use<00:04:03.410> these<00:04:03.560> little<00:04:03.829> knobs<00:04:03.980> are<00:04:04.190> losing<00:04:04.760> orbit

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
use these little knobs are losing orbit

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.400 
use these little knobs are losing orbit
to<00:04:05.239> small<00:04:05.510> really<00:04:05.720> they<00:04:05.900> could<00:04:05.959> do<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.290> lot

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
to small really they could do a lot

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.180 
to small really they could do a lot
unknown
