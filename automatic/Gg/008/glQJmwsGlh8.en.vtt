00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.540
 I'm shinkay today we're going to talk about the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.230
 movie after the earth with wheels 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.230
 midibus min 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.410
 this movie is a thousand years later 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.539
 that a catastrophe happens in the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.520
 planet earth and all the inhabitants of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.070
 here they have to move to another planet 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.320
 called prime and then the general that 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.720
 it is will smith and his son after doing 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.550
 an expedition and exploration are going to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 get stuck here in danger 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 surprise this land and they will have to 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.620
 face all the dangers that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.620
 that represents 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.550
 i 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.420
 directors will call and if they do not locate it it's 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.489
 the same one who made the sixth sense and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.440
 the protected are good movies only 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.759
 that this is actually science fiction 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.400
 it is not that they have more effects 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.380
 special is not that I have a greater 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.149
 it's just not a movie that is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 at the height of the blockbusters that 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.890
 they release in the summer in reality the paper 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.409
 protagonist falls on yemen who has 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 14 years and is about to turn 15 no 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.580
 is that it acts badly or even simply 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.590
 it lacks something to shine completely 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.460
 in this movie it has good effects 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.770
 special 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.960
 is a good script is not something that does not 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.240
 we have previously seen one of the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.100
 mistakes maybe has this movie is that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.470
 he came out with fast and furious that it was a 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.909
 long-awaited movie and then it's 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.640
 hard here he has not achieved 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 excelling is not bad however it is not 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.080
 those great productions that we were 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.409
 waiting to go and see and tell us what 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.409
 it seemed 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.049
 it's the wii 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.399
 Y 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.920

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.880
 danger 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.680
 the curious facts of this movie will 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.260
 smith is the producer of the tape yesterday 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.000
 I personally look for calls so that 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.739
 I directed this tape because I had 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.270
 eager to work with this 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.030
 director but it had not been done 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.440
 this first film in 20 years that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.450
 call land whose script is not 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.550
 specifically of since it is a 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.709
 history of will smith in which they call 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.000
 he collaborated on the script but it's not a 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.400
 history will call as sex 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.019
 meaning and other movies that we saw this 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.000
 it's the second time that points appear in 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.069
 the big screen and even in will smith 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.800
 since they first appeared in 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.780
 pursuit of happiness despite 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.459
 Will Smith had produced some other 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.970
 tapes where his son came out as 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.930
 It was karate kid 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.680
