the<00:01:45.030> pressure<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:45.840> applying<00:01:46.170> it's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the pressure that I'm applying it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
the pressure that I'm applying it's
going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.490> very<00:01:47.820> very<00:01:48.630> light<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.259> I'm

going to be very very light because I'm

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.190 
going to be very very light because I'm
at<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.159> line<00:01:50.399> where<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.299> causes<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.930> most

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
at the line where it causes the most

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.160 
at the line where it causes the most
problems<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.820> most<00:01:54.000> breakage<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.780> done

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
problems and the most breakage if done

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.319 
problems and the most breakage if done
wrong<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.860> we're<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> braid<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.880> just

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
wrong so we're going to braid this just

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.539 
wrong so we're going to braid this just
to<00:01:57.450> give<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> look<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:59.070> we're<00:01:59.219> talking

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to give you a look at what we're talking

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.999 
to give you a look at what we're talking
about<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.780> I'm<00:02:00.960> picking<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.649> I'm

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
about the way I'm picking this up I'm

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859 
about the way I'm picking this up I'm
not<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.520> picking<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:03.090> into<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> follicle

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
not really picking up into the follicle

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.490 
not really picking up into the follicle
and<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.500> sort<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.950> braiding<00:02:05.430> backwards<00:02:06.030> I'm

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
and I'm sort of braiding backwards I'm

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.859 
and I'm sort of braiding backwards I'm
picking<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> hair<00:02:07.829> up<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.849> tiny<00:02:09.420> bit<00:02:09.720> at

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
picking the hair up just a tiny bit at

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.750 
picking the hair up just a tiny bit at
the<00:02:09.959> follicle<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.890> I'm<00:02:11.009> letting<00:02:11.220> all<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the follicle but I'm letting all the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.790 
the follicle but I'm letting all the
extension<00:02:12.390> do<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> rest<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> work

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
extension do the rest of the work

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.760 
extension do the rest of the work
that<00:02:14.490> way<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.420> client<00:02:15.780> doesn't<00:02:16.410> experience

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
that way this client doesn't experience

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.930 
that way this client doesn't experience
hair<00:02:17.310> loss<00:02:17.520> when<00:02:18.120> taking<00:02:18.510> her<00:02:18.690> method<00:02:19.110> off

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
hair loss when taking her method off

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.970 
hair loss when taking her method off
this<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> wonderful<00:02:21.990> way<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.230> achieve<00:02:22.950> that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
this is a wonderful way to achieve that

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.750 
this is a wonderful way to achieve that
so<00:02:23.910> as<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:24.300> see<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:25.080> may<00:02:25.500> look<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:26.460> I'm

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
so as you can see it may look like I'm

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.480 
so as you can see it may look like I'm
picking<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.270> up<00:02:27.450> very<00:02:28.410> very<00:02:28.800> lightly<00:02:29.100> because

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
picking it up very very lightly because

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.760 
picking it up very very lightly because
I<00:02:29.670> am<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.240> we're<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.170> braid<00:02:31.470> all<00:02:31.710> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
I am and we're going to braid all the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.760 
I am and we're going to braid all the
way<00:02:32.100> down<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.880> she<00:02:33.540> my<00:02:33.840> models<00:02:34.200> not<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.530> any

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
way down and she my models not in any

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.820 
way down and she my models not in any
pain<00:02:35.100> which<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.150> very<00:02:36.420> important<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.200> I'm<00:02:37.590> not

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
pain which is very important and I'm not

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.070 
pain which is very important and I'm not
pulling<00:02:38.370> from<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.730> follicle<00:02:38.970> we<00:02:39.540> end<00:02:39.750> up<00:02:39.900> with

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
pulling from the follicle we end up with

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.380 
pulling from the follicle we end up with
bumps<00:02:40.410> from<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.680> hairline<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:42.090> lot<00:02:42.270> of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
bumps from the hairline and a lot of

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.600 
bumps from the hairline and a lot of
other<00:02:42.540> things<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.170> cause<00:02:44.130> hair<00:02:44.580> loss

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
other things that can cause hair loss

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.340 
other things that can cause hair loss
and<00:02:45.030> that's<00:02:45.240> what<00:02:45.420> we<00:02:45.510> don't<00:02:45.720> want<00:02:45.960> we<00:02:46.140> want<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
and that's what we don't want we want a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.050 
and that's what we don't want we want a
beautiful<00:02:46.620> method<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.700> flow

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
beautiful method but we want it to flow

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.630 
beautiful method but we want it to flow
so<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.950> way<00:02:50.070> we're<00:02:50.250> going<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> braid

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
so this is the way we're going to braid

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.780 
so this is the way we're going to braid
this<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.860> here<00:02:52.860> when<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.430> little<00:02:53.700> bit

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
this in here when you get a little bit

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.490 
this in here when you get a little bit
of<00:02:53.880> pickup<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.540> drop<00:02:54.750> out<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.020> little<00:02:55.260> bit

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
of pickup you can drop out a little bit

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.440 
of pickup you can drop out a little bit
you<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.370> pick<00:02:56.520> up<00:02:56.670> every<00:02:57.180> little

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
you don't have to pick up every little

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.990 
you don't have to pick up every little
piece<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.780> hair<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.290> hairline<00:02:59.130> because<00:02:59.790> it

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
piece of hair on the hairline because it

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.570 
piece of hair on the hairline because it
will<00:03:00.150> naturally<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:01.020> kind<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.320> go<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.040> be

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
will naturally just kind of go in and be

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.150 
will naturally just kind of go in and be
comfortable<00:03:03.060> for<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.420> client<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:04.530> this

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
particular method so we pull out a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.370 
particular method so we pull out a
little<00:03:09.930> bit<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.420> that's<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.630> comfortable<00:03:13.200> way

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
little bit and that's a comfortable way
