00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.049
 hi but baby it's laura I hope that 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.120
 you are fine 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.309
 if you already know you know that 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.960
 I have long hair but that does not prevent 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.090
 not being able to give you five ideas 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.380
 hairstyle for short hair in addition 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.929
 that they are very easy to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.400
 achieve 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.710
 we start right away with the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.600
 first hairstyle on Monday I take a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:30.810
 tail comb to come to realize a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:32.550
 side region that I then choose on 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 a first side I take a wick that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.520
 I'm going twisted is tied on 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.880
 the back of my debt with a clamp 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.880
 flat 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.940
 I then reproduce the same thing from 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.010
 the other side being careful 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.079
 to keep volume on the top of my 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.079
 wick so that it is not all raplapla 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:12.880
 and you have the right to dance the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.479
 reprieve on Tuesday I'm going to make a braid 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.220
 African 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.220
 I decide to keep my line on the side 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.170
 I take a big wick that I know 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.700
 by in three equal parts and I 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.180
 begins to squeeze like for a truce 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.180
 classical 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.640
 then with the mass falling back to 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.140
 the bottom I come to take a wick 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.420
 extra that I add to this one 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.189
 and jules and flap both on the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.170
 center of mattress be careful 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.869
 to ceret your 13 so that it stays well 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.610
 plated to your face with the wick owed 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.770
 the game comes add a new wick 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:20.030
 is the same I pick up and two locks at 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:21.650
 middle of my braids or there there are some 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.940
 it's not cool brushed beautiful 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.200
 hair because when you have 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.519
 knots like that it's not practical for 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:34.459
 do your braids I tie and then 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.410
 mattress with transparent elastic and 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.489
 with a flat clip I just tie it 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.489
 on the back of my hair 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.150
 on wednesday I come to crimp the top of 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.350
 my hair and make a braid on 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.940
 sides always using my loincloth to 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.740
 that I take a wick on top of 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:10.930
 my head and I'm coming to tie it with a 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:14.970
 bar for it does not bother me yes 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.970
 I chose the bar 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.860
 then on my first side I 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.510
 select a wick and I fold them 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.290
 hair I do not need on 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.290
 the back of my head 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.180
 I come next braided mameche in the 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.100
 of course putting the side of my face 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.180
 for her to follow the movement when I 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.180
 will come the task and on the back 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.230
 I work with an elastic band 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.060
 transparent and I come to do exactly 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.240
 the same thing on the other side of my 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.240
 face 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.319
 once I did but 13 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.759
 I tie everything on the back of my 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:33.469
 head with my big barrette and I come 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.469
 crimp the top to give volume 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.070
 I then attach the part I have 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.290
 created peace on the back with two clamps 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.290
 flat and the more they do it 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.650
 I fix everything with lacquer 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.650
 I just bought but 13 out of 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.250
 the back of my head with pliers 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.250
 flat again 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.130
 for Thursday's hairstyle I find that 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.630
 it's super simple and too cute 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.060
 make a little knot in our hair 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.450
 so we keep our hair creped on the 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.130
 on top to have volume and I attach 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.670
 but what is created peace with a 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:18.370
 transparent elastic once well my 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.470
 task and I'm going to pass my ribbon or a 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.960
 scarf to choose me I chose a 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.830
 ribbon game the task on the top and I 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.830
 make a nice knot 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.099
 on Friday everything is allowed it's 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.300

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.300

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:47.590
 and what are we doing 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.590
 slide on the back of our skull 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.809
 we take a first wick on a 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:57.219
 first part of our face we 

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:57.219
 roll up in their requests 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.750
 and then I take the second step 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.500
 from below that people are rolling again 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.500
 in the headband 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.830

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.830
