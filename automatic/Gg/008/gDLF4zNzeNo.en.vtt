00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.170 
it's not as easy and smooth as we have
in<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> company<00:00:32.040> right<00:00:32.940> now

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
in the company right now

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
in the company right now
and<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.020> sole<00:00:34.290> fact<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.860> been<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and the sole fact that it's been a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.310 
and the sole fact that it's been a
company<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.210> people<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.750> work<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:36.989> us

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
company and the people that work with us

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.340 
company and the people that work with us
being<00:00:37.649> professionals<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.170> actually<00:00:40.170> being

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
being professionals and actually being

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.490 
being professionals and actually being
grown-ups<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.190> kids<00:00:41.910> running<00:00:42.239> organizations

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
grown-ups but kids running organizations

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.190 
grown-ups but kids running organizations
helps<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.460> love<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.130 

like<00:00:52.200> I<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:53.100> had<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.790> even<00:00:54.240> wasps<00:00:54.630> season

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
like I think we had it even wasps season

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.800 
like I think we had it even wasps season
but<00:00:55.440> after<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:56.850> losing<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.390> everything

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
but after all the losing and everything

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.490 
but after all the losing and everything
it's<00:00:58.110> just<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.680> mentality<00:00:59.100> went<00:00:59.400> quite<00:00:59.760> down

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
it's just the mentality went quite down

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
it's just the mentality went quite down
so<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.250> least<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> facts<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
so I think the least of the facts is the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
so I think the least of the facts is the
new<00:01:03.570> coach<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.020> the<00:01:04.110> new<00:01:04.230> top<00:01:04.440> laner<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.890> gonna

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
new coach in the new top laner are gonna

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.250 
new coach in the new top laner are gonna
refresh<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.120> mindset<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> whole<00:01:07.020> team

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
refresh the mindset of the whole team

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.620 
refresh the mindset of the whole team
it's<00:01:07.920> gonna<00:01:08.070> give<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.430> new<00:01:08.670> hope<00:01:08.940> new<00:01:09.210> goal

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it's gonna give them new hope new goal

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.520 
it's gonna give them new hope new goal
you<00:01:10.410> strive<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.600> show<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> new<00:01:13.140> trust

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you strive to actually show a new trust

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
you strive to actually show a new trust
that<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:13.890> actually<00:01:14.490> achieve<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.600> be

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that they can actually achieve and be

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.890 
that they can actually achieve and be
good<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.890> top<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:17.900> yamato

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
good on top of that I think yamato

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
good on top of that I think yamato
brings<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.680> control<00:01:20.280> over<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.670> team<00:01:20.910> which

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
brings more control over the team which

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.359 
brings more control over the team which
was<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.960> missing<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> old<00:01:22.830> coaching

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
was kind of missing in the old coaching

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.180 
was kind of missing in the old coaching
which<00:01:23.910> i<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:24.960> guys<00:01:25.200> need<00:01:25.770> more

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
which i think is what our guys need more

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.780 
which i think is what our guys need more
than<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.820> actual<00:01:26.910> like<00:01:27.750> game<00:01:28.400> knowledge<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
than the actual like game knowledge and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.210 
than the actual like game knowledge and
game<00:01:29.970> improvement<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.470> regarding<00:01:31.920> Steve

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
game improvement and the regarding Steve

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
discuss about the scrum partners like

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.460 
discuss about the scrum partners like
there's<00:02:36.640> mutual<00:02:37.300> respect<00:02:37.690> between<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.230> teams

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
there's mutual respect between the teams

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.050 
there's mutual respect between the teams
and<00:02:38.830> we<00:02:39.580> try<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.880> keep<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:41.400> for<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.459> future

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
and we try to keep that for the future

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.979 
and we try to keep that for the future
oh<00:02:43.620> good<00:02:44.620> but<00:02:45.310> never<00:02:45.940> scripts<00:02:46.330> never<00:02:46.570> mattered

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
oh good but never scripts never mattered

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.890 
oh good but never scripts never mattered
well<00:02:47.410> that's<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.739> what<00:02:48.400> season<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:48.880> had<00:02:49.030> good

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
well that's like what season we had good

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.970 
well that's like what season we had good

based<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.400> scripts<00:02:54.730> who<00:02:54.880> would<00:02:55.030> have<00:02:55.209> been<00:02:55.390> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
based on scripts who would have been the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.520 
based on scripts who would have been the
best<00:02:55.660> team<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:55.989> Europe<00:02:59.910> like<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.570> scripts<00:03:02.140> are

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
best team in Europe like the scripts are

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.310 
best team in Europe like the scripts are
more<00:03:03.010> casual<00:03:03.549> like<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:04.390> lot<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.989> teams<00:03:05.170> are

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
more casual like a lot of the teams are

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.789 
more casual like a lot of the teams are
actually<00:03:05.680> trying<00:03:05.950> out<00:03:06.190> instead<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.880> they're

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
actually trying out instead of they're

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.710 
actually trying out instead of they're
exploiting<00:03:08.799> their<00:03:09.010> limits<00:03:09.540> trying<00:03:10.540> their

exploiting their limits trying their

exploiting their limits trying their
hardest<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.230> actually<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.780> maximum

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
hardest to actually like to the maximum

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.810 
hardest to actually like to the maximum
they<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.560> extend<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.220> something<00:03:15.670> which

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
they can extend on something which

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.610 
they can extend on something which
usually<00:03:16.120> they're<00:03:16.510> not<00:03:16.660> gonna<00:03:16.810> do<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.290> LCS

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
usually they're not gonna do in the LCS

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.560 
usually they're not gonna do in the LCS
they<00:03:17.890> try<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.220> be<00:03:18.489> more<00:03:18.730> safe<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.360> play

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
they try to be more safe to play

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.140 
they try to be more safe to play
rational<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.290> play<00:03:20.470> more<00:03:20.709> team<00:03:21.549> objective

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
rational to play more team objective

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.210 
rational to play more team objective
games<00:03:22.360> like<00:03:22.630> examples<00:03:23.470> are<00:03:23.680> what<00:03:24.010> are<00:03:24.100> the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
games like examples are what are the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.580 
games like examples are what are the
times<00:03:24.459> on<00:03:24.700> ten<00:03:25.060> minute<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.600> LCS<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.200> have<00:03:26.380> two

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
times on ten minute and LCS you have two

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.310 
times on ten minute and LCS you have two
three<00:03:26.860> four<00:03:27.160> kills<00:03:27.459> always<00:03:28.269> Crimson's<00:03:28.989> most

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
three four kills always Crimson's most

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.370 
three four kills always Crimson's most
probably<00:03:29.650> already<00:03:29.799> on<00:03:30.010> 12:30<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:30.970> 15<00:03:31.390> kills

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
probably already on 12:30 and 15 kills

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.100 
probably already on 12:30 and 15 kills
in<00:03:32.680> like<00:03:33.670> two<00:03:33.970> all<00:03:34.120> together<00:03:34.390> from<00:03:34.690> both<00:03:34.900> teams

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
in like two all together from both teams

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.580 
in like two all together from both teams
so<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.519> can't<00:03:36.940> really<00:03:37.269> compare<00:03:37.540> scrim<00:03:38.200> styles

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
so you can't really compare scrim styles

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
so you can't really compare scrim styles

to<00:03:39.760> learn<00:03:40.000> from<00:03:40.360> doesn't<00:03:41.170> matter<00:03:41.290> if<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.590> win

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
to learn from doesn't matter if you win

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.740 
to learn from doesn't matter if you win
or<00:03:41.890> lose<00:03:42.070> how<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.640> play<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.269> scrims<00:03:43.570> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
or lose how you play in the scrims the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.110 
or lose how you play in the scrims the
important<00:03:44.410> thing<00:03:44.590> is<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.980> find<00:03:45.519> out<00:03:45.670> what<00:03:45.970> you

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120
