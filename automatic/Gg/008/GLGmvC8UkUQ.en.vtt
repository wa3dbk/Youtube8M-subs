00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
bit and that worked a bit better but it

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.270 
bit and that worked a bit better but it
was<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:31.049> in<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.379> mix<00:02:31.560> up<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:31.920> found

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
was really in the mix up that I found

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.360 
was really in the mix up that I found
success<00:02:33.140> second<00:02:34.140> set<00:02:34.349> was<00:02:34.380> tough<00:02:34.830> for<00:02:34.860> me<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
and got the better of me but I was happy

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.289

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
that the first two sets took some time
