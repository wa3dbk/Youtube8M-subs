00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
using the reflex sight with the select

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.090 
using the reflex sight with the select
fire<00:00:34.859> and<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.249> select<00:00:35.519> fire<00:00:35.699> for<00:00:36.059> auto<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
fire and the select fire for auto is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.369 
fire and the select fire for auto is
amazing<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.429> weapon<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.079> this<00:00:40.079> gun<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
amazing on this weapon is this gun is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.110 
amazing on this weapon is this gun is
probably<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.159> the<00:00:41.309> best<00:00:41.489> guns<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
probably one of the best guns in the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.599 
probably one of the best guns in the
game<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.719> overpowered<00:00:43.409> no<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.489> not

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
game is it overpowered no it's not

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.790 
game is it overpowered no it's not
overpowered<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.690> don't<00:00:45.870> think<00:00:46.109> this<00:00:46.260> gun<00:00:46.530> needs

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
overpowered I don't think this gun needs

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.309 
overpowered I don't think this gun needs
to<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.039> touched<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:48.629> lot<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.019> people<00:00:49.140> are

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:49.319 
to be touched and a lot of people are

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:51.410 
to be touched and a lot of people are
talking<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:49.769> it<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.159> saying<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
talking about it right now saying you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.700 
talking about it right now saying you
know<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.809> needs<00:00:51.929> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.199> taken<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.679> of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
know it needs to be taken out of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.000 
know it needs to be taken out of
competitive<00:00:53.550> play<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.989> should<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.350> nerfed<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
competitive play it should be nerfed and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.669 
competitive play it should be nerfed and
I<00:00:56.760> hope<00:00:57.059> they<00:00:57.089> don't<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.749> that<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> reason

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
I hope they don't do that and the reason

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.129 
I hope they don't do that and the reason
for<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.280> there's<00:00:59.969> weapons<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.870> game

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:01.139

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
know the vector you look at the MSMC all

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.529 
know the vector you look at the MSMC all
four<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> those<00:01:13.710> smgs<00:01:14.369> are<00:01:14.520> amazing<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.180> close

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
four of those smgs are amazing up close

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.830 
four of those smgs are amazing up close
and<00:01:15.860> they<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.189> don't<00:01:17.219> even<00:01:17.700> need<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.479> aim

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and they really don't even need to aim

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
and they really don't even need to aim
down<00:01:19.200> sight<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:19.950> even<00:01:20.070> need<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.369> aim

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
down sight you don't even need to aim

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.039 
down sight you don't even need to aim
down<00:01:20.729> sight<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.240> those<00:01:21.390> weapons<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.899> can

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
down sight with those weapons you can

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.649 
down sight with those weapons you can
just<00:01:22.229> hip<00:01:22.860> fire<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
just hip fire and just do well with that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.289 
just hip fire and just do well with that
weapon<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.289> that's<00:01:25.829> I<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.729> problem

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
weapon and that's I think the problem

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.830 
weapon and that's I think the problem
with<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.630> weapon<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.170> has<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.320> high<00:01:29.119> no<00:01:30.119> spray

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
with this weapon it has a high no spray

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.289 
with this weapon it has a high no spray
that<00:01:31.649> you<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.520> hip<00:01:32.670> fire<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> it's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that you know you can hip fire and it's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.810 
that you know you can hip fire and it's
very<00:01:33.630> effective<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.770> mention<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.310> it's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
very effective not to mention it's it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.870 
very effective not to mention it's it's
a<00:01:35.969> crazy<00:01:36.450> long<00:01:36.990> distance<00:01:37.560> gun<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.859> mean<00:01:38.219> you<00:01:38.700> got

why the pistols are there to counter

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.240 
why the pistols are there to counter
weapons<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.599> are<00:03:09.750> amazing<00:03:10.440> up<00:03:10.590> close<00:03:10.920> and

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
me and I think I tide would suck so I

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.850 
me and I think I tide would suck so I
could<00:05:57.880> add<00:05:58.000> another<00:05:58.110> stealth<00:05:59.110> chopper<00:05:59.560> once
