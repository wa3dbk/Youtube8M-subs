00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 in form of this week I tested 2 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 Italians and 1 Scotsman as you see 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.610
 in my composition there is also 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.829
 martin skrtel from this team of the week but 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.079
 I tested it say so out 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.520
 contest can not say anything about him 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.059
 good defender 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.309
 did not stand out well defended 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.500
 and what is required of it and the link to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.719
 composition as usual I will leave in the description 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.969
 what's the plus of this composition is very good 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 flank defenders are some of the best in 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.070
 series a striker with five stars 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.739
 special tricks in the center is my 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 Favorite Vidal from the series but you can 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.239
 I want to put on a boar 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.460
 see gamshik too good company 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.040
 minole to my surprise very well 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.650
 played but so basically in this composition 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.580
 There are no such pronounced minuses very 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 good composition 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.290
 and now I will tell my opinion of three 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 my current patients first i 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.180
 I'll tell you about inform Andrea Pirlo, I think 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.549
 that many have been waiting to inform this guy and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.740
 its not quick price in the market 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.960
 connected with this because many 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.280
 did not try this player did not play for 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.619
 him because of his speed 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.659
 and now his info has appeared and everything is sharp 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 wanted to test it 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.350
 and therefore it costs about a hundred thousand in 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.280
 principle 100,000 is not so big 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.890
 problem 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.590
 you can afford but is it worth it 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.390
 of these coins now we will look at 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.509
 on his stat they are of course all that 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.490
 It concerns the kick stroke twist that is 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.750
 all actions that should be done 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.000
 the player standing still they have pyrr just 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.290
 godlike they are more than 90 even often 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
 more than 95 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.719
 you see everything on your screens and play 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 for Andrea Pirlo I want to say yes 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.810
 he really has a good pass with him 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.060
 good vision of the field blah blah blah up 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.550
 good penalties good angles good 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.560
 penalty if you put it in the center 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.420
 fields with some fast type guy 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.450
 how i did it with vital 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.880
 either spock fight or marquisio with the same 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.319
 with which he has perfect is exactly that of 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.290
 Andrea Pirlo you can survive 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.209
 actually its maximum that's all i 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.959
 put him eight and a half points 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.970
 out of ten 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.200
 very good player advise you 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.390
 try the legend 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.489
 what else do you want to say when I had 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.550
 Andrea Pirlo on the field inside of me was 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.040
 such a kind of confidence for your 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.480
 composition that is, there is such a dad who 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.959
 will lead everyone else 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.690
 players 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.400
 they will follow him obey him in 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.049
 general andrea pirlo recommend eight 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.610
 half of ten is very good 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.209
 central midfielder 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.489
 then I will tell about the kris to mansi it 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.470
 the guy from the compartment is remarkable because 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.750
 he is of course perfect 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.840
 stevenom with the famous harry makay 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.090
 Steven Oms legend 15 Feb and a kind 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.920
 5 stars special tricks good speed 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.549
 very good poppy steven but we are now 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.570
 we are not talking about him we are talking about the team 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.690
 We look at his stats first 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.739
 striking his balance is 92 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.540
 his penalty kick power and finish he is very 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.970
 he played so good at me 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.700
 lcd positions and what i want to say guys 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.750
 I was not a bit disappointed he played 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.209
 almost better than poppy and stephen hit 81 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.880
 he justifies this blow in full he is very 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.709
 cool shot on goal he scored 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.510
 I'm very interesting goals and unfortunately 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.109
 not all the moments I managed to write 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.420
 but believe me he played very well if 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.889
 you want to try poppy and steven 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.780
 if you haven't done it yet 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.940
 wanted i don't know why guys try 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.030
 really cool then you can 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.519
 put it just in conjunction with the chris 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.410
 commence a perfect chemistry very 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.230
 convenient inform such a beautiful card 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.420
 can put very low see it 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.069
 so-called talents fu twist us 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.290
 says he's good at deathlok sho you 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.859
 good playmaker and he has a good 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.920
 dribbling 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.530
 yes all the truth I put this player 9 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.760
 points out of 10 for the most part for what 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.760
 I really have a lot 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.359
 scored on the position of the fvd will remind him better 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.539
 use 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.069
 On l m I do not know whether space 71 will 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.729
 bring you much benefit 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:28.900
 but then a score of 9 is set by me in 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.270
 mainly due to the fact that he firstly 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.949
 crippled strong secondly he has 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.849
 very good perfect in poppy and 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.169
 Stephen Well, in the third he he he scored 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.629
 really he scores really 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.969
 ok plays chris commons very you him 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:45.639
 I advise and finally we guys 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.639
 getting close to in antonio kondrovo formulas 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.310
 this guy could be in the shadow of such 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.860
 in form of how grizzmann david silva 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.500
 and robin is not very lucky for him with the team 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.689
 of the week he obviously loses them 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.060
 ranked by stats but few 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.310
 loses I want to say well only 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.150
 look guys at these stats they are all 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.699
 green 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.610
 right flank squares of series a left 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.469
 here it is the new cuadrado the only thing 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.719
 The difference of course is no 5 star special 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:17.349
 tricks well and so very balanced and 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:19.060
 from then you are very good hit very him 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.849
 all ok accusative guys i don't know what 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.500
 talking about him he scored with me just 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.180
 some masterpiece goals even 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.300
 naturally better than chris commons it 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.460
 no wonder because well and the stat 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.310
 it is better and it costs several times 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.319
 more expensive many times more expensive but antonio 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.449
 Conder was exactly the way we are 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.509
 would like to see him on the right flank 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.940
 series and this is a very cool right winger 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:46.050
 even in a position get me playing 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.750
 as you see stamina 96 well it's just 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:53.710
 present for current fife where ps solves 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.870
 a lot of things and truth and force of impact 95 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.569
 kick and 92 well guys what more do you need 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:02.349
 I don't need anything else for 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.240
 attacking player and he has a height of 181 and 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.759
 principle physics is not bad for an attacker 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.639
 the player is far below him 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.919
 don't really unsubscribe he himself 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.129
 shoves i would say i set 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:18.039
 antonio can wood 10 points out of 10 this 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:20.110
 the highest score and its price is quite justified 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.360
 this is something around 200 thousand on 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.479
 playstation price is justified 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.300
 great player great finish il a 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:30.190
