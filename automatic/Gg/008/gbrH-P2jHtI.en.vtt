00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.289
 Talk to me once more welcome. 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.509
 a channel video and we are going to another pc 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:13.159
 the inscribed and this time we are with you 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.289
 the bush rabbit 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:18.800
 let's go to his pc's settings 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.740
 processor is a phenom ii x4 of 95 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.830
 cooled with 70 cpu color cooler 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.480
 Of course his mother board is of the asus is m 5 a 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.930
 7 8 l mlx Brazilian memory model 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.899
 It has 4GB of Kingston HD 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.210
 it has a max content of 80 gb sata 2 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.859
 however it has indicated that it will exchange for 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.550
 one of one will have what is well needed 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:46.250
 in this case the video card is a gtx 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.350
 640 has the 1 gig accent cabinet 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.359
 was the cost xo year 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.000
 only it's a different series to arh 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.640
 meditate on it is more advanced and the source is 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.640
 very interesting is giving a certain model gs 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.780
 600 watts real and 80 plus is a model 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.820
 that game 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.440
 Let's show this machine the first time. 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.990
 image by default is already being 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.910
 we have the overview of the pc gives 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.680
 to see the tidiness of the cable he made 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.780
 It is not very good. 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.460
 It's a little low, he has a little more. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.410
 patience but is not the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.330
 worst case it provides a 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.610
 Nice assembly, then you can improve. 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.040
 some details on cable management 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.440
 the next image is taking the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.810
 processor and memory is clearly visible 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.420
 What you're looking for is huge. 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.390
 really the ones and the search is only used 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.830
 for you to overclock people not 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.480
 recommend you put a chip prides 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.410
 this size if you do not 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.960
 overclock 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.670
 but in the case of it being a processor 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.370
 unlocked he put it on 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.870
 overclock including a detail is that 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.630
 to take the memory it will have to 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.370
 get the cpu wedge also because you 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.640
 looks right on top of the memory 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.800
 inclusive is only mine 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 now here is the default template 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.540
 four gigs it only has one comb 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.880
 but this card more supports up to 16 gb 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.159
 In this image we have the video card one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.740
 model of zotac as they are seeing is the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.510
 gtx 150 t this may make it 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.759
 majority of my writings have this 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.070
 video card precisely by the tests 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.570
 that I've done previously is a plaque 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.760
 video I recommend to everyone 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.709
 which is a good value for money you 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.810
 can get one of this for 500 reais 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.319
 around this and you will be able to 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.300
 rotate f3 in uterus in full hd and bs-4 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.790
 you will also be able to ride with this 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.250
 video card there in medium quality 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.230
 In this other image we can see that the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.630
 his cabinet has several 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.640
 plague to testify it only has hd of 80 gb 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.739
 he has already made it clear that he will 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.330
 hd to where the inter was what becomes 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.370
 a priority for him 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.920
 Let's talk a little bit about the source is 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.540
 The Color Model Saw Game is a series 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.120
 that the right color in which the differential 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.370
 it is that it has a led in the cooler 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.430
 it has a general performance in 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.470
 slightly higher than the series and x is a source 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.930
 that it provides for it has a great 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.360
 future of video card is a good source 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.130
 Nice even now I'm going through a 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.190
 series of images of the cabinet that is a 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.500
 stress x 1 year air meditate he owns 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.989
 some differentials in the side cover gives 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.870
 to put 2 tablespoons and it has a 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.090
 pretty good looking design on the front 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.600
 his main differential is that he 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.870
 has sbt 3.0 but the subscriber does not 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.670
 is using these two psb 3.0 since 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.310
 his motherboard has no input 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.620
 front for this type of usb on the front 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.049
 It has one more cooler and in the 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.720
 You can put two more spoons in it. 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.290
 is the windows rating scored 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.970
 5.8 because of hd and this was one more 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.220
 written request I hope you have 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.290
 liked it if you liked the jewel 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.269
 had favorites remembering that people 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.579
 Now there's our facebook, I always ask. 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.900
 For you to like facebook page 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.060
 there we have a capacity of 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.890
 interaction much bigger if you want 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.569
 watching the latest video is just clicking 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.189
 in the last video that is happening until 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.120
 She's that, give me a hug until 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.120
 next time it was
