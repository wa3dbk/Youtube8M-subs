ultrasound<00:01:00.989> test<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> heart<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
ultrasound test of the heart and so a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.539 
ultrasound test of the heart and so a
large<00:01:03.149> hole<00:01:03.719> between<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> two<00:01:05.010> ventricles

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
large hole between the two ventricles

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
large hole between the two ventricles
between<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> two<00:01:06.510> pumping<00:01:06.810> chambers<00:01:06.869> he

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
between the two pumping chambers he

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
between the two pumping chambers he
basically<00:01:08.010> told<00:01:08.310> me<00:01:08.549> he's<00:01:09.000> having<00:01:09.240> heart

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
failure when I first heard I just start

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.880 
failure when I first heard I just start
crying<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.479> figured<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:15.990> like

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
crying like I just figured you know like

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.730 
crying like I just figured you know like
I<00:01:17.009> was<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> lose<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.520> son<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:19.530> were<00:01:19.650> gonna

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I was going to lose my son we were gonna

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
I was going to lose my son we were gonna
try<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.549> him<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:21.060> least<00:01:21.210> seven<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
try to get him to at least seven to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
try to get him to at least seven to
eight<00:01:21.900> months<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.619> age<00:01:24.439> before<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
eight months of age before to do the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.440 
eight months of age before to do the
surgery<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.270> he<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.689> suffering<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
surgery but he was just suffering the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179 
surgery but he was just suffering the
way<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> hearts<00:01:31.140> developed<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.950> should

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
way that the hearts developed it should

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.010 
way that the hearts developed it should
function<00:01:32.400> as<00:01:32.759> kind<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> two<00:01:33.270> separate<00:01:33.630> pumps

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
function as kind of two separate pumps

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.810 
function as kind of two separate pumps
so<00:01:34.680> there's<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.280> heart<00:01:35.520> that's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
so there's a right heart that's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
so there's a right heart that's
receiving<00:01:36.210> blood<00:01:36.509> from<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> body<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> then

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
receiving blood from the body and then

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
receiving blood from the body and then
its<00:01:38.130> primary<00:01:38.430> job<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.180> pump<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.600> blood

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
its primary job is to pump that blood

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
its primary job is to pump that blood
out<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> longest<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
out to the longest and then you have the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.090 
out to the longest and then you have the
left<00:01:42.210> side<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> heart<00:01:42.869> that's<00:01:43.530> receiving

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
left side of the heart that's receiving

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
left side of the heart that's receiving
all<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.490> blood<00:01:44.700> from<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> lungs<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
all that blood from the lungs is all the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
all that blood from the lungs is all the
oxygen-rich<00:01:46.380> blood<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> body<00:01:47.369> needs

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
oxygen-rich blood that the body needs

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.300 
oxygen-rich blood that the body needs
and<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.600> left<00:01:48.840> hearts<00:01:49.170> job<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.770> simply<00:01:50.189> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and that left hearts job is simply to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
and that left hearts job is simply to
pump<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> blood<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> body<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> if

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
pump that blood out to the body so if

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950 
pump that blood out to the body so if
you<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> hole<00:01:53.549> between<00:01:53.759> those<00:01:54.750> two

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you have a hole between those two

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
you have a hole between those two
pumping<00:01:55.320> chambers<00:01:55.380> then<00:01:56.280> blood<00:01:56.579> starts<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> go

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
pumping chambers then blood starts to go

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
pumping chambers then blood starts to go
in<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> wrong<00:01:57.570> directions<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:58.500> was

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
in all the wrong directions there was

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.440 
in all the wrong directions there was
times<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> would<00:01:59.700> struggle<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.299> he

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
times that I would struggle that he

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
times that I would struggle that he
wouldn't<00:02:00.719> eat<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> would<00:02:01.710> cry<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.189> like

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
wouldn't eat so I would cry a lot like
