00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.220
 the flight operations manager have 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.120
 have the same knowledge as a 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.260
 captain and a flight captain 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.400
 here in sin is done throughout the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.520
 year 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.310
 matters that I which enter 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.470
 meteorology that and balance merchandise 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.570
 dangerous material depending on the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.960
 different planes 737 and 767 boiled and in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.550
 the background he is going to plan the flight 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.150
 so that when the captain arrives he 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.150
 dispatch 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.329
 well the most important also the re 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.550
 possibility of having in charge the ways 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.859
 human beings that are transported on the flight 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.269
 since we are not talking about a 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.540
 person of two people but of hundreds 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.300
 of people 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.400
 then it is a great factor also of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.400
 responsibility for us for the 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.120
 capital and for all the people who are 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.580
 on land since the plane has to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.730
 fly through many cities of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
 many places and it can be very if it's that 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.080
 it is not prepared in the best way and can 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.060
 be very important some accident that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.060
 I'm going to pass an incident in the good 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.690
 it's a short but very intense race 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.150
 and that opens doors 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.640
 branch to continue studying many things 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.640
 it has stuck commercial air traffic controller 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.880
 It is a dynamic work and is not 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.760
 readmitted has repetitive waste 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.630
 that today you can wake up a plane 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.000
 with 190 tons and tomorrow that same 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.920
 plane maybe it will take off with 180 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.930
 tons because because the conditions 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.640
 they have varied then it is a job 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.640
 dynamic and pressure 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 it's a super race like it's very 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.760
 hidden people and well although he does not know 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.110
 that to dispatch a plane you have to 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.120
 study tells us that you arrive and you 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.920
 they hire that he works there but he does not have 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.110
 to go through a study you have to 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.530
 give you an exam in the let it take out your 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.300
 leave these five with just leave 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.340
 apt and you can work anywhere 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.340
 without your license you can not do anything 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.370
 and good between each time I had a pleasant 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.190
 even bigger experience a moment 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.000
 there I met a lot of very good people very 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.400
 trained very professional in all the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.610
 aeronautical field and teaching towards 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 us since they especially are 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.010
 the ones in charge to give us all the base and 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.860
 all the facilities to learn what 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.220
 it's really this job they put us 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.370
 a lot of existence many make us have 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.250
 a lot of character and a lot of handling of 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.610
 the adverse situations to the flight and that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.400
 It is most important to reach 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.120
 where are we who takes care of 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.120
 Good operations 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.930
 behind the plane there are many people there 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.870
 many things and interesting because they are 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.600
 things that normally one does not see them or 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.590
 be a passenger does not know that people 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.810
 that does not sound good that is with the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.790
 respect jacket does not know that salt does not 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.110
 they know that person is the person who 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.110
 that life depends
