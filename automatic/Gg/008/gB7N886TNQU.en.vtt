under the plan wrestling so right away
I'm<00:00:17.640> firing<00:00:17.910> off<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> couple<00:00:18.390> shots<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.960> the

I'm firing off a couple shots of the
Avalanche<00:00:19.830> hopefully<00:00:20.279> take<00:00:20.490> down<00:00:20.670> some

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
Avalanche hopefully take down some

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.240 
Avalanche hopefully take down some
barriers<00:00:21.029> may<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.660> free<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.410> I'll<00:00:22.890> just

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
barriers may be free so on I'll just

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.640 
barriers may be free so on I'll just
sort<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.490> soften<00:00:23.850> him<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.420> weapon

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
excellent spot for an engineer um it's a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.270 
excellent spot for an engineer um it's a
great<00:00:42.480> spot<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.760> most<00:00:44.760> classes<00:00:45.360> um<00:00:45.980> but<00:00:46.980> it

can keep people out for cover and
whatnot<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.649> keep<00:00:55.829> using<00:00:56.160> those

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
whatnot you can just keep using those

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.700 
whatnot you can just keep using those
like<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.879> drone<00:00:57.210> or<00:00:57.539> cryo<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.289> saw<00:00:58.500> right

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
like your drone or cryo as you saw right

like your drone or cryo as you saw right
there<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.190> even<00:00:59.219> Center<00:00:59.879> 8<00:01:00.030> um<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.949> be

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
there or even Center 8 um and just be

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.560 
there or even Center 8 um and just be
you<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.850> keep<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> enemy<00:01:03.769> out<00:01:04.769> from<00:01:05.570> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you know keep the enemy out from you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
you know keep the enemy out from you
know<00:01:06.689> taking<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.260> position<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
know taking a good position and as you

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.429 
know taking a good position and as you
can<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.549> i<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.090> hit<00:01:09.240> almost<00:01:09.450> any<00:01:09.720> enemy<00:01:10.140> no

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
can see i can hit almost any enemy no

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.740 
can see i can hit almost any enemy no
matter<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.950> they're<00:01:11.220> hiding<00:01:12.090> behind<00:01:12.180> cover<00:01:12.540> or

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
matter if they're hiding behind cover or

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.580 
matter if they're hiding behind cover or
not<00:01:13.640> i'm<00:01:14.640> using<00:01:14.850> cryo<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:16.259> range

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
not i'm using cryo right there range

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.080 
not i'm using cryo right there range
just<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.070> i<00:01:17.189> wanted<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> keep<00:01:17.700> him<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:18.000> in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
just because i wanted to keep him out in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
just because i wanted to keep him out in
the<00:01:18.150> open<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.540> maybe<00:01:19.200> grow<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.770> some<00:01:20.040> shots<00:01:20.520> on

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the open it maybe grow get some shots on

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
the open it maybe grow get some shots on
but<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> looks<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.659> front<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.710> going

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
but it looks like front is going

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.460 
but it looks like front is going
toe-to-toe<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.970> arbiter<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.869> i<00:01:25.110> don't

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
toe-to-toe with arbiter so i don't

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.819 
toe-to-toe with arbiter so i don't
really<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.830> opportunity<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
really have that opportunity and so I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.569 
really have that opportunity and so I
see<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.280> there's<00:01:29.490> only<00:01:29.869> one<00:01:30.890> unit<00:01:31.890> left<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
see that there's only one unit left the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.780 
see that there's only one unit left the
assassin<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:34.200> decide<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.549> might

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
assassin and I decide you know I might

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.179 
assassin and I decide you know I might
as<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.659> move<00:01:36.900> down<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:38.070> in

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
as well just move down there and get in

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
as well just move down there and get in
close<00:01:38.460> range<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.049> an

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
close range but as you can see that's an

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
close range but as you can see that's an
absolute<00:01:40.530> great<00:01:40.860> spot<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:41.400> especially

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
absolute great spot up there especially

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330 
absolute great spot up there especially
if<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.540> few<00:01:42.840> Avalanche<00:01:43.259> shots<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
if you have a few Avalanche shots you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.880 
if you have a few Avalanche shots you
can<00:01:44.369> hit<00:01:44.520> almost<00:01:44.850> every<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.710> with<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
can hit almost every one with the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.490 
can hit almost every one with the
Avalanche<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.790> position<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
Avalanche from that position and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.290 
Avalanche from that position and
work<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.400> well<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:50.940> I<00:01:50.970> don't<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.270> if

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
work out really well now I don't know if

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.480 
work out really well now I don't know if
my<00:01:51.390> game<00:01:51.660> fucked<00:01:51.900> right<00:01:52.080> here<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:53.010> you<00:01:53.370> know

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
my game fucked right here but you know

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.830 
my game fucked right here but you know
there's<00:01:53.700> usually<00:01:53.880> supposed<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.480> a<00:01:54.510> second

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
there's usually supposed to be a second

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.620 
there's usually supposed to be a second
wave<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.260> no<00:01:55.590> second<00:01:55.980> wave<00:01:56.100> even<00:01:56.430> came<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
wave and no second wave even came so you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.390 
wave and no second wave even came so you
know<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.170> consistently<00:01:58.830> works<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
know if that consistently works in that

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.700 
know if that consistently works in that
spot<00:01:59.729> there's<00:02:00.240> another<00:02:00.750> reason<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.380> play

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
spot there's another reason to play

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.690 
spot there's another reason to play
defensively<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.900> next<00:02:04.170> video<00:02:04.700> I'm

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
defensively so in this next video I'm

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.040 
defensively so in this next video I'm
going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.910> be<00:02:06.000> showing<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:06.330> aggressive<00:02:06.840> play

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
going to be showing you aggressive play

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.410 
going to be showing you aggressive play
and<00:02:07.290> I'd<00:02:07.740> sing<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.160> engineer<00:02:08.550> you'll<00:02:09.209> see

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
and I'd sing for the engineer you'll see

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.930 
and I'd sing for the engineer you'll see
as<00:02:09.539> far<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.840> time<00:02:10.080> goes<00:02:10.350> it's<00:02:10.979> almost<00:02:11.310> equally

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
as far as time goes it's almost equally

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.510 
as far as time goes it's almost equally
as<00:02:12.150> long<00:02:12.390> aggressive<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.590> defensive<00:02:13.770> play<00:02:14.280> I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
as long aggressive and defensive play I

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.250 
as long aggressive and defensive play I
think<00:02:14.850> part<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.330> because<00:02:15.480> that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
think part of that is because that

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.030 
think part of that is because that
second<00:02:17.010> wave<00:02:17.160> never<00:02:17.459> came<00:02:18.020> for<00:02:19.020> sure<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.590> so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
second wave never came for sure but so

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.800 
second wave never came for sure but so
I'm<00:02:20.370> playing<00:02:20.700> aggressively<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:21.570> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
I'm playing aggressively right here and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.930 
I'm playing aggressively right here and
I<00:02:21.840> want<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.320> get<00:02:22.440> as<00:02:22.530> close<00:02:22.709> as<00:02:22.800> possible<00:02:22.950> so

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
I want to get as close as possible so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.170 
I want to get as close as possible so
right<00:02:24.120> away<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.510> cast<00:02:24.810> my<00:02:24.989> drone<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.800> on

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
right away I cast my drone not on

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.970 
right away I cast my drone not on
Harbinger<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.140> collector

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
Harbinger but on that a collector

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.010 
Harbinger but on that a collector
guardian<00:02:29.550> because<00:02:30.000> he<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.450> actually<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.810> more

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
guardian because he can actually do more

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.810 
guardian because he can actually do more
damage<00:02:31.200> than<00:02:31.410> Harbinger<00:02:31.860> fire<00:02:32.580> two<00:02:32.790> shots

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
damage than Harbinger fire two shots

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.040 
damage than Harbinger fire two shots
because<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.390> know<00:02:33.450> they're<00:02:33.780> coming<00:02:33.989> around

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
because I know they're coming around

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.830 
because I know they're coming around
this<00:02:34.230> corner<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.820> then<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.360> reason<00:02:36.690> why<00:02:36.810> I

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
this corner and then the reason why I

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.010 
this corner and then the reason why I
didn't<00:02:37.820> fail<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.239> second<00:02:39.630> unit<00:02:39.750> is

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
didn't fail a that second unit is

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.780 
didn't fail a that second unit is
because<00:02:40.290> i<00:02:40.320> was<00:02:40.500> afraid<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.130> assassin

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
because i was afraid that this assassin

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.860 
because i was afraid that this assassin
i<00:02:41.880> know<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.270> right<00:02:42.480> over<00:02:42.600> here<00:02:43.040> would<00:02:44.690> shoot<00:02:45.690> me

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
i know is right over here would shoot me

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
i know is right over here would shoot me
should<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.650> got<00:02:46.860> get<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> melee<00:02:47.489> range<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.030> I

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
should I got get the melee range and I

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.940 
should I got get the melee range and I
was<00:02:48.209> worried<00:02:48.450> about<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.780> health<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.650> now<00:02:49.770> as

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
was worried about my health so now as

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.440 
was worried about my health so now as
you<00:02:50.070> can<00:02:50.160> see<00:02:50.220> i'm<00:02:50.670> basically<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.390> be

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
you can see i'm basically going to be

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.590 
you can see i'm basically going to be
following<00:02:52.020> my<00:02:52.530> drone<00:02:53.160> around<00:02:53.489> eating<00:02:54.480> my

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
following my drone around eating my

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.810 
following my drone around eating my
throne<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.410> pick<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.769> target<00:02:56.040> for<00:02:56.400> me<00:02:56.580> and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
throne to pick out a target for me and

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.539 
throne to pick out a target for me and
then<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.590> know<00:02:58.620> right<00:02:58.860> there<00:02:59.010> i<00:02:59.040> ended<00:02:59.489> up

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
then you know right there i ended up

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.720 
then you know right there i ended up
casting<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.830> then<00:03:01.950> falling<00:03:02.310> around<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
casting it and then falling around and

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.970 
casting it and then falling around and
using<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.060> basically<00:03:03.390> as<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> killing<00:03:04.049> tool<00:03:04.320> so

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
using it basically as a killing tool so

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.180 
using it basically as a killing tool so
i<00:03:05.040> can<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.519> close<00:03:05.790> range<00:03:06.290> at<00:03:07.290> one<00:03:07.739> unit<00:03:08.040> at

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
i can get in close range at one unit at

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.000 
i can get in close range at one unit at
a<00:03:08.220> time<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.450> then<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:10.080> unload<00:03:10.560> with<00:03:10.830> my

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
a time and then just unload with my

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.090 
a time and then just unload with my
machine<00:03:11.280> pistol<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.560> finish<00:03:13.860> off

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
machine pistol so you know finish off

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.620 
machine pistol so you know finish off
that<00:03:14.130> first<00:03:14.459> section<00:03:14.820> very<00:03:15.000> quickly<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.540> then

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
that first section very quickly and then

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.120 
that first section very quickly and then
this<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.959> really<00:03:16.200> awesome<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.799> happens

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
this is really awesome what happens

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.550 
this is really awesome what happens
right<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.820> see<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:19.019> know<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.350> wave

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
right here I see that you know the wave

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.500 
right here I see that you know the wave
2<00:03:19.860> is<00:03:20.160> starting<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.519> bunch<00:03:20.730> up<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.269> have<00:03:21.480> a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
2 is starting to bunch up and I have a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.810 
2 is starting to bunch up and I have a
few<00:03:21.780> Avalanche<00:03:22.230> shots<00:03:22.560> yet<00:03:22.829> so<00:03:23.340> i<00:03:23.370> switched<00:03:23.640> to

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
few Avalanche shots yet so i switched to

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.360 
few Avalanche shots yet so i switched to
my<00:03:23.940> avalanche<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:25.079> i've<00:03:25.620> got<00:03:25.769> three<00:03:26.070> shots

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
my avalanche and i've got three shots

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.610 
my avalanche and i've got three shots
left<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:27.180> fire<00:03:27.390> one<00:03:27.720> takes<00:03:28.079> out<00:03:28.260> everyone's

left but fire one takes out everyone's
barrier<00:03:29.010> second<00:03:29.850> shot<00:03:30.410> freezes<00:03:31.410> every<00:03:31.620> 1i

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
barrier second shot freezes every 1i

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.620 
barrier second shot freezes every 1i
fire<00:03:32.070> totally<00:03:32.519> useless<00:03:32.700> third<00:03:33.150> shot<00:03:33.360> but<00:03:33.540> as

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
fire totally useless third shot but as

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.150 
fire totally useless third shot but as
you<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:33.840> see<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.200> know<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> avalanche<00:03:34.920> it's

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
you can see you know the avalanche it's

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.539 
you can see you know the avalanche it's
just<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.090> brutal<00:03:36.620> for<00:03:37.620> taking<00:03:37.950> out<00:03:38.070> light

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549
