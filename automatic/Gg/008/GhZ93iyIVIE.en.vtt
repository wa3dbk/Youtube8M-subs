the same thing but the problem with that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.500 
the same thing but the problem with that
is<00:02:49.769> is<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.580> if<00:02:50.790> no<00:02:51.090> ones<00:02:51.239> are<00:02:51.299> sending

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
reason so that's why we don't look we

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.559 
reason so that's why we don't look we
will<00:02:56.190> block<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.519> got<00:02:56.610> half<00:02:56.910> through<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.420> we

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569

to cover zone or cover man to man you'll

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.900 
to cover zone or cover man to man you'll
see<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:10.709> defenders<00:03:11.099> will<00:03:11.250> start<00:03:11.489> out<00:03:11.579> wide

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
see the defenders will start out wide

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.809 
see the defenders will start out wide
and<00:03:12.239> then<00:03:12.870> they're<00:03:13.049> going<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.260> slide<00:03:13.709> in<00:03:14.549> if

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
and then they're going to slide in if

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.610 
and then they're going to slide in if
it's<00:03:15.120> zone<00:03:15.329> if<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:16.019> man-to-man<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.440> they

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
it's zone if it's man-to-man and they

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's zone if it's man-to-man and they
just<00:03:16.739> start<00:03:17.129> and<00:03:17.310> lined<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:17.670> right<00:03:17.910> on<00:03:18.180> the

just start and lined up right on the
receiver<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.319> is<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.709> type<00:03:20.040> formation

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
receiver and this is for type formation

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.650 
receiver and this is for type formation
so<00:03:20.670> you're<00:03:20.790> gonna<00:03:20.879> if<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.120> come<00:03:21.269> out<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.480> gun

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
so you're gonna if you come out and gun

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.869 
so you're gonna if you come out and gun
tight<00:03:21.900> you'll<00:03:22.410> read<00:03:22.709> if<00:03:23.040> they<00:03:23.310> start<00:03:23.579> out<00:03:23.640> wide

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
tight you'll read if they start out wide

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.690 
tight you'll read if they start out wide
and<00:03:24.150> they<00:03:24.569> slide<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.200> its<00:03:25.680> own<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.459> then<00:03:26.579> you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
and they slide in its own so then you

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.920 
and they slide in its own so then you
know<00:03:26.819> its<00:03:27.090> own<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:27.450> you're<00:03:27.599> going<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.750> want<00:03:27.810> to

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
again cover zero coverage that's why we

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.710 
again cover zero coverage that's why we
had<00:06:41.400> that<00:06:41.550> deep<00:06:41.730> Street<00:06:42.030> pressure<00:06:42.330> coming<00:06:42.570> off

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720

had that deep Street pressure coming off
the<00:06:42.810> edge<00:06:42.990> there<00:06:43.290> but<00:06:43.530> we<00:06:43.620> hang<00:06:43.800> in<00:06:43.920> the<00:06:43.980> pocket

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400

the<00:06:44.430> bull<00:06:44.700> route<00:06:44.880> gives<00:06:45.360> us<00:06:45.480> just<00:06:45.660> enough<00:06:45.750> time

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
the bull route gives us just enough time

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.210 
the bull route gives us just enough time
