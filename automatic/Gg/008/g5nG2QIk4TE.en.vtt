00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 all right 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.640
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.410
 nightmare 'and welcome to the third and 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.160
 last part of the guide for the dead 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.200
 nights in matters of pvp in this guide 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.289
 I will talk about the studs or statistics 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.880
 that you should consider to go up 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.000
 besides that I will tell you some gems and 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.129
 james jones that I recommend we start 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.330
 with the theme of this video 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.040
 we will talk first are the priorities 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.440
 in the states for statistics that 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.780
 you must take into account 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.239
 first we will have hit chance and expertise 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.829
 to the limit with this I mean 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.719
 that at level 90 we can generate a 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.870
 attack without risk to fail that what 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.000
 block or write it 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.670
 for this be sure to go to the states 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.280
 of yitzhak and expertise and fix it does not say 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.940
 level 90 that says 0% at risk to fail 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.190
 block and dodge after we 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.019
 we will focus on strange that is the basis 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.610
 main to generate damage with the the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.700
 night since it increases the attack power 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.790
 Now let's consider pi pi pi power for 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.470
 increase the damage we do to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 then we will focus on gdp and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.130
 foresee if lynch to decrease the damage 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 received 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.690
 continue with haste to reduce the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 cool down from the runes 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.370
 fruit chance for greater ownership of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.620
 critical hit 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.600
 and finally master and that will be a plus 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.620
 to the damage we do with our 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.540
 spells 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.490
 in the particular I consider that the damage 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.710
 generated as the knight when you have 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.960
 Two-handed weapons is better than when 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.030
 you have a double weapon but for those who 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 like to use double weapon the states that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 they must keep in mind they are almost 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.520
 the only difference is that at 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.400
 final should give more importance to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.409
 mastering after to the last and finally 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.210
 al white sands 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.319
 those were the statues statues 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.729
 that I recommend so they can 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.369
 exploit their skills of 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.770
 knight to the maximum now I will tell you my 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.990
 recommendations on suns and gems 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.549
 that they must have this can be the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.739
 a heavier part of investing in 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.319
 gems and in sans can cost a great 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.400
 amount of gold in the game 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.799
 then I hope it is useful 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.080
 the zions and the gems that I'm going 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.730
 to say because the truth as I say 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.830
 will help them exploit the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.000
 skills to the maximum of dead night and 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.650
 you are really going to be of great help 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.930
 inside the game to improve your 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.409
 pvp skills 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.830
 The genes they sell are the following 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.640
 white tiger inscription 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.660
 superior critical strike 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.520
 superior resilience 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:49.470
 exceptional strange super strange and 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.300
 white lake harmonica and panda ling is a chef 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.240
 those are the extensions that I recommend 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.600
 much now we will go to the gems that 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.560
 they must be the following 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.510
 perfect stern and lapis lazuli stormy 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.290
 rivers heart 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.790
 perfect roxanne 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.730
 vivid or alien 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.860
 perfect vivid alexandre 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.670
 drink of beijing time out diamond 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.950
 imperial mephisto bold primordial ruby ​​and 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.599
 mystic the gradients 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.160
 It should be noted that these are the 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.769
 which I recommend as I consider that 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.209
 They are the best for the night 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.040
 you are going to say what and how many 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.629
 buy since I repeat the ones that can most 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.629
 be something expensive in the game 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.590
 something that I would like to tell you is that 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.470
 forget to add what is an extra 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.620
 socket to what is the belt the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.410

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.849
 wristbands when adding an extra soft that to 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.099
 these parts of his armor 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.840
 will allow you to add an extra gem that will 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.459
 will help increase what the stacks are 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.040
 by statistics according to the burning that 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.870
