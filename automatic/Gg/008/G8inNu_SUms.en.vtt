00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
important to get crisp run and Stephen

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.079 
important to get crisp run and Stephen
Reed<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.799> pitch<00:00:52.979> with<00:00:53.219> seven<00:00:53.729> days<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.999> go

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
Reed on the pitch with seven days to go

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.789

made<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:24.900> big<00:01:25.110> decision<00:01:25.410> just<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.770> take<00:01:25.920> our

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
made a big decision just to take our

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.030 
made a big decision just to take our
time<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.250> Chris<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:27.270> sure<00:01:27.300> that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
it would come on at the right pace and

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.720 
it would come on at the right pace and
and<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:31.170> suffer<00:01:31.620> another<00:01:31.890> setback<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.550> just
