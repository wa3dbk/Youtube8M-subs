00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.450
 of the Moroccan economy 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.250
 I'm not going to ask your opinion there 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.160
 but we will ask 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.810
 the opinion of the auditors and to respond to 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.640

 tonight just call us at 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:34.050

 platinum jaguar bentley tos bin djaouad 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.560
 little like a boost the economy of Morocco 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.360

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.050
 of tea returning from a year again a 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.390
 woman now lives in clear pleasure 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.550
 African to figure on in a on a 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.430
 podium of a world championship 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.620
 So from there it's still fun 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.750
 to bring from the President of the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.250
 world championship and I hope that 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.710
 will open the doors for the future and 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.170
 that charles there we go we will try 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.119
 to be fighting why not in 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.379
 the coming years and it's having the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.640
 world title and that Morocco is 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.650
 world champion we rub at least 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.479
 once in the person of mehdi bennani 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.439
 but compared to just good it's 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.640
 still a small satisfaction 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.859
 personal therefore the tool of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.840
 recognition still smiled yes yes 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.390
 especially last year already - the year 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.280
 last I finished but there the race the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.249
 first who before the podium 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.250
 where I finished fourth overall and the 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.630
 came 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.860
 tell me he must write in gold letters 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.050
 this result because it's a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.360
 exploit for the african continent 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.970
 when I wrote in gold letters and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.410
 after the race after they came back 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 to me with the same book of the 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.080
 die for writing in gold letters in 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.850
 camelot d'armes is marking 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.530
 history shows that Morocco is 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.450
 present and that they will make just presence 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.130
 to be qualified and be included in the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.540
 world championship what is already a 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.010
 big step because to enter the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.750
 favorite world championship but rick 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.250
 that is, you have to be qualified 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.150
 respect the parts to qualify as long as 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.020
 alice the lap time there 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.479
 today we show that we are 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.790
 qualified con con and worthy of his 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.700
 championship drivers of the world and that 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.960
 is fighting through among the oppositions that's 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.660
 true that when I started my 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.580
 career someone who comes to tell me and 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.260
 who tell me you're going to fight one day 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.420
 against gabriel tarquini tiago monteiro 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.400
 yvan muller i will say no we can not 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.830
 a game is great drivers 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.330
 had come forward and 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.280
 today I'm fighting I'm in front 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.900
 street for example at the grand price the angle 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.489
 yvan muller tiago monteiro have finished 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.959

 so today we are among the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.769
 Morocco is one of the biggest 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.360
 we have to hold and I think that if we 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.430
 continue in this in this work 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.230
 in this stride we can remove 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.430
 chardin have the world title and that 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.690
 that everyone is shown that the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.310
 Morocco is world champion in a 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.260
 discipline where infrastructure is 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.519
 coming we are going to say nicely 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.720
 even huge because because here we are 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.400
 there is a lot of altering the lah with the 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.130
 second that makes the races 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.160
 direct and also delayed by media tv 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.510
 we see that there is a craze if by the 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.090
 Moroccan people because I'm from 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.250

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.180
 races or where I am I climbed in 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.380
 the plane it made me happy to see 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.910

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.940
 make the trip to see the big 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.449
 price for example of brazil that makes me 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.189
 in 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.189

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:12.779
 I would like to see exactly 70 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.639
 we aim the championship us a charter to 

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:16.529
 jesper of elana the next ones try to 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:19.259
 to make a result that is to say better 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:21.269
 than the top 10 because there I do not know we're going 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:23.339
 try to aim why not the 5 

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:24.539
 and 6 first positions of general of the 

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:26.189
 world championship knowing that there we 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.830
 mark points directly from official 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:30.419
 and for the years to come 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.740
 to be world champion and where his pavement 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:33.719
 that a world champion title for the 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.099
 Morocco is something that I think me 

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.059
 I can not believe it because we 

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:37.919
 will be world champion in a 

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:39.240
 discipline where one does not benefit until 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.319
 today of a single permanent circuit 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.669
 the salt syrte and in which in 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:43.769
 enjoy it's an urban circuit 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.940
 marrakech that I hope the 

00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:47.470
 message will pass to my eyes 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.440
 in any case we are proud of you anton 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.330
 so keep his bike behind you and 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.300
 we are going to take rounded 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.720
 trice he is a fan and with our 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.720
 screens
