dropping your side no I mean tank pushes
much<00:06:01.560> scarier<00:06:01.889> than<00:06:02.039> a<00:06:02.100> tank<00:06:02.520> push<00:06:02.669> is<00:06:02.789> coming

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
much scarier than a tank push is coming

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.180 
much scarier than a tank push is coming
to<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.180> left<00:06:03.660> so<00:06:04.440> I'm<00:06:04.500> saying<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.889> can't<00:06:05.070> do

gas I am no bring some areas to my
ground<00:06:22.500> units<00:06:22.830> will<00:06:23.280> work<00:06:23.639> together<00:06:23.820> I<00:06:25.580> will

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
ground units will work together I will

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.310 
ground units will work together I will
do<00:06:26.669> that<00:06:26.789> when<00:06:26.910> I<00:06:26.970> get<00:06:27.030> one<00:06:27.389> I<00:06:27.570> don't<00:06:27.780> have<00:06:27.990> on

he's<00:06:31.320> leapfrogging<00:06:32.009> about<00:06:38.750> that's<00:06:39.750> not<00:06:40.020> good

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
he's leapfrogging about that's not good

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:57.469 
he's leapfrogging about that's not good
all<00:06:40.560> my<00:06:40.740> units<00:06:41.039> are<00:06:41.190> dead<00:06:47.570> I<00:06:56.000> have<00:06:57.000> to<00:06:57.210> void

rays<00:06:57.690> can<00:06:58.199> i<00:06:58.260> push<00:06:58.440> out<00:06:58.590> with<00:06:58.710> that<00:06:58.830> does<00:06:59.370> he

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
rays can i push out with that does he

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.719 
rays can i push out with that does he
have<00:06:59.550> support<00:06:59.990> yeah
