00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
 hello everyone welcome to the last video 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.850
 of the series of spheres and for this 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.460
 last video we will need 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.040
 a plastic bottle of preference 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.780
 that is smooth this part of this part see that 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.570
 in the bottles are like they have 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.610
 curvitas have little things here of 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.270
 preference that is smooth 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.970
 we will also be ready this I knew 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.859
 that was called Christmas ready 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.020
 but in any case it can be another 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.360
 type of ribbon 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.210
 1 to make the sphere and another to make 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.989
 monkey 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.989
 a clip 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.520
 a league 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.320
 and well, our hot silicone and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 a razor or scissors to cut 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.700
 the bottle let's start cutting 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.520
 our bottle we are going to cut what 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.520
 is the bottom part of that they have as 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.280
 that some spacings bottles 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.550
 It looks very light but here has a 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.870
 and more stripes is that in that line I'm going to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.870
 guide to cut him from the bottom 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 and now we're also going to cut the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.659
 top of where it starts to 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.830
 be made as the curve have equal 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.620
 as a line 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.920
 of separation there in that line I'm going to 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.920
 go guiding 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 and 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.560
 Now that we have this cylinder 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.799
 let's see more or less of what size 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.689
 are the width of the ribbon we are going to 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.689
 measure the width of our lath 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.430
 and based on that we're going to cut strips 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.729
 for each wait I am going to use 4 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.729
 strips 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.620
 villa that we have our 4 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.670
 parts 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.490
 let's start covering the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 with our ribbon 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.970
 preferably the bottle is the same 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.970
 transparent to make it look like 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.530
 that are made with the pure ribbon are 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.100
 they do not see basically the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.100
 plastic 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.010
 since we have the four lined we're going 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.010
 to start assembling the 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.720
 in this way 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.720
 one inside the other 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.910
 and we're going to start hitting 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.280
 since we have our assembled sphere 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.050
 let's make the bow as I say 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.750
 can make the bow of the same color 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.450
 of the ribbon they used for those 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.040
 outside or they can do it in another color 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.530
 the truth I tried to do with the same 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.060
 but I did not do it that much so 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.060
 I decided better to do it in another color 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.090
 let's unfold our clip you know 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.360
 how we unfolded it in the videos 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.360
 previous 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.310
 let's put enough silicone in 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.310
 our bun 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.230
 and there we are going to brown it 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.750
 we'll wait for it to dry so that it 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.750
 was there subject was the clip 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.310
 now we will put silicone 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.310
 in this part the child's appointment 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.500
 and we are going to paste them in our sphere 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.360
 and well, we would be staying 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.160
 this way and well this is how we are 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.320
 three completed areas I hope that they 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.480
 have liked the video that they apply in 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.760
 this Christmas the idea is super easy to 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.770
 true so tell me which is the one 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.600
 more they liked what they would use to 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.360
 donate your house this Christmas to decorate 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.160
 your tree in order and we do not know 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.160
 we see in the following video bye
