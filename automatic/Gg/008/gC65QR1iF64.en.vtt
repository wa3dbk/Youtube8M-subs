00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
now we'll give her one more shot if I

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.650 
now we'll give her one more shot if I
can't<00:05:37.840> knock<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.110> center<00:05:38.770> of<00:05:38.800> that<00:05:42.480> be<00:05:43.480> good

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
can't knock the center of that be good
