00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.440
 last saturday despite a paso-doble 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.060
 mesmerizing emmanuel moire and his 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 partner did not know how to seduce 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.120
 judges 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 from now on even more 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.960
 attention to the technique me I think 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.620
 that now we have to jump to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.120
 above 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.350
 I do not like me for two weeks 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.760
 find at the bottom of the ranking I 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.830
 the impression of working like crazy 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
 and try to evolve all that but 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.070
 is at the same time but apparently they 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.930
 are not happy it hurt me 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 really and I want to do some 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:36.180
 progress what am I doing my true 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.460
 princess 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.159
 this week the theme this one 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.620
 we're going to dance on Edward's hands 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.929
 money 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.929
 something very fairy that all 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:56.999
 like in a movie really that's me 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.519
 fills with happiness I am very fan of 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.989
 tim burton is the universe he creates in 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.239
 his films the characters that can be 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.760
 to be bad at the fantastic seals 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.320
 I love this work there laval it is necessary that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 you're like cotton it's very airy 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.970
 you 're just going to make a square for 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.740
 moment one side you shut up 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.450
 very hard tonight I know that everything is 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.520
 perfect actually the waltz it's not 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.100
 simple he was very tired at the beginning of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.620
 week he so stiff using it so 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.540
 I do it look there's nothing moving there 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.540
 whether it is in terms of its services 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.000
 notes of the pressure that is this 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.800
 nerve ball 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.730
 they were stuck there there is everything that 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.310
 do not give up and I even feel 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.750
 that I was much more relaxed at first 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.450
 you see, I always have clean 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:48.140
 there I have a hole I locked you 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:50.360
 take a break this is a passion I have 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.990
 the impression on Thursday that the end of crazy 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.990
 I'm sorry 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.380
 today I am deeply involved in 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.340
 this adventure but not against 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.640
 really when I go home I 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.640
 believe 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.450
 there is a loneliness actually that is very 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.480
 present 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.080
 in my personal life I am alone 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.790
 and it's hard actually 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.160
 because sometimes you want to 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.140
 actually ask someone you want 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.910
 to lay the head on the shoulder of 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.550
 someone you want to have words 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.450
 comforting 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.310
 you feel like all this is already his 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.640
 thousand sheets jr booster the better than 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.240
 I could 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.190
 we stretch wii wade it's better that if 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.390
 we take but it's really good 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.020
 it's just i think i'm going by 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.640
 example if we have seen the evidence we have 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.310
 imposed this week 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.100
 needed better than they are at the cleat what 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.290
 this week your challenge is to 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.250
 perform the most acrobatics 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.210
 spectacular 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.210
 fred astaire 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.040
 m 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.130
 when I personally saw what 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.130
 I was forced bedside have what 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.790
 I was scared he almost found himself a 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.600
 solution so that manu are not afraid of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.470
 get on the table 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.970
 sir wants to become a server 2 in tangier 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.140
 bad for tunisie I must not 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.140
 drop the tray and the greens 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.610
 then you 'll let your guard down the more you go 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.590
 you crust and it's a good day for me 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.209

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.390
