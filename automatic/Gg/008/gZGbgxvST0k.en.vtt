00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello everybody today on the board with you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.590
 some trying to show a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 biodiversity of snakes and this is a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.540
 way I make an appeal that the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.650
 people to be aware of preserving the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.510
 environment preserve the rivers a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.510
 protest against global warming 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:34.200
 today we swallow a snake put 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.780
 two snakes in the mouth and can be today 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:45.980
 this proposal to swallow 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.980
 we are getting up today 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.690
 we have one here 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.199
 in section 6 known 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.650
 this is the most dangerous the fourth 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.650
 most dangerous form of brazil a jararaca 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:40.130
 It's beautiful, but it's not so easy. 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:46.880
 working with all animals are 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:49.240
 here it is coiled that the show can not 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.240
 stop 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.800
 they are very strong snakes 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.420
 here we have a little one we go 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.899
 wait and see that the glass is also 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.899
 stay 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.990
 children do not try to bridge the gap 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.990
 House 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.569
 do not try to practice this in every 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.280
 we are not mistreating an animal 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.159
 we were successful and this is the most 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.159
 dangerous of all 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.530
 Let's wear glasses, what can happen? 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.930
 an accident 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.329
 and there the intention people 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.579
 I liked the work for you and now. 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:42.450
 we drop the kids not animals 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:46.019
 do it at home and we will preserve the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.549
 environment and say yes to nature 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.120
 life 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.750
 I hope you enjoyed the show with 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.750

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.540
 the musician 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.890
 It's okay 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.440
 the option I hope you have enjoyed and 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.440
