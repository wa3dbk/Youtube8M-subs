00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello everybody i'm tight and 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.609
 Welcome back to my channel today 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.140
 I bring a new episode with the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.849
 purpose of starting a new series that 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.440
 will basically consist of going 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.090
 traveling in the most detailed way 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.590
 possible all modern maps 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 warfare 3 from the first to the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.520
 last and with the purpose then 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.230
 basically to find out why 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.320
 they include certain elements so useless 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.510
 on maps that are included in a game 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.980
 like this one shooter game and we're going to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.269
 start with the purpose in the first 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.189
 we are going to find myself I think that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.929
 basically chickens that take us out of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 sometimes I ask everyone who asks you 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.590
 you really stop to question why 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.890
 these items are included as useless 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.480
 on maps in the maps of a game like 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.649
 this is not good because I'm trying 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.750
 find the answer to this question 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.239
 Well, I went to the wikipedia to see if 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 there was if I could find some 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.600
 answer about this no and well then 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.860
 here to put that his common name is rooster 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.329
 for the hen male for the female 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.649
 perhaps the largest ever video 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.510
 It is estimated that it exceeds 13 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.090
 millions of copies well then well not 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 nothing will happen I suppose if I loaded 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.050
 because the barbarian has an explanation 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.790
 possible unwashed term on top of one of 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.810
 those tables that are served with four 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.190
 plates and three support napkins and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.160
 restaurant 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.290
 and this what the fuck is or a bakery 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.320
 boulangerie pastry and you pay or what 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.450
 pussy is this a bakery where you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.340
 sells absolutely anything but so much 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.179
 all everything 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.439
 and here we see biscuits cookies 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:31.450
 cookies cookies potatoes here we see 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.420

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.819

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.179
 of our greens the normal bike and 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.780
