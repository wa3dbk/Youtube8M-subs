00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.660
 on our community server like you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.220
 I also have a different texture 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.340
 pack that is that that never sat it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.769
 is actually a middle age pack and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 still trying modern 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.349
 to set up because we have here 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.080
 different different topics on the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.280
 server we certainly know and some 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.739
 I have the modern quarter and the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.290
 try to make it modern with lisas 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.540
 this is the good thing today 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 I want to show you it will be this time 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.050
 we will be a little bit different 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 not together I'll set you up 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.850
 just show and explain and you can 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 then write me in the comments 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.320
 if I as the Sun to the art and 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.960
 maybe better like the long ones 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 videos or if you would rather see 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.359
 as I would that a judge good then 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.990
 I say let's just start that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.610
 here so the entrance area it's just 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.280
 this is the good piece of terrace house 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.850
 large terraces 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.850
 let's go clean 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.010
 This apartment I think that is 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.070
 nice this is now the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.909
 Entrance area is large cloakroom with 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.000
 a little bit of light 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.030
 here we have hooks on the wall and there 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.240
 also and a small closet for 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.940
 cowshed then a little decoration then 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.140
 Let's come to the living room right now 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.840
 there is the big sofa the tv 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.810
 I did that with wool and that 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.280
 at the turntable here are everything 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.490
 upside down steps with trapdoors 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.280
 in front of flower pots on it is here one 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.890
 carpet to put on this looks too 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.840
 always very nice we have 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.540
 bookshelves and the workbenches also with 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.690
 flowers and the whole results then 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.540
 together the living room what now yes 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.010
 right can pass as quite modern 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.510
 Here come when the kitchen I have 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.650
 tries to be a bit Mediterranean too 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.970
 Shaping with living ground and this 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:39.400
 are graz stages here again with 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.900
 fold and crate under and thus shelf 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 and flowers here is the sink 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.620
 oven and here again and again a box 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.500
 Below is the sitting area our 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.150
 table that are also steps and below 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.840
 So it is in the middle is a 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.519
 blog a blog quartz flowers on top of it because 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.440
 behind a nice shelf again 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.440
 That's the kitchen 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.250
 then what that down here already 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.530
 Let's face it up 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:17.010
 There we have the hallway with us again 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:22.109
 Wardrobe and light and here too 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.540
 Here we have the bathroom here 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.060
 Again shower is quartz blocks again 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
 I took a nonsense here 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.650
 step exactly and down here too 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.510
 level like the lever to the true ones 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.879
 classroom a hot shower is a 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.780
 towel rack the toilet and the 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.340
 sinks that are carbon blocks 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.590
 they are doing pretty well for that 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.260
 sits a bit marbled up here 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.939
 I'm dumb on it 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.739
 it's very nice because that's the opposite 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.629
 to the pressure plate takes everything completely 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.859
 covers and has just a nice 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:04.470
 smooth surface so that was the bathroom 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:08.069
 Then we come to the bedroom that has 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.909
 our light Mediterranean touch here 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.810
 the bed with quartz steps again behind 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:20.099
 turn on as a nightstand with flowerpots 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:24.740
 here again the heads on stages 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:26.849
 Here are some pictures of the dressing room 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.520
 here is the wardrobe 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.150
 I covered that up with tempi 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.280
 stages 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.840
 because then if you open the doors 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.419
 that really looks like such a real thing 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.500
 closet and you get the chest still 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:44.120
 through the carpet through the closet 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.120
 we can and from it 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.660
 I'll give you the first one here 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.710
 terrace because I have so small trees 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.600
 made and here are a few leagues 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.510
 again flowers 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:09.000
 that was it here then so come 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:12.580
 the last room the man great view 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.390
 on the church and on the others 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.130
 houses so here we have in the wall 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.260
 I have cleaned two niches 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.880
 there are flowerpots here 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.280
 I also have redstone upstairs again 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.020
 lamps are cleaned 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.520
 the acts then avenges he acts simply 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.810
 more modern than when you're there again 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.800
 a cupboard or something disfigured 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.960
 Here I have bookshelves in the wall 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.820
 We cleansed the back are a 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.990
 bookshelves again with value bankers and 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.750
 that's the computer 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.320
 that is not so modern impact 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:51.190
 because unfortunately you do not have a desktop picture 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.380
 but that too worked that was it 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.630
 We have another office here 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.760
 terrace which is quite similar to the 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.550
 lower again with two lying 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.020
 I just taken a wooden staircase and 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.960
 one level then one has a right 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.590
 nice couch and again the little ones 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.880
 trees and that 's it 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.880
 From the flat 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:21.640
 yes that was the appartement 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:23.920
 terrace house pictures you can find on 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.810
