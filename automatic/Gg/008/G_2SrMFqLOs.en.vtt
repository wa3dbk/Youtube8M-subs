so I'm going to show you from beginning
to<00:02:12.160> end<00:02:12.190> how<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.910> dial<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.870> with<00:02:14.140> your

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
to end how to dial it in with your

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.430 
to end how to dial it in with your
nuclear<00:02:15.130> system<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.570> first<00:02:16.900> off<00:02:17.080> I'm<00:02:17.290> going<00:02:17.380> to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
nuclear system so first off I'm going to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.140 
nuclear system so first off I'm going to
choose<00:02:17.680> which<00:02:17.950> mount<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.459> want<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> use<00:02:18.940> they

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
choose which mount I want to use they

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.490 
choose which mount I want to use they
have<00:02:19.180> two<00:02:19.480> different<00:02:19.660> ones<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.170> can<00:02:20.260> either

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
have two different ones you can either

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.560 
have two different ones you can either
stick<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> outside<00:02:21.700> or<00:02:21.910> clamp<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.420> I'm

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
stick it on the outside or clamp it I'm

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.960 
stick it on the outside or clamp it I'm
going<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.780> clamp<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:26.280> choose<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> spot<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.850> has

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
going to clamp it choose a spot that has

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.000 
going to clamp it choose a spot that has
a<00:02:28.000> little<00:02:28.300> bit<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.570> gap<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.500> no<00:02:29.770> gap

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
a little bit of a gap if you have no gap

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.210 
a little bit of a gap if you have no gap
then<00:02:30.310> you'd<00:02:30.459> want<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.700> stick<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.150> there

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.229 

just<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.400> simple<00:02:39.810> clamps<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:40.930> there<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:43.180> is

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
just that simple clamps on there this is

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.090 
just that simple clamps on there this is
your<00:02:43.390> brain<00:02:43.750> HBC<00:02:44.560> one<00:02:44.770> hundred-plus<00:02:47.100> that

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
your brain HBC one hundred-plus that

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.290 
your brain HBC one hundred-plus that
slides<00:02:48.459> right<00:02:48.760> in<00:02:49.440> yeah<00:02:50.670> okay<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.060> have

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
slides right in yeah okay now you have

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.449 
slides right in yeah okay now you have
the<00:02:52.420> unit<00:02:52.870> mounted<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.650> now<00:02:54.100> we're<00:02:54.280> going<00:02:54.400> to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
the unit mounted and now we're going to

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.900 
the unit mounted and now we're going to
go<00:02:54.610> ahead<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.120> mount<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.660> earbuds<00:02:56.650> long<00:02:57.160> from

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
go ahead and mount the earbuds long from

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
go ahead and mount the earbuds long from
you<00:02:58.270> clear<00:02:58.570> it's<00:02:58.930> an<00:02:59.020> accessory

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you clear it's an accessory

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.910 
you clear it's an accessory
so<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.050> first<00:03:02.320> step<00:03:02.820> seen<00:03:03.820> here<00:03:04.030> got<00:03:04.269> our

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
so the first step seen here got our

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.620 
so the first step seen here got our
earbud<00:03:05.920> system<00:03:06.340> here<00:03:06.670> then<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:07.360> plugs

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
earbud system here then this just plugs

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.060 
earbud system here then this just plugs
into<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.930> brain<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.940> are<00:03:10.060> going<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.420> mount

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
into the brain is we are going to mount

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.850 
into the brain is we are going to mount
the<00:03:12.070> velcro<00:03:12.310> pieces<00:03:12.730> right<00:03:13.450> up<00:03:13.630> in<00:03:13.750> here<00:03:14.110> what

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
the velcro pieces right up in here what

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.860 
the velcro pieces right up in here what
about<00:03:15.100> five<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.790> half<00:03:15.850> inches<00:03:16.299> apart<00:03:16.660> is

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
about five and a half inches apart is

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.560 
about five and a half inches apart is
what<00:03:17.049> you're<00:03:17.170> looking<00:03:17.290> for<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.209> it's<00:03:19.420> pretty

let's go in your ear and then this is
the<00:03:38.640> actual<00:03:38.849> microphone<00:03:39.390> right<00:03:39.750> there<00:03:40.640> so

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
the actual microphone right there so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.759 
the actual microphone right there so
this<00:03:41.849> will<00:03:42.030> hang<00:03:42.209> down<00:03:42.720> by<00:03:43.080> your<00:03:43.260> ear<00:03:43.470> right

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
this will hang down by your ear right

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.539 
this will hang down by your ear right
there<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.290> get<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.620> microphone<00:03:47.069> placed

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
there and you get the microphone placed

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.729 
there and you get the microphone placed
right<00:03:47.730> there<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.140> take<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.409> other<00:03:49.590> side

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
right there and you take the other side

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.660 
right there and you take the other side
of<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.890> velcro<00:03:52.700> right<00:03:53.700> there<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:56.400> do<00:03:56.549> the
