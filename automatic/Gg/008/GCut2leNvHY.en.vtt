00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.330
 because the national agrarian strike and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.779
 protests because those popular sectors 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.830
 also transportation sectors 30 of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.289
 the 32 departments would be here

 asking for more investment from the

 state is to say better conditions for 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.219
 able to do the daily work they claim 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.500
 that the executive of Juan Manuel Santos 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.920
 has positioned itself listen to these policies 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.390
 anti-worker antipopular that coerce and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.489
 that limit the rights that are 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.020
 privatizing the institutions that are 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.560
 delivering natural resources to 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.570
 transnational companies 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.140
 What did President Juan Manuel say? 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.170
 saints already launched on the street of 16,000 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.900
 effective saints reiterated that the force 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.510
 public will act with total forcefulness 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.820
 against those who close the tracks and 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.430
 will also take legal action against 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.770
 the various managers are new 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.150
 ministers who referred to the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.250
 activities that begins on the day of 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.590
 today in reality to the paralysis of 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.160
 activities good to us we are in 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.850
 the street there in colombia to see how 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.770
 are these first hours of paralysis 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.080
 but also of mobilizations 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.080
 remember that there is a strong presence 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.220
 military in some of the regions over 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.860
 all taking into account that the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.510
 president said let's allow 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.880
 paralyze activities but we are not going to 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.240
 allow roads to be blocked 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.940
 something similar then to what happened 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.950
 they remember in the catatumbo not that the 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.440
 threat came accompanied by an eviction 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.630
 violent good let's see we're in 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.340
 two points in milton in ado is our 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 special envoy that is in ibaguÃ© 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.950
 Tolima department and we also have 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.050

 and me who is in the capital we are going to 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.580
 start if you think milton with you 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.830

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.930
 how are the activities and if there are already 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.080
 presence of these mobilizations how 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.090
 you go 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.920
 It's a pleasure to establish this contact 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.660
 with you also only a special one for your 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.950
 mate vladimir cheek, look at 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.550
 this moment what we have knowledge 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.870
 is that the peasants are continuing 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.420
 moving towards the different 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.520
 points of concentration have 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.430
 informed some leaders of so 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.050
 less of this sector from here of the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.720
 department of Tolima that was born of 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.130
 I went to the municipality of Coelho there 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.020
 there are already a significant number of 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.630
 peasants who came more or less to 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.460
 that at 3 in the morning likewise the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.980
 different points than in colombia 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.200
 also the peasants have already begun to 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.110
 come remember that today in Colombia is 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.240
 holiday the activity is a little 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.070
 it becomes slower and at that time 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.660
 they are moving towards those 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.700
 points of concentration remember the 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.280
 transport where it gets slower and 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.110
 good anyway the transport of 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.970
 changing abstract tractomulas 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.470
 tractor trucks has also been made 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.970
 little slower has already eroded 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.980
 ostensibly remember that the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.140
 president omar the saints raised the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.540
 measure that restricts 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.880
 that the weekend days were 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.200
 move on these roads 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.870
 intact tractor tractors 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.450
 because this measure was lifted so that 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.010
 cargo trucks on everything 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.630
 will transport on this side without clutter 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.520
 well we know that increase 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.470
 transport is also has been added to 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.480
 this mobilization and good at that time 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.280
 already begin to vacate the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.380
 meanwhile meanwhile the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.440
 national police force begins to occupy more or 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.239
 less the 148 roadways that they have 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.980
 manifested as critics and where they are going 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.530
 to present the highest concentrations 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.840
 of peasant and as you said so 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.910
 minus 16 thousand policemen remember that 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.800
 about 3,000 of them are those of 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.440
 mobile riot squad that are 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.760
 good the national police team 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.370
 who is responsible for doing all the work 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.320
 repressive of these mobilizations there 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.600
 so much that he will dedicate himself to the subject 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.670
 of surveillance and also some that 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.560
 they will be doing the kuriles 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.200
 judicialization is of the people who 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.120
 block roads according to 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.680
 manifested the same president form 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 two senior the minister of defense and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.050
 Fernando Carrillo who has threatened 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.970
 jail 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.919
 for all those people the 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.900
 peasants who dedicate themselves to this 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.430
 activity of blocking the tracks and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.650
 obstruct transit 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.720
 well there we have the presence of 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.419
 some security forces we go with 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.250
 vladimir now another point of the ground 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.470
 Colombian that today takes the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.620
 prominence because it is a strike not 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.139
 only agrarian is already popular is 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.440
 different sectors that crosses all 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.440
 the
