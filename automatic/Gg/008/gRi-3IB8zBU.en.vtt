00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.510
 this battlefield we're going to have to 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.280
 look for who makes it 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.610
 with blue exclamation x above 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.610

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.859
 squarely the exclamation point on the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.119
 map we see it here too so I'm going 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.549
 click on the guard 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.399
 he was really too much a shredder I 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.859
 think before our eyes men lose 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.929
 and so that's when I'm online 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:50.599
 seemed relieved of the blow not the big 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.149
 good at all good night mood I 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.369

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.170

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.579
