on both sides also on the front I found
out<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.310> installing<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.330> you're<00:00:21.539> gonna

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
out that installing this you're gonna

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
angle as you can but I cut this away so

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
angle as you can but I cut this away so
it'll<00:00:27.810> fit<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.140> between<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:30.289> wood<00:00:31.289> housing<00:00:31.830> up

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it'll fit in between the wood housing up

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.420 
it'll fit in between the wood housing up
there<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.719> had<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.590> comes<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.280> has<00:00:35.399> a

there it I had this comes out and has a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.340 
there it I had this comes out and has a
whole<00:00:35.700> lot<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.120> flashing<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.079> need<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
whole lot of flashing and you need to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.170 
whole lot of flashing and you need to
trim<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.739> back<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.100> until<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> fits<00:00:38.969> in

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
trim it back a little until it fits in

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
trim it back a little until it fits in
there<00:00:39.300> easily<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.890> should<00:00:41.100> be

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
there easily and all this should be

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
there easily and all this should be
pre-fitted<00:00:41.730> before<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> ever<00:00:42.270> get<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.600> this

tape around here you actually should go

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.610 
tape around here you actually should go
a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.719> bit<00:01:00.870> lower<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.140> I've<00:01:01.350> actually

hit<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.200> showed<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.710> trimming

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
hit like you like I showed you trimming

hit like you like I showed you trimming
most<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> gives<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
most of the way but it gives you a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
most of the way but it gives you a
gluing<00:01:34.200> surface<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.189> creates<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.820> really

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
gluing surface and this creates a really

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.039 
gluing surface and this creates a really
good<00:01:36.420> tight<00:01:36.750> box<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:38.450> um<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.930> will

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
good tight box for the back um you will

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.230 
good tight box for the back um you will
get<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.229> close<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> top<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.790> very

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
get it close to the top as you can very

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.080 
get it close to the top as you can very
little<00:01:42.390> gap<00:01:42.799> glue<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.979> paint<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.909> glue

little gap glue it in paint it and glue

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.690 
little gap glue it in paint it and glue
it<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.299> place<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:46.110> chair<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> pilot<00:01:47.520> seat

it in place the chair or the pilot seat

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.219

this<00:03:57.049> lip<00:03:57.319> here<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.829> then<00:03:58.310> push<00:03:58.609> it<00:03:58.790> back<00:03:59.150> into

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
this lip here and then push it back into

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.750 
this lip here and then push it back into
place<00:04:01.150> that<00:04:02.150> will<00:04:02.389> lock<00:04:03.319> it<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.799> and<00:04:03.980> once<00:04:04.639> you

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
place that will lock it in and once you

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.800 
place that will lock it in and once you
figured<00:04:05.209> out<00:04:05.269> where<00:04:05.450> you're<00:04:05.569> going<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.750> put

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
figured out where you're going to put

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.809 
figured out where you're going to put
then<00:04:06.139> you<00:04:06.290> can<00:04:06.440> glue<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.650> in<00:04:06.799> place<00:04:06.829> another

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
then you can glue it in place another

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.640 
then you can glue it in place another
thing<00:04:08.000> like<00:04:08.150> I've<00:04:08.299> shown<00:04:08.510> in<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.750> past<00:04:08.930> on<00:04:09.260> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
back of the instrument panel I would put

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.039 
back of the instrument panel I would put
a<00:04:14.230> piece<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.260> 1<00:04:15.920> through<00:04:16.160> 3<00:04:16.729> 30<00:04:16.910> seconds<00:04:17.419> or<00:04:17.539> 16

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
I've seem to have misplaced it but

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.360 
I've seem to have misplaced it but
anyway<00:05:39.900> yes<00:05:40.230> that's<00:05:40.590> the<00:05:40.710> last<00:05:40.890> two<00:05:41.100> things

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
anyway yes that's the last two things

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.920 
anyway yes that's the last two things
because<00:05:41.550> you<00:05:41.670> really<00:05:42.180> can't<00:05:42.210> move<00:05:42.600> put<00:05:42.900> your

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
because you really can't move put your

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.540 
because you really can't move put your
hands<00:05:43.230> down<00:05:43.350> and<00:05:43.620> air<00:05:43.680> well<00:05:43.920> with<00:05:44.160> those<00:05:44.340> two

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
hands down and air well with those two

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.930 
hands down and air well with those two
pieces<00:05:44.760> in<00:05:45.120> place<00:05:45.290> so<00:05:46.290> anyway<00:05:46.580> it's<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.730> real

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
pieces in place so anyway it's a real

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.760 
pieces in place so anyway it's a real
good<00:05:47.970> addition<00:05:48.510> to<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:48.690> airplane<00:05:49.080> makes<00:05:49.620> it

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
good addition to the airplane makes it

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.560 
good addition to the airplane makes it
look<00:05:49.920> really<00:05:50.100> interesting<00:05:50.760> adds<00:05:51.330> a<00:05:51.510> little

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
look really interesting adds a little

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.390 
look really interesting adds a little
bitter<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.120> whole<00:05:54.270> look<00:05:54.480> of<00:05:54.660> it<00:05:55.370> like<00:05:56.370> I

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
bitter to the whole look of it like I

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.850 
bitter to the whole look of it like I
