out<00:04:12.030> pretty<00:04:12.239> well<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.690> unfortunately<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.590> like

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
out pretty well but unfortunately I like

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.890

keeping<00:04:14.730> those<00:04:14.850> on<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.120> think<00:04:15.330> it's<00:04:15.540> maybe<00:04:15.810> a

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
keeping those on I think it's maybe a

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.870 
keeping those on I think it's maybe a
little<00:04:15.959> bit<00:04:16.200> tedious<00:04:16.470> going<00:04:17.250> back<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.609> forth

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
little bit tedious going back and forth

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.940 
little bit tedious going back and forth
because<00:04:18.180> with<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.049> iPad<00:04:19.350> here's<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.680> lot<00:04:19.859> of

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
because with the iPad here's a lot of

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.610 
because with the iPad here's a lot of
gestures<00:04:20.480> for<00:04:21.480> example<00:04:21.900> going<00:04:22.109> back<00:04:22.230> and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
gestures for example going back and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.909 
gestures for example going back and
forth<00:04:22.950> through<00:04:23.160> applications<00:04:24.830> but<00:04:25.830> it

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
forth through applications but it

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.380 
forth through applications but it
doesn't<00:04:26.220> seem<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.490> do<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.669> up<00:04:26.880> now<00:04:27.030> that's

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
doesn't seem to do that up now that's

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.340 
doesn't seem to do that up now that's
interesting<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:30.360> can<00:04:30.510> still<00:04:30.660> zoom<00:04:30.690> in<00:04:31.139> with<00:04:31.320> a

that I know that you can do on here is
you<00:04:40.200> can<00:04:40.350> do<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.530> little<00:04:40.710> bit<00:04:40.890> of<00:04:41.040> smudging<00:04:41.400> if

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
you can do a little bit of smudging if

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.050 
you can do a little bit of smudging if
you<00:04:42.210> do<00:04:42.390> have<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> finger<00:04:43.290> out<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.880> pencils<00:04:44.880> not

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
you do have a finger out and pencils not

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.850 
you do have a finger out and pencils not
in<00:04:45.240> use<00:04:45.390> you<00:04:45.419> can<00:04:45.690> use<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.140> smudge<00:04:46.530> just

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
in use you can use it to smudge just

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.279 
in use you can use it to smudge just
like<00:04:46.979> you<00:04:47.100> would<00:04:47.340> on<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:48.539> real<00:04:48.780> piece<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.110> paper

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
like you would on a real piece of paper

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.590 
like you would on a real piece of paper
and<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.530> think<00:04:49.740> that's<00:04:49.890> great

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
and I think that's great

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.990 
and I think that's great
so<00:04:51.600> palm<00:04:52.169> rejection<00:04:54.200> and<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:56.460> is<00:04:56.580> tripping<00:04:56.910> up

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
so palm rejection and it is tripping up

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.640 
so palm rejection and it is tripping up
a<00:04:57.060> little<00:04:57.270> bit<00:04:57.419> with<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.750> gesture<00:04:58.110> salon<00:04:58.410> so

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
a little bit with the gesture salon so

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.380 
a little bit with the gesture salon so
don't<00:04:59.220> forget<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.520> turn<00:04:59.610> their<00:04:59.789> gestures<00:05:00.180> off

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
don't forget to turn their gestures off

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.840 
don't forget to turn their gestures off
all<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.229> all<00:05:01.350> I<00:05:01.380> think<00:05:01.440> it's<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.770> great<00:05:01.950> idea<00:05:02.310> I

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
all in all I think it's a great idea I

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.090 
all in all I think it's a great idea I
love<00:05:03.479> using<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.900> paper<00:05:04.169> application<00:05:04.860> for<00:05:05.039> all

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
love using the paper application for all

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.279 
love using the paper application for all
my<00:05:05.250> drawing<00:05:05.630> even<00:05:06.630> if<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:06.810> don't<00:05:06.990> use<00:05:07.169> the

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
my drawing even if you don't use the

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.170 
my drawing even if you don't use the
paper<00:05:07.470> application<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:08.430> can<00:05:08.550> still<00:05:08.789> use<00:05:09.030> this

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
paper application you can still use this

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.610

as<00:05:09.390> a<00:05:09.539> traditional<00:05:09.990> stylus<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:12.350> think<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.410> looks

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
as a traditional stylus I think it looks

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.250 
as a traditional stylus I think it looks
great<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.190> let's<00:05:15.150> try<00:05:15.419> this<00:05:15.479> as<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.110> mech

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
great and let's try this as the mech

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.480 
great and let's try this as the mech
netic<00:05:16.530> snap<00:05:17.000> or<00:05:18.000> this<00:05:18.240> go

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.629 

hmm<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:27.750> believe<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.780> medic<00:05:29.199> magnetic<00:05:29.949> snap<00:05:30.250> only

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
hmm I believe a medic magnetic snap only

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.999 
hmm I believe a medic magnetic snap only
