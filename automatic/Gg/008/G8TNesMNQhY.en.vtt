00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 when we have how are you then today 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.940
 I 'm going to show you how to play the condor 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.670
 happens' a friend of mine has asked me to 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 Well, let's start 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.130
 first the first I pour with the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.130
 song and then I show you how it goes 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
 or 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.029
 weather 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.879
 and 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.879
 i 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.780
 as such 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.059
 and 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.909
 in the subject 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.910
 the song is divided first in 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.470
 two different types of sounds that are 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.470
 the strum 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:34.140
 and the pointer as nothing first the ray is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.369
 a known rhythm called cumbia vale is 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.369
 a rhythm that is good for me 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.369
 simply 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.430
 it's like that in the first place are I'm going to 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.820
 teach the score that would be the note 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.820
 the least 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.810
 we start with the fourth string the 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.439
 second fret we started giving 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.439
 nothing else 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.390
 we give him and we go to the third string 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.069
 that would also be a c 1 fret that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.090
 it would continue 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.900
 to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.900
 It would be the same 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.569
 to 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.780
 and then nothing starts 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.420
 and then after the third guard 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.210
 we went to the same third string instead 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.630
 to be second after train we went to 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.630
 First 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.080
 then it would be 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.720
 OK 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.930
 ah 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.170
 and then it would be the same, we will pass another 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.750
 time to the third string second fret and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.290
 it would be 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.290
 ah 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.340
 OK 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:20.840
 well then followed by this 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:25.870
 we would go to the second free rope 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.870
 free voucher that would be left 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.000
 after this we passed again in the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.190
 first rope 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.770
 the second rope forgiveness after the second 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.390
 rope after this we went to the 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.360
 second string allows fret 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.590
 and then again we let go 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.590
 it would be 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.660
 to 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.670
 after free again we put 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.620
 so it would be like that 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.100
 after placing again after 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.280
 this 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.710
 after that it would 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.389
 again the same rope second rope 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.389
 but this time on the third fret 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.370
 it would be 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:45.949
 then we will go to the first string 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:48.210
