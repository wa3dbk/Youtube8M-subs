00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.330
 hello guys we will then respond more 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.789
 Enemy issues there 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.220
 in case the pool 6 is nature 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.400
 competence 4 talk about genetics in 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.070
 existing gold process you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.890
 wrote on the channel on youtube and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.529
 twitter em por matheus ducks beauty 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 Let's settle there Professor Thomas and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.550
 Let's solve one more question that is 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.190
 an issue that is actually a bit of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.739
 reading and also you remembering a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.450
 feature on beauty papers with 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.719
 this issue speaks thus to prolonged use 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.239
 of contact lenses at night and 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.170
 Nobody favors the world. 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.090
 explaining about microbial infection 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 Only then does he say that you will. 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:04.350
 end up using just one 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:07.799
 antibiotic to kill bacteria 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.690
 in general with the risk factors 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.280
 causes oxygenation to decrease in the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.190
 cornea finish change in your 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.200
 metabolism that passes from the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.270
 and this ends up killing the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.119
 bacteria but also any that ends up 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.159
 affecting the region exactly and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.580
 of the eyeball that are affecting the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.189
 cornea consequently only after that in 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.070
 1 to 1 what is asked he says that the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.380
 of bacteria in the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.270
 process in the core are 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.250
 related to some general criticisms 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 these microorganisms risk then you 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:47.220
 realizes that they are not as 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.600
 concerned with the issue is about the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.000
 bacteria 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 Good, this is talking about these micro 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 organisms that go this bacterium that goes 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.869
 infect with our eyes are on 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.360
 this alternative when speaking here is a 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:06.390
 great adaptability even 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.550
 type of the same type same environment 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.580
 temperature ph type 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.020
 with its adaptation to the great capacity of 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.540
 mutate 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.470
 also it was not what ended up telling 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.880
 morphological diversity the high power is 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.950
 increase variability 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.960
 genetics 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.590
 many, but the ceiling has not 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.400
 this alternative can not just forget 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.840
 bacteria in bacteria usually the 20th 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.480
 28 percent of bacterial species 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.430
 perform the asexual reproduction of the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.490
 sexual reproduction is precisely radio 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.640
 absence is the absence that will open 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.920
 in genetics of gametes is this then 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.290
 fertilization and can not speak 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.500
 of genetic variability in this 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.020
 in this alternative that is going to be the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.220
 answer and palm trees and sÃ£o paulo is 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.280
 United 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.130
 finished football will be on top 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.020
 power of reproduction causing thousands 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.160
 of genetically identical seeds 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.900
 precisely because it is a reproduction 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.340
 sexed not have quality and diversity 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.350
 considering new processes 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.690
 and new ones for obtaining energy 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.040
 I really got the best answer 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.989
 that you did not then you realize that it is 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.870
 an issue is in fact totally 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.390
 bacteria and it is important to 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.830
 small good reading and which is a 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.709
 characteristic of him 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.820
 reading has to be done with much 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.010
 attention 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.690
 beauty you get to go to the house 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.900
 captains of bacteria 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.060
 the title of assisted reproduction of 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.310
 Playback is that this ends up falling 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.290
 competence 4 to 1 the proceedings 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.810
 biology ends up putting even the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.970
 icon 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.410
 the skills there precisely 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.260
 reproduction of living beings in this 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.700
 Beauty competence do you want more 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.170
 information on the material is 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.660
 www using dn.org.br be enjoyed 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.580
 a tanned in the video and we are going to 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.580
 next technical question, few people
