00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.730
 in this video of 5 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.280
 5 I'm going to show you a secret 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.009
 instructs a reference a secret place 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.240
 everything all together all the world and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.430
 good if you wonder why the lightning does not 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.570
 I'm online because it's because 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.490
 finished the live 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.850
 I had two options I had two 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.590
 soups or run out to buy a 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.710
 card which was not very viable 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.179
 because it was already something night and I do not know no 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 I know how long it would take me maybe I'll 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.219
 take a few hours and so maybe I was going 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.649
 also to eat something over there or maybe 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.379
 I was going to distract from stores 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.680
 the square and all that and the other option was 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.450
 then record it with franklin or there I decided 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.430
 this does not receive it with franklin which 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.969
 I do not see any difference and equipment 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.770
 franklin is good wave not also style 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.539
 franklin is the band but good since 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.430
 leave all that behind to carry your 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.430
 location we open our map and we 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.079
 let's go exactly here to this king 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.570
 which is on the road and obviously 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.189
 We have to go to the road, not me 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.420
 I think I think that's where you have to 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.990
 go to find a mystery of the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.520
 highway 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.380
 on the road you do not have to go to 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.030
 a farm 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.829
 there is this point observe what 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.830
 visualize you can not locate the map 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.030
 Normal gta is not as cool as the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.619
 of not online because he does not have so many 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.899
 references but then there more or less 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 can be located and so you can 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:28.640
 we go there and good here is here is 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.149
 finally we got down here and 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.659
 we should not make traffic if there 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.850
 to put ourselves a bit on the side of 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.289
 on the side where traffic is not done like this 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.500
 that we already went down to see if we do not 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.179
 they kill so yes yes definitely because 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 it's half dangerous they were how they pass 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.280
 the cars go by very fast and maybe we 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.990
 can kill but hey here they are here 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.789
 there's the symbology there's more symbology there 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.799
 come 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.020
 there is no more symbolism except that this is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.319
 the beginning and only the beginning there 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.700
 was close to see this symbol that 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.619
 it's strange because it's almost with 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.689
 half the road is not noticeable because 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.030
 whenever you pass by here you stop or 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.920
 be very fast I get run over and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.580
 Another pillar is what I told them 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.110
 so kill 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.110
 Well there is not much to see but 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.540
 well we are back see you see the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.950
 symbology from the sky as seen there 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.310
 we are more or less doing well 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.310
 acrobatic jump 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:34.000
 well this is safer as you can see 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.560
 because there is a bit more secure and therefore 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.319
 we can see it from the ceiling not good 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.510
 from the roof of the car if they were there 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.709
 this is what interested me what I was 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.069
 he did very interesting of this symbology 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.159
 is that it has no logic 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.340
 they look a lot like the drawings that in the 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.889
 Monchi actually read in the video of the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.750
 This drawing of the jet paq are like more or 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.609
 less equal and the drawings and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.280
 as facts as well as lines like that but 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:03.669
 how colorful they have that style of that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.129
 video I remember so much and so 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:10.750
 because in this vato not that apply 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:14.220
 frame knowing super bear cartoons 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.450
 and the oxide of this symbology is that 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.920
 Well, as I said, it's very 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.840
 similar to the people in the mont chile 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.530
 but that's how we're going on the other side of the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.650
 road see what we have here as more 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.390
 there are not like some arrows and good here 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.030
 as of other colors the interesting thing 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.370
 as I already told you is that these 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.450
 these drawings these symbols only 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.660
 they are in this part of the road 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.060
 I was looking like this everywhere and it's 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.980
 the only one is the only place where then you 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.290
 you find them, it's not like that 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.270
 are somewhere else or like that 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.220
 they know almost all the map that I have 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.970
 like 80% of the map because this fact of 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.920
 streets and roads and it is not 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.020
 interesting not that they are specifically 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.720
 at this point it looks like these arrows and 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.700
 these things there is therefore that they have 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.430
 as certain similarity by the way there is a 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.510
 number 38 that maybe has something to do 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:12.220
 some numerology out there with that 38 89 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.380
 11 48 plus 3 and well if something something like that 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.900
 could it be and well see if we 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.419
 let's go here 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.669
 evading all the cars obviously if 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.930
 we are going to run by suicide 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.080
 we will find with this picture 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.360
 that maybe governments have nothing 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.470
 what to see but anyway anyway maybe 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.120
 so you have as something to see is the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.120
 flag of usa and says 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.770
 this is volcano canal net which is the same 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.250
 that says this is broken this I can 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.139
 return it and not because it is not and it is not 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.120
 this symbology is close is that thing 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.360
 in the way that the USA flag 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.720
 It is broken like many countries like 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.300
 that everyone is good they 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.270
 a little more than us 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.250
 and people is not so interesting that 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.220
 think of these symbols that logic 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.889
 come you do not see any logic is there is something 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.509
 that out there they have been told as well 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.000
 familiar or something they may know 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.370
 some Chinese letters may not be 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.139
 whatever it is whatever 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.900
 contribution is good, so it's true 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.970
 nothing else that would be all for this video 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.940
 for this symbolism someone ultra 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:23.430
 mysterious of the nomads 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:26.770
 and what else have you liked this video and 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.510
 until the next and nib understanding 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.510
 blue for fun 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.630
 ah
