hey<00:00:02.669> YouTube<00:00:03.030> so<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.640> been<00:00:05.640> working<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.060> fine

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
hey YouTube so I been working on fine

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.690 
hey YouTube so I been working on fine
tuning<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:06.660> bike<00:00:06.930> lately<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.429> move<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
tuning this bike lately I move the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.150 
tuning this bike lately I move the
controller<00:00:09.150> out<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.260> frame<00:00:10.500> bag<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.130> that

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
controller out of the frame bag so that

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.400 
controller out of the frame bag so that
it<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.179> get<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> little<00:00:12.480> more<00:00:12.690> cooling<00:00:13.139> and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
it you can get a little more cooling and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.470 
it you can get a little more cooling and
it<00:00:13.620> looks<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.130> says<00:00:14.670> standing<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.269> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
it looks like it says standing up to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.880 
it looks like it says standing up to
about<00:00:16.400> 65<00:00:17.400> amps<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.970> power<00:00:18.000> continuously<00:00:18.890> no

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
about 65 amps of power continuously no

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.529 
about 65 amps of power continuously no
problem<00:00:20.220> doesn't<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:20.580> get<00:00:20.730> all<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.029> hot

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
problem doesn't really get all that hot

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.250 
problem doesn't really get all that hot
anymore<00:00:22.010> I<00:00:23.010> upgraded<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> battery<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> 25

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
anymore I upgraded the battery to a 25

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.950 
anymore I upgraded the battery to a 25
minute<00:00:25.380> power<00:00:25.560> lipo<00:00:26.130> pack<00:00:26.660> previously<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.720> have

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
minute power lipo pack previously I have

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.620 
minute power lipo pack previously I have
15<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.349> our<00:00:28.590> 15<00:00:29.580> C<00:00:29.820> battery<00:00:30.090> pack<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.539> was

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
15 of our 15 C battery pack and it was

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.530 
15 of our 15 C battery pack and it was
sagging<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.170> lot<00:00:31.669> today<00:00:32.669> I've<00:00:33.000> bumped<00:00:33.329> up<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sagging a lot today I've bumped up the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.139 
sagging a lot today I've bumped up the
amps<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.079> about<00:00:34.260> 80<00:00:34.680> amps<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> I've<00:00:35.850> increased

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
amps to about 80 amps and I've increased

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.150 
amps to about 80 amps and I've increased
the<00:00:36.530> battery<00:00:37.530> into<00:00:37.620> phase<00:00:37.860> ratio<00:00:38.340> from<00:00:39.890> one<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the battery into phase ratio from one to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.240 
the battery into phase ratio from one to
two<00:00:41.790> point<00:00:42.000> four<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.680> two<00:00:43.710> point<00:00:44.100> five

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
two point four to one to two point five

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.119 
two point four to one to two point five
so<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.809> more<00:00:46.020> initial<00:00:46.530> kick<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so I have a little more initial kick and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
so I have a little more initial kick and
we're<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.789> gonna<00:00:47.940> go<00:00:48.149> take<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.719> up

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
we're just gonna go take this thing up

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
we're just gonna go take this thing up
some<00:00:49.020> pills<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.800> show<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
some pills and and show you what it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.900 
some pills and and show you what it
really<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.090> capable<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.110> know<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.280> any

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
really can be capable of I know that any

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.540 
really can be capable of I know that any
amps<00:00:54.329> isn't<00:00:54.600> even<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.370> saturating<00:00:56.370> this

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
amps isn't even really saturating this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.580 
amps isn't even really saturating this
motor<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.440> mommy

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590

leaf<00:00:59.250> bike<00:00:59.780> efficiency<00:01:00.780> graph<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.820> shows

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
leaf bike efficiency graph it it shows

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.280 
leaf bike efficiency graph it it shows
that<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> drops<00:01:03.629> down<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:04.110> eighty

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that it drops down to about eighty

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
that it drops down to about eighty
percent<00:01:04.379> efficiency<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.280> 80<00:01:05.460> amps<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:06.060> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
percent efficiency at 80 amps which is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.500 
percent efficiency at 80 amps which is
like<00:01:06.900> nothing<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.299> do

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
like nothing and you're not gonna do

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.090 
like nothing and you're not gonna do
that<00:01:09.540> continuously<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> motor<00:01:10.830> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that continuously on this motor so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
that continuously on this motor so
that's<00:01:11.250> totally<00:01:11.700> safe<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:13.020> not

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that's totally safe to do so I'm not

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.719 
that's totally safe to do so I'm not
really<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.740> saturate<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:14.670> I'm

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
really gonna saturate it here but I'm

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.859 
really gonna saturate it here but I'm
just<00:01:14.760> gonna<00:01:14.970> show<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.330> sort<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.990> reasonable

just gonna show you sort of a reasonable
use<00:01:18.869> case<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.409> motor<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.670> should<00:01:20.820> be

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
use case of the motor and it should be

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
use case of the motor and it should be
pretty<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.509> damn<00:01:21.689> quick<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.229> we're<00:01:23.220> just

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
yeah my controllers warmer the motor is

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.120 
yeah my controllers warmer the motor is
barely<00:06:28.240> warm<00:06:30.360> dude<00:06:31.360> it<00:06:31.599> can<00:06:31.750> take<00:06:31.930> more<00:06:32.139> this

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
barely warm dude it can take more this
