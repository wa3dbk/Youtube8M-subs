that<00:03:12.790> i<00:03:12.879> do<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:13.329> just<00:03:13.510> basically<00:03:13.750> set<00:03:14.590> up

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
that i do and it's just basically set up

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.710 
that i do and it's just basically set up
position<00:03:15.370> I'll<00:03:15.549> research<00:03:15.909> just<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.450> silver

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720

it<00:05:02.950> probably<00:05:03.310> goes<00:05:03.370> back<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.790> K<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.090> that's<00:05:04.420> the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
it probably goes back to K so that's the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.270 
it probably goes back to K so that's the
difference<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:05.110> they're<00:05:05.320> just<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.830> league<00:05:06.040> on

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280

difference is they're just the league on
its<00:05:06.400> own<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.870> next<00:05:08.050> thing<00:05:08.200> is<00:05:08.440> if<00:05:08.920> you're
