going to get worked from walking with

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.130 
going to get worked from walking with
resistance<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.570> something<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> lot

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
resistance and it's something that a lot

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.530 
resistance and it's something that a lot
of<00:00:40.170> people<00:00:40.500> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> don't<00:00:41.579> emphasize<00:00:41.850> enough

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540

of people kind of don't emphasize enough
they<00:00:42.780> kind<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.079> take<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.500> granted<00:00:43.530> but

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
they kind of take it for granted but

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.610 
they kind of take it for granted but
functional<00:00:45.329> exercises<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> farmers

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
functional exercises like the farmers

some farmers walk now obviously that's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.700 
some farmers walk now obviously that's
good<00:01:56.120> for<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.360> grip<00:01:56.570> but<00:01:57.080> after<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.470> couple

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710

dumbbells and a lot of people think well

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.900 
dumbbells and a lot of people think well
isn't<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.460> cheating

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
isn't that cheating

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.420 
isn't that cheating
but<00:02:11.450> there's<00:02:12.410> more<00:02:12.560> muscles<00:02:12.950> getting<00:02:13.220> worked

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
but there's more muscles getting worked

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.670 
but there's more muscles getting worked
than<00:02:13.850> your<00:02:14.060> grip<00:02:14.330> it's<00:02:15.290> like<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.590> that

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
than your grip it's like it's that

you're<00:02:15.830> working<00:02:16.100> all<00:02:16.220> those<00:02:16.340> stabilizing

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
you're working all those stabilizing

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.330 
you're working all those stabilizing
muscles<00:02:17.420> throughout<00:02:17.870> your<00:02:18.020> entire<00:02:18.170> body<00:02:18.560> your

traps your core your hips all these
muscles<00:02:22.820> that<00:02:22.910> get<00:02:23.090> activated<00:02:23.300> when<00:02:23.810> you're

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
muscles that get activated when you're

muscles that get activated when you're
walking<00:02:24.320> with<00:02:24.470> resistance<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.730> go

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
walking with resistance and you go

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.610 
walking with resistance and you go
longer<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.990> heavier

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
longer and heavier

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.980 
longer and heavier
if<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.400> reinforce<00:02:28.940> your<00:02:29.090> grip<00:02:29.300> with<00:02:29.660> lifting

if you reinforce your grip with lifting
straps<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:31.070> what<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.280> recommend<00:02:31.960> start<00:02:32.960> off

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
straps so what I recommend start off

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.620 
straps so what I recommend start off
with<00:02:33.650> your<00:02:33.800> bare<00:02:33.980> rib<00:02:34.220> maybe<00:02:34.760> chalk<00:02:35.120> up<00:02:35.330> like<00:02:35.540> I

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
with your bare rib maybe chalk up like I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.650 
with your bare rib maybe chalk up like I
did<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:36.620> get<00:02:37.370> more<00:02:37.550> friction<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:38.120> your<00:02:38.330> hands

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
did to get more friction in your hands

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.110 
did to get more friction in your hands
then<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:39.590> soon<00:02:39.770> as<00:02:39.890> your<00:02:40.040> hands<00:02:40.400> fatigue<00:02:40.820> and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
then as soon as your hands fatigue and

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.970 
then as soon as your hands fatigue and
you<00:02:41.360> can't<00:02:41.690> keep<00:02:41.900> going<00:02:42.080> because<00:02:42.350> your<00:02:42.740> grip

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
you can't keep going because your grip

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.920 
you can't keep going because your grip
strength<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.430> limiting<00:02:43.850> factor<00:02:43.930> then

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
strength is a limiting factor then

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.500 
strength is a limiting factor then
switch<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.709> using<00:02:45.890> lifting<00:02:46.400> straps<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.940> do<00:02:47.480> a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
switch to using lifting straps and do a

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.449 
switch to using lifting straps and do a
couple<00:02:47.840> more<00:02:47.959> sets<00:02:48.290> with<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.800> straps<00:02:49.190> and

couple more sets with the straps and

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.390 
couple more sets with the straps and
