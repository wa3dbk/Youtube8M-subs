00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
car talking about why they're doing what

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.860 
car talking about why they're doing what
they're<00:03:12.550> doing<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.060> Luna<00:03:13.300> was<00:03:13.420> there<00:03:13.570> and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
they're doing and Luna was there and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.630 
they're doing and Luna was there and
they<00:03:14.530> could<00:03:14.739> have<00:03:14.800> easily<00:03:15.040> talked<00:03:15.430> about

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
they could have easily talked about

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.340 
they could have easily talked about
being<00:03:15.790> sailor<00:03:16.030> star<00:03:16.330> lights<00:03:16.570> or<00:03:16.810> galaxia

being sailor star lights or galaxia

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.690 
being sailor star lights or galaxia
which<00:03:17.590> would<00:03:17.770> have<00:03:17.890> clued<00:03:18.100> Luna<00:03:18.370> in<00:03:18.489> onto

which would have clued Luna in onto
their<00:03:18.820> secret<00:03:19.120> identity<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.690> would<00:03:19.810> have

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
their secret identity so it would have

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.780 
their secret identity so it would have
been<00:03:19.930> great<00:03:20.140> but<00:03:20.440> they<00:03:21.160> kind<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.520> skip
