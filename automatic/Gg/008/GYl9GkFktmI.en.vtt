area up to a five or seven centimeters
on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.970> hills<00:01:09.180> by<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> time<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.850> by

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
on the hills by that time and by

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.050 
on the hills by that time and by
midnight<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:13.130> Sunday<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.340> into<00:01:14.670> Monday

midnight on Sunday going into Monday
just<00:01:15.479> look<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> some<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.680> large

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
just look at this some really large

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
just look at this some really large
totals<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.509> over<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
totals in there this would be over the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
totals in there this would be over the
hills<00:01:18.930> i<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.040> came<00:01:20.400> 10<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> 15

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
hills i think if you came 10 to 15

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.640 
hills i think if you came 10 to 15
centimeters<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.229> how<00:01:22.320> much<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
centimeters but you can see how much of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.870 
centimeters but you can see how much of

change<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.869> from

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
change but what I want you to take from

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.929 
change but what I want you to take from
this<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.470> idea<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.579> snow

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
this is the idea that there is snow

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.480 
this is the idea that there is snow

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
running into Monday as I said though big

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.230 
running into Monday as I said though big
uncertainty<00:01:49.590> over<00:01:49.920> exactly<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.820> happens

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
uncertainty over exactly what happens

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.090 
uncertainty over exactly what happens
the<00:01:51.420> key<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> chart

this area of low pressure that you can

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.620 
this area of low pressure that you can
see<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.240> tell<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.450> let's

this area of low pressure that you can
see<00:02:03.360> down<00:02:03.689> here<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.350> super<00:02:04.680> critical

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
going to fall but for now we need to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
going to fall but for now we need to
just<00:02:32.160> look<00:02:32.310> at<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.670> say<00:02:32.790> okay<00:02:33.180> we<00:02:33.330> have

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
just look at this and say okay we have

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.449 
just look at this and say okay we have
the<00:02:33.600> potential<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.560> wintry<00:02:34.920> outbreak<00:02:35.310> of

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
the potential for a wintry outbreak of

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.080 
the potential for a wintry outbreak of
significant<00:02:36.360> snow<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.840> monday<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
significant snow on monday and just to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.520 
significant snow on monday and just to
compare<00:02:39.360> across<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.810> models<00:02:40.110> there's<00:02:40.319> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
compare across the models there's the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.920 
compare across the models there's the
ecmwf<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.760> same<00:02:42.000> time<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.600> can<00:02:42.720> see

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
ecmwf for the same time and you can see

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.110 
ecmwf for the same time and you can see
here<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.830> two<00:02:44.100> enters<00:02:44.400> two<00:02:44.730> centers

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
here that it has two enters two centers

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.910 
here that it has two enters two centers
of<00:02:45.180> low<00:02:45.330> pressure<00:02:45.480> one<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:46.019> one<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.230> by<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
of low pressure one here one here by the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
of low pressure one here one here by the
same<00:02:47.220> time<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.459> Monday<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:47.880> it's<00:02:48.120> very<00:02:48.390> very

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
same time a Monday so it's very very

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
same time a Monday so it's very very
similar<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.440> where<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.489> placing<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.030> low

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
similar in where it's placing the low

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.960 
similar in where it's placing the low
and<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> Canadian<00:02:53.430> model<00:02:53.580> again

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and this is the Canadian model again

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.550 
and this is the Canadian model again
it's<00:02:54.209> got<00:02:54.360> low<00:02:54.510> pressure<00:02:54.750> yes<00:02:55.019> down<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it's got low pressure yes down to the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.259 
it's got low pressure yes down to the
south<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:56.010> got<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.280> here<00:02:56.580> across<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
south it's got it here across the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.210 
south it's got it here across the
western<00:02:57.570> both<00:02:57.750> biscuit<00:02:58.260> area<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.739> again<00:02:59.040> this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
western both biscuit area but again this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.100 
western both biscuit area but again this
idea<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.300> bringing<00:03:00.569> low<00:03:00.840> pressure

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
idea that it's bringing low pressure

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.600 
idea that it's bringing low pressure
across<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.739> south<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.130> country<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.580> a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
across the south of the country is a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.900 
across the south of the country is a
significant<00:03:03.330> one<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:04.170> ECM<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.130> Canadian

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
significant one on the ECM and Canadian

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.520 
significant one on the ECM and Canadian
models<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.330> snow<00:03:06.569> would<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.930> further<00:03:07.170> south

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
models the snow would be further south

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.229 
models the snow would be further south
on<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.010> GFS<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.550> would<00:03:08.670> be<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.819> little<00:03:09.060> bit

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
on the GFS it would be a little bit

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.640 
on the GFS it would be a little bit
further<00:03:09.390> north<00:03:09.540> affecting<00:03:10.080> northern<00:03:10.380> England

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
further north affecting northern England

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.320 
further north affecting northern England
and<00:03:10.739> Scotland<00:03:10.860> mainly<00:03:11.459> but<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.880> Jazz<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.209> say

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
and Scotland mainly but the Jazz to say

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.759 
and Scotland mainly but the Jazz to say
the<00:03:12.450> Canadian<00:03:12.840> Geese<00:03:13.080> interview<00:03:13.500> F<00:03:13.620> would

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
the Canadian Geese interview F would

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.100 
the Canadian Geese interview F would
bring<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.100> more<00:03:14.220> down<00:03:14.400> into<00:03:14.640> Wales<00:03:14.880> and

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
bring it more down into Wales and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.610 
bring it more down into Wales and
southern<00:03:16.110> parts<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.500> England<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.069> Ireland

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.780 
southern parts of England and Ireland
but<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.680> big<00:03:19.799> uncertainty<00:03:20.070> really<00:03:20.549> is<00:03:20.640> how

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
but the big uncertainty really is how

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.580 
but the big uncertainty really is how
cold<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.269> air<00:03:21.299> is<00:03:21.540> going<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.840> within<00:03:22.019> that

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
cold the air is going to be within that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.039 
cold the air is going to be within that
system<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.910> 850<00:03:24.390> temperatures<00:03:24.810> for

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
mid day on Sunday you can see that we've

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.060 
mid day on Sunday you can see that we've

you<00:03:46.829> see<00:03:47.010> how<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.220> low<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.700> then<00:03:47.940> kind<00:03:48.420> of

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
you see how the low is then kind of

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.640 
you see how the low is then kind of
moved<00:03:48.690> its<00:03:48.840> wasting<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.230> think<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.470> it's<00:03:49.620> a

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
moved its wasting I think so it's a

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.289 
moved its wasting I think so it's a
little<00:03:49.769> bit<00:03:49.920> wouldn'ta<00:03:50.340> minus<00:03:50.640> 3s<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.060> minus

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
minus six minus 7-8 at eight-fifty so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.170 
minus six minus 7-8 at eight-fifty so
well<00:04:13.709> in<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.920> snow<00:04:14.130> zone<00:04:14.340> then<00:04:14.579> but<00:04:14.790> by<00:04:14.910> then

you<00:04:20.760> can<00:04:20.910> see<00:04:21.090> how<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.479> air<00:04:21.690> comes<00:04:21.930> through

you can see how that air comes through

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.110 
you can see how that air comes through
it<00:04:22.530> kind<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.830> warms<00:04:23.159> up<00:04:23.310> slightly<00:04:23.640> but<00:04:24.000> then

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it kind of warms up slightly but then

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.960 
it kind of warms up slightly but then
cools<00:04:24.570> down<00:04:24.870> as<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.979> low<00:04:26.159> pulls<00:04:26.490> away<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.760> the

cools down as the low pulls away to the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.410 
cools down as the low pulls away to the
south<00:04:27.120> and

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
south and

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.960

it just continues look down these
eastern<00:05:34.260> coast<00:05:34.440> again<00:05:34.590> feeding<00:05:35.310> down<00:05:35.520> into

Wales and it Stan into the Midlands as

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.510 
Wales and it Stan into the Midlands as
well<00:05:40.020> so<00:05:40.320> these<00:05:40.680> are<00:05:40.890> just<00:05:40.980> accumulating

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
well so these are just accumulating

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.540 
well so these are just accumulating
totals<00:05:42.030> of<00:05:42.180> snow<00:05:43.040> and<00:05:44.040> then<00:05:44.160> on<00:05:44.310> Monday

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
totals of snow and then on Monday

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.310 
totals of snow and then on Monday
morning<00:05:44.850> still<00:05:45.270> got<00:05:45.450> this<00:05:45.540> area<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:45.960> snow

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
morning still got this area of snow

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.770 
morning still got this area of snow
that's<00:05:47.190> kind<00:05:47.520> of<00:05:47.580> in<00:05:47.730> here<00:05:48.360> look<00:05:48.540> you<00:05:48.660> can

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
that's kind of in here look you can

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.990 
that's kind of in here look you can
almost<00:05:48.900> draw<00:05:49.290> it<00:05:49.500> all<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:50.010> way<00:05:50.160> in<00:05:50.190> through

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
almost draw it all the way in through

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.210 
almost draw it all the way in through
here<00:05:51.390> so<00:05:51.660> it's<00:05:51.780> that<00:05:51.900> whole<00:05:52.140> area<00:05:52.410> as<00:05:52.710> those

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
here so it's that whole area as those

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.280 
here so it's that whole area as those
out<00:05:53.430> 50<00:05:53.790> temperatures<00:05:54.150> pull<00:05:54.420> off<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:54.990> snow

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
out 50 temperatures pull off the snow

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.660 
out 50 temperatures pull off the snow
does<00:05:55.560> become<00:05:55.830> lighter<00:05:56.070> but<00:05:56.310> there's<00:05:56.490> still

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
does become lighter but there's still

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.440 
does become lighter but there's still
snow<00:05:57.090> falling<00:05:57.690> so<00:05:58.140> a<00:05:58.830> real<00:05:59.280> wintery<00:06:00.000> look<00:06:00.240> to

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
snow falling so a real wintery look to

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.120 
snow falling so a real wintery look to
the<00:06:00.570> GFS<00:06:01.050> at<00:06:01.230> the<00:06:01.320> moment<00:06:01.590> of<00:06:01.680> course<00:06:01.860> what<00:06:02.040> we

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
the GFS at the moment of course what we

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.310 
the GFS at the moment of course what we
have<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.580> decide<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.270> big<00:06:03.600> question<00:06:03.900> mark

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
have to decide and the big question mark

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.950 
have to decide and the big question mark
that<00:06:04.410> we<00:06:04.470> have<00:06:04.650> is<00:06:05.040> is<00:06:05.730> it<00:06:06.360> very<00:06:06.480> cold<00:06:06.720> enough

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
that we have is is it very cold enough

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.540 
that we have is is it very cold enough
exactly<00:06:07.560> where's<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.890> low<00:06:07.980> going<00:06:08.220> to<00:06:08.280> be<00:06:08.370> and

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
exactly where's the low going to be and

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.330 
exactly where's the low going to be and
what<00:06:08.820> are<00:06:09.060> we<00:06:09.120> going<00:06:09.420> to<00:06:09.570> see<00:06:09.720> from<00:06:09.990> it<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:11.310> I

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
what are we going to see from it so I

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.620 
what are we going to see from it so I
think<00:06:11.550> what<00:06:11.670> I<00:06:11.730> want<00:06:11.880> you<00:06:11.940> to<00:06:12.060> take<00:06:12.180> away<00:06:12.420> from

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
think what I want you to take away from

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.240 
think what I want you to take away from
this<00:06:12.780> recording<00:06:13.230> is<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.560> idea<00:06:13.890> that<00:06:13.920> there<00:06:14.160> is

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
this recording is the idea that there is

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.830 
this recording is the idea that there is
this<00:06:14.400> threat<00:06:14.760> of<00:06:14.940> wintry<00:06:15.270> weather<00:06:15.300> on<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.660> way

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
this threat of wintry weather on the way

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.470 
this threat of wintry weather on the way
the<00:06:16.380> risk<00:06:16.740> of<00:06:16.920> it<00:06:17.070> is<00:06:17.190> building<00:06:17.610> day<00:06:18.060> to<00:06:18.120> day

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
the risk of it is building day to day

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.240 
the risk of it is building day to day
we've<00:06:19.410> always<00:06:19.590> thought<00:06:19.710> it<00:06:19.920> was<00:06:19.950> going<00:06:20.100> to<00:06:20.160> be

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
we've always thought it was going to be
