thoughts<00:00:09.240> about<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.719> tree<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:11.070> things<00:00:11.309> I

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
thoughts about this tree the things I

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.299 
thoughts about this tree the things I
like<00:00:11.700> about<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.719> aged<00:00:12.990> looking<00:00:13.650> bark

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
like about it are the aged looking bark

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.080 
like about it are the aged looking bark
I<00:00:14.340> like<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> sparse<00:00:15.690> number<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.379> branches

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
I like the sparse number of branches

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.150 
I like the sparse number of branches
although<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.420> not<00:00:18.750> sure<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.350> sparse<00:00:19.770> enough

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
although I'm not sure it's sparse enough

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.179 
although I'm not sure it's sparse enough
at<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.520> point<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:22.260> things<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:23.130> like

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
at this point the things I do not like

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.790 
at this point the things I do not like
about<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.240> think<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.689> needles<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:25.380> too

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
about it is I think the needles are too

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.099 
about it is I think the needles are too
long<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.760> image<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.420> think<00:00:27.449> shorter

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
long for this image I think shorter

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.749 
long for this image I think shorter
needles<00:00:28.529> would<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.949> better<00:00:29.359> I<00:00:30.359> also<00:00:31.430> I'm<00:00:32.430> not

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
needles would be better I also I'm not

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.569 
needles would be better I also I'm not
sure<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> care<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.100> barely

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
sure I care for the for the just barely

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.160 
sure I care for the for the just barely
moving<00:00:36.059> curved<00:00:36.719> trunk<00:00:38.059> I<00:00:39.059> certainly<00:00:39.750> see<00:00:40.140> I

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
moving curved trunk I certainly see I

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380 
moving curved trunk I certainly see I
have<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> lot<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.100> trees<00:00:41.340> personally<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.090> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
have a lot of trees personally like this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.139 
have a lot of trees personally like this
because<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.530> most<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.520> material<00:00:45.030> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
because that's most of the material I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.729 
because that's most of the material I
have<00:00:45.180> readily<00:00:45.660> available<00:00:46.489> but<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:48.350> prefer<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
have readily available but I prefer and

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.740 
have readily available but I prefer and
my<00:00:49.920> bun<00:00:50.280> Jen<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.030> trunk<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> has<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
my bun Jen it's a trunk that has a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.319 
my bun Jen it's a trunk that has a
little<00:00:51.989> more<00:00:52.260> movement<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.120> what<00:00:54.120> I'm<00:00:54.210> gonna

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
little more movement so what I'm gonna

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.799 
little more movement so what I'm gonna
do<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.870> I've<00:00:55.050> used<00:00:55.289> Photoshop<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.809> help

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
do here is I've used Photoshop to help

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.779 
do here is I've used Photoshop to help
this<00:00:57.960> process<00:00:58.260> along<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> first<00:00:59.579> thing

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this process along so the first thing

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
this process along so the first thing
I'm<00:00:59.940> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.690> rid<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> some

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I'm going to do is get rid of some

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
I'm going to do is get rid of some
things<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:01.949> gonna<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.309> rid<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> pot

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
things and I'm gonna get rid of the pot

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.570 
things and I'm gonna get rid of the pot
because<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.710> different<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
because you know this is different it's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
because you know this is different it's
interesting<00:01:08.000> it's<00:01:09.000> maybe<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.200> were

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
interesting it's maybe if I were

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.710 
interesting it's maybe if I were
Japanese<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.460> wabi-sabi<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.479> might

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
Japanese and like wabi-sabi this might

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.490 
Japanese and like wabi-sabi this might
be<00:01:12.930> there's<00:01:13.799> something<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:15.500> valuable

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
be there's something that was valuable

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.280 
be there's something that was valuable
to<00:01:16.799> me<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.540> don't<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
to me but I don't really like it I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
to me but I don't really like it I
prefer<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.860> bunging<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> pot<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
prefer to see bunging in a pot or on a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.649 
prefer to see bunging in a pot or on a
stone<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> let's<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.030> started<00:01:24.390> first<00:01:24.479> thing

I'm<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.170> erase<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> bunch<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
I'm going to do is erase a bunch of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.899 
I'm going to do is erase a bunch of
stuff<00:01:26.159> okay<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.380> there<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.650> I've<00:01:28.829> erased<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
stuff okay so there we go I've erased a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.690 
stuff okay so there we go I've erased a
couple<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> lower<00:01:31.020> branches<00:01:31.650> I've<00:01:32.490> also

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
couple of the lower branches I've also

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.749 
couple of the lower branches I've also
erased<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> container<00:01:34.100> now<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
erased the container now I'm going to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.020 
erased the container now I'm going to
move<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> tree<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> center<00:01:38.000> one<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
move the tree more to the center one of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.670 
move the tree more to the center one of
the<00:01:39.180> things<00:01:39.360> I'd<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
the things I'd like to do now is to

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.289 
the things I'd like to do now is to
actually<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:44.100> some<00:01:44.130> movement<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> trunk

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
actually put some movement in the trunk

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
actually put some movement in the trunk
so<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.229> go<00:01:46.409> putting<00:01:46.799> some<00:01:47.040> movement<00:01:47.460> in

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so here we go putting some movement in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:57.840 
so here we go putting some movement in
the<00:01:47.579> trunk

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.120 

alright<00:01:58.850> ok<00:01:59.540> so<00:01:59.600> now<00:02:00.200> we've<00:02:00.410> added<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.950> few

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
alright ok so now we've added a few

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.100 
alright ok so now we've added a few
bends<00:02:01.520> in<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.730> trunk<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.210> just<00:02:02.750> think<00:02:02.990> this

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
bends in the trunk I just think this

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.180 
bends in the trunk I just think this
adds<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.560> little<00:02:03.830> more<00:02:03.979> interest<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.760> tree

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
adds a little more interest to the tree

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.790 
adds a little more interest to the tree
yeah<00:02:07.190> there's<00:02:07.460> still<00:02:07.550> some<00:02:08.000> taper<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:09.500> curves

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
yeah there's still some taper the curves

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.670 
yeah there's still some taper the curves
are<00:02:10.130> not<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:11.390> same<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:12.170> mean<00:02:12.350> they're<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> little

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
are not the same I mean they're a little

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.960 
are not the same I mean they're a little
bit<00:02:12.920> different<00:02:13.750> different<00:02:14.750> distances<00:02:15.260> apart

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
bit different different distances apart

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.090 
bit different different distances apart
but<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.420> now<00:02:17.630> let's<00:02:17.900> deal<00:02:18.140> with<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.530> needles<00:02:18.890> I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
but so now let's deal with the needles I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.000 
but so now let's deal with the needles I
think<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.550> shorter<00:02:20.030> needle<00:02:20.209> would<00:02:20.570> be<00:02:21.010> offer

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
think a shorter needle would be offer

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.580 
think a shorter needle would be offer
better<00:02:22.400> perspective<00:02:22.910> for<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.630> boon<00:02:24.290> shin<00:02:24.560> or

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
better perspective for a boon shin or

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.580 
better perspective for a boon shin or
literati<00:02:24.980> style<00:02:25.489> like<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.330> let's<00:02:27.320> do

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
literati style like this so let's do

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.430 
literati style like this so let's do
that

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
that

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.970 
that
clean<00:02:30.440> up<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.770> needle<00:02:31.070> son<00:02:35.800> all<00:02:36.800> right

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
clean up the needle son all right

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.830 
clean up the needle son all right
Bend<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.520> branch<00:02:37.850> down<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.209> little<00:02:38.420> bit<00:02:38.630> you

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
Bend that branch down a little bit you

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.390 
Bend that branch down a little bit you
can<00:02:38.989> see<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.350> was<00:02:39.470> straight<00:02:39.800> out<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.340> just

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
can see it was straight out so I just

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.760 
can see it was straight out so I just
bent<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.880> down<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.120> little<00:02:41.360> bit<00:02:42.850> all<00:02:43.850> right<00:02:44.770> few

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
bent it down a little bit all right few

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.920 
bent it down a little bit all right few
minor<00:02:46.250> adjustments<00:02:46.489> now<00:02:47.209> it's<00:02:47.420> time<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.780> put

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
minor adjustments now it's time to put

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.770 
minor adjustments now it's time to put
it<00:02:48.020> on<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> stone<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:49.010> let's<00:02:49.880> move<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.330> down<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
it on a stone so let's move it down and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.470 
it on a stone so let's move it down and
put<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:51.080> on<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> stone<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:52.360> couple<00:02:53.360> more

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
put it on a stone a couple more

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.550 
put it on a stone a couple more
adjustments<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.470> foliage<00:02:56.049> now<00:02:57.049> let's

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
adjustments to the foliage now let's

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.509 
adjustments to the foliage now let's
move<00:02:57.860> this<00:02:58.130> up<00:02:58.370> ok<00:02:59.330> well<00:02:59.959> it's<00:03:00.709> not<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> perfect

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
move this up ok well it's not a perfect

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.110 
move this up ok well it's not a perfect
image<00:03:01.820> by<00:03:02.030> any<00:03:02.269> means<00:03:02.630> but<00:03:03.170> in<00:03:04.160> my<00:03:04.850> eye<00:03:04.880> this

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
image by any means but in my eye this

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.930 
image by any means but in my eye this
tree<00:03:05.840> shows<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.140> little<00:03:06.680> more<00:03:06.920> effect<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.580> age

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
tree shows a little more effect of age

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.870 
tree shows a little more effect of age
and<00:03:08.360> time<00:03:08.630> with<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.230> bends<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.920> trunk<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
and time with the bends in the trunk the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.180 
and time with the bends in the trunk the
tighter<00:03:11.269> foliage<00:03:11.989> makes<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.500> tree<00:03:12.950> look

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
tighter foliage makes this tree look

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.320 
tighter foliage makes this tree look
much<00:03:13.489> taller<00:03:13.970> than<00:03:14.269> what<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:15.500> was<00:03:15.709> before<00:03:16.330> so

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
much taller than what it was before so

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.140 
much taller than what it was before so
that's<00:03:17.720> my<00:03:17.989> take<00:03:18.200> on<00:03:18.440> it

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
that's my take on it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.870 
that's my take on it
who<00:03:20.870> knows<00:03:21.760> alright<00:03:24.100> have<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.160> great<00:03:25.340> day

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
who knows alright have a great day

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.090 
who knows alright have a great day
I'll<00:03:26.330> be<00:03:26.570> interested<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.989> see<00:03:27.290> what<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.950> other

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
I'll be interested to see what the other

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.080 
I'll be interested to see what the other
folks<00:03:28.370> have<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.700> say<00:03:28.730> about<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.330> Thanks
