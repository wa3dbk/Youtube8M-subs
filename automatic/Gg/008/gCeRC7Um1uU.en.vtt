00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone I'm seeing that ricky ai this 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.359
 It's my first video in this video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.790
 I got it from a website 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.849
 I have not invented anything comment and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.889
 subscribe after several days in the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.560
 hospital a child just expected to return 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 home with his parents far from imagining 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.730
 that same night he would receive the fright 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 greatest of your life to see what you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.320
 it caused more terror a clown more 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.539
 precisely to the nurse chief of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.429
 pediatrics who along with other nurses 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.560
 for a year they were the managers 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.600
 to entertain with laughter therapy 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.149
 to the children of the hospital who were 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.160
 in recovery they did it once 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.520
 per week dressed as clowns with 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 colorful costumes wigs and makeup 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.789
 but the one that enjoyed it most and the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.370
 funniest clown was the boss of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.530
 Polish nurses 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.870
 because his dream had always been to be 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 clown and his greatest satisfaction was 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.519
 make children forget the pain 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.019
 for a moment by laughing all 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.879
 the children who had been in the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.219
 hospital the last year they had 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.170
 funny with clowns - that child 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.420
 who had just entered the hospital that 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.310
 week and they did not know there were clowns in 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.470
 the hospital as well as no nurse 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.780
 he knew about his fear of clowns and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.550
 misfortune would have a dangerous reaction 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.590
 with the clown who entered his 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.509
 room because from very small they 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.830
 I had been terrified and because of the appearance 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.050
 they considered evil and dangerous 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.030
 the night will come the nurses will 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.130
 they dressed in clown costumes and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.810
 they went into different rooms to 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.820
 make all the children laugh there 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.560
 were on their side the head of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.570
 nurses decided to enter the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.120
 child's room without thinking about the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.400
 consequences that would bring in the 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.470
 room the child heard the noise of 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.570
 the door while it opened and got off 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.400
 the bed in a hop hoping to receive 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.470
 his parents but when the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.900
 door and found himself facing the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.790
 clown an uncontrollable fear seized 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.890
 of the little one who was screaming desperately 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.760
 while a chill ran through her 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.130
 back the head nurse did not know 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.900
 how to react because I had never seen 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.000
 to a child who was afraid of 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.340
 clowns after having made laugh 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.229
 so many children and to try to calm him down 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.479
 he made the wrong decision to talk and 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.550
 approach but the child felt so 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.500
 terrified he ran to the window 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.290
 closed to leave the room and 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.480
 escape from the evil clown 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.579
 immediately the head nurse 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.349
 he tried to grab it when it was launched with 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.510
 all your strength through the window 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.370
 breaking the crystals and throwing the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.219
 last deafening scream and almost what 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.319
 It reaches but it was too late the 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.750
 fall from the fourth floor had been 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.939
 mortal the other nurses and some 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.319
 children went to the rooms to 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.720
 see what had happened when 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.879
 they heard the child's screams the sound 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.680
 of the crystals breaking and the scream 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.269
 of terror of the head of nurses and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.129
 when they came to the room what 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.379
 they found paralyzed and looking at the 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.109
 broken window from which falling drops of 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.299
 blood before I could count what 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.250
 that the only thing that had happened 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.319
 remained of the child in the room were 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.870
 the drops of blood from the window and 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.360
 slippers next to the bed 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.519
 that head nurse would not sleep that 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.530
 night or the following ones in your mind 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.599
 only the tragic one was lived again and again 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.430
 event and the body image almost 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.099
 unrecognizable child when 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.450
 they picked up to take him to the morgue 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.489
 he continually lamented because he never 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.829
 he thought that his intention to give him joy 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.510
 a child will end with his death and not 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.879
 he was able to tell him what he had 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.950
 passed to his wife with whom he was trying 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.720
 have a child but the nightmare was 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.820
 to start 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.860
 the next day the news came out in 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.450
 all the newspapers and news of the 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.820
 city ​​in which it appeared as the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.860
 responsible for the death of the child that and 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.440
 comments against all the 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.450
 hospital began to drive him crazy but 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.520
 the worst was to come to avoid 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.770
 legal measures the managers of the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.140
 hospital decided to fire him that same 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.210
 day 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.190
 He left the hospital without honors and for 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.959
 back door putting an end to your 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.240
 career because with what they said about 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.430
 he would not be hired in any circus and 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.470
 much less in a hospital feeling 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.840
 as his world collapsed way up 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.940
 his house and found a note from his wife 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.740
 about a newspaper that day there was 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.650
 decided to leave it after reading the 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.720
 newspaper at that time entered into a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.670
 deep depression because in a day what 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.530
 I had lost all that night either 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.660
 got sleep because not only 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.790
 I regretted and relived the death of the child 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.740
 but also that he had not only lost 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.930
 forever his work and his dream of 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.530
 be a clown but also his wife and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.810
 possibility of having a child 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.550
 as a way to escape his pain 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.830
 I seek refuge in alcohol and 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.169
 medicines when he managed to stay 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.760
 Asleep he was awakened by nightmares and 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.620
 in a matter of days the depression 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.780
 started to become crazy and 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.669
 despair every time I saw more 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.950
 frequency the child covered in blood 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.770
 with cuts and broken glass in the face 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.990
 and the body that appeared looked at him 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.790
 fixedly with hateful expression and 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.980
 vanished as if it were a 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.900
 ghost and not knowing if it was real or 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.030
 product of your mind disturbed fear 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.820
 the memories paralyzed him 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.740
 nightmares alcohol drugs and 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.760
 the apparitions had turned their 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.770
 life in a real hell 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.990
 a night ready to finish with everything 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.850
 she dressed herself up as a clown and a 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.710
 look so terrifying that it would scare 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.810
 anyone tied a rope to 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.120
 ceiling fan of the room and placed 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.190
 a chair under the rope broke a 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.110
 mirror and with one of the crystals it 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.940
 he cut the palm of his hand to write 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.770
 a message on the wall and saved the 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.720
 bloody glass in one of the 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.120
 trouser pockets and grabbed the 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.190
 last empty bottle with the other hand is 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.440
 climbed on the chair put on the rope 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.540
 around the neck he grabbed the piece of 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.169
 mirror with the injured hand and jumped from the 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.419
 chair 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.219
 blood dripped from the glass that 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.560
 It fell to the ground along with the bottle 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.629
 when he lost consciousness covering the 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.849
 floor of blood and broken glass 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.919
 The last thing he saw was the child just 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.650
 this time I did not have a single scratch and 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.870
 I was smiling when the police entered 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.939
 in the room they saw the message on the wall 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.189
 that said I killed the child and also at 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:03.319
 clown what started with the death of 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:05.830
 a child ended with the suicide of a 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.830
 clown
