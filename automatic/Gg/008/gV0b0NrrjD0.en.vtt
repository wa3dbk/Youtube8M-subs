 description taste day in day out 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.500
 but not busy 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.759
 but suddenly our first became and in itself 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.680
 best yet good team and need to party 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 I think see lockers and also the most 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.489
 still teenagers and nesting told 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.320
 Flashy best to martinus more striker 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.210
 is here and always makes my real big deal 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.370
 finish it well on speed because or spinach 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.110
 maybe 40 or thirty soon 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.030
 when the fast skipper and there I am 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.350
 the best quite now and then and make it here 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.300
 last time would be technique of this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.039
 delivery was as I promised I go 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.390
 from now on the begging game came after the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.550
 is it is everything recorded for me 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.230
 to my fan landing but with one thing 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.520
 that I have to play very sliedrecht 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.480
 I have everything and are difficult 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.770
 want gameplay 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.449
 but again i promise it all 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.339
 quickly now the weather is spacious that is again 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.260
 totally fantastic and I don't know 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.090
 why I think that's so gay when 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.950
 they do not have these games 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.689
 lost three a collision it was sin 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.130
 was through we go well together as 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.900
 grab us for a few more points 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.759
 tackle me to do so by a core 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.259
 city ​​boiling the heart because even 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.030
 for previously canceled and best known stable 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.250
 its very good impact on how you players 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.170
 and was briefly injured during rush hour 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.590
 or tired ibarbo merges that could not 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.509
 play 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.729
 that's why I replaced this with the cables 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.170
 and grave saxon camp step 7 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.880
 rural heart because i thought he was one 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.650
 little bit stiff they could watch 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.090
 how that would move with the rake and them 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.320
 just proved proven on lesson on how can the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.740
 it was actually through the e-mail 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.270
 to score 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 Well I have to go back to that right away 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.689
 with his ball through and there I became 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.520
 weather or add speed to our pina 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.479
 is not the fastest way that way good 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.100
 speeded up 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.630
 that I'm actually the one integer 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.159
 but also immediately back and 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.750
 look in smaller i want you it 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.310
 not working properly and what they made 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.020
 use the bulkheads two one there 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.700
 what was pretty was your luck 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 he also immediately presses it was however 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.490
 competition that went back and forth then 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 he got his chance then i got hope 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.200
 that he again I unfortunately again 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.670
 he will get some bad luck this time 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.930
 I investigate with a goal here just come 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.550
 player and history just full 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.140
 past beyond the keeper actually to 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.940
 pretty nice and quick evening it 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.450
 aalten scores search us as the german 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.670
 to do 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.750
 nothing got the fast home that feels like that 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.430
 you would probably find if in 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.680
 look up a dictionary but it was quite 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.209
 stupid part really kiko might do it sometime 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.010
 but now look at defender 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.510
 he gets the ball around the corner like 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.190
 by getting ready for just beside 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.050
 the headlines and that they actually don't often 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.069
 I only had next and that was playful 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.510
 always just beside 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.849
 headlines and until finally costs me 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.500
 but it also points very much 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.819
 could get frustrating bitch that needs 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.380
 so it costs up 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.420
 because there or Lutheran points that really 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.130
 totally unnecessary and I want dates 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.140
 so this was right so there is 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.940
 yes come on man jg bries a bit wild 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.709
 no luck I am very lucky because 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.610
 when one gets a little less and so hope it 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.170
 can now turn around 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.120
 that again remarkably on our side 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.739
 but now come against this team 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.420
 another dessel 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.340
 great the series a tim if i'm not really 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.380
 spectacular but this time I'll go 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.760
 fiercely enterprising now really extremely much 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.560
 I also have chances to dominate him 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.160
 only got the first in the second half 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.450
 good chance 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.799
 it succeeded first goal and not 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.750
 abandoned places with paul the corner 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.090
 pastor and who also goes someone and left 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.590
 follow him where the goalkeeper then 520 score 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.450
 and that sweet is where she finally got one 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.310
 fast game play or be 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.200
 why chemistry in this episode 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.760
 two quick coulson scores eventually 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.380
 so present it in the winnings 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.269
 the three points that we certainly have one 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.739
 use to baseline is not 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.150
 very much india wick number twice 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.040
 won two equal and once 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.690
 We have lost 5 and divorce to 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.489
 our situation is changing 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.569
 of course we have to score 17 points 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.040
 to promote 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.389
 then we are there in the vision 5 so 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.280
 going on visible will soon be a new one 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.380
 much faster to rotate vision than shake 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.940
 it for large television 34 or wrinkles 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.859
 music she tried to do that something 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.060
 quicker to do I'm going to search around 25 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.950
 trying to catch up and then I'm curious 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.900
 or also keep that number 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.060
 come philosopher's stone and the way was the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.769
 definition of frustration because me too 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.569
 do not easily get angry what we consider fatter 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.700
 when really I-complex ' already close by 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.889
 bit to be angry was by none 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.510
 shock is really great goal with that 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.920
 cosmos me like really a helper marco 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.209
 of ham but then my whole one went 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.920
 defense just sleep 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.450
 can you d &amp; ad come tomorrow maybe 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.489
 coach look back but you soft that 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.440
 my defend good work we didn't step 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.970
 come out of nowhere should be a nice one 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.799
 chances tomatoes comes the goal shoot 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.239
 here theme vd did not go away well 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.560
 warriors fall again sloppily 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.359
 actually defend the one against 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.500
 with do have a chance here you see 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.000
 what rhaegar's and because it is actually 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.470
 because they are frustrated with everything without it 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.390
 was that I did n't have to look at all 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.430
 look you should n't be behind 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.040
 must come because he already said players 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.110
 were actually 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.880
 hurt but continuous fitness injuries 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.320
 the watch such a ball against a once site 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.610
 technique a payback so 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.080
 yes that is of course not about getting it done 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.090
 is just a cookie of your own dough 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.460
 I have done it just as often myself 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.140
 who of the after look at me still pff because 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.880
 yes you see devices that just head bm 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.500
 is that I really come type with them 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.910
 cheat me like christian theo who 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.100
 still just the ball to the inserter 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.930
 250 and to shoot and ok we too small 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.550
 tuft comes with a unique row at the start 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.410
 from the second half and the market is whole 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.820
 fine we will see the bottom right corner 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.530
 in the end my three five comma he 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.150
 decides the match by here at the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.680
 cow that great goal to score you the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.840
 three six come to an end is competition 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.670
 wins with 3 6 so that is a shame and 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.020
 ceiling needed but what do we do about it 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.640
 I enough our separator became our position 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.050
 so straighten up so go ahead then 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.760
 Something very worried what 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.710
 actually or left group pressure of 40 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.090
 not too like art leaves the alm enormously hard 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.830
 to check if looking for choice 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.270
 link description between fifa coins he 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.130
 I came up with the development description 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.640
 but I still have to burn eressos 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.760
 say 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.760
 bye
