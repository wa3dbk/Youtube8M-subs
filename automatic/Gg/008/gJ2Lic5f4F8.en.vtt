the second thing to cover is you'll want

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
the second thing to cover is you'll want
to<00:01:30.210> decide<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:30.930> files<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.439> want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> bring

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to decide what files you want to bring

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.039 
to decide what files you want to bring
in<00:01:32.009> I've<00:01:32.189> created<00:01:32.610> three<00:01:32.970> test<00:01:33.240> files<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
in I've created three test files as you

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.929 
in I've created three test files as you
see<00:01:34.610> these<00:01:35.610> files<00:01:35.970> actually<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.380> blank

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
see these files actually are all blank

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.010 
see these files actually are all blank
so<00:01:38.939> we're<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> create<00:01:39.600> three<00:01:39.869> different

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
so we're going to create three different

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.630 
so we're going to create three different
files<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.009> work<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.189> any<00:01:41.430> type<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
files and this can work for any type of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.710 
files and this can work for any type of
file<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> doesn't<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.600> be

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
file it doesn't just have to be

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.999 
file it doesn't just have to be
documents<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:44.090> video<00:01:45.090> files<00:01:45.509> etc<00:01:46.009> so

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
documents it can be video files etc so

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.289 
documents it can be video files etc so

I'm<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.320> situation<00:02:04.890> where<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.280> do

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I'm not in this situation where I can do

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
I'm not in this situation where I can do
that<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.700> I've<00:02:05.820> created<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.270> secondary<00:02:06.719> folder

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that so I've created a secondary folder

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
that so I've created a secondary folder
just<00:02:07.229> called<00:02:07.590> second<00:02:08.039> PC<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.670> we're<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420

just called second PC and we're going to
give<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.690> basic<00:02:10.110> idea<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.739> works

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
give you a basic idea of how this works

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.290 
give you a basic idea of how this works
so<00:02:11.099> you'll<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> copy<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.000> test

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so you'll want to copy that test

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.660 
so you'll want to copy that test
briefcase<00:02:12.810> up

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
briefcase up

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.080 
briefcase up
into<00:02:14.180> there<00:02:15.220> sorry<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.310> moved<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:16.910> let's

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
into there sorry I moved it so let's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.080 
into there sorry I moved it so let's
recopy<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.830> now<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.280> copied<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> piece

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
recopy so now we have copied the piece

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.440 
recopy so now we have copied the piece
the<00:02:20.450> file<00:02:20.720> up<00:02:20.930> there<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.940> we're<00:02:23.180> going<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the file up there so we're going to

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.120 
the file up there so we're going to
pretend<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.050> second<00:02:24.470> PC<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.130> actually

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
pretend that this second PC is actually

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.190 
pretend that this second PC is actually
on<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.190> different<00:02:28.550> PC<00:02:28.910> right<00:02:29.120> now<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.720> if<00:02:30.050> you

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
on a different PC right now so if you

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.690 
on a different PC right now so if you
open<00:02:30.350> up<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.709> briefcase<00:02:30.890> you'll<00:02:31.340> actually<00:02:31.490> be

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
open up the briefcase you'll actually be

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.400 
open up the briefcase you'll actually be
able<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.970> work<00:02:32.150> on<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.450> files<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.050> see

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
able to work on the files that you see

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.010 
able to work on the files that you see
so<00:02:34.310> there's<00:02:34.640> our<00:02:34.790> text<00:02:35.060> dock<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.570> as<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.780> see

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
so there's our text dock and as you see

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.500 
so there's our text dock and as you see
they're<00:02:36.470> basically<00:02:37.070> blank<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.180> we're<00:02:38.420> going

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
they're basically blank so we're going

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.920 
they're basically blank so we're going
to<00:02:38.570> actually<00:02:38.780> pretend<00:02:39.260> we're<00:02:39.440> working<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:39.950> it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
we've worked on the file at work or

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.870 
we've worked on the file at work or
whatever<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.650> now<00:02:46.160> we're<00:02:46.310> going<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.489> save<00:02:46.730> the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.060 
you would just have to hook the drive
back<00:03:05.060> up<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.630> then<00:03:06.200> going<00:03:06.500> into<00:03:06.800> this
