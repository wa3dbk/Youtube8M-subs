00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
really haven't had to try too hard to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.700 
really haven't had to try too hard to
get<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.830> point<00:00:20.449> so<00:00:21.449> let's<00:00:21.869> get<00:00:24.500> as<00:00:25.500> I've

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
get to this point so let's get as I've

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.769 
get to this point so let's get as I've
been<00:00:25.859> doing<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.279> pretty<00:00:26.369> much<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.820> along<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
been doing it pretty much all along the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.919 
been doing it pretty much all along the
two<00:00:28.410> maelstroms<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.340> cryptid<00:00:29.939> pretty<00:00:30.539> solid

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
two maelstroms and cryptid pretty solid

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.280 
two maelstroms and cryptid pretty solid
combination<00:00:31.700> even<00:00:32.700> though<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.290> maelstroms

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
combination even though the maelstroms

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
combination even though the maelstroms
actually<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.680> more<00:00:34.890> damage<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.489> figured

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
actually do more damage I just figured

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.389 
actually do more damage I just figured
since<00:00:36.090> encrypted<00:00:37.050> has<00:00:37.380> more<00:00:37.739> defense<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
since encrypted has more defense and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.560 
since encrypted has more defense and
gives<00:00:38.550> me<00:00:38.700> more<00:00:38.879> time<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.390> him<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:42.090> will

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
gives me more time with him and I will

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
gives me more time with him and I will
