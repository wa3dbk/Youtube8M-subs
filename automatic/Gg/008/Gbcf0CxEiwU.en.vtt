00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.650
 this equipment has reached our hands 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.579
 thanks to smart but if you look for this other 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.350
 device 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.870
 do not forget to visit www.sprint.com 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.370
 the friends welcome to petrolia 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.680
 new chapter in today's video 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.949
 we have the nike class filven 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.350
 this is basically an ulcer that 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.140
 we can use to measure 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.059
 our performance at the time of 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.980
 supposed to play sports or for 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.200
 example in the case that we are walking 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.420
 the number of steps that we are taking the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.580
 speed and the calories that we are 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.570
 burning etcetera there are applications 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.030
 for smartphones with such as runkeeper 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.240
 or also the same nike application 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.100
 that allow us to use this but the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.110
 problem of it is that we have to 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.360
 always use our smartphone should 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.100
 be always on and of course 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.130
 we are consuming a lot of 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.810
 batteries therefore this is an option the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.509
 true much simpler of course 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.540
 you can connect to your smartphone either 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.060
 in the case of 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.430
 I do have an application 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.290
 specific to be able to do it and in the 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.480
 Android case there are applications of 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.980
 third parties that allow us to measure the 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.630
 performance and also the application of 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.390
 live which is also now 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.160
 available for android then let's 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.050
 see what we find first thing 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.870
 that we find of course that is the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.300
 nike state see that this is the band that 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.729
 we are going to use and that is going to 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.570
 measure all the different parameters 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.910
 that we said this account with a port or 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.070
 the option to connect it to a usb port 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.869
 that connects to our computer and 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.540
 there we can download all the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.880
 data that the band gives us after 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.510
 have a workout or by 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.990
 example we can also fix in this 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.200
 case goals based on walking and with the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.540
 amount of calories that we want to lower 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.230
 here we have inside the accessories 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 This is to be able to enlarge the band 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.960
 in case it is too small to 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.240
 us and this is 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.790
 the tool that we use to be able 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.040
 take out and be able to place this part 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.800
 additional of course we have the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.320
 USB cable that connects directly to 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.350
 the band and then we connect it to our 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.870
 computer we enter the site of no 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.020
 there class we create a profile if it is that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.760
 we do not have one before and after 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.970
 we can start using them 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.890
 good and how it works on it and what is the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.070
 advantage for example to use 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.960
 applications like nike class and others that 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.600
 allow us in our smartphone 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.880
 basically do the same as this one me 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.920
 I think the difference is based on that 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.620
 applications such as in motion 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.870
 xo there are no classes and so on 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.860
 we use only when we are going to do 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.780
 sports in this case this band is something 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.180
 that reminds us always that we should 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.700
 maintain an active life and that in everything 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.470
 moment will tell us how many 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.210
 example how much have we walked how many 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.210
 We have worn calories and so on 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.370
 then it is an excellent reminder in 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.489
 every moment of what 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.120
 we must have an active life 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.980
 basically it is measured based on different 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.799
 has four different modes the first 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.930
 which is the same as it tells us how much 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.170
 we take from our daily goal we 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.019
 we can say how all this is the same is 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.209
 what we want to do 2000 for 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.450
 a relatively passive life at 3,000 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.760
 for more active and four thousand for there 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.549
 high performance and on the bottom 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.819
 As you can see, it shows us how much 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.099
 we take from that final goal the following 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.590
 option is calories tells us how many 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.380
 calories we have spent so far 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.590
 the next how many steps we have taken and 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.380
 finally it is the time that allows us 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.539
 use it as if it were a clock in 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.630
 conclusion that we can say about the nike 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.520
 class and opel the truth is that it works 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.639
 pretty good of course we can not 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.410
 ask it to be 100 100 percent accurate 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.020
 when measuring for example the 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.720
 number of steps we have taken in 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.310
 some cases without measure a little more or 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.470
 a little less but the truth 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.240
 pretty small margins in terms 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.450
 general this is used as a 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.540
 reference and also as an excellent 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.910
 option for certain ways to encourage us 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.280
 that day to day we have a life 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.720
 much more active so if you guys 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.000
 They are from those people who like 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.590
 the didactic or who are thinking in 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.780
 have a much more active life and in 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.710
 have some way of being able to measure 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.320
 constantly that performance is this 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.390
 a very good option to consider well 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.740
 that this has been the complete analysis of 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.740
 the nike brass and drop
