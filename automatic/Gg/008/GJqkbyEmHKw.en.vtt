00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
such so it's actually now turned into a

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.880 
such so it's actually now turned into a
complete<00:01:29.650> build<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.300> think<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:32.470> well

especially the backup power is going to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.150 
especially the backup power is going to
be<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.480> first<00:01:34.690> half<00:01:34.960> like<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:35.770> think<00:01:35.950> I'm<00:01:36.070> gonna
