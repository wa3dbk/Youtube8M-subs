okay here's a piece of metal that I have
made<00:00:09.050> to<00:00:10.050> fit<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:10.590> there<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> end

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
made to fit up in there this is the end

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.880 
made to fit up in there this is the end
of<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.349> front<00:00:13.349> spring<00:00:14.330> shackle<00:00:15.330> mount<00:00:15.890> and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
of the front spring shackle mount and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.260 
of the front spring shackle mount and
this<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.190> where<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> new<00:00:17.609> piece<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.970> metal

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
this is where the new piece of metal

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.939 
this is where the new piece of metal
will<00:00:18.420> go<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> go<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.710> here

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
will go and I'm going to go up in here

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.910 
will go and I'm going to go up in here
and<00:00:20.010> put<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> mark<00:00:20.720> when<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.109> hole<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and put a mark when that hole is and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.330 
and put a mark when that hole is and
drill<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.730> tap<00:00:23.779> that<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.140> then<00:00:25.859> I'll<00:00:25.980> spot

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
drill and tap that and then I'll spot

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.589 
drill and tap that and then I'll spot
weld<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.000> place<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:29.189> then<00:00:29.460> drop<00:00:30.359> my

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
weld this in place and then drop my

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
weld this in place and then drop my
steering<00:00:30.990> box<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.529> weld<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> rest<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
steering box and weld it the rest of the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
steering box and weld it the rest of the
way<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.759> might<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.120> careful<00:00:33.360> not<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.989> weld<00:00:34.200> up

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
way I might be careful not to weld up

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
way I might be careful not to weld up
here<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.670> these<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:36.120> actually<00:00:36.510> kind<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
here because these two actually kind of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.350 
here because these two actually kind of
butt<00:00:36.960> together<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:41.149> although<00:00:42.149> I'm

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
butt together right here although I'm

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.970 
butt together right here although I'm
wondering<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.989> did<00:00:43.200> leave<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.739> gap

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
wondering if I did leave a little gap

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
wondering if I did leave a little gap
here<00:00:44.309> where<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.520> leave<00:00:44.820> me<00:00:44.969> some<00:00:45.180> room<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
here where that leave me some room to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.119 
here where that leave me some room to
put<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> bead<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.050> weld<00:00:46.289> across<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> bottom

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
put a bead of weld across the bottom

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.340 
put a bead of weld across the bottom
there<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:48.180> gonna<00:00:48.390> want<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> weld<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.140> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
there I'm gonna want to weld up this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.400 
there I'm gonna want to weld up this
side<00:00:49.680> part<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.780> looked<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.140> there's<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
side part here it looked like there's a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.930 
side part here it looked like there's a
little<00:00:52.559> bit<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> crack<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> side<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
little bit of a crack in the side of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.540 
little bit of a crack in the side of
this<00:00:54.149> frame<00:00:54.449> maybe<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.800> took<00:00:56.370> this

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
this frame maybe that if I took this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
this frame maybe that if I took this
thing<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.440> pulled<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> out<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.949> hair<00:01:00.140> like

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
thing and pulled it out of hair like

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.599 
thing and pulled it out of hair like
welded<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> would

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
welded it right out here that would

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.160 
welded it right out here that would
leave<00:01:02.789> me<00:01:02.820> enough<00:01:03.120> room<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> weld<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.930> little

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
leave me enough room to weld a little

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.080 
leave me enough room to weld a little
piece<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.559> mount<00:01:04.830> down<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> side<00:01:05.460> too<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
piece of a mount down the side too I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
piece of a mount down the side too I
might<00:01:06.840> take<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.080> grinder<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.010> clean<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.490> up

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
might take my grinder and clean this up

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.080 
might take my grinder and clean this up
real<00:01:08.970> good<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:10.369> cut<00:01:11.369> me<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.760> piece<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
real good and cut me a little piece of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.730 
real good and cut me a little piece of
metal<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.720> also<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> side

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
metal that I can also use as a side

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.850 
metal that I can also use as a side
mount<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.780> may<00:01:15.990> also<00:01:16.170> move

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
mount right there and I may also move

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.600 
mount right there and I may also move
this<00:01:17.100> back<00:01:18.110> enough<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> give<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.860> well<00:01:20.189> across

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
this back enough to give a well across

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.020 
this back enough to give a well across
the<00:01:20.790> front<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.270> too

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
the front of that too

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.310 
the front of that too
and<00:01:22.960> yes<00:01:23.080> that<00:01:23.290> would<00:01:23.410> help<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.640> work<00:01:25.320> all

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
and yes that would help and work all

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.590 
and yes that would help and work all
right<00:01:26.410> I'm<00:01:26.680> still<00:01:27.240> still<00:01:28.240> working<00:01:28.480> out<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
right I'm still still working out the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:46.020 
right I'm still still working out the
details<00:01:28.810> on<00:01:29.260> that<00:01:31.560> okay<00:01:43.110> always<00:01:44.850> drill<00:01:45.850> that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
details on that okay always drill that

00:01:46.030 --> 00:02:49.190 
details on that okay always drill that
out<00:01:46.200> tap<00:01:47.200> it

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.510 

all<00:02:50.200> right<00:02:50.380> what<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.530> did<00:02:50.800> was<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.010> drilled<00:02:51.370> out

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
all right what I did was I drilled out

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.180 
all right what I did was I drilled out
the<00:02:51.550> hole<00:02:51.849> this<00:02:52.330> is<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.680> kind<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:53.860> call<00:02:54.040> this

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
the hole this is a kind of you call this

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.100 
the hole this is a kind of you call this
a<00:02:54.250> tap<00:02:54.580> or<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.880> dive<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:55.330> basically<00:02:55.750> cuts

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
a tap or a dive but basically cuts

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.990 
a tap or a dive but basically cuts
threads<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.830> hole<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.700> bolt

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
threads in the hole so that this bolt

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.760 
threads in the hole so that this bolt
that<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.300> have<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.540> my<00:02:58.660> pocket<00:02:58.840> would<00:02:59.170> fit<00:02:59.380> in

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
that I have in my pocket would fit in

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.160 
that I have in my pocket would fit in
then<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:01.000> had<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.600> make<00:03:01.690> sure<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.900> had<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.080> right

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
then I had to make sure I had the right

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.600 
then I had to make sure I had the right
size<00:03:02.530> drill<00:03:02.950> here's<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.400> bowl<00:03:05.250> with<00:03:06.250> my<00:03:06.400> old

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
size drill here's the bowl with my old

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.460 
size drill here's the bowl with my old
tired<00:03:07.180> eyes<00:03:07.450> sometimes<00:03:08.019> it's<00:03:08.170> hard<00:03:08.319> to<00:03:08.380> tell

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
tired eyes sometimes it's hard to tell

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.250 
tired eyes sometimes it's hard to tell
exactly<00:03:08.739> what's<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.340> right<00:03:09.519> size<00:03:09.790> bit<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.510> it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
exactly what's the right size bit so it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.020 
exactly what's the right size bit so it
started<00:03:11.650> small<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.160> worked<00:03:12.310> my<00:03:12.459> way<00:03:12.610> up<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:12.970> I

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
started small and worked my way up so I

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.729 
started small and worked my way up so I
found<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.420> right<00:03:13.569> size<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.170> could<00:03:14.350> tell<00:03:14.530> by

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
found the right size and I could tell by

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.890 
found the right size and I could tell by
the<00:03:14.769> way<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.160> felt<00:03:15.519> if<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.450> get<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.720> too

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
the way this felt if you get it too

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.000 
the way this felt if you get it too
tight<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.530> you're<00:03:17.650> putting<00:03:17.830> too<00:03:17.980> much

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
tight and you're putting too much

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.470 
tight and you're putting too much
pressure<00:03:18.160> on<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.880> can<00:03:19.000> break<00:03:19.180> one<00:03:19.390> of

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
pressure on that you can break one of

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.610 
pressure on that you can break one of
these<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.870> it's<00:03:19.959> just<00:03:20.080> like<00:03:20.200> breaking<00:03:20.470> a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
these and it's just like breaking a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.320 
these and it's just like breaking a
drill<00:03:21.040> bit<00:03:21.250> these<00:03:21.489> things<00:03:21.700> are<00:03:21.819> really<00:03:22.000> hard

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
drill bit these things are really hard

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.210 
drill bit these things are really hard
once<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.319> break<00:03:23.500> one<00:03:23.650> might<00:03:23.890> as<00:03:23.950> well<00:03:24.040> throw

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
once you break one might as well throw

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.550 
once you break one might as well throw
the<00:03:24.400> metal<00:03:24.640> away<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:26.080> then<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.470> go

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
the metal away and then you have to go

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.690 
the metal away and then you have to go
to<00:03:26.620> store<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:26.890> get<00:03:27.040> another<00:03:27.069> one<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.610> then

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
to store and get another one and then

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.949 
to store and get another one and then
you<00:03:27.819> have<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.030> drill<00:03:28.180> another<00:03:28.209> hole<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.750> start

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
you have to drill another hole and start

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.840 
you have to drill another hole and start
all<00:03:29.080> over<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:29.680> rather<00:03:30.010> than<00:03:30.220> do<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.370> when<00:03:30.819> I

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
all over so rather than do that when I

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.309 
all over so rather than do that when I
felt<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.269> pressure<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.720> just<00:03:31.989> went<00:03:32.170> through<00:03:32.200> a

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
felt the pressure I just went through a

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.949 
felt the pressure I just went through a
little<00:03:32.470> bit<00:03:32.650> larger<00:03:33.250> side<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.880> till<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.810> got

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
little bit larger side of it till I got

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.509 
little bit larger side of it till I got
one<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.290> worked<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:35.920> what<00:03:36.160> I'm<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.400> do

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
one that worked so what I'm going to do

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.970 
one that worked so what I'm going to do
now<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.850> I'll<00:03:37.000> spin<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.480> out<00:03:37.750> spin<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.799> bolt

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
now is I'll spin that out spin the bolt

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.410 
now is I'll spin that out spin the bolt
into<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.510> put<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.630> up<00:03:40.810> under<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:42.090> Jeep<00:03:43.090> there

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
into it put that up under the Jeep there

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.190 
into it put that up under the Jeep there
put<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.690> bolt<00:03:43.930> up<00:03:44.140> through<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.470> brace<00:03:45.069> and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
put a bolt up through that brace and

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.110 
put a bolt up through that brace and
sort<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.290> wedge<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.130> place<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:48.700> then<00:03:48.790> spot

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
sort of wedge it in place and then spot

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.180 
sort of wedge it in place and then spot
weld<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.810> then<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.140> can<00:03:50.590> drop<00:03:50.829> down<00:03:51.010> that

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
weld it and then I can drop down that

00:03:51.190 --> 00:04:12.670 
weld it and then I can drop down that
steering<00:03:51.579> box<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.269> well<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.989> in<00:03:53.109> there<00:03:53.290> good
