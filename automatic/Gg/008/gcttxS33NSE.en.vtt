hey<00:00:01.199> people<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:02.490> my<00:00:02.610> teacher<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:03.300> theory

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hey people this is my teacher for theory

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.280 
hey people this is my teacher for theory
and<00:00:04.730> this<00:00:05.730> report<00:00:06.120> start<00:00:06.450> I'm<00:00:06.690> not<00:00:06.930> calling

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
and this report start I'm not calling

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.190 
and this report start I'm not calling
anybody<00:00:08.090> anybody's<00:00:09.090> theory<00:00:09.389> wrong<00:00:09.690> but<00:00:10.080> this

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
anybody anybody's theory wrong but this

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.180 
anybody anybody's theory wrong but this
is<00:00:10.380> just<00:00:10.410> what<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.389> all<00:00:12.389> right<00:00:12.480> look<00:00:12.660> into<00:00:13.049> it

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
is just what I all right look into it

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.580 
is just what I all right look into it
okay<00:00:14.190> well<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.330> not<00:00:15.480> gonna<00:00:15.660> go<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.080> try<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.379> it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
okay well I'm not gonna go to try for it

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.859 
okay well I'm not gonna go to try for it
I'm<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:16.859> gonna<00:00:17.130> go<00:00:17.460> straight<00:00:18.180> tension<00:00:18.660> force

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
I'm just gonna go straight tension force

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.550 
I'm just gonna go straight tension force
on<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> detective<00:00:21.449> potential<00:00:22.170> force<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
on you so detective potential force is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.609 
on you so detective potential force is
basically<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.939> idea<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.420> charge<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.019> hf

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
basically the idea of charge for hf

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.980 
basically the idea of charge for hf
would<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.949> one<00:00:26.189> triangle<00:00:26.580> there's<00:00:27.269> four<00:00:27.660> parts

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
would be one triangle there's four parts

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.900 
would be one triangle there's four parts
of<00:00:28.080> triangle<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:30.019> even<00:00:31.019> though<00:00:31.910> officially

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
of triangle and even though officially

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.950 
of triangle and even though officially
this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.300> been<00:00:33.890> declined<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:36.000> possible<00:00:36.540> like

make these mistakes well my first thing
is<00:00:53.930> immense<00:00:54.930> cap<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
is immense cap you see all in the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.549 
is immense cap you see all in the
introduction<00:00:59.010> issue<00:00:59.309> Gustav<00:01:00.410> holding<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
introduction issue Gustav holding the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
introduction issue Gustav holding the
course<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.940> ball<00:01:03.260> typically<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.210> above<00:01:06.210> them

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
course the ball typically and above them

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.670 
course the ball typically and above them
you<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.439> triangle<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:09.090> triangle

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
you see this triangle it's one triangle

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.910 
you see this triangle it's one triangle
people<00:01:10.680> think<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.350> one<00:01:13.350> part<00:01:13.680> or

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
people think that it is the one part or

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
people think that it is the one part or
the<00:01:14.580> missing<00:01:14.939> part<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> tension<00:01:15.780> force<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the missing part of the tension force I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.429 
the missing part of the tension force I
don't<00:01:17.220> believe<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.930> think<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
don't believe this as you think it is

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.160 
don't believe this as you think it is
the<00:01:19.890> tetra<00:01:20.220> force<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.210> whole<00:01:21.450> chart<00:01:21.990> for

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the tetra force like the whole chart for

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
the tetra force like the whole chart for
unification<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.400> these<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.909> whole

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
unification think are these the whole

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.130 
unification think are these the whole
thing<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.939> think<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.750> while

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
thing this is what I think because while

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.940 
thing this is what I think because while
they<00:01:29.030> worship<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.270> piece<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
they worship one piece you know and the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.069 
they worship one piece you know and the
rest<00:01:32.130> assured<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:32.820> worship<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.600> whole<00:01:33.780> damn

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
rest assured they worship the whole damn

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.190 
rest assured they worship the whole damn
thing<00:01:34.409> doesn't<00:01:35.400> make<00:01:35.670> much<00:01:35.850> sense<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.180> me<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
thing doesn't make much sense to me so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.390 
thing doesn't make much sense to me so
I'm<00:01:37.350> saying<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> whole<00:01:38.130> thing<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
I'm saying it's a whole thing and to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.359 
I'm saying it's a whole thing and to
support<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.090> even<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.250> something<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
support this even more something that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.149 
support this even more something that

um on her dress when she was a kid she
had<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> whole<00:01:55.170> Triforce<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.100> don't

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
had not the whole Triforce you don't

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
had not the whole Triforce you don't
landline<00:01:58.610> i'm<00:01:59.610> not<00:02:00.119> sure<00:02:00.450> i<00:02:00.780> forgot<00:02:01.229> i<00:02:01.469> doubt

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
landline i'm not sure i forgot i doubt

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.360 
landline i'm not sure i forgot i doubt
look<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.100> again

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
look that up again

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.520 
look that up again
anyways<00:02:03.640> what<00:02:03.970> I<00:02:04.240> know<00:02:04.360> how<00:02:04.810> he<00:02:04.870> sure<00:02:05.170> they

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
anyways what I know how he sure they

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.890 
anyways what I know how he sure they
show<00:02:05.860> four<00:02:06.280> pieces<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:07.180> definition<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.660> four

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
show four pieces the definition of four

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.850 
show four pieces the definition of four
pieces<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:08.979> but<00:02:09.790> they<00:02:09.940> changed<00:02:10.180> it<00:02:10.590> due<00:02:11.590> to

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
pieces so but they changed it due to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
pieces so but they changed it due to
that<00:02:12.190> finding<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.150> these<00:02:13.450> dials<00:02:14.140> fans<00:02:14.440> made

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
that finding that these dials fans made

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.590 
that finding that these dials fans made
so<00:02:16.230> amazing<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.380> leave<00:02:18.040> themselves<00:02:18.190> open<00:02:18.600> open

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
so amazing so leave themselves open open

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.450 
so amazing so leave themselves open open
oh<00:02:19.840> yeah<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:20.740> thing<00:02:20.770> about<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.190> minish<00:02:21.430> cap

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
oh yeah one thing about the minish cap

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.350 
oh yeah one thing about the minish cap
with<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.060> Gustav<00:02:22.480> thing<00:02:22.750> if<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:24.160> see<00:02:24.430> if<00:02:25.180> you

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
with that Gustav thing if you see if you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.820 
with that Gustav thing if you see if you
look<00:02:25.510> at<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> Triforce<00:02:26.370> are<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:29.260> triangles

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
look at the Triforce are one triangles

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.000 
look at the Triforce are one triangles
turn<00:02:30.790> upside<00:02:31.390> down<00:02:31.440> another<00:02:32.440> one<00:02:32.680> let's<00:02:32.920> say

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
turn upside down another one let's say

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.520 
turn upside down another one let's say
you<00:02:33.070> copy<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.820> then<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.840> try<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.050> offside

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
you copy it and then you try to offside

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.820 
you copy it and then you try to offside
down<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:36.370> will<00:02:36.520> fit<00:02:36.700> perfectly<00:02:37.830> the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
down that will fit perfectly the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.190 
down that will fit perfectly the
triangle<00:02:39.520> that's<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.540> picture<00:02:40.900> will<00:02:41.080> do

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
triangle that's in the picture will do

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.140 
triangle that's in the picture will do
stuff<00:02:41.530> that's<00:02:42.810> by<00:02:43.810> turned<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.890> normally<00:02:45.760> now

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
stuff that's by turned like normally now

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.770 
stuff that's by turned like normally now
also<00:02:46.360> down<00:02:46.740> normally<00:02:47.740> that's<00:02:48.250> why<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.910> think

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
also down normally that's why I think

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.780 
also down normally that's why I think
that<00:02:50.080> is<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.290> treasure<00:02:50.680> Force<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.400> piece

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
that is the treasure Force not a piece

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.470 
that is the treasure Force not a piece
of<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.570> that<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.700> isn't<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.060> upside

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
of it like that is it isn't it upside

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.290 
of it like that is it isn't it upside
down<00:02:55.510> Oh<00:02:59.970> another<00:03:00.970> thing<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.450> well<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:03.300> thing

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
down Oh another thing is well the thing

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.370 
down Oh another thing is well the thing
about<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:05.710> minish<00:03:06.010> cap<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.840> or<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.080> in<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
about the minish cap is or it is in the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.930 
about the minish cap is or it is in the
timeline<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:09.570> believe<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.930> be<00:03:10.959> first<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
timeline I believe it to be first and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.330 
timeline I believe it to be first and
I'm<00:03:12.940> going<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.150> make<00:03:13.209> another<00:03:13.690> video

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
I'm going to make another video

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.050 
I'm going to make another video
explaining<00:03:15.340> why<00:03:15.700> because<00:03:16.239> first<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:18.060> best

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
explaining why because first but best

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.979 
explaining why because first but best
thing<00:03:19.209> about<00:03:19.330> this<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.560> first<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:22.750> it

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
thing about this it is first that it

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.770 
thing about this it is first that it
makes<00:03:23.290> sense<00:03:23.530> because<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:25.060> tetra<00:03:25.360> force<00:03:25.600> is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
makes sense because the tetra force is

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.870 
makes sense because the tetra force is
not<00:03:26.290> talked<00:03:26.770> about<00:03:26.920> i'm<00:03:27.220> at<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.459> life<00:03:27.610> force

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
not talked about i'm at the life force

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.870 
not talked about i'm at the life force
it's<00:03:28.060> not<00:03:28.180> talked<00:03:28.480> about<00:03:28.600> at<00:03:29.320> any<00:03:29.620> other<00:03:30.040> game

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
it's not talked about at any other game

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.380 
it's not talked about at any other game
in<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.150> series<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:34.030> would<00:03:34.180> make<00:03:34.209> sense

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
in the series so it would make sense

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.449 
in the series so it would make sense
with<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.500> other<00:03:35.770> things<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:36.160> are<00:03:36.340> not

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
with the other things that are not

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.350 
with the other things that are not
mentioned<00:03:36.760> in<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.989> arm<00:03:38.880> what's<00:03:39.880> called<00:03:40.180> young

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
mentioned in the arm what's called young

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.520 
mentioned in the arm what's called young
and<00:03:41.140> like<00:03:42.040> in<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.090> middle<00:03:43.239> cap<00:03:43.510> again<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.170> up

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
and like in the middle cap again and up

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.710 
and like in the middle cap again and up
and<00:03:44.709> all<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.220> but<00:03:45.430> make<00:03:45.700> no<00:03:45.730> avail<00:03:46.180> about<00:03:46.480> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
and all that but make no avail about the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.949 
and all that but make no avail about the
men<00:03:46.900> scrap<00:03:47.170> being<00:03:47.410> first<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.840> my

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
men scrap being first this is my

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.830 
men scrap being first this is my
personal<00:03:50.170> feeling<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:52.030> seems<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.690> make

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
personal feeling and it seems to make
