the u.s. RSA's program I just got this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.219 
the u.s. RSA's program I just got this
free<00:01:58.860> set<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.430> gamma<00:01:59.759> T<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.360> T<00:02:00.540> touch<00:02:00.840> okay

this<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.180> newest<00:02:03.180> string<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.020> gamma<00:02:04.409> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
this is the newest string that gamma is

this is the newest string that gamma is
putting<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> marketplace<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.790> again

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
putting out on the marketplace so again

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.359 
putting out on the marketplace so again
it's<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> packet<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.069> not

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it's in the packet here so I have not

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.749 
it's in the packet here so I have not
tested<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.110> play<00:02:10.110> tested

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
so I can't really comment about it from

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.080 
so I can't really comment about it from
that<00:02:12.590> perspective<00:02:13.010> but<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:13.849> want<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.030> let

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
that perspective but I just want to let

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.789 
that perspective but I just want to let
you<00:02:14.299> know<00:02:14.330> about<00:02:14.780> new<00:02:15.049> strings<00:02:15.439> that<00:02:15.560> are<00:02:15.650> in

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
you know about new strings that are in

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.140 
you know about new strings that are in
entering<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> market<00:02:16.579> okay<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:18.349> one<00:02:18.680> is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
entering the market okay and this one is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.990 
entering the market okay and this one is
in<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.360> TNT<00:02:20.870> series<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.620> gamma<00:02:21.890> has<00:02:22.189> this<00:02:22.730> is

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
in the TNT series the gamma has this is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.470 
in the TNT series the gamma has this is
the<00:02:23.150> first<00:02:23.480> one<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.400> multifilament<00:02:26.120> as

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
the first one that is a multifilament as

you can see here on the packaging you

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.640 
you can see here on the packaging you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
little bit more comfortable from what I

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.770 
little bit more comfortable from what I
understand<00:03:01.430> about<00:03:01.489> this<00:03:01.760> string<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.420> believe

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
understand about this string I believe

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.470 
understand about this string I believe
it<00:03:02.930> retails<00:03:03.470> for<00:03:03.709> about<00:03:04.099> eighteen<00:03:04.909> nineteen

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
it retails for about eighteen nineteen

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.199 
it retails for about eighteen nineteen
dollars<00:03:05.720> per<00:03:06.200> set<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.220> certainly<00:03:07.819> not

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
dollars per set so it is certainly not

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.129 
dollars per set so it is certainly not
an<00:03:08.510> inexpensive<00:03:10.030> multifilament<00:03:11.030> string<00:03:11.780> it's

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
an inexpensive multifilament string it's

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.449 
an inexpensive multifilament string it's
definitely<00:03:12.560> up<00:03:12.650> there<00:03:12.680> in<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.010> range<00:03:13.220> with

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
definitely up there in the range with

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.409 
definitely up there in the range with

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:18.789 
len x 1 x fish tecnifibre or baba la XL
power<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.989> some<00:03:18.109> of<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:18.230> high-end

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
power and some of the high-end

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.189 
power and some of the high-end
multifilament<00:03:19.340> but<00:03:20.030> gamma<00:03:20.720> makes<00:03:20.989> good

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
multifilament but gamma makes good

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.559 
multifilament but gamma makes good
strings<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.859> so<00:03:22.099> maybe<00:03:22.669> maybe<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.329> worth

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
strings and so maybe maybe it is worth

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.629 
strings and so maybe maybe it is worth
it<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.900> give<00:03:24.169> it<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.379> try<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:24.859> just<00:03:25.040> wanted<00:03:25.549> to

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
it to give it a try so just wanted to

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.000 
it to give it a try so just wanted to
let<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:25.970> know<00:03:26.150> about<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.930> one<00:03:27.230> again<00:03:27.859> this

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
let you know about that one again this

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.949 
let you know about that one again this
is<00:03:28.160> something<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.549> got<00:03:28.760> from<00:03:28.790> pre<00:03:29.780> spring

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
that comfort category its natural gut so

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.570 
that comfort category its natural gut so

if you throw that out of the equation

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.580 
if you throw that out of the equation
that<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.330> all<00:05:17.449> the<00:05:17.479> strings<00:05:17.840> of<00:05:17.930> us<00:05:18.199> are<00:05:18.379> I<00:05:18.409> say

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
that of all the strings of us are I say

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.050 
that of all the strings of us are I say
has<00:05:18.710> tested<00:05:19.099> over<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.400> years<00:05:19.580> this<00:05:19.729> is<00:05:19.909> the

has tested over the years this is the

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.180

number two synthetic string from a
comfort<00:05:25.639> perspective<00:05:26.419> okay<00:05:27.259> so<00:05:27.319> maybe

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
comfort perspective okay so maybe

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.459

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.360 
very high multifilament about eighteen
ninety-nine<00:05:38.479> percent<00:05:38.840> I<00:05:39.229> believe<00:05:39.889> that<00:05:39.919> this

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
ninety-nine percent I believe that this

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.640 
ninety-nine percent I believe that this
mantis<00:05:40.909> trim<00:05:41.210> is<00:05:41.360> going<00:05:41.539> to<00:05:41.599> retail<00:05:42.050> in<00:05:42.380> the

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
mantis trim is going to retail in the

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.119 
mantis trim is going to retail in the
maybe<00:05:43.490> five<00:05:44.000> to<00:05:44.479> eight<00:05:45.169> nine<00:05:45.500> dollar<00:05:45.830> range

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
maybe five to eight nine dollar range

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.580 
maybe five to eight nine dollar range
percent<00:05:46.849> so<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.479> lot<00:05:47.900> cheaper<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:48.289> lot<00:05:48.440> more

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
percent so a lot cheaper a lot more

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.909 
percent so a lot cheaper a lot more
affordable<00:05:49.099> so<00:05:49.430> I've<00:05:50.360> already<00:05:50.750> sent<00:05:51.560> in<00:05:51.740> my

affordable so I've already sent in my

anywhere from two weeks to six weeks I

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.649 
anywhere from two weeks to six weeks I

should have a sample of this mantis

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.800 
should have a sample of this mantis
comfort<00:06:00.110> synthetic<00:06:00.650> and<00:06:01.120> I'll<00:06:02.120> either<00:06:02.539> play

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
comfort synthetic and I'll either play

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.990 
comfort synthetic and I'll either play
test<00:06:03.080> it<00:06:03.259> myself<00:06:03.379> or<00:06:04.009> maybe<00:06:04.279> give<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:04.729> to<00:06:04.849> one

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
test it myself or maybe give it to one

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.850 
test it myself or maybe give it to one
of<00:06:05.060> my<00:06:05.180> clients<00:06:05.389> for<00:06:05.779> free<00:06:06.050> but<00:06:06.289> then<00:06:06.349> ask<00:06:06.680> some

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
of my clients for free but then ask some

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.800 
of my clients for free but then ask some
of<00:06:06.889> their<00:06:07.039> feedback<00:06:07.279> so<00:06:07.729> hopefully<00:06:08.629> I<00:06:08.690> can
