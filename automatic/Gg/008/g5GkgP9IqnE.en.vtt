will likely just be skirting the
overlord<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.870> about<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.379> giving<00:00:46.950> him

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
overlord to just about here giving him

overlord to just about here giving him
just<00:00:47.100> enough<00:00:47.520> vision<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> edge<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
just enough vision to see the edge of

just enough vision to see the edge of
the<00:00:49.469> command<00:00:49.800> center<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.610> there

the command center and if it's not there

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.340 
the command center and if it's not there
he<00:00:51.030> should<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.360> actually<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.840> rerouting

this map and your Terran opponent were

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
this map and your Terran opponent were
to<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.770> spawning<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.400> near<00:01:11.670> position<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
to be spawning in that near position you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.969 
to be spawning in that near position you
can<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.900> were<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> spawn<00:01:13.590> here<00:01:13.830> how

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
can see if you were to spawn here how

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.590 
can see if you were to spawn here how
close<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> ground<00:01:14.850> distance<00:01:15.210> would<00:01:15.420> be

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
close that ground distance would be

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300 
close that ground distance would be
things<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.560> racks<00:01:16.770> early<00:01:17.100> pressure

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
things like to racks early pressure

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
things like to racks early pressure
could<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.640> incredibly<00:01:18.000> dangerous<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.840> we

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
coming out hatch first so I mentioned if

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.139

the<00:01:45.509> Terran<00:01:45.810> player<00:01:45.930> were<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.380> spawn<00:01:46.909> in<00:01:47.909> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the Terran player were to spawn in that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
the Terran player were to spawn in that
near<00:01:48.390> position<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> could<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.409> really

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.170

really<00:01:49.920> dangerous<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> fact<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
really dangerous but the fact that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.179 
really dangerous but the fact that
because<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.899> proxying<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.740> equally

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
because of you is proxying it as equally

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.340 
because of you is proxying it as equally
