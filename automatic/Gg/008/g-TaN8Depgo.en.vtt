pegged<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> team<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.280> sucks<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:12.000> I'm

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
pegged as a team that sucks but I'm

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.210 
pegged as a team that sucks but I'm
thinking<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.780> maybe<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.350> don't<00:01:13.439> quite<00:01:13.890> suck

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
thinking now maybe they don't quite suck

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
thinking now maybe they don't quite suck
a<00:01:14.430> ton<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.270> sort<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.750> suck<00:01:15.960> now<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> don't

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
a ton they they sort of suck now I don't

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.960 
a ton they they sort of suck now I don't
thinking<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.619> don't<00:01:17.100> suck<00:01:17.310> ass<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.759> would

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
thinking they don't suck ass I would

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.210 
thinking they don't suck ass I would
more<00:01:18.119> categorize<00:01:18.720> them<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.080> sort<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> sucking

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
more categorize them as sort of sucking

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.460 
more categorize them as sort of sucking
I<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.299> Derek<00:01:21.600> Carr<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.990> quarterback

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
not a very reliable guy so I guess all

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
not a very reliable guy so I guess all
things<00:01:39.000> considered<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.810> might<00:01:40.020> lead<00:01:40.259> towards

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
hanging a little low so maybe you lean

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.130 
hanging a little low so maybe you lean
towards<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> over-40<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> below<00:01:46.049> I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.240 
I do think yeah with Derek Carr he's
he's<00:02:44.220> showing<00:02:44.580> some<00:02:44.850> potential<00:02:45.420> I'm<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:47.220> a

he's showing some potential I'm not a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.640 
he's showing some potential I'm not a
