00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:08.041
 We're in the printing shop 

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.521
 Robert Blackburn 

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.581
 founded by Bob Blackburn in 1940. 

00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:12.931
 Lithography was invented for purpose 

00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:14.761
 reproducing sheet music. 

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.591
 Instead of copying notes manually 

00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:18.671
 over and over and over again 

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:20.549
 Senefelder invented lithography 

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:22.119
 to be written once 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.239
 orchestral composition 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.949
 could be reproduced, and so on 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.929
 sold to several orchestras 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.249
 more cities across Europe. 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.759
 That was her original meaning 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.279
 and when the artist grabs something 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.539
 what will allow him to work in a new way 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.529
 He always takes these tools and materials 

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:38.499
 and use them for their own artistic purposes. 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.499
 This was the case of engraving, 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:44.559
 embossing or woodcut. 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.239
 It is now also a case of digital printing. 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.169
 Lithography is based on a very simple principle 

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:52.239
 that oil and water repel each other. 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.739
 So you will see how the smoothed board is 

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:56.859
 moisten and then overcoat 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.019
 oily ink. 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.549
 It's like washing dishes. 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.459
 When you have a lot of greasy pan 

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:04.069
 and pour water into it, 

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.029
 it starts to degrease. 

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:07.679
 The same is happening here, 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.949
 but the grease distribution is regulated. 

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:12.059
 Lithography is exceptional among other things 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.530
 that of all printing processes 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.960
 here handicrafts occupy the largest share 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.230
 Captures the exact footprint of the hand 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.420
 that moves across the surface. 

00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:24.762
 The result is the highest precision 

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:27.353
 from the artist's point of view 

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.473
 therefore, from an immediate perspective. 

00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:31.263
 All other printing processes 

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:33.203
 converts these tracks to others 

00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:34.993
 but again it creates an absolute one 

00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:37.103
 record in hand movements. 

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:41.121
 This means that there is a lithography for the artist 

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:42.641
 very liberating type of drawing 

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:44.119
 because it can be layered. 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.069
 You can draw in black and print in green 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.009
 or blue or pink. 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.846
 Such a degree of freedom allows only 

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:53.025
 artistic print. And that degree of freedom 

00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:55.195
 in drawing, in the immediate process 

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:56.985
 it only allows lithography.
