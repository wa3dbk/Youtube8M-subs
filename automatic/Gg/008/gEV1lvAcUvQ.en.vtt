00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.089
 Do you recognize this voice? 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.080
 I am to blame if Iberians do 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.830
 justice 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.540
 while you listen behind your throne 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.910
 what brad interviewed the dubbers 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.160
 march simões and ricardo juarez that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.980
 participate in the Brazilian dubbing of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.710

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.640
 of the dubbing of the devil 3 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.540
 Wow 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.030
 You can not judge me I'm the justice. 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.960
 incarnate 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:52.220
 our purpose is to better protect 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.830
 innocent but if our precious laws 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.750
 prevents them from acting 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:02.450
 so I will not be your brother anymore 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.580
 so stay tuned to leave the video already 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.390
 will start 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.390
 cynthia 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.289
 Personal speech beauty that is André but I 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.210
 Were you welcome to the old west? 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.100
 I'm here next to three dubbers 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.570
 fantastic and I'm here beside the river 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.390
 is in the area that he is director of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.950
 dubbing voice actor and the márcio that simões 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.429
 is a voice actor and also a dubbing director 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.679
 and Ricardo Juarez grand voice actor of 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.789
 johnny bravo is the cartoon and the 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.860
 first question I wanted to ask 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.289
 It would be for you how it was with 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.799
 experience of dubbing diablo 3 a game 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.060
 video game is interesting because it is 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.420
 different from what you are accustomed to doing 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.849
 on television and in the cinema to the methodology 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.640
 different is accustomed to making movies 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.259
 So we watch the movie, tv. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.149
 image is the reference of the image to 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.409
 help in the interpretation and the game 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.360
 basically we do not have to 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.539
 recognize that Gustavo gives people in 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.939
 relation to the character who gives and 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.190
 audio reference and we have to see 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.060
 the image in Syria will know how 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.150
 how is it but to do each one of them chose 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 an apprentice to be forged in a 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.260
 champion of light when the master died 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.060
 apprentice take his name on his shield 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.530
 weapon and its cause 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.630
 the other question why he was going to 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 as was the first contact with 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.239
 Devil 3 how did he get here? 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.310
 it was a dubbing test is the studio 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.440
 look for you to do the dubbing 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.200
 How was that wrong mirror? 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.959
 the actors' contact count the news 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.180
 through DNA tests were 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.090
 summoned the actors to take the test 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.069
 No one knows what's good, right? 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.220
 It's a game that we always say with the 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.130
 dubbing director for them is a game 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.780
 And you, then, when we come through 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.250
 in terms of cyrus these things make the 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.280
 people are telling the story along 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.500
 of the times né ô 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.870
 people since the first of abunã 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.319
 We recorded and I Ricardo appeared 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.720
 now making me take it is obvious and he is the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.099
 our crusader our new hero then 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.099
 ricardo has entered the recording process 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.230
 now from the current picture and will be 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.120
 present is also not a character 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.859
 appeared now we have done for now 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.020
 bakanas is ball show but at the time that 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.980
 you are doing 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.550
 of a jury you only understand but you do not 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.000
 have the picture you do not have is not in a 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.680
 point is not is is to equip is the great 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.510
 balcony you have to have 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.180
 sensitivity in order to be able to 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.760
 people already know exactly what you 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.380
 want of each on the scene is to build 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.050
 inside your head search the 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.200
 material and from the moment in space 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.170
 from the studio with the actors sharing 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.790
 that and how you can improve that. 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.780
 that you were not going to add in the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.680
 job 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.030
 when entering the fight it can cause the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.920
 legions of evil forcing them to attack him 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.260
 dare his sacred judgment to 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.270
 to root but she had some is she 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.040
 had any with her participated in the 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.680
 matter of casting 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.720
 the question of the direction of the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.880
 dubbing to have in that 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.560
 snow participation 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.630
 So, as a director, I choose right? 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.760
 two indications from the actors that I think 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.260
 that it is better not to be able to do it is obvious that 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.150
 also has another department of the 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.700
 Portuguese contents institution 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.340
 also takes care of this and the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.670
 people talk about which is the best 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.340
 direction to the work 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.740
 protected by faith and by steel the crusader 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.170
 can face equal to equal with 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.220
 any abomination created by hell 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.960
 ardent 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.360
 The voice actor has the freedom to 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.040
 improvise some lines when 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.270
 he is doing the dubbing of 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.890
 character 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.590
 there was this possibility of you 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.080
 able to adapt and do something 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.630
 different at the time of the endless novel 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.190
 a few moments talking to us 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.260
 Sometimes it's my suggestion the same 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.120
 suggestion of the technician who 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.030
 is also one of the technicians who recorded with 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.070
 people and people in the context of 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.290
 game without being able to get away much 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.940
 today china for example we try 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.980
 in thinking about changing the text some 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.810
 people can leave at some moments 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.040
 Yes, we can adapt and make a 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.870
 Brazilian version like us Brazilians 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.200
 serious to leave a natural thing 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.080

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.750
 the event 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.870
 Your goal is simply to

 eradication of all demons and he 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.390

 category we can not talk much 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:33.600
