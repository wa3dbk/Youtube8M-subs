00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.889
 the invention of the automobile has completely transformed the world 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.140
 modern 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.010
 today there are more than 620 million vehicles through the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.650
 globe emit toulouse a cocktail of potentially toxic gases 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.579
 but today 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.610
 thanks to the art of the most precious metals in the world 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.369
 these poisonous gases can be broken down at sea for us 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.800
 and carbon dioxide 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800
 So how does it work 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.599
 pollution a plague engendered by the automobile 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.780
 this deadly cloud contains a toxic cocktail of oxidized hydrocarbons 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.300
 of nitrogen and carbon monoxide all emitted by gasoline engines 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.610
 but there is an amazing girl device ride on cars maybe 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.610
 at the elysÃ©e all these poisons 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.680
 it seems unreal but this nerac device really exists 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 it's the catalytic converter 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.700
 however there is a catch 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.800
 to make it 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.800
 it takes a few grams of the year but all the most valuable in the world 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 platinum 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.540
 at twice the price of gold platinum is extremely thunder it's up to 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.880
 ideal metallica for the joy ride 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 but he also has another property even more amazing 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.330
 platinum and one of the most effective catalysts that are because it 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.160
 comes in contact with exhaust fumes it reacts by dissociating 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 toxic gases 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.490
 but if platinum is so expensive it is not without reason 11 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.479
 it is extremely rare hard to extract and its process of refinement 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.890
 lasts six months 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.920
 to find out how it works we went to the hague in montana 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.640
 that's where the stilwater mines are 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 they produce 4 tons of platinum per year 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.409
 as for 800 meters underground teams of miners look for the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.770
 precious metal day and night 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.770
 in this sense kilometers of tunnels 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.489
 this region may be one of the richest platinum in the world 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.489
 to find a vein to exploit remains a difficult task 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.659
 what measure ever more than three meters wide and geologists 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.010
 have to take regular samples to check the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.570
 presence of platinum and palladium 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.369
 the metal that accompany it 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.389
 once the beautiful locate the excavators goes into action 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.779
 it's a heavy operation the extraction of one gram of platinum requires the 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.779
 release of 300 kilos of rocks 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.219
 we have to go back to the surface the minaret is sent to its crushers 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.219
 giant 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.529
 the resulting powder I recovered by a treadmill 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 magnetized who extracts from it 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:10.149
 the next step is to mix the remaining material with water and 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.719
 I was indoor air 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.450
 result platinum rises to the surface in a study that is called 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.479
 the concentrate 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.109
 the raw ores to challenge been stirred and broken down 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.279
 happily we did on the surface of the culture 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.039
 the South Korean company focuses 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.039
 humiliation value for our children 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.470
 but so far everything is fine 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.470
 platinum is now 300 thousand times more concentrated than it was 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.719
 but keep coming back to 7 3% 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:46.789
 here 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:48.569
 then to treat the exhaust 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.509
 it must be 98% 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.589
 the scum to dry out been contacted have the taste for the next step 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.919
 the ingots are placed in a stove to burn most of 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.409
 other elements that compose them 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.719
 leaving only small amounts of methane 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.719
 which in laguiole and of course 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.949
 to prevent these metals from fusing by cooling the mixture 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.949
 melt is sprayed with cold water to break it into fine particles 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.590
 but this factory will go no further 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.300
 at this level of concentration platinum is sent to another factory in 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.300
 several thousand kilometers away 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.150
 for those who would be interested 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.689
 unfortunately we can not reveal its location 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.490
 the training is confidential why 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.130
 it belongs to anne johnson matthey who produces a third of the catalytic costs 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.860
 used in the world 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 nearly 35 million last year 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.979
 the mission of this plant is to separate the platinum metals from 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.389
 lower value 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.819
 to do this we use a series of chemical reactions whose result 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.050
 final spark of platinum plus rock at 98% 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.789
 but for the catalytic converter to work guys do not have to enter 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.719
 in direct contact with platinum 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.449
 for the manufacturer can not afford in using them more than a few 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.449
 grams 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:24.059
 the solution and this ceramic structure in honeycomb 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.490
 seen from the outside and the small but its area corresponds to that of a 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.490
 football field 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.209
 run korea to this surface platinum is first suspended in 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:40.330
 solutions and then poured on the honeycomb structure to form a layer 

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:42.189
 some molecules thick 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.189
 then the structure is cooked to activate platinum 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.889
 the end result is a device with almost miraculous virtues unable to 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.140
 convert mercury-toxic gases into carbon dioxide 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.949
 if the love of your life and offer to offer you a platinum object 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.300
 it may be more you will think of your lungs to win your heart
