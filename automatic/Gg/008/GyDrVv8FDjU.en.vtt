reticulation<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.720> other<00:04:12.840> hand<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.140> will

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
reticulation on the other hand it will

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.360

be<00:04:13.440> left<00:04:14.370> out<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:14.610> was<00:04:14.790> expecting<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.330> lot<00:04:16.370> maybe

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
be left out I was expecting a lot maybe

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.900 
be left out I was expecting a lot maybe
too<00:04:17.729> much<00:04:19.040> because<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.130> was<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.280> small<00:04:20.549> figure

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
too much because it was a small figure

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.250 
too much because it was a small figure
and<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.090> figured<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.600> know<00:04:21.660> Hasbro<00:04:22.079> could

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.719 
and I figured you know Hasbro could
spend<00:04:22.470> more<00:04:22.680> on<00:04:22.740> articulation<00:04:23.160> but<00:04:23.639> they

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
spend more on articulation but they

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.450 
spend more on articulation but they

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.740 
I think Hasbro nailed it with this one I
mean<00:05:35.880> they<00:05:36.060> could<00:05:36.180> have<00:05:36.270> given<00:05:36.419> him<00:05:36.570> some
