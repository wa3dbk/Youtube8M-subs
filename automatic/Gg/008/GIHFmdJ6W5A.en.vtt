so<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> little<00:02:26.520> mister<00:02:26.910> Shire<00:02:27.150> usually<00:02:27.900> about

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
so a little mister Shire usually about

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.050 
so a little mister Shire usually about
six<00:02:28.890> or<00:02:29.010> seven<00:02:29.310> dashes<00:02:29.760> per<00:02:29.970> side<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:31.910> rub<00:02:32.910> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
six or seven dashes per side and rub it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.220 
six or seven dashes per side and rub it
in<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.850> same<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> Chipotle<00:02:36.990> I'd

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
in and the same with the Chipotle I'd

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.290 
in and the same with the Chipotle I'd
like<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> little<00:02:38.430> conservative<00:02:39.120> with

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
like to be a little conservative with

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.820 
like to be a little conservative with
this<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:40.050> get<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.290> little<00:02:40.500> salty

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
this because it can get a little salty

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.570 
this because it can get a little salty
so<00:02:41.490> maybe<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.750> three<00:02:43.050> or<00:02:43.170> four<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.770> again

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
so maybe just three or four and again

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:56.240 
so maybe just three or four and again
rubbing<00:02:45.510> on<00:02:46.490> each<00:02:47.490> side

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.540 

so<00:02:56.850> now<00:02:57.150> we've<00:02:57.660> got<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.140> marinating<00:02:59.100> and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
so now we've got this marinating and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.610 
so now we've got this marinating and
we're<00:02:59.760> now<00:02:59.910> going<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.270> clean<00:03:00.630> my<00:03:00.870> set<00:03:01.200> as<00:03:01.380> much

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
we're now going to clean my set as much

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.500 
we're now going to clean my set as much
fat<00:03:02.010> off<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.490> as<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.300> when<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:03.900> cube<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:08.510> so

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
fat off of as we can when we cube it so

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.810 
fat off of as we can when we cube it so
that<00:03:10.050> there<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> line<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.860> fat<00:03:11.340> down<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
that there is a line of fat down the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.580 
that there is a line of fat down the
center<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.210> it's<00:03:12.450> nice<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:13.230> cut

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
center and it's nice just to cut

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.090 
center and it's nice just to cut
straight<00:03:14.220> down<00:03:15.050> so<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.320> can<00:03:16.530> remove<00:03:16.860> as

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
straight down so that you can remove as

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.400 
straight down so that you can remove as
much<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.490> fat<00:03:17.820> as<00:03:18.530> possible<00:03:20.960> so<00:03:21.960> we've<00:03:22.170> got

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
much of the fat as possible so we've got

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.240 
much of the fat as possible so we've got
a<00:03:22.440> nice<00:03:22.910> half<00:03:23.910> pieces<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.410> pot<00:03:25.650> roast<00:03:26.010> and

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
a nice half pieces of the pot roast and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.180 
a nice half pieces of the pot roast and
we<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.880> just<00:03:27.030> cut<00:03:27.330> these<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.750> cubes<00:03:28.190> again

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
we can just cut these in cubes again

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.090 
we can just cut these in cubes again
uniformity<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.720> always<00:03:31.440> important

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
uniformity with this is always important

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.040 
uniformity with this is always important
so<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.550> everything<00:03:33.060> cooks<00:03:33.390> at<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.840> same

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
so that everything cooks at the same

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.570 
so that everything cooks at the same
temperature<00:03:34.410> in<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:35.430> same<00:03:35.670> rate<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:37.580> also

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
temperature in the same rate you also

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.880 
temperature in the same rate you also
want<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:38.910> consider<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.600> bite<00:03:39.870> size<00:03:40.170> whenever

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
want to consider the bite size whenever

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
set the cube to meet aside and we're

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.960 
set the cube to meet aside and we're
going<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:02.860> start<00:04:03.130> our<00:04:03.220> vegetables<00:04:05.970> making

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
going to start our vegetables making

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.340 
going to start our vegetables making

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
this so it's not to cross contaminate

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.330 
this so it's not to cross contaminate
even<00:04:11.170> though<00:04:11.260> we're<00:04:11.440> cooking<00:04:11.920> all<00:04:12.069> of<00:04:12.100> this

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340

bottom at this point you have a nice

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.159 
bottom at this point you have a nice
ring<00:04:51.949> but<00:04:52.699> it's<00:04:52.939> got<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.270> inside<00:04:53.659> so<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:53.930> want

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
ring but it's got the inside so you want

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.559 
ring but it's got the inside so you want
to<00:04:54.229> take<00:04:54.409> that<00:04:54.650> out<00:04:54.949> you<00:04:55.280> can<00:04:56.060> do<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.210> two

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
to take that out you can do that two

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.809 
to take that out you can do that two
ways<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.930> can<00:04:57.050> either<00:04:57.139> pull<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.710> or<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.669> can

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
ways you can either pull it or you can

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.800 
ways you can either pull it or you can
actually<00:04:58.849> cut<00:04:59.449> it<00:05:01.210> sometimes<00:05:02.210> it<00:05:02.389> has<00:05:02.539> to<00:05:02.569> be

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
actually cut it sometimes it has to be

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:14.409 
actually cut it sometimes it has to be
cut<00:05:03.050> so<00:05:09.310> when<00:05:10.310> you've<00:05:10.430> got<00:05:10.610> your<00:05:10.819> ring<00:05:13.419> you
