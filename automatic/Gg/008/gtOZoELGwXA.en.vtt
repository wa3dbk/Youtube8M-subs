00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.360
 hey people here and today a ford ka 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.980
 tutorial for the 2 version of a ford and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.260
 though to pick the vips 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.699
 first time to the first version as well 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.109
 I have learned one right 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.480
 simple version also good for beginners 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.689
 suitable and then a something 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 more advanced with a dj feedback 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 flip would be 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.460
 and I will both except you now 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.260
 your perspective explains so is rich 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.079
 there we would be at the tutorial for 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.460
 the flip flops and that was the first one 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 variant which now came again seen 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 that is very good for beginners 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 suitable because hardly any heavy passages in it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.700
 the second one is a bit heavier 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.920
 her there, I'll say it's a little one 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.620
 version of dnv det flips from there 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.750
 should prevail the fire department before 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.329
 this fund has made in this version 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.800
 but the first version is right then 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.020
 easy to learn and I will teach you 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.120
 now explain the first version of this 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.920
 cups was created by rodney race one 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.989
 american magician customers and the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 second version I just have 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.890
 a little bit with the cut and played around 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.900
 The idea always came in such a way 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.640
 concealed flip it is he 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.020
 his half-version still with the left 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.729
 hand with the left I can give them a 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 that's not exactly why it is 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.720
 a down-driven version but it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.290
 is still better if you have the title 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 how could philipp in itself be a 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 further requirement for both 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.060
 versions is the talk off like you 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.430
 maybe you could taste it here 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 you have to do the same in the stall and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.180
 which is so far all the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.610
 requirements of this cut is also a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.560
 complete portfolio critical or too 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.759
 blind cup called so all cards 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.159
 stay in one and the same order 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.600
 shape after the cut and we easily 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.790
 you can see the deck turning in the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.540
 hand around from face down to fat or 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.909
 vice versa 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.439
 You start this katyn of a kwk 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.290
 position in the so-called streller 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.189
 grip and actually found the celik 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.990
 has normal 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.399
 You can either half or one 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.920
 it is relatively unimportant 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.689
 This time, I usually do about 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.189
 one third 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.509
 once this pack is disconnected 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.850
 either by the index finger or 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.770
 divides by dropping the dome 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.520
 her the vertical pack again 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.730
 in two about the same size 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.260
 fanning this away to the side 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.110
 putting it over the fingers here 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.670
 just spread and push this 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.459
 below are effect as normal as the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.569
 start up 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.129
 as soon as the pack what you are here right now 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.080
 the index finger has pushed up 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.360
 this vertical corner clarified 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.299
 has its circuits the two just now 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.670
 open tabs again and do that 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.099
 check it up before leaving this one 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.500
 Shut your right now 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.110
 hand between the two packs and take 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.510
 which now actually falling to pack 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.099
 either with index finger and thumb or 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.599
 with the complete hand I actually 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.890
 always the complete hand because it's mine 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.200
 opinion after simply safe and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.790
 looks more beautiful 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.579
 and as soon as you have this in your hand 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.709
 have it off to the side and for animal 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.750
 now changes the grip of the pack in the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.410
 left hand and only with index finger 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.269
 and thumbs 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.579
 These three fingers have to be here now 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.769
 expand so that you complete the 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.359
 Right knew about it because you 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.459
 must coincide with this pack including 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.190
 so go from this happiness to these 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.569
 or you turn your index finger 1 has that 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.030
 So I also do some simple work 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.560
 only the left knew quite well here 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.829
 Sorry the right edge of the pack in 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.540
 the left hand so must be free 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.250
 then you come here with this pack 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.079
 simply at 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.250
 and then you can either do it that way 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.200
 that you really pack this on it 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.019
 balances easily pulls up and then around 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.870
 just flip it or just do it 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.220
 luck directly in your hand to flip so 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.579
 if you balance it with the volt 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.200
 it would have to be a bit over the top 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.760
 over the pack now lying down 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.989
 seemed so its there so it 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.269
 both can and then just in the 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.669
 hand over to flip or you have direct 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.250
 this grip and it'll flip you right in 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.139
 hand if you did that now 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.169
 Do you have to pack this up? 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.129
 get in with a half turn 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.459
 There would have to be a bit of height 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.819
 but experiment what I tell you 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.489
 can 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.579
 the fingertips so in the about in the 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.959
 middle of the underlying packet 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.319
 because then the pack is just falling 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.790
 down and lands exactly on the 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.349
 another pack on it and there you have to team 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.470
 with the height I try that I try 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:22.300
 now only once so briefly in the 500 this 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.960
 have so that the pack then actually 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.200
 exactly 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.000
 pinpoint lands 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.650
 so if you have the pack you have 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.780
 so yes with me as with the whole 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.060
 hand or aldi with how many fingers it 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.100
 have accepted and go with these 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.420
 fingertips in the middle of the pack 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.090
 So you just make it here 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.800
 kind of airline and then just leave it 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.320
 just fall with your thumb and it should 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.060
 to turn around and around the fingers 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.170
 just fall down as I said then 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.590
 you just have to look with the height 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.360
 how high the pack is because partly 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.920
 If you then, for example, still the hand 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.720
 Of course you need to move upwards 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.010
 not so big higher if now 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.850
 just have to fall because he then 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.420
 Of course the deck a little bit 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.800
 accelerates yes and that we too 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.570
 actually everything so far already 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.840
 first variant i just go 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.360
 once very slowly through the beginning 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.790
 Charlie has the beginning of the vertical 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.890
 divide up the standing pack and fan it 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.840
 while she holds the pack with her index finger 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.220
 pushes up here as soon as that 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.050
 vertical pack and this basin 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.870
 have clarified it closes the momentarily 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.940
 fanned pack again and completed 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.340
 the chart almost pushes between the 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.290
 packs your right hand takes this pack 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.020
 transferred to the grip so that the 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.510
 right edge of the left pack is open 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.820
 either flip it over in hand or 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.790
 balances and then flip it brings 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.440
 this pack up your positioned 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.790
 fingertips in the middle of the underneath 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.090
 lying decks and leave it easy 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.040
 fall and then we can recognize that 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.420
 blanket so it still comes in the 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.670
 same order it is a complete one 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.800
 who had before the critical blablabla 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.410
 I am all already the second version 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.240
 the first very similar just that here 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.700
 this put the tgv cover sheet 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.410
 insert as soon as you have vitali 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.090
 and I've been wrong 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.680
 and actually with this pack underneath 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.960
 want to go and the fingers opens here 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.780
 let the fingers here quite normal 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.030
 the long side of the pack turns her 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.410
 index finger and take your time this 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.670
 Half digitec flip or only deck flip 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.080
 you can here as I said the wrist 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.730
 also take with you as easily a turn or 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.920
 something that makes the pack easier to turn 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.840
 and theoretically easy to open 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.550
 that's no matter comes with then 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.080
 this pack just like the first one 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.480
 right about the fingertips about 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.990
 with the middle line of this map here 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.760
 and let the just pack it in 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.460
 so it's really very similar and 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.260
 just requires a little more exercise through 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.300
 this title for the club was one 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.580
 looks a little nicer when you are here 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.740
 make the backflip and the deck still in the 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.240
 flight is and you already pack this 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.790
 drop that requires a little bit 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.950
 Timing also looks pretty nice 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.510
 So I can try it with 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.080
 the tuba is obscured father is not 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.260
 quite so great 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.800
 So then sitting in about looks completely 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.450
 nice out 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.650
 you can just try around and 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.750
 of course , own variations 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.300
 bring in that we go as far as mine 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.040
 tutorial on this little progress 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.320
 I just hope it has you 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.880
 I like it and then I come to it 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.560
 standard car 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.420
 Of course I do a little bit 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.100
 advertising for mystic magic a very 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.330
