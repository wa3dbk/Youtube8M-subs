00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.910
 the oil that we will use more 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.020
 home centa and coconut silicon the quinci 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.280
 and coco talk about an oil that comes from 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.610
 body that excellent for calls effect 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.949
 similar to silicones but of course it is 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.559
 natural as well as this used 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.430
 also avocado oil and its own 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.250
 gold drawing and recipe title with gods 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.680
 essential ylang ylang lemon e 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.420
 rosemary and then finally used a 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 fragrance to the manageable this oil is 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.560
 very light, in fact, so water 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.100
 and this is precisely the peculiarity of 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.670
 this ingredient that will not weigh down the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.290
 hair 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.680
 now, however, add to the mount of 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.200
 oils a little heavier though in 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.310
 lower percentage find all the oil of 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.760
 avocado at this point we can guess 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.370
 also seed oil for children 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:41.070
 and great for the hair now we will insert 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.310
 the essential oils that will be used 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.250
 polishing hair but also singing e 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.390
 to the oil a better perfume given 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.390
 just because the viewfinder 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.970
 now we hope well and to make them melt 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.740
 distinct radicals and at our leisure we can 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.619
 even add an evening you 're not for 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.670
 example the point the jasmine girl 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.940
 because with milan from a content on 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.180
 walls in italy 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.030
 now we are ready to pour the oil 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.360
 container as you see the consistency is 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.560
 very light a very light then 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.730
 you will not feel hair and it will make them shiny 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.730
 at the same time it was 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.860
 and this is the cd polished oil also for 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.740
 hair the consistency to do it 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.010
 see is that of a very light oil 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.630
 it seems almost water is absorbed immediately and 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.800
 therefore it does not represent rai hair 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.050
 but the useless and at the fair 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.370
 you can use it either before 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.970
 then dry the hair for 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.670
 protect them and from the heat of the bottom but 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.910
 also to protect them for example from 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.720
 chlorine or alone and or you can 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.160
 use it even after drying 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.400
 then, to do so, to fix a little 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.400
 life 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.560
 I hope this research says it liked 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.240
 leave me but have a comment if you like 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.240
