CHIA PUDDING WITH RASPBERRIES

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.180
I'm Dani Nocce, from the channel Cozinha, Bossa e Malagueta

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.740
and from the website I Could Kill For Dessert,
specialized in confectionery.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.100
I was invited by Electrolux and Tastemade

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.810
to produce this series of videos to you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.620
with delicious and very healthy food.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.840
You can come to my channel, have delicious treats

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.240
and then come see me here cooking healthy delights

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.980
to stay in shape for the rest of the week.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.170
And today I'll make you a chia pudding with coconut milk

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.040
gluten and lactose free

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.720
and with natural raspberry gelatin that's delicious.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.830
Let's cook!

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.800
Let's cook

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.480
To start, I'll make a raspberry gelatin

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.870
that I'll place under my chia pudding.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.140
This gelatin is natural

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.570
so I'll use raspberry pulp

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.120
water, gelatin and nothing else.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.120
Just boil 100mL of water.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.650
It will dissolve 7g of gelatin powder

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.020
Then blend the raspberries.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.180
I'll use 150g of raspberries

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.400
but you can use any fruit you want.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.040
Could be strawberry, currant, mango, 
anything you want.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.000
Then I'll mix these two and place in
the bottom of dessert glasses.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.060
100 mL of water

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.270
7g of gelatin powder

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.440
Mix well

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.280
Blend

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.300
Then take it to the fridge for 2 hours

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300
then I'll make my chia pudding.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.620
Leave it in the fridge for 2h

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.900
To cover the gelatin, I'll make chia pudding.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.080
Why not, right?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.200
It's delicious! 
Don't complain, it's really delicious.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.810
When I made it it was really good,
so don't complain now.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.120
No contest.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.180
So I'll make chia pudding with coconut milk

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.840
and agave, so, for those that -

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840
Co-co-nut?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.240
Milk?

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.460
Are you going to keep messing around?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.150
So this is a great dessert if you can't have lactose

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
or gluten, because it has neither.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.180
Cool, right?

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.720
So if you want to replace the agave
for honey, sugar

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.180
or sucralose, it's fine.
Just pour it and mix it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.950
testing how much it takes to sweeten it.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.130
making your taste buds happy and satisfied.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.320
Isn't it so?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.460
Making your taste buds happy and satisfied?

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.760
- It's what matters, right?
- That's right.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.900
In my pudding, I'll use 8 tablespoons of chia

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.220
3 tablespoons of agave

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.700
and 400 mL of coconut milk.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.580
If you want to make your own coconut milk

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.370
just click here and take a look at the recipe.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.650
I have mine ready, so I'll mix it all in a jar

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.180
close it, shake it and cover 
our glasses with the result.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.330
take it to the fridge for 4h

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.240
let the chia and the whole fridge
process make it harden.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.940
Do you know what it turns into now?

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.940
A pitaya.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.940
- A pitaya, honey?
- Right.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.410
Do you know how to
make a pitaya, then?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.280
Throw it into those pink cheese
things, you know?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.700
- Right.
- Gouda cheese, you know.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.220
- Got it?

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.700
Leave it in the fridge for 24h

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.720
I hope you enjoyed my chia pudding
with natural raspberry gelatin.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.080
It's not a pudding to me.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.890
I would call it a mousse.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.520
Honey, a mousse is a lot more 
aerated than this.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.620
This is consistent, hard, you know.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.620
We'll make up another name then.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.620
It's pudding, there's no other name.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.690
It's chia pudding with coconut milk.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.840
Well, it's really cool that you can put them
into mini jars, like this.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.530
And take them to work to
have a healthy dessert.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.050
I wouldn't even call it a dessert.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.720
It's just a very tasty afternoon snack.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.530
For when you're hungry in the afternoon,
you know, at 5 o'clock.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.100
When you're starving.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.100
I'm always starving.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.250
I'll see you next week with another
tasty and healthy recipe.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.050
Bye!
