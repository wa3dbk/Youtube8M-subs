00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.689
 very good thing here we are in others 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.040
 5 languages on the line that I am 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.630
 flying over the city of saints 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.130
 how are you living with my piece of hunting 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.360
 what good is nerve a favorite and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.740
 I guess a lot of people's favorite 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.450
 since it is the most powerful plane in the game 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.890
 and well then in this case I bring you something 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.599
 original that really never had 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.770
 brought to the channel and well then I do not know 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.510
 If you know it, it's because 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.760
 many times here in gta 5 one of the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 things that I do the most is take a saucepan and 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.880
 put me in a coffee in a game 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.289
 death as in this case I am in a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.430
 Death match and I put myself to try 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.830
 I've put him on the beach a lot of 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.420
 fighters and as I say in what 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.859
 I usually do many times on GT5 when 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.320
 I'm bored and that 's putting me here 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.850
 gta 5 with a fighter to make as 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.130
 acrobatics here between the buildings and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.600
 so then it really gave me a lot 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.370
 time doing that I enjoyed it because 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.290
 I do not do as a kind of since one of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.969
 series but some loose videos in the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.020
 which I do not approve with 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.940
 different shareholders between 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.899
 buildings and that then well then 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.160
 it really occurred to me and said 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.270
 back because we're not going to upload it to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.890
 channel that surely writers 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 demolish makes a portion cool this guy 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.469
 of videos then leave there is a like you ' 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.850
 comment saying dan and then I would like 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.899
 that there should be if I like what 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.399
 upload or if you want if you have any 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.379
 way to improve the series or something today 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.339
 also by in the comments it's worth like that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.000
 that we are going to find here to do 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.160
 acrobatics that really always 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.600
 upstairs of the building or do 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.850
 acrobatics so that the buildings and 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.930
 find the perfect super acrobatics 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.930
 I really love it 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.740
 and this is very cool 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.240
 I did not like so many while I took off 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.100
 the invisibility there we are I want to be 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.270
 he wants to be sensitive so he can die 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.250
 watch appear again on the beach and 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.260
 catch another fighter but like 600 that if I 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.030
 took a lot of time in the afternoon and such 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.680
 when you do not know when I have nothing to 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.479
 record and then so I put myself there 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.490
 with a fighter to circle the city 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.990
 of the saints and that and you'll see what we 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.460
 things come out sometimes quite a lot of wheat 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.570
 back because I do not tax things things 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.250

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.880
 limit of buildings and them so 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.440

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.359
 here is worth 6 and feeling of bridges 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.069

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.069
 around here on the river 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 OK 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.919
 control 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:41.370
 of the total with one we can also 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.870
 mother daily hunting a lad

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.190
 hunting just above all the 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.150
 building of the saints we will choose 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.460
 all the saints as I say for 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.900
 end the episode and as I say the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.210
 true that sergio is to fly 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.530
 it took me almost as long as I say 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.760
 doing these acrobatics here for the 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.170
 anti sometimes I get some ones that my mother 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.940
 and I say why the hell is not recording 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.260
 to be able to bring a montage of this 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.910
 because it's that sometimes I get a 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.010
 acrobatics pretty look impression 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.340
 Look, this is going to take a bead in 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.070

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.980
 I say peak seriously and it was and neither 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.990
 by the golden shrapnel with that of senator 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.680
 I almost all of them are gathered in the 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.680
 shore god free me 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:29.819
 yunis and looking up what the fuck 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.960
 the case we will use at home 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.639
 just above the building of 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.659
 systems all the saints my challenge is my 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.669
 deal we have the episode ends 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.810
 ethically of site or with coffee 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.310
 tell you that we are not used to 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.310
 I always usually do it with the titan and 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.620
 that and you have to try to promote that position 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.030
 too small and as I say I'm 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.190
 quite please with the titan but 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.069
 with the fighter I never never do so 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.690

 should have accelerated my mother and 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.370
 achával to the first is the time it is not 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.469
 so typical in hunting really hunting 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.639
 he controlled it quite well pretty well 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.569
 that nautical, basically, it's coming 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.780
 being so that you are left behind this 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.780
 video 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.360
 I'm going to bring so you can see what I do 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.740
 in the afternoons ita 7 to 5 and the truth that 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.970
 I recommend you that time because I do not know 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.440
 once you get the control that way 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.330
 you can do so pretty movements 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.860
 clean and that for the truth that is 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.940
 pretty pretty cool 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.550
 also criticized to say movement 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.080
 pretty clean at the moment of telling 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.570
 I was going to crash was going to stay in plan file 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.680
