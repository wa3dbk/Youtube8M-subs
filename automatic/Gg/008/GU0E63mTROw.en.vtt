concerned<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.110> list<00:04:58.380> just<00:04:58.590> means<00:04:58.919> there

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
concerned that the list just means there

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.280 
concerned that the list just means there
are<00:04:59.460> shows<00:04:59.669> capacities<00:05:00.389> Joe's<00:05:00.570> capability
