00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.689
 hello friends I'm Hector James Ruiz and the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.029
 today I bring you one of the best 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.669
 that I read many that I have seen for the gta 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 san andreas first we go to the link 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.529
 that I will leave them in the description of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.149
 video we give it folding and then to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.219
 save files if they have 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.759
 mozilla if they have cron they only give 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.759
 though land 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.500
 once it's finished we're going to 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.500
 the folder where they downloaded it 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.630
 as you can see, it's a file, they give you a click 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.120
 right and then click to extract here we 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.390
 leave a folder we open it 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.240
 we open the folder I think 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.130
 and we copy the cs file to the folder 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.130
 cleo of our gta san andreas 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.930
 which is commonly in the folder 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.960
 program files of our disk 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.960
 hard 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.690
 and we paste the file in the folder I think 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.940
 now we go back to the folder of the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.700
 downloaded file and we open the folder 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.770
 kernel text and we copy the file to the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.960
 kernel text folder that is in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.619
 our folder I believe and ready now 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.510
 they have installed one of the best as 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.510
 now I will show them I see them inside 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.850
 good to activate the clamor press 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.880
 control more c 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.370
 they can take weapons that are 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.690
 or they can also change the weather if it's 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.690
 that is very ugly xd 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.120
 it even has as a skin selector 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.060
 What I recommend most are the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.990
 modifications that the cars have 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.990
 They are very good 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.680
 it also has a car selector 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.980
 and could not miss the teletransportaciÃ³n 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.170
 they just mark the place where they want to go 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.170
 and they teleport to the marker 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.430
 yes and magic of harry potter xd 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.560
 good as they see it has everything it is only 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.660
 question of you going 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.620
 grabbing the wave and see everything 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.620
 has is click mode 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.150
 and many thanks to the chingones who 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.760
 have subscribed to my channel very many 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.099
 thanks and another thing for this I think mod 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.140
 It is necessary to have installed or 4 cla 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.299
 because with I believe 3 does not work in the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.439
 description of the video I leave the link 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.439
 to download it 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.549
 good little hand up and sign it 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.329

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.329
