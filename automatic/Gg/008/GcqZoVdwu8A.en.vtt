out based on this 12 calories per pound
calculation<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.739> see<00:03:35.489> if<00:03:35.760> that's<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.360> reason

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
calculation and see if that's the reason

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.259 
calculation and see if that's the reason
why<00:03:36.840> you're<00:03:37.019> not<00:03:37.260> losing<00:03:37.530> body<00:03:37.920> fat<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.430> again

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
why you're not losing body fat and again

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.259 
why you're not losing body fat and again
I'm<00:03:39.450> looking<00:03:40.110> into<00:03:40.440> my<00:03:40.680> crystal<00:03:41.610> ball<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.150> I'm

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
I'm looking into my crystal ball and I'm

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.729 
I'm looking into my crystal ball and I'm
kind<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.569> visualizing<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.349> that<00:03:43.560> is

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
kind of visualizing that that is

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.220 
kind of visualizing that that is
probably<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.670> issue<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.690> you're<00:03:45.840> having<00:03:46.019> is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
probably the issue that you're having is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.750 
probably the issue that you're having is
it<00:03:46.349> just<00:03:46.500> you're<00:03:46.799> just<00:03:46.950> eating<00:03:47.069> too<00:03:47.310> damn<00:03:47.489> much

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
it just you're just eating too damn much

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.670 
it just you're just eating too damn much
simple<00:03:48.209> as<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.690> mean<00:03:49.200> even<00:03:49.349> though<00:03:49.530> you're

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
simple as that I mean even though you're

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.289 
simple as that I mean even though you're
eating<00:03:49.860> clean<00:03:50.040> you're<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.549> eating<00:03:50.730> too<00:03:51.060> much

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
eating clean you're just eating too much

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.199 
eating clean you're just eating too much
for<00:03:51.810> fat<00:03:51.959> loss<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.950> if<00:03:53.099> you<00:03:53.220> reduce<00:03:53.909> your

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
for fat loss so if you reduce your

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.910 
for fat loss so if you reduce your
caloric<00:03:54.420> intake<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.439> point<00:03:55.650> where<00:03:55.799> you're

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
caloric intake to the point where you're

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.679 
caloric intake to the point where you're
eating<00:03:56.099> 12<00:03:56.280> calories<00:03:56.819> per<00:03:57.150> pound<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.510> body
