which is really plenty of space for me
it's<00:02:05.710> an<00:02:05.920> Athlon<00:02:06.310> 64<00:02:08.130> processor<00:02:09.130> runs<00:02:09.850> at

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it's an Athlon 64 processor runs at

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.840 
it's an Athlon 64 processor runs at
about<00:02:10.030> 3<00:02:10.540> gig<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.830> motherboard<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:13.330> canine

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850
