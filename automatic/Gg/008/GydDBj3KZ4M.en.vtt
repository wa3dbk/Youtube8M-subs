one<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.339> more<00:00:05.490> important<00:00:06.029> rudiments<00:00:06.480> that

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
one of the more important rudiments that

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.880 
one of the more important rudiments that
you're<00:00:06.750> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.960> study<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.620> set<00:00:07.799> of

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
you're going to study on the set of

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.970 
you're going to study on the set of
drums<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.519> called<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.059> double<00:00:09.179> stroke<00:00:09.630> roll

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
drums is called the double stroke roll

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.470 
drums is called the double stroke roll
really<00:00:10.980> any<00:00:11.219> role<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.910> study<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
really any role that you study and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.270 
really any role that you study and
understand<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.200> important<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> double

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
understand is important but the double

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.150 
understand is important but the double
stroke<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.820> something<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:16.020> works<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
stroke is something that works the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.040 
stroke is something that works the
muscles<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.580> your<00:00:17.609> hands<00:00:18.119> really<00:00:18.390> gets<00:00:18.779> your

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
muscles in your hands really gets your

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.590 
muscles in your hands really gets your
hands<00:00:19.350> moving<00:00:19.770> especially<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.670> round<00:00:21.000> set<00:00:21.510> of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
hands moving especially a round set of

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
hands moving especially a round set of
drums<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.769> play<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.039> more<00:00:23.220> on

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
drums but I'm going to play it more on

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
drums but I'm going to play it more on
the<00:00:23.400> snare<00:00:23.730> drum<00:00:23.789> today<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:25.050> where

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the snare drum today so you see where

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
the snare drum today so you see where
you<00:00:26.039> start<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> certain<00:00:27.240> techniques<00:00:27.660> are

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you start and certain techniques are

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
you start and certain techniques are
involved<00:00:28.550> basically<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> double<00:00:29.970> stroke

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
involved basically the double stroke

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.939 
involved basically the double stroke
roll<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.539> exactly<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> says<00:00:31.590> where

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
roll is exactly what it says where

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.620 
roll is exactly what it says where
you're<00:00:32.070> getting<00:00:32.279> two<00:00:32.579> strokes<00:00:33.030> per<00:00:33.390> hand

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you're getting two strokes per hand

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.040 
you're getting two strokes per hand
right<00:00:34.500> right<00:00:34.770> left<00:00:35.460> left<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:36.000> right<00:00:36.690> left

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
right right left left right right left

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
right right left left right right left
left<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> you're<00:00:38.190> moving<00:00:38.309> back<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.790> forth<00:00:39.059> up

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
left and you're moving back and forth up

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.380 
left and you're moving back and forth up
to<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.390> tempo<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.200> becomes<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.980> clean<00:00:41.390> steady

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
to a tempo that becomes a clean steady

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810 
to a tempo that becomes a clean steady
stream<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.840> notes<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> start<00:00:44.610> off<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
stream of notes now to start off a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.670 
stream of notes now to start off a
double<00:00:45.210> stroke<00:00:45.510> roll<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.050> way<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> lot<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
double stroke roll the way that a lot of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
double stroke roll the way that a lot of
people<00:00:47.039> begin<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> basically<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.210> drop<00:00:48.510> their

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
people begin is basically to drop their

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.830 
people begin is basically to drop their
stick<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> bounce<00:00:50.879> sometimes

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
stick and to get a bounce sometimes

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
stick and to get a bounce sometimes
called<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> double<00:00:52.440> bounce<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:53.640> each<00:00:53.760> stick

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
called a double bounce from each stick

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
called a double bounce from each stick
so<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.719> drop<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.530> let<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.860> bounce<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
so you drop it and let it bounce and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:05.000 
so you drop it and let it bounce and
pick<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.850> after<00:00:57.059> two<00:01:02.989> now<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.830> that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
pick it up after two now with that

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.100 
pick it up after two now with that
approach<00:01:05.430> you're<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> eventually<00:01:06.689> hit

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
approach you're going to eventually hit

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.289 
approach you're going to eventually hit
a<00:01:07.140> wall<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.890> how<00:01:08.010> fast<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:08.640> clean<00:01:09.060> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
a wall of how fast and how clean you

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
a wall of how fast and how clean you
could<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.380> over<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> period<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.220> time<00:01:11.490> what

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
could go so over a period of time what

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000 
could go so over a period of time what
you<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> try<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> work<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.020> called<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you want to try to work on is called a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.429 
you want to try to work on is called a
push-pull<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.390> sometimes<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> call<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
push-pull or sometimes what I call a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.950 
push-pull or sometimes what I call a
throw<00:01:16.860> pull<00:01:17.250> grip<00:01:17.909> where<00:01:18.540> you're<00:01:18.689> throwing

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
throw pull grip where you're throwing

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.530 
throw pull grip where you're throwing
your<00:01:19.320> arm<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.369> stick<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.090> head<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
your arm or the stick at the head and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.899 
your arm or the stick at the head and
you're<00:01:22.110> yanking<00:01:22.439> back<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> second<00:01:23.610> stroke

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you're yanking back on the second stroke

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
you're yanking back on the second stroke
so<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:24.720> fingers<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.369> your

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
so that your fingers actually and your

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.520 
so that your fingers actually and your
arm<00:01:26.670> actually<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:28.080> motion<00:01:28.259> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
arm actually have a little motion in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.060 
arm actually have a little motion in
this<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.360> one<00:01:30.360> series<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.229> doubles<00:01:31.619> would<00:01:31.890> look

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
this so one series of doubles would look

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:42.440 
this so one series of doubles would look
something<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:40.939> as<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.060> pick<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.420> my

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
something like this so as I pick up my

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.410 
something like this so as I pick up my
arm<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.619> throw<00:01:43.649> portion<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.820> throwing<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
arm the throw portion is throwing the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.050 
arm the throw portion is throwing the
stick<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.170> head<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.250> pull<00:01:47.520> portion

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
stick at the head and the pull portion

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.240 
stick at the head and the pull portion
is<00:01:48.240> yanking<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.259> stick<00:01:49.500> back<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.979> get<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
is yanking the stick back to get that

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.429 
is yanking the stick back to get that
second<00:01:50.700> stroke<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.240> hopefully<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.049> work<00:01:52.259> on

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
second stroke and hopefully you work on

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.990 
second stroke and hopefully you work on
it<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.829> controlled<00:01:53.340> enough<00:01:53.610> where<00:01:53.939> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it to get it controlled enough where you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480 
it to get it controlled enough where you
get<00:01:54.149> two<00:01:54.299> strokes<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.770> speed<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.280> in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
get two strokes so as you speed it up in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.249 
get two strokes so as you speed it up in
both<00:01:56.640> hands<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.210> looks<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.719> sounds<00:01:57.899> something

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
both hands it looks and sounds something

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:23.390 
both hands it looks and sounds something
like<00:01:58.409> this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.700 

and<00:02:24.570> that's<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.660> good<00:02:25.810> starting<00:02:26.200> point<00:02:26.410> for

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
and that's a good starting point for

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.670 
and that's a good starting point for
developing<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:27.130> double<00:02:27.400> stroke<00:02:27.610> roll
