00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
Corsair Vengeance which is I believe

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.810 
Corsair Vengeance which is I believe
it's<00:02:44.410> just<00:02:44.470> slightly<00:02:44.770> smaller<00:02:44.920> than<00:02:45.640> the

it's just slightly smaller than the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.030 
it's just slightly smaller than the
corsair<00:02:46.770> dominator<00:02:48.930> see<00:02:49.930> here<00:02:50.140> there's<00:02:50.920> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040
