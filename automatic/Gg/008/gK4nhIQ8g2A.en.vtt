here that looks at gold in Brazilian
rial<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.060> yen<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> Argentine

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
rial the yen and I think the Argentine

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.210 
rial the yen and I think the Argentine
peso<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.090> could<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.479> paid<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> ruble<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
peso I could have paid the ruble was so

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
peso I could have paid the ruble was so
in<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.360> currencies

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
in in these currencies

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.649 
in in these currencies
you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.040> since<00:01:47.310> 2011<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.270> price<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.570> gold

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you know since 2011 the price of gold

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.660 
you know since 2011 the price of gold
dropped<00:01:49.070> 36%<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.759> very<00:01:51.409> Argentine<00:01:52.409> peso<00:01:52.890> it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
dropped 36% but very Argentine peso it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.600 
dropped 36% but very Argentine peso it's
actually<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.299> 36%<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.250> kind<00:01:56.549> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
actually up 36% and so this is kind of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.969 
actually up 36% and so this is kind of
the<00:01:56.729> global<00:01:57.090> opportunity<00:01:57.750> correct<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.469> gold

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the global opportunity correct so gold

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.670 
the global opportunity correct so gold
has<00:01:59.250> essentially<00:02:00.049> gained<00:02:01.049> purchasing<00:02:01.500> power

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
has essentially gained purchasing power

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.230 
has essentially gained purchasing power
against<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.189> currencies<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> big

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
against all currencies one of the big

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.520 
against all currencies one of the big
issues<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.600> gold<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> last

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
issues with gold is it for the last

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.459 
issues with gold is it for the last

of gold gold has been adopted as in sort

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.470 
of gold gold has been adopted as in sort
of<00:02:10.410> an<00:02:10.530> investment<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.879> it's<00:02:12.120> created

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
of an investment and it's it's created

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.860 
of an investment and it's it's created
the<00:02:12.569> situation<00:02:12.750> where<00:02:13.200> people<00:02:13.290> debate

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
the situation where people debate

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.240 
the situation where people debate
whether<00:02:14.050> gold<00:02:14.319> is<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> better<00:02:14.680> investment<00:02:14.830> than

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
whether gold is a better investment than

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.130 
whether gold is a better investment than
Apple<00:02:15.610> or<00:02:15.730> Google<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.750> truth<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.110> that

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
Apple or Google and the truth is that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.050 
Apple or Google and the truth is that
gold<00:02:17.470> should<00:02:17.769> never<00:02:18.040> be<00:02:18.280> measured<00:02:18.489> versus

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
gold should never be measured versus

gold should never be measured versus

investments should be measured versus

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.259 
investments should be measured versus
currencies<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.610> we<00:02:21.700> measured<00:02:21.970> against

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
currencies and we measured against

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.729 
currencies and we measured against
currencies<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.870> unequivocally<00:02:23.530> gains

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
currencies it unequivocally gains

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.550

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.970 
currency so why has it never been done
before<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.310> bring<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.819> to<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.660> platform<00:04:11.380> that

before and bring it to the platform that
you<00:04:12.160> have<00:04:12.489> so<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.910> technology<00:04:13.720> exists<00:04:14.200> today

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
you have so the technology exists today

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.589 
you have so the technology exists today
where<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.829> may<00:04:14.950> not<00:04:14.980> have<00:04:15.340> existed<00:04:16.209> before

2<00:04:59.349> week<00:04:59.379> 3<00:04:59.530> weeks<00:04:59.889> what<00:05:00.280> we<00:05:00.430> were<00:05:00.580> able<00:05:00.729> to<00:05:00.969> do

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
2 week 3 weeks what we were able to do

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.240 
2 week 3 weeks what we were able to do
was<00:05:01.900> basically<00:05:02.169> shortened<00:05:02.560> settlement<00:05:02.979> cycle

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
was basically shortened settlement cycle

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.680 
was basically shortened settlement cycle
for<00:05:03.370> gold<00:05:03.520> down<00:05:03.669> to<00:05:03.819> as<00:05:03.940> little<00:05:04.090> as<00:05:04.270> 10<00:05:04.509> minutes

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.899 
for gold down to as little as 10 minutes
and<00:05:05.020> then<00:05:05.440> make<00:05:05.650> it<00:05:05.680> thus<00:05:06.009> compatible<00:05:06.789> with

and then make it thus compatible with

and then make it thus compatible with
the<00:05:07.000> existing<00:05:07.419> payment<00:05:07.599> rails<00:05:07.930> so<00:05:08.469> we're<00:05:08.650> able

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
example I was a portfolio manager I

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.930 
example I was a portfolio manager I
never<00:05:56.169> had<00:05:56.379> over<00:05:56.650> a<00:05:56.680> 10%<00:05:57.250> waiting<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:57.699> gold

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
never had over a 10% waiting in gold

never had over a 10% waiting in gold
what<00:05:58.659> I<00:05:58.690> believe<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.229> that<00:05:59.259> as<00:05:59.469> you<00:05:59.589> go<00:05:59.770> down

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
what I believe is that as you go down

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.219 
what I believe is that as you go down
the<00:06:00.190> socio-economic<00:06:00.550> ladder<00:06:00.969> gold<00:06:01.900> is<00:06:02.050> more

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
the socio-economic ladder gold is more

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.320 
the socio-economic ladder gold is more
relevant<00:06:02.469> to<00:06:02.830> people<00:06:03.129> and<00:06:03.520> if<00:06:03.729> I<00:06:03.819> if<00:06:04.000> I<00:06:04.120> take<00:06:04.150> a

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
relevant to people and if I if I take a

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.790 
relevant to people and if I if I take a
piece<00:06:04.629> of<00:06:04.779> gold<00:06:04.900> today<00:06:05.139> and<00:06:05.349> I<00:06:05.379> look<00:06:05.560> it<00:06:05.680> I

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
piece of gold today and I look it I

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.990 
piece of gold today and I look it I
can't<00:06:06.039> tell<00:06:06.250> you<00:06:06.370> what<00:06:06.490> it's<00:06:06.580> gonna<00:06:06.699> be<00:06:06.879> worth

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000

trained to only view investments that I

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:13.769 
trained to only view investments that I
could<00:06:12.490> calculate<00:06:12.699> their<00:06:13.060> intrinsic<00:06:13.330> value

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
could calculate their intrinsic value

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.200 
could calculate their intrinsic value
