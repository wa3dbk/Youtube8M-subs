00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.760

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.519
 separate plot as it were here 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.949
 such a topic hello everyone with you 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:22.130
 Michael tailors and the theme is what 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.380
 The fact is that I am very busy in life 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.119
 time man that is, I have little 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.769
 there is a free minute if big 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.409
 the letter comes here I have there there 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.079
 ten very good big interesting 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.940
 letters but huge and I have no time 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.219
 answer them connect small 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.050
 grabbed there wrote down a piece of paper and 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.239
 went though a lot I miss 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.739
 so I am very limited in time and 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.589
 I often know this here 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.600
 let the season well, that's another sense giving 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.199
 not so scary but let's say the new year 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.719
 when or my birthday is easy 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.440

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.079
 may come there five hundred six hundred 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.810
 emails from living people that is not something 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.720
 there some robot writes these too send 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.590
 I pay attention and here are living people 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.260
 and they are generally not a pattern 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.750
 outside the box is not a carbon copy but they write 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.350
 some kind words about how 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.540
 their lives have changed how they are grateful 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.870
 as they wish you every success and 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.580
 so on and it will make me monstrous 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.260
 completely position because i 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.780
 absolutely not able to not 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.940
 five hundred six hundred i i'm even 50 not in 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.580
 able to respond normally to sit down 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.010
 and with feeling sensibly with the arrangement 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.890
 write if i write something and be there 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.510
 cafe will eat do everything in a row 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.550
 it is humiliating it is humiliating for me 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.080
 it's not good for them I don't know 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.410

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.210

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.960
 Well , somehow here is my way to apologize there 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.020

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.760

 physical ability so I already 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.120

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.060

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.740

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.240
