hole for the camera and the apple so I'm
just<00:01:24.380> gonna<00:01:24.530> circle<00:01:25.100> both<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.610> those<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.360> that

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
just gonna circle both of those so that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.740 
just gonna circle both of those so that
I<00:01:26.840> know<00:01:26.960> um<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:28.369> know<00:01:28.520> how<00:01:28.880> much<00:01:29.060> face<00:01:29.450> it

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
I know um you know how much face it

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.780 
I know um you know how much face it
needs<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.530> be<00:01:30.649> cut<00:01:30.829> out<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:30.979> where<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.520> stuff

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
needs to be cut out and where and stuff

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.100 
needs to be cut out and where and stuff
so<00:01:31.969> I'd<00:01:32.030> only<00:01:32.270> guesstimate<00:01:32.810> because<00:01:32.990> that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
so I'd only guesstimate because that

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.139 
so I'd only guesstimate because that
would<00:01:33.290> fail<00:01:33.560> then<00:01:34.189> you<00:01:34.310> take<00:01:34.610> out<00:01:34.759> your<00:01:34.789> phone
