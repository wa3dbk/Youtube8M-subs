00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello to everyone sipix we get 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.220
 found today for a new 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.120
 video 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:12.389
 so this is a pvp video so already for 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.139
 start I'm going to put in mode 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:21.119
 tactical then it's between ziga a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.240
 rogue level 2 are so on 6 with 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.720
 very good reses of fixed heresy of late 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 and especially in the land of fire as here 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.129
 amy him a palette where a bomb to me 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.260
 I'm not saying we're level 200 with 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.590
 fishnet for her purposes low compared to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590
 his opponent 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.730
 so i'm going to see cpa finally taught me 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.280
 that the picole that's it increases like 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:59.510
 you can see go up to 50% stalled in 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 11.6 also then 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.750
 the grades so it's a curly slip 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.409
 who is bold of 8 I believe yeah that must 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.000
 to be free 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.100
 I would have a little more information for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 you do penven videos because 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.890
 me as soon as I have a fight and I go 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.250
 on it and zynga which is good they 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.229
 have a fat shield of 4.3 that's got to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.619
 to be that so a bomb with a lot 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:31.039
 of points 10 750 points of villabon 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:34.250
 it's completely one in 3p is hungry 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.250
 it's enormous 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.960
 we do not see the tackles so if I 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.160
 you make this video come my daring osa 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.370
 gratis left steph because my coronation 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.270
 he died on the mound for a 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.820
 a little stupid history 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.950
 that's because it was during 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.110
 weekend weekend know heroic in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.270
 done when we die on the beta but we 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.450
 loses they will perceive wine level 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.390
 1 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.890
 finally go back to level 1 so that's it 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.480
 it's flaccid standards when even a 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.540
 produces all percent and 84 sets of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.520
 game very good place that then the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.610
 stability by putting contract finally to 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.360
 the rogue because he can no longer the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.950
 move in the good ones a panda that was 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.560
 very well as it should be noticed and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.270
 blocks his opponent and this even if 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.230
 block a rogue it's because he 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.580
 easy for the coup the rogue who plays 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.270
 well also by putting him mass 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.940
 erosion it goes up to 60 per turn 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.860
 erosion which is pretty huge 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.340
 so both characters have each 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.340
 their style of play 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.150
 while in Finland in any case a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.740
 bomb that is getting bigger over there 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.260
 that the panda will surely kill with a 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.120
 flabby 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.140
 here we go I see the panda panda 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.550
 largely winner on this fight is 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.860
 does a lot of damage and 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.570
 it's very well played the rogue who is 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.260
 made to the powders on his bomb and the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.920
 rogue like took advantage and I would like 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.349
 very well his character 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.730
 finally the panda who have benefited I am 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:30.709
 not too much what I said I lose myself a 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:32.390
 little so the libÃ© who threw ball and 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.660
 then blunder again to put de 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.660
 erosion 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.040
 mam and really hurt this panda 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.790
 do a lot of damage 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.069
 look at that vim 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.510
 I do not want to calculate everything 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.519
 three hundred times 3 let's say it does 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.030
 900 so a thousand a little less than 1000 per 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:00.890
 turn which is pretty huge 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.220
 despite the 84 sets the bomb is launched 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.220
 but I think that 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:16.859
 it's coming from nothing he's done completely 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:18.989
 smash the rogue then the little good 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.230
 ok me it's still a wall me 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.710
 put a bot I think sure to make a 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.710
 maximum damage 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.530
 that's it but it's over for him it's a 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.520
 very fast fight as good 5 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.410
 minutes but as I end I was able 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.660
 watch the views on me on my videos 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.760
 and apparently you like them 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.960
 pvp fighting there is that goes up to a lot of 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.170
 seen I will try to make you 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.640
 so the panda that was free and the 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.750
 rogue grade 4 so that's pretty much 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.820
 what I said here thank you for having 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.910
 followed this video and bye bye all the 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.910
 world
