can execute on the device open twitter

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.050 
can execute on the device open twitter
create<00:00:56.720> a<00:00:56.750> direct<00:00:57.320> message<00:00:57.590> it<00:00:58.490> will<00:00:58.760> be<00:00:58.910> on

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
create a direct message it will be on

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.060 
create a direct message it will be on
the<00:00:59.240> android<00:00:59.750> device<00:01:00.080> which<00:01:00.350> is<00:01:00.500> on<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.710> right

the android device which is on the right

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.520 
the android device which is on the right
side<00:01:01.400> so<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:02.270> will<00:01:02.450> open<00:01:02.630> twitter<00:01:03.020> create<00:01:03.500> a

list of the direct messages next on the
left<00:01:11.780> side<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.260> see<00:01:12.560> an<00:01:12.800> iOS<00:01:13.280> phone<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
left side you see an iOS phone the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.080 
left side you see an iOS phone the
iPhone<00:01:14.600> will<00:01:14.810> open<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.680> web<00:01:16.130> in<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.850> face<00:01:17.060> of

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so Twitter is opening we are moving

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.700 
so Twitter is opening we are moving
through<00:01:31.109> the<00:01:31.259> direct<00:01:31.560> message<00:01:32.490> bitch

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
through the direct message bitch

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.280 
through the direct message bitch
we<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.370> counting<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.479> number<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> messages

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
we are counting the number of messages

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.440 
we are counting the number of messages
and<00:01:38.570> we<00:01:39.570> create<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.170> new<00:01:40.290> message

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.719 

when<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.200> message<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.680> sent<00:01:45.979> out<00:01:46.159> we<00:01:46.640> are

when the message is sent out we are

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.179 
when the message is sent out we are
going<00:01:46.969> to<00:01:47.149> verify<00:01:47.930> if<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.710> number<00:01:49.159> of

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
going to verify if the number of

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.209 
going to verify if the number of
messages<00:01:49.909> is<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.899> previous<00:01:51.409> number<00:01:51.799> plus<00:01:52.219> one

functionality<00:03:31.780> we<00:03:31.870> call<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.230> spy<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:33.249> that<00:03:33.459> you

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
functionality we call it spy so that you

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.849 
functionality we call it spy so that you
are<00:03:33.760> able<00:03:33.969> to<00:03:34.780> look<00:03:34.930> at<00:03:35.079> all<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.439> different<00:03:35.560> UI

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
are able to look at all the different UI

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.250 
are able to look at all the different UI
elements<00:03:36.430> for<00:03:36.639> example<00:03:37.030> this<00:03:37.150> button<00:03:37.569> you<00:03:38.079> can

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
elements for example this button you can

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.520 
elements for example this button you can
see<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:39.639> is<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:40.030> label<00:03:40.659> you<00:03:40.870> can<00:03:41.049> access

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
see that it is a label you can access

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.740 
see that it is a label you can access
all<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.859> different<00:03:42.340> properties<00:03:42.849> and<00:03:43.090> all

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
all the different properties and all

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.119 
all the different properties and all
these<00:03:43.900> properties<00:03:44.349> can<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:44.620> used<00:03:44.980> for

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
these properties can be used for

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.220 
these properties can be used for
verification<00:03:46.030> purposes<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.750> synchronization

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
verification purposes of synchronization

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.699 
verification purposes of synchronization
purpose<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.760> order<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.299> recognize<00:03:49.689> the<00:03:50.139> object

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
purpose in order to recognize the object

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.849 
purpose in order to recognize the object
etc<00:03:51.579> so<00:03:52.239> it's<00:03:52.419> a<00:03:52.480> very<00:03:52.510> powerful<00:03:52.930> tool<00:03:53.260> it

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
etc so it's a very powerful tool it

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.149 
etc so it's a very powerful tool it
allows<00:03:54.219> you<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:55.150> test<00:03:56.019> dynamic<00:03:56.950> information

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
allows you to test dynamic information

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.209 
allows you to test dynamic information
inside<00:03:58.090> your<00:03:58.329> mobile<00:03:58.750> app<00:03:58.959> using<00:03:59.829> native
