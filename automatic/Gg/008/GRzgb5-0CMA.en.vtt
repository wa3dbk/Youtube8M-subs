 to show you the elegant shoes that 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.120
 do not imagine in streams I see me in 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.250
 the room to be able to sign this video 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.840
 it's practically in my collection 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.509
 full of shoes is not that I have 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.160
 so much I know I have enough regarding 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.169
 when I lived in Cuba I obviously have 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.899
 very many but with respect to others 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.849
 youtubers that I have seen very expensive that 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.710
 they have a klose full of shoes no no 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.370
 that's not my case but we're going for 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.130
 that way like elegant shoes those 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.170
 that you put on you are very beautiful posts 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.859
 but if they tell you you have to walk two 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.420
 blocks you start crying here are 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.670
 these are from steve madden look what 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.730
 beauty of shoes have all these 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.469
 stones embedded here iridescent and 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.140
 I love that because you can 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.050
 combine with dresses of all 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.449
 colors practically white blue pink 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.269
 black purple because the pebbles 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.790
 when it gives them light 20 they reflect all 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.530
 those colors this type of shoe is left 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.380
 super cute, I feel that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.600
 immediately stylize the foot and the other 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.880
 pair of shoes that I have for 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.670
 exit so a little more elegant than me 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.920
 love the good color if they are set as 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.780
 I already told them I always try to invest in 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.460
 shoes that have neutral colors that 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.030
 then we can combine them easily 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.680
 and this I think has a very color 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.350
 delicate and is also super cute 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.140
 put these are from nine west too 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.270
 this was already taught a hole lie down 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.180
 that had the whole golden sole because 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.830
 the gold lost in some parts is 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.350
 but of course in our collection 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.929
 they should not miss the colorful shoes 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.630
 those that are coral color look at what 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.429
 cute these are tall but what I 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.850
 go with this pair of shoes and they are very 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.860
 cute but very comfortable are these for 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.300
 put them on is riding in the car in 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.940
 get to the place 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.280
 sit up riding in the car in the car 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.200
 and go back to your house already and the other pair of 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.020
 colored shoes that I have this this 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.759
 that I love them especially for the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.739
 color but also because they are comfortable 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.959
 these and they are comfortable with these I can 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.030
 I do not know if they will be able to appreciate 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.710
 the camera but it has here like a 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.740
 golden dots 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.170
 they are from the brand bikers do not pronounce 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.300
 that's how you write bikers they had a 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.650
 shop in the moll I have a mola here 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.230
 it is removed from the house that is the mold 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.640
 adventure but they already closed it gave me 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.440
 tremendous sadness because I loved them 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.690
 the shoes of them but I think that in the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.270
 dolphin mobile if they still have the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.070
 store there is a video this video is 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.800

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.200
 darkened and the bugs are starting to 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.760
 to get inside the house 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.590
 I will go quickly to show you the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.180
 peculiar shoes because I did not want 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.640

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.010

 all these stones here in the part of 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.760
 go ahead and have this kind of strip 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.100
 that you give more race around standing and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.290

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.490
 that is higher but these shoes 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.130
