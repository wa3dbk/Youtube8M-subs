 Hi guys. Justin is here with AmericanMuscle.com and I'm going to take a closer look at 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.299
 One of the most popular spoiler options available in your late S197. I'm talking about this 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:17.220
 GT500 style brake, available either unpainted or pre-painted, fit your 2010 through 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.740
 2014 Mustang. When weighing your aftermarket spoiler options for your S197, I think you'll 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.470
 Find my favorite hands down with many owners out there, and I'm among them, GT500 is a style 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.720
 Spoiler for many different reasons. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.230
 The biggest reason for being really adds to the aggressive here is the back of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.580
 Car without being over-top. As for the building, the men, we are looking at lasting after 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.210
 Very lightweight AVS plastic to build. Now as I mentioned at the top of this video, 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.610
 You have the option of grabbing this spoiler either unpainted, if you have paint-link-up 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.980
 Or if you are going to paint it yourself, or for a few more dollars you can actually spring 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.350
 For PREPAINTED version, we have installed our 2011 GT here. 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.420
 Now PREPAINTED parts do not get sprayed right here in our state-of-the-art paint booth 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.689
 AM, the best part is, since we use the same paint and clear coat Ford uses in the 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.719
 Their factories, you could expect the perfect color match right out of the box. Getting 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.799
 The new spoiler installed on for your trip is really not difficult to function but will 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.850
 Spend some time removing this spoiler plant, which can be a bit stubborn. Mine 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 Advice and use a heat gun or hair dryer or something like that, just take your time. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.979
 Now once you get this thing out of the way, it's just a matter of just cleaning up 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.979
 Prepared area using alcohol supplied prep pads and 3M adhesion promoters 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.920
 Then get this thing installed in place. 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.319
 Now the nice thing about this particular spoiler is to do re-use the holes left by the bolt 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.170
 Your factory spoiler does not even drill necessary. Now we do call it two hours here on the site 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.670
 But again, expect more of the time to be spent removing this factory spoiler but again, 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.920
