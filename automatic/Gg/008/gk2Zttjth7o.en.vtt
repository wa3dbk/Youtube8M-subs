00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.639
 pull over an expired year there 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.270

 2012 13 that stands out or you have 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.530
 you will surely remember for a long time 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.430
 In any case, the home-wm is very 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.020
 certainly the season highlight 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.910
 or world champion title 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.169
 but basically were in this 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.629
 season so much courier inside where i say 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.530
 just so the sporty as well 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.780
 driving at a high level 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.730
 what will remain in memory will be in 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.190
 the public is certainly the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.659
 world championship and the total 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.850
 World Cup victory and maybe the 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.219
 small crystal ball in the slalom we then 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 ran the course or the two 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.999
 runs 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.159
 that was fantastic 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.800
 and yes and of course, if you yourself 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.569
 Also in the top sport in it knows what 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.149
 it needs and what a mental 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.829
 climb it then I need but only 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.159
 say hat off to this performance 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.680
 what was the top highlight for you in 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.030
 This past year is easy for us 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.540
 Of course it is the silver medal 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.700
 been at the wm in schladming 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.409
 that was such a salvation and for 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.149
 I'm probably just the right one 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.390
 time in my career just times 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.950
 Thank you got back and that was a 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.450
 more beautiful and better than us 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.340
 below that is finally working though 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.170
 a single medal therefore of the last one 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.680
 Year was of course the paralympics in 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.960
 london about 800 meters away and 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.260
 that could have been metals 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.020
 she also locates unfairly 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.880
 the highlight of my previous 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.640
 previous athlete life was my son 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.860
 very mixed hey so always many 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.750
 up and down option for me the highlight 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.750
 she was in muddy for the medal 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.880
 although a lot more would have hoped 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.480
 but hello has the whole life is 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.520

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.750
 the on and departures the domestic very 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.480
 shaped and that reminded me 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.010
 actually an external pressure now very much 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.300
 Glad the conclusion as table leader 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.550
 to stand there is certainly one 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.870
 highlight owns what my life 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.580

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.310

 Hummer has that is so exquisite 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.820
 knowledge of this home-wm with man 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.920
 sometimes he can go crazy where he is 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.390

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.780
 moments you always live in 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.410
