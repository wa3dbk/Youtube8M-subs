00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.430
 very good evening and welcome again 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.080
 to lost elegance I find myself as not 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 with the other part this program our 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.760
 fashion expert jose lopez very good 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 jose nights are good you've given me this 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.820
 I have it here that we're going to talk about today 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.370
 if today we have prepared a program of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.570
 about protocol 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.980
 completely many times we will receive 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.110
 some invitation we will not have to go to 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.790
 some act some event and if you can us 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.040
 specify to dress in some way 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.500
 then today we are going to touch those diverse 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.870
 things that they can receive and so what 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.750
 have a little bit easier here 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.970
 several cards the eight a putin more 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.500
 simple as a game then we have 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.020
 created some cards that will not be these 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.580
 can receive but well let's ride 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.110
 so they can be a little placed we're going to 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.510
 I need to put next stop making 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.460
 which you want to come and imagine me 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.960
 receive this one that I have here the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.050
 exactly if you receive an invitation 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.940
 where the specific black tic or by 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.860
 example in Spanish 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.020
 they have to dress up they would have 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.580
 that going with a tuxedo is also possible 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.360
 that they receive it in French with which 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.900
 it would be recorded 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.000
 do not 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.710
 when we have to wear tuxedo then here 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 we have pointed to a series of sites where 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.520
 can where you usually carry the mobile 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.530
 whenever you specify it for example 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.510
 if they follow us specify that they know that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.370
 can go to the opera you can go with the 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.530
 making will have seen that in many 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.720
 casinos are also asked please the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 people go like kings and especially the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.970
 monkey is a cocktail garment itself that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.550
 we have to about mobbing 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.410
 we will do a program if we want well 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.350
 this type of garments are we have to 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.930
 say for example that the tuxedo tuxedo 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.040
 or tops exactly the same only 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.020
 For example, in Europe we call it 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.380
 tuxedo 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.149
 and in the USA they call it the torcedor and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.060
 about this garment there is a small litigation 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.459
 enter in this case English Americans 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.800
 not by who was the first that what 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.800
 he put it that he started using it 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.900
 I really do not take sides or for 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.209
 henri paul in this case by the club 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.819
 tucson but I would say that like almost all 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.890
 the garments 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.879
 I believe he was born in england 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.769
 specifically the star of henri paul 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.659
 which is one of the most famous and the most 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.340
 old health road one we leave there 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.769
 that doubt and if some spectator wants 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.170
 so investigate your account we go with the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.359
 next to see for example we receive 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.879
 this one that I have here that puts without 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.579
 specify exactly if we made 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.349
 An invitation where nothing does not appear 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.750
 tells us nothing as it tells us nothing like 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.099
 we should continue we would always understand that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.450
 it's half sticker half sticker 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.689
 it means that we have and the suit 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.620
 we have and the suit 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.590
 I will explain this to you because normally 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.450
 when you receive an invitation from this 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.919
 type is because people are still 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.560
 working then he is asked to go 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.510
 as he himself is like himself is he does not want 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.139
 to say that they go in bedclothes or that 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.269
 go in summer clothes but they can 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.310
 go with him with the same attire that 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.210
 were the work can attend this 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.950
 meeting 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.570
 any type of event without another without 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.220
 protocol will normally ask you to 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.830
 go with suit keep in mind that 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.870
 always this suit should be in shades 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.000
 blue or gray in summer 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.940
 be for example much clearer but 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.400
 black must never be really black 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.320
 is a color that is always for the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.030
 two more rigorous clothes and more 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.100
 serious that is that there are that are the morning 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.230
 and the frac and in the case of being a woman 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.970
 example that destroys us with a suit 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.200
 we can not use it in black for a 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.670
 kind of event like this for that guy 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.160
 of event that does not specify that each 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.080
 one can go yes that could be in black 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.210
 keep in mind that the color black always 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.300
 it is a color that is for a color 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.060
 nightly agree and it's the most formal 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.100
 that we find clear here the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.190
 question is often people often 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.990
 say where is the cut to dress from 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.940
 day shape with lighter colors for 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.250
 dress in a more serious way concorde 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.680
 more dark problems really the cut 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.540
 it is from 6 in the evening 6 o'clock 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.280
 of our time is the big time where 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.590
 everything should be changed where 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.770
 Normally if we receive the invitation 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.320
 will specify that it is nocturnal or any 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.570
 type of club parties 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.760
 where I invite them in order is normally 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.520
 without specifying that put half label 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.010
 agree very well to see the following 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.780
 card that we have here what 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.650
 we would call ourselves a rigorous label 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.560
 what would be the white and the krabat in 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.820
 this case speaking in agreement when 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.460
 we received this kind of invitation 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.630
 we always have to go with coats we have 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.880
 commented before both the morning coat and 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.350
 the frac are those two types of objects 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.230
 that they carry with us let's say that 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.570
 they would be the elders of the current clothes 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.980
 almost 200 years that have not changed and no 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.750
 they have varied 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.000
 in some program we will also play the 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.950
 fracc part by part but if ever 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.230
 have seen one that I suppose so 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.060
 You will see that its shape is a bit special 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.470
 going to pull back and normally 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.570
 open from behind 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.360
 this is because before as he was riding 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.420
 horse those openings allowed it to 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.400
 that could result in the leg 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.380
 could be in perfect in flaws the 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.880
 I'll ask you, I'll call 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.570
 vulgarly the penguin costume 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.510
 exactly the penguin costume that is 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.470
 more elegant 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.020
 when they can ask us to go 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.870
 any kind of real reception already 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.510
 what luck the one that receives it clear dinners 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.610
 also of the aristocracy or the 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.230
 nobility if you are ever given the 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.740
 Nobel prize will surely also have 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.199
 to go in frac 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.550
 and other people who can use the 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.220
 brake your daily life can be 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.860
 also the musicians the directors of 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.750
 orchestra that also usually use it 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.880
 and finally I have here exactly the 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.740
 morning with 5 we will be talking 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.890
 always in the morning 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.200
 in this case daytime morning coat I find 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.460
 which is not for especially for weddings 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.470
 currently used mostly for 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.670
 weddings but you can also really 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.280
 use for example for any type 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.620
 of reception in descents as we have seen 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.790
 for weddings for burials also and in 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.920
 the wind the 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.960
 always distinguish between what 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.390
 we would speak of diurnal the government of 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.610
 turn 21 you can use a morning coat that 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.650
 be for example gray would be accepted 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.330
 but nevertheless when we pass that 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.190
 Barrier six in the afternoon if that 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.560
 it should be already dark colors we would have 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.880
 of the ebb and we would talk about black frock coat 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.980
 agreement and the bread is more what are 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.979
 in gray but with what is called a thousand 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.750
 Stripes is also black 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:45.340
 receptions weddings burials if by 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.470
 example if queen isabel of england 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.349
 scott is invited to know that they have 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.060
 to go with the Nordic to them what 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.069
 they would call wine is chaqué and 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.199
 women with pamela and women 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:57.139
 do we are going to pass with panela if you re 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.539
 service 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.479
 then those would be four let's say 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:05.259
 the 44 events or the four ways 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.610
 where they will be asked to wear an area 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:09.800
 good protocol are four either 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.479
 very complicated is not easy they do it 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.249
 today I really believe that doubt 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.800
 It is always when we receive the 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:17.870
 invitation and does not appear for example as 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.219
 of a price yes that true with the 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.499
 years as everyone has done more casual 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.939
 now let's say let's say certain 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:25.249
 not licenses but I think that always 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:28.310
 it is good to know for less how to do it 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:31.279
 then each one that with his criterion makes 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.979
 and what you like, well, you know 

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:35.840
 you already at least know him already 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:38.090
 they know how they should dress then in each 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.039
 gala in each event and today and if you receive the 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.930
 invitation, they know what it means and 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:43.699
 how should go thank you very much jose escape 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.620
 they are a life all of you already know 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:48.909
 we'll see each other in the next 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.909
 lost elegance program
