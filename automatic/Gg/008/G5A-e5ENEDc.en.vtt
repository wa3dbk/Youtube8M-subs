00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
hey boys and girls it's me and let's say

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.630 
hey boys and girls it's me and let's say
Chevrolet<00:00:30.470> car<00:00:31.470> radio<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.980> guy<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.430> made

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
Chevrolet car radio this guy was made

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.869 
Chevrolet car radio this guy was made
even<00:00:35.790> before<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.420> born

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
even before I was born

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
even before I was born
so<00:00:38.879> basically<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.540> acquired<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.170> from<00:00:40.470> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
so basically I acquired this from a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
so basically I acquired this from a
gentleman<00:00:41.040> who<00:00:41.070> asked<00:00:41.580> me<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.000> could<00:00:42.059> repair

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
gentleman who asked me if I could repair

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.640 
gentleman who asked me if I could repair
form<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.620> told<00:00:43.890> him<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.190> probably<00:00:44.460> could<00:00:45.650> so

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
form and I told him I probably could so

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.350 
form and I told him I probably could so
way<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.010> did<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.370> he<00:00:47.489> gave<00:00:47.640> me<00:00:47.790> this<00:00:47.910> REO<00:00:48.150> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
way it did was he gave me this REO to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.079 
way it did was he gave me this REO to
repair<00:00:48.720> so<00:00:49.080> let<00:00:49.230> me<00:00:49.550> show<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:50.790> I've<00:00:50.910> had

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
repair so let me show you what I've had

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.439 
repair so let me show you what I've had
to<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.629> far<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.489> could<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.519> radio<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.300> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
to do so far I could a radio and as you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.619 
to do so far I could a radio and as you
can<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.400> pretty<00:00:57.059> old

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
can see this is pretty old

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.709 
can see this is pretty old
it's<00:00:57.840> got<00:00:58.110> tubes<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.610> one<00:00:59.969> two<00:01:00.390> three

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it's got tubes so I got one two three

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.670 
it's got tubes so I got one two three
four<00:01:02.120> five<00:01:04.100> six<00:01:05.100> tubes<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.880> radio<00:01:06.680> in

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
four five six tubes on this radio in

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.639 
four five six tubes on this radio in
this<00:01:07.800> radio<00:01:08.220> because<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:09.060> six<00:01:09.360> volt<00:01:09.649> car

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
this radio because it's a six volt car

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.969 
this radio because it's a six volt car
radio<00:01:11.009> and<00:01:11.300> Chevy<00:01:12.300> did<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:12.990> go<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.410> 12<00:01:13.770> volt

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
radio and Chevy did not go to 12 volt

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.060 
radio and Chevy did not go to 12 volt
till<00:01:14.190> 1955<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.470> six<00:01:16.920> volt<00:01:17.240> car<00:01:18.240> radio

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
till 1955 this is a six volt car radio

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.880 
till 1955 this is a six volt car radio
so<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.190> biggest<00:01:20.399> challenge<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.060> had<00:01:21.270> was

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
so the biggest challenge I had was

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.529 
so the biggest challenge I had was
trying<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.340> guy<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
trying to get this guy here and this is

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.130 
trying to get this guy here and this is
a<00:01:24.869> vibrator<00:01:25.729> what<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> vibrator<00:01:27.270> does<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
a vibrator what a vibrator does is it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.260 
a vibrator what a vibrator does is it
actually<00:01:28.350> helps<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.909> generate<00:01:30.439> high<00:01:31.439> voltages

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
actually helps to generate high voltages

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.980 
actually helps to generate high voltages
from<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.590> six<00:01:34.860> volts<00:01:35.299> that's<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
from the the six volts that's there and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.359 
from the the six volts that's there and
it<00:01:37.140> brings<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.950> couple<00:01:38.340> hundred

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it brings it up to a couple hundred

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.660 
it brings it up to a couple hundred
volts<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.439> then<00:01:40.439> gets<00:01:41.040> stored<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
volts and then gets stored in this

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.310 
volts and then gets stored in this
transformer<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> need<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.140> high

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
transformer and you need that high

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.130 
transformer and you need that high
voltage<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.009> basically<00:01:44.570> drive<00:01:45.570> everything<00:01:45.869> in

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
voltage to basically drive everything in

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.710 
voltage to basically drive everything in
the<00:01:46.259> tubes

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
the tubes

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
the tubes
so<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.200> biggest<00:01:49.380> part<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.920> trying<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> get

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
so the biggest part was trying to get

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.789 
so the biggest part was trying to get
this<00:01:50.579> vibrator<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.360> work<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.380> let<00:01:52.470> me<00:01:52.560> explain

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
this vibrator to work so let me explain

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.700 
this vibrator to work so let me explain
what<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> had<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.810> now<00:01:54.810> typically<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
what I had to do now typically with the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.679 
what I had to do now typically with the
vibrator<00:01:56.159> radios<00:01:57.409> what<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.740> underneath

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
vibrator radios what you have underneath

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.130 
vibrator radios what you have underneath
is<00:02:00.689> what's<00:02:01.079> called<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.409> buffer<00:02:02.130> capacitor<00:02:03.140> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
is what's called a buffer capacitor and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.310 
is what's called a buffer capacitor and
when<00:02:04.290> these<00:02:04.409> buffer<00:02:04.799> capacitors<00:02:05.369> go<00:02:05.700> bad<00:02:06.320> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
when these buffer capacitors go bad and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.249 
when these buffer capacitors go bad and
then<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.920> tendency<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.269> it<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.690> tears

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
then the tendency is that it just tears

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.539 
then the tendency is that it just tears
up<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:11.150> contacts<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> vibrator<00:02:13.220> as<00:02:14.220> well

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
up the contacts on the vibrator as well

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.509 
up the contacts on the vibrator as well
as<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.880> making<00:02:15.209> radio<00:02:15.600> stop<00:02:15.900> working<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> why

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
as just making radio stop working so why

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.660 
as just making radio stop working so why
I<00:02:17.549> took<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.970> out<00:02:18.209> from<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> radio<00:02:22.400> I'm<00:02:23.400> just

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
I took this out from the radio I'm just

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.150 
I took this out from the radio I'm just
holding<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.470> could<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:25.950> much

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
holding like that you could pretty much

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.390 
holding like that you could pretty much
see<00:02:26.400> why<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.120> radio<00:02:27.420> didn't<00:02:27.750> work<00:02:28.400> so

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
see why that the radio didn't work so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160 
see why that the radio didn't work so
for<00:02:29.579> some<00:02:29.820> reason<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.239> had<00:02:30.540> split<00:02:31.019> and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
for some reason this had split and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.250 
for some reason this had split and
failed<00:02:32.030> thus<00:02:33.030> not<00:02:33.600> making<00:02:33.959> radio<00:02:34.350> work<00:02:36.260> okay

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
failed thus not making radio work okay

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.880 
failed thus not making radio work okay
this<00:02:37.500> is

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
this is

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.230 
this is
original<00:02:39.680> 4-pin<00:02:40.680> six<00:02:41.040> volt<00:02:41.340> vibrator<00:02:42.060> that

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
original 4-pin six volt vibrator that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.010 
original 4-pin six volt vibrator that
was<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> radio<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:45.090> tried<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.600> revive

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
was in the radio and I tried to revive

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.080 
was in the radio and I tried to revive
it<00:02:46.230> using<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.709> technique<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:48.560> fellow<00:02:49.560> in

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it using a technique that a fellow in

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.610 
it using a technique that a fellow in
