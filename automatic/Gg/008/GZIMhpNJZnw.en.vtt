00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 the people today we are going to make a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.090
 demonstration of how to transform your 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.849
 android smartphone and a remote control 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.009
 for a smart tv 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.270
 we will use as an example here in the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:23.130
 android application to lg tv remote and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.580
 smart tv is a lg lm6000 200 is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.470
 be informed that the two 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 devices must be connected to the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.719
 same wifi network so it will be 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.950
 necessary a router is to be able to do 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.149
 the synchronization between television and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.079
 smartphone 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.010
 we have already installed the application here 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.149
 lgtb remote 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 at that moment he is already 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.500
 synchronized on tv 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 however the first time you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.989
 download the application and install it 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.780
 on the application itself smartphone will 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.880
 search the network to find the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.640
 TV 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.729
 Finding the TV will be 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.090
 displayed on the TV screen a sequence of 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.520
 six digits to be entered in the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.549
 smartphone field at that time will be 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.040
 made the timing 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.119
 Since then there are no more 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.360
 The only secret is to use the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:36.840
 application and it will already be doing the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 turn the remote control right here then 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.340
 we have the home screen on the screen 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.020
 main remote control 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.960
 note here we have channel control and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 on the other side we have the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.310
 volume on top we have the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.270
 more ch it would be a chanel that are the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.750
 my favorite channels the cap that is a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.689
 button that captures the screen of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.520
 Television is a picture on the TV screen. 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.810
 the smart button that directs us to to 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.640
 home of television 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.150
 and oh my happiness that will be opening 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.599
 my apps at the bottom 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.770
 we have the option to turn off the 3d 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.950
 the input to the input at the blur input 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.709
 and others do not even have others 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.610
 device connected to the TV you there is 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.720
 it opens a list of channels are 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:46.170
 available in the locality and the number of 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.239
 09 he opens a numeric keypad here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.440
 otherwise you may also notice that they are 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.970
 two pages right 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.900
 in case the main screen page is 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.900
 drag to the right 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.799
 The other screen is that it has area 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.930
 premium and my applications ringing 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:11.849
 in an award it will bring all the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.910
 premium applications that are available 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:20.070
 on the TV by clicking here on the mobile phone 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.810
 it will open on the TV in the 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.160
 low 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.180
 we have the touch screen that will serve as 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.620
 Mouse 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.500
 the movement that is done on the smartphone 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.799
 he will be moving in the womb in the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.540
 tv here right here on the mobile 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.040
 she does not move does not leave 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.010
 place but in the na on tv it is noticed that there is 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.120
 some runs across the screen 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.019
 later in this video we will go 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.660
 is demonstrating this on television 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.250
 Good people, let's make a 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.470
 practical demonstration right 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.620
 let's first test the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.620
 volume 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.510
 the volume bid but vehicle part is already going 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.300
 increasing the rank and now it is a bit 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.450
 volume at the same table the third year 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.190
 the volume decreases 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:25.830
 here also the controller channels 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.480
 As I make the move here to 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:36.600
 down to the top 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:40.830
 the TV will switch channels to 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.110
 home key here on your smartphone 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.650
 when played 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.300
 she opened a smartphone or delighted that 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.540
 It will serve as a mouse. 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.900
 Note that even though the 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:05:01.280
 owner on the smartphone screen the arrow does not 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:03.770
 Moved though was wool on smart tv 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.770
 I realize a movement happens 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.770
 naturally 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:16.350
 coming back here for today more phone 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.590

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:25.890
 scrolling a case of being navigated in the 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:30.330
 internet with tv can be used to 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:33.690
 your scrollbar is perceived in the 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:38.160
 normative and also that by dying here 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:44.970
 Scrollbar is switched to the screens in the 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:48.660
