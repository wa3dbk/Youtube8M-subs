well<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.030> suppose<00:00:03.360> they<00:00:03.600> better<00:00:03.780> start<00:00:04.049> fixing

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
well I suppose they better start fixing

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.369 
well I suppose they better start fixing
this<00:00:05.279> thing<00:00:05.390> again<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:06.420> motor<00:00:06.810> pulled<00:00:07.140> but

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
this thing again that motor pulled but

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.680 
this thing again that motor pulled but
before<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> couple<00:00:09.059> things<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.540> got

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
before I do that a couple things I got

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.770 
before I do that a couple things I got
to<00:00:09.719> do<00:00:09.929> I'm<00:00:10.620> gonna<00:00:10.980> move<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.370> crap<00:00:12.360> off<00:00:12.599> from

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
to do I'm gonna move that crap off from

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.270 
to do I'm gonna move that crap off from
over<00:00:12.929> here<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.200> clear<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.559> out<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.130> can

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
over here and clear that out so I can

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.950 
over here and clear that out so I can
pull<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> car<00:00:14.730> forward<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.150> little<00:00:15.269> bit<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
pull the car forward a little bit and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.410 
pull the car forward a little bit and
then<00:00:16.890> crawl<00:00:17.250> up<00:00:17.430> there<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.910> see<00:00:18.060> if<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.270> can

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
then crawl up there and see if I can

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.380 
then crawl up there and see if I can
move<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.710> winch<00:00:20.010> over<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.270> more

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
move that that winch over so it's more

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.080 
move that that winch over so it's more
centered<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> hood<00:00:22.490> but<00:00:23.490> before<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:23.939> any

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
centered in the hood but before I do any

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.939 
centered in the hood but before I do any
of<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.359> I'm<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> go<00:00:25.619> ahead<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.830> throw

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
of that I'm going to go ahead and throw

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.800 
of that I'm going to go ahead and throw
some<00:00:26.099> gas<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:27.359> if<00:00:27.449> it'll<00:00:27.539> fire<00:00:27.750> up

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
some gas in it and see if it'll fire up

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
some gas in it and see if it'll fire up

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
what the knock sounds like let's let's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.620 
what the knock sounds like let's let's
get<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> ready<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.990> pull<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.500> motor<00:01:38.630> all

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
get it ready to pull this motor all

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
get it ready to pull this motor all
right<00:01:39.810> well<00:01:39.960> I've<00:01:40.050> got<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.290> lined<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.710> pretty

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
right well I've got it lined up pretty

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.400 
right well I've got it lined up pretty
close<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.610> where<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.789> want<00:01:42.030> I'll<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.810> slide

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
close to where I want I'll have to slide

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.950 
close to where I want I'll have to slide
that<00:01:43.590> over<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.100> little<00:01:44.130> bit<00:01:44.539> to<00:01:45.539> even<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that over just a little bit to even it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.580 
that over just a little bit to even it
up<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> motor<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.920> that's<00:01:47.759> good<00:01:48.590> first

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
up with the motor but that's good first

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.980 
up with the motor but that's good first
thing<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:49.890> gonna<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.190> before<00:01:50.539> I<00:01:51.539> even<00:01:51.720> move

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
thing I'm gonna do before I even move

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.120 
thing I'm gonna do before I even move
that<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.770> ahead<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:53.009> pull

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that is I'm going to go ahead and pull

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.460 
that is I'm going to go ahead and pull
this<00:01:53.190> radiator<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.789> so<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.899> damage<00:01:55.259> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
this radiator out so I don't damage it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.130 
this radiator out so I don't damage it
and<00:01:55.590> drain<00:01:55.800> all<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.039> coolant<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.990> pull<00:01:57.990> this

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and drain all the coolant and pull this

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980 
and drain all the coolant and pull this
out<00:01:58.350> take<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> hoses<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.780> obviously<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
out take the hoses off obviously and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.139 
out take the hoses off obviously and
then<00:02:01.170> probably<00:02:01.950> pull<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.190> fan<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.060> my

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
then probably pull this fan out of my

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.320 
then probably pull this fan out of my
way<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:04.460> then<00:02:05.460> I'll<00:02:05.580> just<00:02:05.729> start<00:02:06.000> plucking

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
way and then I'll just start plucking

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.880 
way and then I'll just start plucking
stuff<00:02:06.690> off<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.080> top<00:02:07.259> here<00:02:07.440> that<00:02:07.590> needs<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
stuff off the top here that needs to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.430 
stuff off the top here that needs to
come<00:02:08.039> off<00:02:08.070> like<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.729> fuel<00:02:09.600> lines<00:02:09.869> any<00:02:10.229> vacuum

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
come off like the fuel lines any vacuum

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.240 
come off like the fuel lines any vacuum
lines<00:02:10.950> stuff<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.000> I'll<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.420> linkage

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
lines stuff like that I'll be on linkage

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.300 
lines stuff like that I'll be on linkage
undo<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> exhaust<00:02:14.760> here<00:02:15.890> pull<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.950> starter

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
undo the exhaust here pull the starter

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.250 
undo the exhaust here pull the starter
out<00:02:17.340> probably<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.350> stuff<00:02:19.350> like<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.739> and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
out probably and stuff like that and

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.360 
out probably and stuff like that and
shouldn't<00:02:22.260> take<00:02:22.380> too<00:02:22.410> long<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.860> don't<00:02:22.920> think<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
shouldn't take too long I don't think to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.610 
shouldn't take too long I don't think to
get<00:02:23.519> everything<00:02:23.700> bolted<00:02:24.600> up<00:02:24.870> top<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.440> then<00:02:25.560> I

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
get everything bolted up top and then I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.080 
get everything bolted up top and then I
can<00:02:25.769> go<00:02:25.890> down<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.190> start<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.730> bolting<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
can go down and start on bolting the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.140 
can go down and start on bolting the
engine<00:02:27.329> itself<00:02:27.600> from<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> transmission

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
engine itself from the transmission

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.900 
engine itself from the transmission
should<00:02:30.150> go<00:02:30.329> pretty<00:02:30.510> quick<00:02:30.750> I'm<00:02:30.930> hoping<00:02:31.910> well

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
should go pretty quick I'm hoping well

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.479 
should go pretty quick I'm hoping well
I've<00:02:33.060> got<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.390> radiator<00:02:34.230> out<00:02:34.320> pretty<00:02:35.040> simple

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
I've got the radiator out pretty simple

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.440

then I moved on starting to take these

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.270 
then I moved on starting to take these
heater<00:02:51.600> hoses<00:02:51.840> off<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.410> got<00:02:52.530> one<00:02:52.680> off<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.100> fine

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
heater hoses off I got one off just fine

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.000 
heater hoses off I got one off just fine
cuz<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.640> has<00:02:53.670> screw<00:02:54.000> clamp<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.570> then<00:02:55.440> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
cuz it has screw clamp and then of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.800 
cuz it has screw clamp and then of
course<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.370> one<00:02:56.549> has<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.940> stupid<00:02:57.450> spring

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
course this one has the stupid spring

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.370 
course this one has the stupid spring
clamps<00:02:58.170> which<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.560> absolutely<00:02:58.920> hate<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:00.380> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
I'll work my way pull these wires out

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.370 
I'll work my way pull these wires out
set<00:03:17.280> them<00:03:17.400> off<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:17.760> side<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.199> course

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
set them off to the side and of course

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.020 
set them off to the side and of course
the<00:03:19.530> linkage<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.010> everything

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the linkage and everything

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.760 
the linkage and everything
and<00:03:21.120> exhaust<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.080> we'll<00:03:22.230> move<00:03:22.410> underneath

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.500 

well<00:03:25.770> I've<00:03:26.130> got<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> few<00:03:26.490> more<00:03:26.640> things<00:03:26.910> off<00:03:27.150> um

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
well I've got a few more things off um

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.840 
well I've got a few more things off um
you<00:03:28.170> got<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.319> fuel<00:03:28.590> line<00:03:28.770> off<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.700> so

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
you got the fuel line off and it's so

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.540 
you got the fuel line off and it's so
obviously<00:03:30.390> jump<00:03:31.020> to<00:03:31.290> when<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.830> pull<00:03:32.400> on<00:03:32.520> a

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
obviously jump to when you pull on a

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.110 
obviously jump to when you pull on a
hose<00:03:32.790> or<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> line<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.380> cracks<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.920> that

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
hose or a line and it cracks like that

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.850 
hose or a line and it cracks like that
and<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.240> pretty<00:03:36.840> much<00:03:36.930> time<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.350> replace<00:03:37.620> it

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
and it's pretty much time to replace it

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.120 
and it's pretty much time to replace it
and<00:03:39.170> following<00:03:40.170> some<00:03:40.260> I'd<00:03:40.410> never<00:03:40.560> seen<00:03:40.800> before

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
and following some I'd never seen before

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.130 
and following some I'd never seen before
when<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.760> pulled<00:03:42.030> off<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.330> vacuum<00:03:42.510> line<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:42.900> saw

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
when I pulled off this vacuum line I saw

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.500 
when I pulled off this vacuum line I saw
something<00:03:43.739> sticking<00:03:44.069> out<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.520> turns<00:03:45.360> out

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
something sticking out of it turns out

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.390 
something sticking out of it turns out
it<00:03:45.600> was<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> little<00:03:45.900> bug<00:03:46.080> in<00:03:46.110> here<00:03:46.410> there's

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it was a little bug in here there's

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.650 
it was a little bug in here there's
something<00:03:47.580> I've<00:03:47.700> never<00:03:47.880> seen<00:03:48.150> before<00:03:48.270> but

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
something I've never seen before but

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.850 
something I've never seen before but
suppose<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:49.770> time<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:51.410> now<00:03:52.410> all<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> got<00:03:52.830> left

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
suppose it's time and now all I got left

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.740 
suppose it's time and now all I got left
is<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.280> exhaust<00:03:53.580> starter

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
is the exhaust starter

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.610

I<00:03:55.760> like<00:03:56.760> their<00:03:56.970> little<00:03:57.320> contraption<00:03:58.320> here<00:03:58.470> for

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
I like their little contraption here for

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.710 
I like their little contraption here for
the<00:03:58.680> throttle<00:03:59.340> linkage<00:03:59.459> they<00:03:59.820> had<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.150> piece

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
the throttle linkage they had the piece

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.020 
the throttle linkage they had the piece
of<00:04:00.840> rubber<00:04:01.080> hose<00:04:01.200> on<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.500> end<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:02.030> shoved

home<00:04:08.010> which<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.519> something<00:04:09.330> I'd<00:04:09.480> never<00:04:09.600> seen

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
pull it forward and probably get it up

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.630

all<00:04:43.860> right<00:04:44.039> well<00:04:44.400> I've<00:04:44.550> got<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:44.910> starter<00:04:45.900> out

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
and I've got the exhaust off my light is

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.740 
and I've got the exhaust off my light is
actually<00:04:49.590> unplugged<00:04:50.190> right<00:04:50.400> now<00:04:50.550> because<00:04:51.450> I

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
actually unplugged right now because I

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.670 
actually unplugged right now because I
use<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.260> lift<00:04:52.890> here<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.610> pull<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:53.910> hood<00:04:54.060> off

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
use the lift here to pull the hood off

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.640 
use the lift here to pull the hood off
which<00:04:55.680> went<00:04:55.890> pretty<00:04:56.010> well<00:04:57.260> kind<00:04:58.260> of<00:04:58.289> tricky<00:04:58.620> to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
which went pretty well kind of tricky to

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.440 
which went pretty well kind of tricky to
do<00:04:58.830> by<00:04:58.950> yourself<00:04:59.100> but<00:04:59.700> if<00:04:59.970> you<00:05:00.060> have<00:05:00.150> one<00:05:00.330> of

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
do by yourself but if you have one of

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.210 
do by yourself but if you have one of
these<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.780> makes<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.140> lot<00:05:01.229> easier<00:05:01.289> the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
these that makes it a lot easier the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.040 
these that makes it a lot easier the
only<00:05:02.430> thing<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.669> got<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.850> do<00:05:03.030> when<00:05:03.930> you're

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
only thing you got to do when you're

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.110 
only thing you got to do when you're
doing<00:05:04.289> it<00:05:04.470> by<00:05:04.560> yourself<00:05:04.710> is<00:05:05.250> watch<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
doing it by yourself is watch the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.000 
doing it by yourself is watch the
corners<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.690> hood<00:05:06.870> because<00:05:07.620> as<00:05:07.770> soon<00:05:07.890> as

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
corners of the hood because as soon as

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.770 
corners of the hood because as soon as
you<00:05:08.130> take<00:05:08.250> these<00:05:08.460> off<00:05:08.700> these<00:05:09.090> bolts<00:05:09.390> out<00:05:09.539> and

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
you take these off these bolts out and

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.570 
you take these off these bolts out and
want<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.110> slide<00:05:10.410> down<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.890> jam<00:05:11.010> into<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.370> hood

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
want to slide down and jam into the hood

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.700 
want to slide down and jam into the hood
so<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:12.360> laid<00:05:12.600> these<00:05:12.750> rags<00:05:13.050> in<00:05:13.320> here<00:05:13.500> on<00:05:13.590> each

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
so I laid these rags in here on each

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.250 
so I laid these rags in here on each
side<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.390> looks<00:05:15.390> like<00:05:15.479> it's<00:05:15.720> protective<00:05:16.140> of

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
side and looks like it's protective of

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.219 
side and looks like it's protective of
it<00:05:16.350> pretty<00:05:16.500> good<00:05:16.710> or<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.310> fender<00:05:17.700> pretty<00:05:17.880> good

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
it pretty good or the fender pretty good

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.710 
it pretty good or the fender pretty good
and<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.800> hood<00:05:19.979> is<00:05:20.100> not<00:05:20.310> damaged<00:05:20.940> scratched<00:05:21.479> or

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
and the hood is not damaged scratched or

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.120 
and the hood is not damaged scratched or
anything<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.490> we're<00:05:23.490> good<00:05:23.669> there<00:05:23.970> now<00:05:24.390> I<00:05:24.419> can

away mmm no another thing to notice when
I<00:05:42.559> was<00:05:42.679> moving<00:05:42.769> that<00:05:43.039> hood<00:05:43.219> I'm<00:05:43.459> missing<00:05:43.849> the

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:43.939 
I was moving that hood I'm missing the

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.399 
I was moving that hood I'm missing the
pin<00:05:44.119> out<00:05:44.269> of<00:05:44.389> here<00:05:44.479> this<00:05:44.659> thing<00:05:44.899> almost<00:05:45.049> fell

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
pin out of here this thing almost fell

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.799 
pin out of here this thing almost fell
out<00:05:45.879> good<00:05:46.879> thing<00:05:47.029> I<00:05:47.089> caught<00:05:47.299> it<00:05:47.419> when<00:05:47.509> I<00:05:47.569> did

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:47.809 
out good thing I caught it when I did

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:49.600 
out good thing I caught it when I did
before<00:05:47.989> I<00:05:48.169> started<00:05:48.559> picking<00:05:49.129> up<00:05:49.249> that<00:05:49.459> hood

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
before I started picking up that hood

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.100 
before I started picking up that hood
because<00:05:49.879> it<00:05:50.059> very<00:05:50.569> well<00:05:50.749> could<00:05:50.899> have<00:05:50.929> come

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
because it very well could have come

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.739 
because it very well could have come
down<00:05:51.159> and<00:05:52.159> I<00:05:52.579> would<00:05:52.699> have<00:05:52.789> lost<00:05:52.909> it<00:05:53.179> damaged

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:53.749 
down and I would have lost it damaged

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:55.179 
down and I would have lost it damaged
stuff<00:05:53.989> and<00:05:54.259> it<00:05:54.349> would<00:05:54.529> not<00:05:54.679> have<00:05:54.860> been<00:05:55.009> a<00:05:55.039> good

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:55.189 
stuff and it would not have been a good

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.409 
stuff and it would not have been a good
thing<00:05:55.249> so<00:05:55.729> mm-hmm

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
thing so mm-hmm

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.719 
thing so mm-hmm
I'll<00:05:57.379> crawl<00:05:57.649> underneath<00:05:58.069> I'll<00:05:58.249> find<00:05:58.429> a<00:05:58.549> pin

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
I'll crawl underneath I'll find a pin

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.429 
I'll crawl underneath I'll find a pin
for<00:05:58.909> this<00:05:59.439> and<00:06:00.439> get<00:06:00.860> back<00:06:01.009> to<00:06:01.159> work<00:06:02.139> well<00:06:03.139> there

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 
for this and get back to work well there

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.689 
for this and get back to work well there
we<00:06:03.529> go<00:06:03.679> we<00:06:03.829> got<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:04.009> out<00:06:04.249> a<00:06:04.789> little<00:06:05.719> tricky<00:06:05.989> I

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
we go we got it out a little tricky I

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.239 
we go we got it out a little tricky I
originally<00:06:07.699> had<00:06:07.849> chained<00:06:08.179> up<00:06:08.389> to<00:06:08.689> there<00:06:09.469> and

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:10.249 
originally had chained up to there and

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.519 
originally had chained up to there and
in<00:06:10.999> the<00:06:11.089> back<00:06:11.239> here<00:06:11.569> where<00:06:11.719> the<00:06:11.839> second<00:06:12.229> one<00:06:12.349> is

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
in the back here where the second one is

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.529 
in the back here where the second one is
and<00:06:12.800> then<00:06:13.339> I<00:06:13.369> moved<00:06:13.699> it<00:06:13.879> because<00:06:14.239> I<00:06:14.389> was

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
and then I moved it because I was

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.809 
and then I moved it because I was
thinking<00:06:14.869> it<00:06:14.989> wasn't<00:06:15.319> quite<00:06:16.009> right<00:06:16.399> as<00:06:16.669> it

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
thinking it wasn't quite right as it

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.249 
thinking it wasn't quite right as it
wasn't<00:06:17.089> pulling<00:06:17.269> out<00:06:17.389> right<00:06:17.419> and<00:06:17.869> then<00:06:18.019> I<00:06:18.050> got

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259 
wasn't pulling out right and then I got

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:20.889 
wasn't pulling out right and then I got
it<00:06:18.349> out<00:06:18.439> a<00:06:18.769> little<00:06:19.669> ways<00:06:19.819> and<00:06:20.300> by<00:06:20.479> that<00:06:20.629> time<00:06:20.659> I

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:20.899 
it out a little ways and by that time I

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:23.259 
it out a little ways and by that time I
was<00:06:21.199> already<00:06:22.039> off<00:06:22.249> the<00:06:22.279> motor<00:06:22.610> mounts<00:06:22.969> so<00:06:23.239> I

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:23.269 
was already off the motor mounts so I

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:25.569 
was already off the motor mounts so I
couldn't<00:06:23.509> really<00:06:23.689> set<00:06:23.959> it<00:06:24.050> down<00:06:24.219> so<00:06:25.219> I<00:06:25.249> added

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:25.579 
couldn't really set it down so I added

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:28.290 
couldn't really set it down so I added
another<00:06:25.789> chain<00:06:26.239> to<00:06:26.839> it<00:06:26.869> and<00:06:27.079> bolted<00:06:27.199> it<00:06:27.409> in<00:06:27.589> and

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
another chain to it and bolted it in and

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.179 
another chain to it and bolted it in and
when<00:06:29.300> I<00:06:29.329> did<00:06:29.569> that<00:06:29.599> I<00:06:29.749> probably<00:06:30.050> bent<00:06:30.889> up<00:06:31.099> a

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
when I did that I probably bent up a

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.699 
when I did that I probably bent up a
little<00:06:31.399> bit<00:06:31.519> of<00:06:31.610> this<00:06:31.699> linkage<00:06:32.119> here<00:06:32.360> but<00:06:32.709> just

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:33.709 
little bit of this linkage here but just

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:36.729 
little bit of this linkage here but just
minor<00:06:33.949> minor<00:06:34.669> there<00:06:34.999> no<00:06:35.360> big<00:06:35.599> deal<00:06:35.899> um

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:36.739 
minor minor there no big deal um

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:39.369 
minor minor there no big deal um
otherwise<00:06:37.459> it<00:06:37.699> came<00:06:37.849> out<00:06:37.999> pretty<00:06:38.179> good<00:06:38.379> I've

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379 
otherwise it came out pretty good I've

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:42.249 
otherwise it came out pretty good I've
got<00:06:39.559> a<00:06:39.589> crowbar<00:06:40.839> slammed<00:06:41.839> under<00:06:42.169> the

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
got a crowbar slammed under the

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.089 
got a crowbar slammed under the
transmission<00:06:42.829> to<00:06:42.889> hold<00:06:43.039> that<00:06:43.189> up<00:06:44.769> and<00:06:45.769> tell<00:06:46.009> us

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
transmission to hold that up and tell us

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:47.379 
transmission to hold that up and tell us
ready<00:06:46.249> to<00:06:46.339> go<00:06:46.399> back<00:06:46.579> in<00:06:46.789> so<00:06:46.909> I<00:06:46.969> could<00:06:47.119> push<00:06:47.269> it

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
ready to go back in so I could push it

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:52.779 
ready to go back in so I could push it
back<00:06:47.569> out<00:06:47.779> of<00:06:47.869> my<00:06:47.959> way<00:06:48.999> so<00:06:49.999> I<00:06:50.300> guess<00:06:51.759> now<00:06:52.759> all

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
back out of my way so I guess now all

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.159 
back out of my way so I guess now all
that's<00:06:53.089> left<00:06:53.209> to<00:06:53.360> do<00:06:53.479> is<00:06:53.509> put<00:06:53.779> together<00:06:53.869> that

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
that's left to do is put together that

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.469 
that's left to do is put together that
new<00:06:54.349> engine<00:06:54.649> stand<00:06:54.860> I<00:06:54.979> got<00:06:55.189> and<00:06:55.489> throw<00:06:56.059> this<00:06:56.269> on

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 
new engine stand I got and throw this on

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.389 
new engine stand I got and throw this on
there<00:06:56.719> and<00:06:56.869> probably<00:06:57.709> start<00:06:58.069> pulling<00:06:58.339> it

00:06:58.389 --> 00:06:58.399 
there and probably start pulling it

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:01.059 
there and probably start pulling it
apart<00:06:58.489> next<00:06:58.849> weekend<00:06:59.149> sometime<00:06:59.539> and<00:07:00.069> we'll

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
apart next weekend sometime and we'll

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.749 
apart next weekend sometime and we'll
see<00:07:01.309> what<00:07:01.519> what<00:07:02.149> the<00:07:02.269> problem<00:07:02.629> was
