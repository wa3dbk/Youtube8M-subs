00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.940
 they want it to end 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.929
 own ways I did the java ajoie law 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:10.860
 by this agreement 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.860
 the mice dance why 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.519
 economy 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.819
 to dance, you have to be supportive 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:31.550
 not to miss the decor 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.900
 because he knows his friend's dancing and harmony between the body 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.280
 and feet but be careful johnny some dances not to turn the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400
 head 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.550
 absolutely find but not in France without music 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 but let's see how it works 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.829
 the prices of music will penetrate the body going through batteries for 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.760
 ears 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.460
 to join the body of the dance 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 the top 10 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.320
 and they want it to make a dish absolutely yes the club has changed the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.130
 blood pressure in the limbs 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.790
 while the pressure will be dense at most the dance will be dense 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.980
 8 on the other hand at the lowest-in this will be less dense at least the dance will be 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
 the hearing 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 it's called heartbeat 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.859
 and yes because otherwise as you know the 45th and the means of expression 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.750
 bodily he quickly learned 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.990
 but it is necessary that it is still to traverse to reach perfection permanences 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.040
 and duck customers expect the brand and mozambique 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.110
 to stay in the water 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.749
 each country has created its own dance such as 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.310
 Germany but today 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.040
 there 2 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.440
 of life m 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 you want Morocco 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 where america 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.250
 this is called and in this team absolutely no but forget 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.120
 not that we can also dance as a couple, such as awakening glory 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.079
 slate james with on board tears 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.079
 but also to gaza at the moment 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.099
 so I advise you to start with the waves 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.839
 where dance classes 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.049
 he is good for him the dance is good but a counter dance this man who goes the 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.520
 pay a hundredfold think on your head 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.939
 4 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:37.969
