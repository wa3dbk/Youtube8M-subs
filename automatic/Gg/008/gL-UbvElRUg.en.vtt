00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
all in all that early goal was probably

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.700 
all in all that early goal was probably
the<00:06:31.120> key<00:06:31.300> to<00:06:31.449> this<00:06:31.570> victory<00:06:32.050> yeah<00:06:32.350> that<00:06:32.530> gave

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
the key to this victory yeah that gave

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.020 
the key to this victory yeah that gave
them<00:06:32.889> a<00:06:32.949> lot<00:06:33.070> of<00:06:33.130> confidence<00:06:33.520> and<00:06:33.730> i<00:06:33.790> think

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
them a lot of confidence and i think

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.939 
them a lot of confidence and i think
it's<00:06:34.180> seldom<00:06:34.419> down<00:06:34.840> to<00:06:35.080> over<00:06:35.230> whenever<00:06:35.830> you

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
it's seldom down to over whenever you

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.860 
it's seldom down to over whenever you
score<00:06:36.280> early<00:06:36.310> on<00:06:36.669> in<00:06:36.790> a<00:06:36.880> match<00:06:37.030> it<00:06:37.210> always<00:06:37.600> sets

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
score early on in a match it always sets

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.320 
score early on in a match it always sets
you<00:06:37.990> up<00:06:38.050> nicely
