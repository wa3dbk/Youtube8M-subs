00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.710 

what<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.370> jobber<00:00:05.640> encounter<00:00:06.180> men<00:00:06.359> need<00:00:06.600> to

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
what you jobber encounter men need to

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.839 
what you jobber encounter men need to
understand<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.500> how<00:00:07.679> the<00:00:07.740> carrier<00:00:08.069> bases<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
understand is how the carrier bases and

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.930 
understand is how the carrier bases and
the<00:00:09.300> effect<00:00:09.630> packs<00:00:09.900> work<00:00:10.290> as<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.339> told<00:00:11.820> you

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the effect packs work as we told you

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.180 
the effect packs work as we told you
before<00:00:12.389> we<00:00:12.599> offer<00:00:12.809> these<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.349> 19<00:00:13.919> different

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
before we offer these in 19 different

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.880 
before we offer these in 19 different
colors<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:14.999> they're<00:00:15.509> absolutely<00:00:15.690> beautiful

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
colors and they're absolutely beautiful

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.260 
colors and they're absolutely beautiful
they're<00:00:17.160> designed<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.760> mixed<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
they're designed to be mixed with the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.960 
they're designed to be mixed with the
carrier<00:00:18.510> basis<00:00:19.080> at<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> three-to-one<00:00:19.679> ratio

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
carrier basis at a three-to-one ratio

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.720 
carrier basis at a three-to-one ratio
but<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.119> also<00:00:21.300> offer<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.170> clear<00:00:22.920> called<00:00:23.400> trans

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
but we also offer a clear called trans

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.259 
but we also offer a clear called trans
nebula<00:00:24.300> which<00:00:24.929> is<00:00:25.109> basically<00:00:25.589> the<00:00:26.519> new<00:00:26.730> resin

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
nebula which is basically the new resin

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.140 
nebula which is basically the new resin
system<00:00:27.810> that's<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.740> much<00:00:29.009> like<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> old<00:00:29.490> SG

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
system that's very much like the old SG

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.040 
system that's very much like the old SG
150<00:00:30.839> it<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.589> a<00:00:31.619> carrier<00:00:32.510> Palmer<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.750> locks

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
150 it has a carrier Palmer that locks

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
150 it has a carrier Palmer that locks
around<00:00:34.290> each<00:00:34.740> platelet<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.460> pearl<00:00:35.730> or

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
around each platelet of pearl or

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.850 
around each platelet of pearl or
metallic<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:36.690> whatever<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:37.379> in<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
metallic or whatever you put in it and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
metallic or whatever you put in it and
stops<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:38.789> settling<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.230> also

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
stops it from settling out and it also

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.860 
stops it from settling out and it also
Orient's<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> when<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.789> sprayed<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
Orient's it when it's sprayed so that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
Orient's it when it's sprayed so that
they<00:00:43.020> lock<00:00:43.410> themselves<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:44.160> place<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.699> when

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
they lock themselves in place so when

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.430 
they lock themselves in place so when
they're<00:00:45.000> top<00:00:45.239> coated<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> materials<00:00:46.199> don't

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
they're top coated the materials don't

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.510 
they're top coated the materials don't
move<00:00:46.680> let's<00:00:47.670> talk<00:00:47.969> about<00:00:48.149> some<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.750> those

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
pearls and boy do they impact the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.800 
pearls and boy do they impact the
coating<00:01:32.250> you're<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.270> much<00:01:33.329> fun

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
coating you're going to have so much fun

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.440 
coating you're going to have so much fun
with<00:01:33.990> these<00:01:34.170> mixing<00:01:35.040> them<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.310> using<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.270> by

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
with these mixing them in using them by

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.289 
with these mixing them in using them by
themselves<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.799> trance<00:01:38.070> nebula<00:01:38.610> but

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
themselves in the trance nebula but

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
themselves in the trance nebula but
don't<00:01:39.540> put<00:01:39.780> too<00:01:39.930> much<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.189> problem<00:01:41.610> with

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
don't put too much in the problem with

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.490 
don't put too much in the problem with
putting<00:01:42.060> too<00:01:42.240> much<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.899> can't<00:01:43.140> control

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
putting too much in is you can't control

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920 
putting too much in is you can't control
it<00:01:43.680> when<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.890> spray<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.090> requires<00:01:45.509> much

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
it when you spray it so it requires much

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.990 
it when you spray it so it requires much
less<00:01:45.960> when<00:01:46.680> you're<00:01:46.770> putting<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.189> into<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.549> clear

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
less when you're putting it into a clear

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.929 
less when you're putting it into a clear
with<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> polymer<00:01:49.200> carrier<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.520> you'll

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
with a polymer carrier in it so you'll

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.550 
with a polymer carrier in it so you'll
experiment<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.659> those<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.380> have

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
experiment with those and we do have

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.429

they<00:02:46.140> come<00:02:46.320> across<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.060> 1/64<00:02:48.060> flake<00:02:48.420> so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
they come across like a 1/64 flake so

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.100 
they come across like a 1/64 flake so
you<00:02:49.290> get<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.740> immense<00:02:50.430> flash<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.720> Sun

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
you get that immense flash in the Sun

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.880 
you get that immense flash in the Sun
without<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.800> work<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.760> old-style<00:02:54.090> flakes

now<00:02:55.890> we<00:02:55.950> move<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.210> chameleons<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.260> I

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
now we move on to the chameleons and I

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.500 
now we move on to the chameleons and I
don't<00:02:58.380> think<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.160> explain<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.270> color

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
don't think I have to explain the color

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.470 
don't think I have to explain the color
change<00:03:00.930> chameleons<00:03:01.680> they<00:03:02.610> are<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.300> know

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
change chameleons they are I you know

change chameleons they are I you know
what<00:03:03.630> I've<00:03:03.720> been<00:03:03.780> doing<00:03:03.900> I'll<00:03:04.410> take<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:04.950> add

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
what I've been doing I'll take and add

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
what I've been doing I'll take and add
some<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.490> those<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> little<00:03:06.210> bit<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
some of those to a little bit of the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.250 
some of those to a little bit of the
toners<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.330> we're<00:03:09.480> working<00:03:09.660> with<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.230> you

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
toners that we're working with and you

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.950 
toners that we're working with and you
can<00:03:10.770> get<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.100> slight<00:03:11.520> shift<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.120> color<00:03:12.420> when

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
can get that slight shift of color when

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.120 
can get that slight shift of color when
you<00:03:13.050> mix<00:03:13.260> them<00:03:13.440> with<00:03:13.620> some<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.950> other

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
you mix them with some of the other

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.150 
you mix them with some of the other
additives<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.060> great<00:03:15.390> fun<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.160> tremendous

creativity for the painter to get out

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.780 
creativity for the painter to get out
there<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.560> get<00:03:19.680> his<00:03:19.800> feet<00:03:20.010> wet<00:03:20.040> playing<00:03:20.610> with

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
there and get his feet wet playing with

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.490 
there and get his feet wet playing with
this<00:03:20.940> stuff<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.810> don't<00:03:21.959> need<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.320> use<00:03:22.470> a

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
this stuff and you don't need to use a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.010 
this stuff and you don't need to use a
lot<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.370> cost<00:03:23.640> stays<00:03:24.000> down<00:03:24.420> you

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
lot of it so the cost stays down you

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.630 
lot of it so the cost stays down you
know<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.260> costs<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.680> little<00:03:25.800> bit<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.190> buy<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.370> 8

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
know it costs a little bit to buy the 8

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.699 
know it costs a little bit to buy the 8
ounce<00:03:26.850> container<00:03:27.360> but<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.050> point<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.560> can

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
ounce container but the point is you can

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.410 
ounce container but the point is you can
get<00:03:28.860> some<00:03:29.040> tremendous<00:03:29.580> mileage<00:03:30.000> out<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.209> it

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
get some tremendous mileage out of it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.090 
get some tremendous mileage out of it
paying<00:03:30.720> close<00:03:30.959> attention<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.500> how<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.740> add<00:03:32.070> it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
paying close attention to how you add it

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.390 
paying close attention to how you add it
and<00:03:32.520> then<00:03:33.480> last<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.050> not<00:03:34.200> least<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
and then last but not least is the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.670

off and that's just mixing these colors

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.120 
off and that's just mixing these colors
together<00:03:54.209> what<00:03:54.959> about<00:03:55.200> taking<00:03:55.500> some<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:55.920> our

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
together what about taking some of our

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.750 
together what about taking some of our
our<00:03:56.640> toners<00:03:57.209> our<00:03:57.420> basic<00:03:57.930> mixing<00:03:58.410> materials<00:03:58.760> we

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
our toners our basic mixing materials we

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.180 
our toners our basic mixing materials we
call<00:04:00.000> them<00:04:00.120> carrier<00:04:00.480> bases<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.350> mixing<00:04:02.070> the

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
call them carrier bases and mixing the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.430 
call them carrier bases and mixing the
carrier<00:04:02.520> bases<00:04:03.060> together<00:04:03.239> well<00:04:04.140> then<00:04:04.290> you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
carrier bases together well then you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.920 
carrier bases together well then you
start<00:04:04.800> going<00:04:05.370> way<00:04:05.670> out<00:04:05.910> there<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.330> all<00:04:06.630> the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
start going way out there on all the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.510 
start going way out there on all the
combinations<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.890> can<00:04:08.130> come<00:04:08.340> up<00:04:08.489> with

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
combinations that you can come up with

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.090 
combinations that you can come up with
it's<00:04:09.239> totally<00:04:09.690> amazing<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.560> places<00:04:10.980> that

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
it's totally amazing that places that

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.500 
it's totally amazing that places that
the<00:04:11.310> painters<00:04:11.670> are<00:04:11.760> going<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.000> be<00:04:12.090> able<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.300> go

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
the painters are going to be able to go

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.810 
the painters are going to be able to go
now<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.930> they<00:04:13.080> never<00:04:13.320> could<00:04:13.560> go<00:04:13.770> before<00:04:13.980> they

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
now that they never could go before they

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.400 
now that they never could go before they
can<00:04:15.000> build<00:04:15.209> formulas<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.810> they<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.230> keep

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
can build formulas that they can keep

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.470 
can build formulas that they can keep
secret<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.430> only<00:04:17.609> they<00:04:17.880> will<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.150> the

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
secret that only they will have the

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.140 
secret that only they will have the
method<00:04:19.109> that<00:04:19.290> they<00:04:19.590> use<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.130> mix<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.609> it's

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
method that they use to mix it and it's

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.380 
method that they use to mix it and it's
theirs<00:04:21.419> alone<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.109> so<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.430> cost<00:04:23.730> is<00:04:24.060> down

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
theirs alone and so the cost is down

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.240 
theirs alone and so the cost is down
considering<00:04:25.260> on<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.470> way<00:04:25.620> these<00:04:25.770> things<00:04:25.830> are

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
considering on the way these things are

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.880 
considering on the way these things are
done<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.669> mileage<00:04:27.450> with<00:04:27.660> this<00:04:27.840> product<00:04:28.169> based

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
you just push these cans across the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.649 
you just push these cans across the
counter<00:04:38.129> and<00:04:38.279> let<00:04:38.819> these<00:04:38.999> guys<00:04:39.240> do<00:04:39.509> their

creativity on their own again we have

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.420 
creativity on their own again we have
pre<00:04:42.569> done<00:04:43.020> formulas<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.650> they<00:04:43.919> can<00:04:44.069> go<00:04:44.219> by

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
pre done formulas that they can go by

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.999 
pre done formulas that they can go by
for<00:04:44.779> averages<00:04:45.779> but<00:04:46.259> this<00:04:46.439> whole<00:04:46.650> thing<00:04:46.680> is
