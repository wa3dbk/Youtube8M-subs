00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.150 
both of our games lasted a little bit
early<00:02:33.630> we<00:02:33.750> probably<00:02:33.959> both<00:02:34.590> would<00:02:34.950> have

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
early we probably both would have

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.420

dropped<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:36.440> 200<00:02:37.440> no<00:02:37.530> no<00:02:37.680> gameplay<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
dropped the 200 no no gameplay and that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.770 
dropped the 200 no no gameplay and that
would<00:02:38.549> have<00:02:38.640> been<00:02:38.700> absolutely<00:02:38.850> awesome<00:02:39.390> for
