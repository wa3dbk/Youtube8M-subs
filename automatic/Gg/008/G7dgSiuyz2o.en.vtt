00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 good morning comrades today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.730
 I bring a tutorial on how we can do 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.060
 soy milk at home 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.370
 ingredients 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.970
 a quarter kilogram of soybeans 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.600
 organic and non-transgenic eight cups of 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.480
 Water 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.180
 process places the soy beans in 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.690
 soak between 8 and 12 hours changing the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.640
 water every 4 hours if possible 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.560
 when the time has passed with help 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.680
 of your hands tries to crack the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.020
 more possible the husk of the grains 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.790
 scrubbing the good now sneaks his 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.379
 Soaked grains and separates the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.050
 any residue that may have 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.180
 left 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.640
 to prevent our soy milk 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.040
 have a slight bitter taste we should 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.809
 eliminate the enzyme that produces such flavor 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.920
 by a couple of minutes in the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.329
 microwave or 5 minutes in a common oven 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.120
 when you have the beans ready 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.670
 place them in a blender or processor 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.620
 together with a little water and starts to 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.019
 process them until a 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.960
 kind of creamy puree or too liquid 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.909
 nor very thick begins using little 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.920
 water and see adding as 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.320
 you need 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.810
 once you have ready you can leaf 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.909
 add it next to the 8 raisins of water in 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.729
 a large pot and put it on the fire until 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.009
 that reaches boiling from 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.189
 there he cooks the soybeans over low heat 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.530
 about 25 minutes without forgetting that 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.680
 you should stir every so often for 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.659
 prevent it from burning or overflowing now 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.789
 place a permeable canvas on a 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.280
 strainer and is within a container 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.009
 to proceed to separate the milk from the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.409
 Soy waste when you have your 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.450
 instrumental ready you just have to dump the 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.119
 prepared soybeans and water on the canvas 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.730
 and remove to facilitate the filtering of 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.280
 the milk 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.800
 when you only have the soy puree in 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.110
 the canvas you can turn it over and squeeze it 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.270
 to extract as much milk as possible 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.590
 Benefits today is the only legume 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.080
 that has all the amino acids 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.450
 essential for the body so it is 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.630
 digests easily and prevents certain 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.000
 diseases the most important thing is that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.819
 contains the xxi tina a substance that 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.680
 among other issues avoids problems 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.090
 heart and helps keep 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.180
 clean arteries 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.370
 It also contains isoflavones that are 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.590
 plant estrogens that possess a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.720
 very small estrogenic action compared 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.200
 with that of true estrogen 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.330
 bodily as this mechanism is believed 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.280
 offers a protective action against 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.620
 breast cancer in women 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.690
 remember that the change begins with each 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.850
 one of us and the smallest of the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.150
 actions has a great impact on the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.150
 long
