everything else is really small however

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.030 
everything else is really small however
the<00:02:44.220> tail<00:02:44.519> tail<00:02:45.510> boom<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:46.079> really<00:02:46.860> long

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the tail tail boom is really long

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.020 
the tail tail boom is really long
compared<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.760> its<00:02:47.910> frame<00:02:48.720> size<00:02:49.049> or<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:50.670> front

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
compared to its frame size or the front

compared to its frame size or the front
mass<00:02:51.329> here<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:52.590> again<00:02:52.709> well<00:02:53.489> Kara<00:02:53.700> says<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
mass here but again well Kara says is a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.600 
mass here but again well Kara says is a
smaller<00:02:54.599> than<00:02:54.900> genius<00:02:55.260> iffy<00:02:55.620> I'll<00:02:56.040> take<00:02:56.459> it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
smaller than genius iffy I'll take it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.660 
smaller than genius iffy I'll take it
and<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:57.239> will<00:02:57.420> see<00:02:57.690> how<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.440> flies<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.160> do<00:02:59.430> not

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
and we will see how it flies I do not

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.390 
and we will see how it flies I do not
have<00:02:59.910> my<00:03:00.120> genius<00:03:00.599> CP<00:03:01.019> with<00:03:01.200> me<00:03:01.379> but<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.709> do<00:03:01.829> have

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
have my genius CP with me but I do have

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.619 
have my genius CP with me but I do have
we<00:03:03.269> 100<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.650> 8<00:03:05.160> helicopters<00:03:05.879> so<00:03:06.090> let's<00:03:06.269> compare

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
we 100 do 8 helicopters so let's compare

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.629 
we 100 do 8 helicopters so let's compare
the<00:03:06.780> size<00:03:07.010> ok<00:03:08.010> here<00:03:08.280> we<00:03:08.400> are<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.819> can<00:03:09.780> see

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
the size ok here we are and you can see

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:20.140 
the size ok here we are and you can see
we<00:03:11.639> 120<00:03:12.209> do<00:03:12.420> -<00:03:12.569> s<00:03:14.359> V<00:03:15.359> 100<00:03:16.079> dl3<00:03:17.030> we<00:03:18.030> 100<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:19.109> 8<00:03:19.560> and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
we 120 do - s V 100 dl3 we 100 do 8 and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.319 
we 120 do - s V 100 dl3 we 100 do 8 and
walk<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> mini<00:03:21.900> CP<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.370> basically<00:03:23.940> if<00:03:24.299> you

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
walk here a mini CP so basically if you

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.009 
walk here a mini CP so basically if you
are<00:03:24.480> looking<00:03:24.930> at<00:03:25.079> them<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.730> front<00:03:27.000> mass<00:03:27.329> main

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
are looking at them the front mass main

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.210 
are looking at them the front mass main
rotor<00:03:28.349> head<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.670> frame<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.329> all<00:03:30.599> small<00:03:31.220> but

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
rotor head the frame is all small but

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.039 
rotor head the frame is all small but
again<00:03:32.519> when<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.910> comes<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.510> tail<00:03:33.750> boom

again when it comes to the tail boom

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.449 
again when it comes to the tail boom
length<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:35.250> reaching<00:03:35.819> almost<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:37.590> V<00:03:37.799> 100

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.150 
let's take the canopy off you can see
the<00:04:32.000> control<00:04:32.450> board<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:33.470> electronics

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
the control board the electronics

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.720 
the control board the electronics
everything<00:04:34.400> goes<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.840> front<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:38.560> mini

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
everything goes to the front and mini

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.730 
everything goes to the front and mini
digital<00:04:40.730> servos<00:04:41.270> which<00:04:41.750> are<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.350> same

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
digital servos which are the same

service<00:04:43.310> that<00:04:43.940> they<00:04:44.120> used<00:04:44.450> in<00:04:44.750> genius<00:04:45.470> CP<00:04:46.780> ok

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
service that they used in genius CP ok

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.890
