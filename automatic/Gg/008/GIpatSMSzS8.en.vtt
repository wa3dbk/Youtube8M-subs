00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hello, welcome, but a video. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.519
 My name is 14 and today I'm going to speak only one 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.870
 theme very specific lot of stupidity 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.870
 Then you have it. 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.640
 the very stupid word is to take the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.620
 always for some confusion 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.410
 because many people think like 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.230
 drummer is a part of the body or that 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.890
 a lot of stupid is a system trainings 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.110
 and there is the word itself is a little 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.239
 complicated then sometimes people 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.449
 they are not aware of things 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.920
 associate things so a little strange 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.370
 but do not be calm 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.039
 It's very simple, the metabolism is nothing. 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.229
 nothing less than the system 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:08.390
 energy of our body 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.390
 ok its the system as what causes it 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.490
 she as if she deviated as if she were our 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.250
 body a faster party three times 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.960
 but it is the metabolism that generates 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:25.220
 all this live is actually 20 in 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:30.080
 two great functions which is anabolism 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.649
 and the catar we look at the team in the good 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.740
 same 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.790
 let's realize that its west end function 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.250
 is to use energy to form new 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.650
 cells 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.369
 The catalog works precisely 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.950
 The opposite is because in these cells 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.670
 give more in the day and turn them into 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.950
 energy for the body to use and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.610
 very important attention 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.790
 it is difficult one of the functions is to 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.700
 operate normally only on the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.030
 metabolism are both functions 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.670
 at the same time although one with 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.920
 higher percentage the other as we but 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:18.470
 They are always tastes running at 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.299
 same time she explains how they work 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.280
 these two functions 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.260
 I'll give you an example because it's a 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.579
 example that I'm sure you've heard 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.609
 many times 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:31.340
 so imagine that you want to lose weight 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:35.299
 through exercise and going internet fact 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.060
 a survey and finds two large 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.080
 contradictory information 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.970
 the first one you find 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.340
 what I will do to be able to from 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.450
 do a workout at an intensity 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.540
 moderate with a long period of training 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.450
 and then in a second information 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.260
 Can you harvest it, will you check? 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.380
 which is also said you should to 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.200
 provide for shorter workouts in the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.150
 maximum 45 minutes with an interval inter 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.280
 will remain quite high 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.910
 so this is what I'm going to explain 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.230
 exactly how it all works 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.260
 so it 's very simple is when we 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.490
 provoke even pick means 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.560
 let's make the cells 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:30.360
 degrades to draw the energy that goes 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.959
 canalized to the muscles and when 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.330
 we are at amboim smooth that our 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.760
 How much is it going to cost us in the day to walk? 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.120
 to the musicians who were pleased 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.280
 vital systems that need to be 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.900
 regenerate 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.709
 So I think with you, you do a job. 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.720
 large volume with many hours and 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.180
 low intensity what will happen is 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.730
 that you will not cause a cataclysm 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.410
 in your body so it is a value that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.260
 You will not degrade the body like this. 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.090
 both because it will also invest in 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.300
 it's not that high 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.540
 ok but if you do the opposite you 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.480
 made is three short but with intervals of 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.940
 A very tall city will happen the chair 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.280
 this lot will be huge 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.260
 you can save the cells to the 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.360
 because the body will need the 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.070
 maximum of possible energy then as 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.560
 will need to store possible energy 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.900
 to perform that exercise you will 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.090
 improve many cells and this will 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.690
 cause extreme catabolism 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.280
 so that only comes once 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.160
 You'll learn to think about spending more. 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.520
 a day than the one that will consume 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.169
 then with the one where you train so much training 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.150
 shorter and shorter intervals 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.730
 intensity will cause 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.250
 is that you have produced a catalog of the most 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.650
 for short periods of time 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.590
 but the big difference is that you 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.570
 during the period either generation or 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.600
 during the present year the same stupidity 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.720
 your body will essentially 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.800
 on the road to rebuilding these 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.950
 cells that have been degraded and are 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.130
 so the body will do is to degrade 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.130
 cells to carry less replenish 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.570
 muscles during training and then after 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.390
 during the training period . 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.620
 and I 'll just pick up 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.320
 nor come to reset the levels and that 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.510
 degraded with the trailer is also very 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.120
 simple as seeing a lot today works 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.530
 this way if we make this second 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.930
 we will have a result 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.910
 much better and ready 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.250
 almost that is what the end of the 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.420
 tourism even if it receives the form 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.590
 how our body can acquire 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.340
 energy 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.160
 we do anabolism I will catch on 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.750
 energy to make new cells that 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.720
 were degraded 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.240
 Let's do catabolism means I 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.520
 go create new cells will please classes 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.480
 to transform energy is very 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.730
 simple 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.280
 I hope it was the other I have 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.820
 a question leave a comment and until the 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.820
 next summer
