00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.019
 now you yourself are here in dragon 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.569
 city ​​and well they will teach the 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:10.090
 best way to defeat the after Christ 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.920
 the Aztec priest and good for 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.230
 defeat him as to have the option to 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.560
 defeat him you have to complete the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.060
 third stage without paying gems if 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.580
 do you then you will get the icon of 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.100
 defeat the dragon and we will have to 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.320
 choosing a dragon to defeat it will be a 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.930
 one against one and the opposite dragon 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.869
 is in this case the aztex prest will have 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.729
 20% over the life of your dragon or be 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.829
 that to defeat it you have to try to use 

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:39.420
 low levels not high because if you have 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.420
 a lot of life is what is going to have even more 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.490
 until express is Aztec type and another more 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.470
 but the Aztec is actually plants 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.760
 so if you want to know the time of 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.210
 plant skills we go to the book of 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.210
 dragons 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.120
 and in plant it comes out that the weaknesses are 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.409
 land and ice then we will have to 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.600
 use a dragon that is land or ice to 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.939
 to be a hybrid or something like that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.670
 entities I guess it does not matter much 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.060
 I've used a weird hybrid or I'm going to 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.320
 use it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.470
 what is he 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.720
 the sight armadillo is worth then has 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.430
 to be at level 15 so you can learn 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.600
 a skill that learned steroid that 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.870
 it's dirt and it takes away a lot 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.150
 and well, it does not have stars 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.270
 bronze level and that's something that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.490
 I recommend that you do not have 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.869
 because the more stars more attacks 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.939
 more lives in yours but also more 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.460
 lives and in the other then it is worth 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.420
 important in those requirements one that 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 be level 15 2 that has an attack of 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.700
 land or ice and 3 this is 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.670
 improved skills good and if you want 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.950
 4 that does not have stars with those four 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.329
 things do not you have no problems going to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.000
 defeat him there are many ways to 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.409
 defeat him but with this afternoon he has 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.009
 100% get to the fight 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.720
 how difficult it is to always lose the same 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.400
 attack 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.410
 that by the way I was wrong about just 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.410
 use this asteroid 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.160
 anyway, if you notice the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.070
 another little 3000 and I have another mission to 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.240
 life so if by chance it starts 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.610
 the attacking 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:26.160
 also the desire you why 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.760
 let's give you your voice then why 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.350
 say is super assured of victory if 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.300
 you do not have an armadillo, you can use 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.750
 whatever one is from plant to 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.490
 ice is that I say ice land 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.830
 practically the same as lights 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.870
 we will enter the cigar, do not use the pure 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.400
 land because that I do not recommend it anymore 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.270
 that has more life and the other felt 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.790
 also more life 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.290
 but nothing that 's all to defeat him 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.180
 that the only thing that you have to have in 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.060
 Count then if you wanted to defeat 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.569
 also the Aztec and Aztec but 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.459
 Aztec emperor is exactly the same 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.520
 and there I go forward to defeat 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.470
 all three with using the armadillo you're worth 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.880
 and what about having an improved ability 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.880
 It is not 100% 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.010
 with one is important because you have already 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.340
 seen that equally with the attack of 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.630
 normal land that he brought could kill him 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.780
 but well that way you make sure even more 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.390
 victory that total is just wait two 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.340
 days to have the skill you're going 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.050
 doing before you need it to 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.730
 fight you do it before and so you have it 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.640
 for later and nothing I hope that I have 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.110
 served the video later you can watch the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.090
 channel if you want to see how it 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.650
 they get the objects from the parties that 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.180
 I have all the parts recorded and nothing 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.320
 but that you liked the video and we 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.320
 we see the next nothing god
