00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
then I sometimes it's animals cities and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.380 
then I sometimes it's animals cities and
people<00:01:33.900> there's<00:01:34.770> three<00:01:34.920> other<00:01:35.070> dividing<00:01:35.970> cuts

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

the collage they were called relief you

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.949 
the collage they were called relief you
know<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.340> was<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.790> wall<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.810> then

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
know and so it was on the wall and then

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.039 
know and so it was on the wall and then
there<00:03:52.109> was<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.829> relief<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:54.150> comes<00:03:54.510> off<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
there was a relief that comes off of the

there was a relief that comes off of the
wall

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
wall

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.310 
wall
although<00:03:57.340> relief<00:03:57.760> was<00:03:58.000> high<00:03:58.240> relief<00:03:58.690> ball

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
although relief was high relief ball

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.040 
although relief was high relief ball
relief<00:03:59.800> was<00:04:00.040> low<00:04:00.220> relief<00:04:00.610> if<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.180> only<00:04:01.510> showed

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
relief was low relief if you only showed

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.100 
relief was low relief if you only showed
this<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.400> was<00:04:03.580> low<00:04:03.910> relief<00:04:04.300> again<00:04:04.780> show<00:04:05.080> the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
this that was low relief again show the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.800 
this that was low relief again show the
whole<00:04:05.770> arm<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.940> was<00:04:07.210> also<00:04:08.170> really<00:04:08.740> so<00:04:09.810> then

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
whole arm that was also really so then

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.480 
whole arm that was also really so then
in<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.080> 20th<00:04:11.380> century<00:04:11.440> get<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.010> whole<00:04:12.310> new

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
in the 20th century get a whole new

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.170 
in the 20th century get a whole new
vocabulary<00:04:12.990> today<00:04:13.990> we<00:04:14.890> have<00:04:15.100> moved<00:04:15.370> into<00:04:15.580> such

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
vocabulary today we have moved into such

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.789 
vocabulary today we have moved into such
a<00:04:16.450> complex<00:04:17.790> bombardment<00:04:18.790> of<00:04:19.170> imagery<00:04:20.170> the

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
a complex bombardment of imagery the

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.070 
a complex bombardment of imagery the

painter in this case is moving off of
the<00:04:26.290> painted<00:04:26.740> surface<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:27.490> into<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.180> room<00:04:28.680> so

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
the painted surface and into the room so

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:38.670 
the painted surface and into the room so
that<00:04:29.890> you're<00:04:30.160> in<00:04:30.550> real<00:04:31.540> space<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:38.290> moment

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
that you're in real space the moment

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.460 
that you're in real space the moment
that<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.950> matriculate<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.850> 50s<00:04:40.360> there<00:04:41.260> was

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
that I matriculate in the 50s there was

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.970 
that I matriculate in the 50s there was
this<00:04:42.090> wanting<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.450> know<00:04:43.680> protrude<00:04:44.680> out

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
this wanting to you know protrude out

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.370 
this wanting to you know protrude out
into<00:04:45.460> life<00:04:45.730> you<00:04:46.480> know<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.780> up<00:04:46.960> against<00:04:47.320> the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
into life you know is up against the

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.860 
into life you know is up against the
wall<00:04:47.470> your<00:04:47.950> work<00:04:48.160> of<00:04:48.340> art<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:48.820> then<00:04:49.330> we<00:04:49.510> wanted

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
wall your work of art and then we wanted

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.190 
wall your work of art and then we wanted
to<00:04:49.990> somehow<00:04:50.350> be<00:04:50.590> part<00:04:51.370> of<00:04:51.580> life<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:52.870> know<00:04:52.900> and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
to somehow be part of life you know and

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.530 
to somehow be part of life you know and
that<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:53.650> think<00:04:54.040> that's<00:04:54.580> when<00:04:54.910> all<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.180> a<00:04:55.210> sudden

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
that I think that's when all of a sudden

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.240 
that I think that's when all of a sudden
what<00:04:56.230> was<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:56.410> relief<00:04:56.890> on<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.250> wall<00:04:57.460> becomes<00:04:57.940> a

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
what was a relief on the wall becomes a

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.760 
what was a relief on the wall becomes a
sculpture<00:05:00.250> in<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.490> round<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.840> just<00:05:02.350> go<00:05:02.530> by

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
sculpture in the round and I just go by

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.860 
sculpture in the round and I just go by
the<00:05:02.830> piece<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.340> have<00:05:03.490> no<00:05:03.670> blueprint<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.690> don't

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
the piece I have no blueprint I don't

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.580 
the piece I have no blueprint I don't
have<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.020> story<00:05:05.380> at<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.620> time<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:06.430> they<00:05:06.730> tell<00:05:07.030> me

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590
