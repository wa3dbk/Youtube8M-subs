going to show you how I usually do the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.960 
going to show you how I usually do the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
masks that use them of course

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.170 
masks that use them of course
so<00:00:39.970> oh<00:00:40.620> goodness<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.829> which<00:00:41.980> one<00:00:42.159> which<00:00:42.790> pixels

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
so oh goodness I which one which pixels

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.420 
so oh goodness I which one which pixels
to<00:00:43.360> use<00:00:43.449> but<00:00:43.629> I<00:00:43.659> got<00:00:43.780> 256<00:00:44.470> is<00:00:44.680> kind<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.100> easier

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
to use but I got 256 is kind of easier

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.110 
to use but I got 256 is kind of easier
to<00:00:45.579> use<00:00:45.760> um<00:00:47.820> first<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:49.000> all<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.550> eyes<00:00:51.730> is<00:00:52.089> the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
to use um first of all the eyes is the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.140 
to use um first of all the eyes is the
eyes<00:00:52.780> is<00:00:53.199> what<00:00:54.040> you're<00:00:54.189> going<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.430> base<00:00:54.640> the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
eyes is what you're going to base the

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.619 
eyes is what you're going to base the
mask<00:00:55.390> around<00:00:55.780> um<00:00:56.369> it's<00:00:57.369> going<00:00:57.790> to<00:00:57.939> be<00:00:58.030> what<00:00:58.360> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
mask around um it's going to be what you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.729 
mask around um it's going to be what you
incorporate<00:01:01.629> around<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.170> eyes

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
incorporate around the eyes

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.200 
incorporate around the eyes
that<00:01:03.159> are<00:01:03.280> going<00:01:03.369> to<00:01:03.460> make<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:03.699> masks<00:01:04.030> look

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
that are going to make the masks look

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.200 
that are going to make the masks look
better<00:01:04.420> then<00:01:05.049> it<00:01:05.170> actually<00:01:05.670> would<00:01:06.670> be<00:01:06.700> if<00:01:07.030> you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
better then it actually would be if you

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.609 
better then it actually would be if you
just<00:01:07.390> did<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.689> design<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.049> then<00:01:08.259> cut<00:01:08.500> the

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
just did the design and then cut the

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.020 
just did the design and then cut the
eyes<00:01:08.770> out<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.159> middle<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.950> just<00:01:12.220> me<00:01:12.430> if

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
eyes out in the middle that's just me if

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.210 
eyes out in the middle that's just me if
you<00:01:13.210> guys<00:01:13.360> find<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:13.990> um<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:16.540> you<00:01:16.689> find<00:01:17.020> that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you guys find that um that you find that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.039 
you guys find that um that you find that
making<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.640> design<00:01:19.180> person<00:01:19.600> then<00:01:19.780> put<00:01:19.960> the

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
making the design person then put the

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.350 
making the design person then put the
icin<00:01:20.380> that's<00:01:20.650> easy<00:01:20.860> for<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.159> then<00:01:21.850> by<00:01:22.329> all

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
icin that's easy for you then by all

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.190 
icin that's easy for you then by all
means<00:01:22.450> go<00:01:22.869> ahead

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
means go ahead

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.110 
means go ahead
um<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:26.320> all<00:01:26.740> probably<00:01:27.040> know<00:01:27.220> that<00:01:27.670> my<00:01:27.940> last

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
um so you all probably know that my last

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.250 
um so you all probably know that my last
tutorial<00:01:28.420> show<00:01:28.870> you<00:01:28.930> guys<00:01:29.140> what<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.760> mirror

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
tutorial show you guys what the mirror

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.310 
tutorial show you guys what the mirror
button<00:01:32.260> does<00:01:32.470> which<00:01:32.740> means<00:01:32.980> it<00:01:33.250> basically<00:01:34.320> by

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
button does which means it basically by

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.380 
button does which means it basically by
zooming<00:01:35.590> into<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.130> halfway<00:01:36.400> point<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:37.150> can

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
zooming into the halfway point I can

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.750 
zooming into the halfway point I can
literally<00:01:37.720> do<00:01:37.930> this<00:01:37.960> side<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:38.740> have<00:01:39.550> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
literally do this side and have the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.670 
literally do this side and have the
other<00:01:39.909> side<00:01:40.150> be<00:01:40.540> flipped<00:01:40.840> onto<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.290> other<00:01:41.470> one

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
other side be flipped onto the other one

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.560 
other side be flipped onto the other one
so<00:01:42.370> that<00:01:42.490> they<00:01:42.580> become<00:01:42.850> symmetrical<00:01:43.420> on<00:01:43.540> both

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
so that they become symmetrical on both

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:52.800 
so that they become symmetrical on both
sides<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:49.330> yeah<00:01:49.510> I<00:01:50.640> got<00:01:51.640> my<00:01:51.760> HD<00:01:52.090> PVR<00:01:52.270> which<00:01:52.690> is

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
sides so yeah I got my HD PVR which is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.070 
sides so yeah I got my HD PVR which is
pretty<00:01:52.960> awesome<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.909> will<00:01:55.540> be<00:01:55.690> uploading

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
pretty awesome so I will be uploading

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.660 
pretty awesome so I will be uploading
more<00:01:56.110> tutorials<00:01:56.710> like<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:57.220> if<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.490> guys

channel so right now I'm just doing like

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.220 
channel so right now I'm just doing like
random<00:02:08.229> designs<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.220> are<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:11.590> random

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
random designs that are really random

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.100 
random designs that are really random
I'm<00:02:14.230> kind<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.739> getting<00:02:15.010> used<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.549> whole

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I'm kind of getting used to the whole

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.850 
I'm kind of getting used to the whole
spikes<00:02:17.110> kind<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.890> look<00:02:18.239> or<00:02:19.530> tribal<00:02:20.530> if<00:02:20.769> you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
spikes kind of look or tribal if you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.470 
spikes kind of look or tribal if you
want<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.069> call<00:02:21.189> it<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.640> really<00:02:22.209> like<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
want to call it that I really like the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.000 
want to call it that I really like the
way<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.629> looks<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:25.599> just<00:02:25.870> gives<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.290> more

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
way it looks it just gives it that more

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.990 
way it looks it just gives it that more
of<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.220> beast<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.360> look

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.449 

so<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.599> can<00:02:31.720> see<00:02:31.980> Marty's<00:02:32.980> coming<00:02:33.160> along

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
so as you can see Marty's coming along

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.470 
so as you can see Marty's coming along
but<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.860> looks<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.340> bit<00:02:36.370> too<00:02:36.610> rounded<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.180> bit<00:02:37.330> too

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
but it looks a bit too rounded a bit too

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.890 
but it looks a bit too rounded a bit too
small<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.550> minute<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.910> think<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.239> start<00:02:40.750> to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
small so in a minute I think I start to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.470 
small so in a minute I think I start to
edit<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.410> but<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.220> would<00:02:42.430> be<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.730> basics<00:02:43.209> of

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
edit it but this would be the basics of

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.370 
edit it but this would be the basics of
where<00:02:43.989> mark<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.910> could<00:02:46.120> easily<00:02:46.239> use<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.080> I

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
where mark you could easily use this I

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.820 
where mark you could easily use this I
mean<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.209> it's<00:02:49.209> kind<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.630> hurricane<00:02:49.830> star

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
mean like it's kind of a hurricane star

mean like it's kind of a hurricane star
mask<00:02:51.160> right<00:02:51.550> now<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:53.950> yeah<00:02:54.640> here<00:02:54.819> we<00:02:54.849> go

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
mask right now so I'm yeah here we go

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.559 
mask right now so I'm yeah here we go
I'm<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:56.680> rubbing<00:02:56.890> out<00:02:57.160> what<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:58.150> original

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
I'm just rubbing out what the original

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.520 
I'm just rubbing out what the original
line<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.519> I<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.980> start<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:04.290> draw<00:03:05.290> some<00:03:05.500> more

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
line and I just start to draw some more

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.720 
line and I just start to draw some more
random<00:03:06.340> lines<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.880> do<00:03:07.239> find<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.690> if<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.959> just

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
random lines I do find that if you just

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.410 
random lines I do find that if you just
don't<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:10.709> any<00:03:11.760> idea<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.819> what<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.150> want<00:03:13.360> to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
don't have any idea of what you want to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.970 
don't have any idea of what you want to
use<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:15.780> just<00:03:16.780> draw<00:03:17.380> something<00:03:17.680> that

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
use that you just draw something that

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.170 
use that you just draw something that
you<00:03:18.069> think<00:03:18.280> would<00:03:18.430> look<00:03:18.610> good<00:03:18.670> then<00:03:19.030> that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
you think would look good then that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.670 
you think would look good then that
becomes<00:03:19.569> easier<00:03:20.080> I<00:03:22.049> know<00:03:23.049> that<00:03:23.319> drawing<00:03:23.530> a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
becomes easier I know that drawing a

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.039 
becomes easier I know that drawing a
picture<00:03:23.860> makes<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.970> paint'll<00:03:25.330> much<00:03:25.569> easy<00:03:25.810> to

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
picture makes the paint'll much easy to

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.030 
picture makes the paint'll much easy to
draw<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:27.660> think<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.959> if<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.530> draw<00:03:29.799> as<00:03:29.860> you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
draw but I think that if you draw as you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.110 
draw but I think that if you draw as you
go<00:03:30.250> then<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.819> makes<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:32.680> little<00:03:33.160> better

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
go then it makes it that little better

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.020 
go then it makes it that little better
to<00:03:34.540> be<00:03:34.630> honest<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:39.190> yeah<00:03:39.310> right<00:03:39.549> now<00:03:39.730> I'm<00:03:39.850> doing

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
to be honest so yeah right now I'm doing

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.250 
to be honest so yeah right now I'm doing
another<00:03:40.840> layer<00:03:41.109> that<00:03:41.440> will<00:03:41.680> become<00:03:43.260> around

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
another layer that will become around

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.069 
another layer that will become around
the<00:03:44.410> mask<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.190> will<00:03:45.519> like<00:03:45.730> links<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.660> jaw<00:03:46.870> line

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
the mask so will like links the jaw line

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:57.270 
the mask so will like links the jaw line
sort<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:48.010> area<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:53.200> one's<00:03:53.470> kind<00:03:53.859> of<00:03:53.980> like<00:03:56.280> one

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
sort of area this one's kind of like one

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.030 
sort of area this one's kind of like one
that<00:03:57.459> would<00:03:57.700> be<00:03:57.730> used<00:03:58.150> for<00:03:58.239> a<00:03:58.959> face<00:03:59.500> paint<00:03:59.829> more

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
that would be used for a face paint more

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.460 
that would be used for a face paint more
than<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.280> mask<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:03.510> with<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.720> white<00:04:04.930> color

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
than a mask but with the white color

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.020 
than a mask but with the white color
combinations<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.220> mask<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.880> could

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
combinations on the mask then it could

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.520 
combinations on the mask then it could
work<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:10.030> will<00:04:10.450> put<00:04:10.569> this<00:04:10.690> up<00:04:10.840> on<00:04:10.989> community

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:51.119 
the description so don't check that and
now<00:05:45.989> I<00:05:48.959> do<00:05:49.959> you<00:05:50.110> think<00:05:50.319> this<00:05:50.439> is<00:05:50.619> quite<00:05:50.919> a<00:05:51.039> good

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
now I do you think this is quite a good

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:52.649 
now I do you think this is quite a good
mask<00:05:51.459> now<00:05:51.699> if<00:05:51.849> you<00:05:51.939> look<00:05:52.089> at<00:05:52.179> it<00:05:52.300> now

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
mask now if you look at it now

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.339 
mask now if you look at it now
I<00:05:52.689> mean<00:05:53.619> that<00:05:53.979> could<00:05:54.159> easily<00:05:54.929> be<00:05:55.929> transferred

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
I mean that could easily be transferred

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.679 
I mean that could easily be transferred
into<00:05:56.679> even<00:05:56.919> a<00:05:56.949> kick<00:05:57.159> pad<00:05:57.399> or<00:05:58.289> like<00:05:59.289> the<00:06:00.509> fun<00:06:01.509> bit

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:01.689 
into even a kick pad or like the fun bit

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:07.529 
into even a kick pad or like the fun bit
of<00:06:01.839> some<00:06:02.319> tights<00:06:02.589> maybe<00:06:04.769> so<00:06:05.849> the<00:06:06.849> coloring<00:06:07.329> I

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
of some tights maybe so the coloring I

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.209 
of some tights maybe so the coloring I
do<00:06:07.599> think<00:06:07.989> the<00:06:08.319> coloring<00:06:08.739> is<00:06:08.829> one<00:06:08.919> of<00:06:09.009> the<00:06:09.069> most

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
do think the coloring is one of the most

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.669 
do think the coloring is one of the most
important<00:06:09.699> things<00:06:09.879> that<00:06:09.969> you<00:06:10.119> do<00:06:10.619> go<00:06:11.619> in

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:11.679 
important things that you do go in

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:14.819 
important things that you do go in
yellow<00:06:12.099> I've<00:06:12.459> already<00:06:13.119> proved<00:06:13.360> like<00:06:13.899> quite<00:06:14.799> a

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:14.829 
yellow I've already proved like quite a

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:15.959 
yellow I've already proved like quite a
good<00:06:15.039> combination<00:06:15.279> so<00:06:15.610> I'm<00:06:15.699> going<00:06:15.819> to<00:06:15.879> use

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
good combination so I'm going to use

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.659 
good combination so I'm going to use
that<00:06:16.089> now<00:06:16.739> as<00:06:17.739> you<00:06:17.919> can<00:06:18.039> tell<00:06:18.099> that<00:06:18.459> looks

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
that now as you can tell that looks

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:25.399 
that now as you can tell that looks
pretty<00:06:19.569> awesome<00:06:21.599> so<00:06:22.619> that<00:06:23.619> is<00:06:23.860> how

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
pretty awesome so that is how

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.379 
pretty awesome so that is how
like<00:06:26.409> the<00:06:26.529> basics<00:06:27.039> of<00:06:27.159> a<00:06:27.249> design<00:06:27.610> from<00:06:28.089> masks

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
like the basics of a design from masks

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.199 
like the basics of a design from masks
or<00:06:29.019> even<00:06:29.229> a<00:06:29.289> face<00:06:29.499> paint<00:06:29.849> and<00:06:30.849> you<00:06:30.999> can<00:06:31.119> always

or even a face paint and you can always
mess<00:06:31.449> around<00:06:31.569> with<00:06:31.719> a<00:06:31.779> face<00:06:31.959> pain<00:06:32.289> default<00:06:33.249> to
