00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
something I personally for I'd never

something I personally for I'd never
address<00:00:14.019> in<00:00:14.140> a<00:00:14.200> video<00:00:14.470> however<00:00:15.070> avoiding<00:00:15.490> this

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
address in a video however avoiding this

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.790 
address in a video however avoiding this
mindset<00:00:15.940> can<00:00:16.180> be<00:00:16.299> super<00:00:16.660> beneficial<00:00:16.840> so<00:00:17.679> the

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
mindset can be super beneficial so the

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.050 
mindset can be super beneficial so the
mindset<00:00:18.160> I'm<00:00:18.220> talking<00:00:18.550> about<00:00:18.640> is<00:00:18.910> when<00:00:19.030> a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
mindset I'm talking about is when a

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.730 
mindset I'm talking about is when a
champion<00:00:19.449> receives<00:00:19.690> a<00:00:19.810> nerve<00:00:20.020> in<00:00:20.230> any<00:00:20.410> form

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
champion receives a nerve in any form

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.320 
champion receives a nerve in any form
and<00:00:20.949> all<00:00:21.160> of<00:00:21.280> a<00:00:21.340> sudden<00:00:21.580> the<00:00:21.670> lead<00:00:21.850> community

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
and all of a sudden the lead community

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.300 
and all of a sudden the lead community
give<00:00:22.630> up<00:00:22.750> on<00:00:22.869> that<00:00:22.900> champion<00:00:23.470> this<00:00:23.949> comes<00:00:24.190> down

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
give up on that champion this comes down

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.950 
give up on that champion this comes down
to<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.520> couple<00:00:24.699> of<00:00:24.910> factors<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.570> I<00:00:25.690> think<00:00:25.900> the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
to a couple of factors and I think the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.480 
to a couple of factors and I think the
main<00:00:26.170> reasoning<00:00:26.650> is<00:00:26.800> when<00:00:26.949> a<00:00:26.980> champion<00:00:27.400> is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
main reasoning is when a champion is

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.310 
main reasoning is when a champion is
balanced<00:00:27.940> and<00:00:28.000> no<00:00:28.210> longer<00:00:28.539> god<00:00:28.720> tier<00:00:28.960> then

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
balanced and no longer god tier then

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.720 
balanced and no longer god tier then
they<00:00:29.470> stop<00:00:29.680> seeing<00:00:29.920> as<00:00:30.010> much<00:00:30.130> competitive

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730
