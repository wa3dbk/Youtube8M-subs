00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I would build it I would build the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.000 
I would build it I would build the
inside<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> drawers<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.880> mahogany

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
inside of the drawers out of mahogany

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.290 
inside of the drawers out of mahogany
I<00:01:50.840> built<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.100> 1995<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.910> looks<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.120> I

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
I built this in 1995 and it looks like I

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.960 
I built this in 1995 and it looks like I
signed<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> ballpoint<00:01:55.260> pen<00:01:55.970> it's

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
signed it with a ballpoint pen it's

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.850 
signed it with a ballpoint pen it's
better<00:01:57.180> than<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.570> signing<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:58.530> but

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
better than not signing it at all but

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.700 
better than not signing it at all but
it's<00:01:59.580> the<00:02:00.030> burning<00:02:00.240> pen<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.870> much<00:02:01.200> nicer<00:02:01.410> way

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it's the burning pen is a much nicer way

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.590 
it's the burning pen is a much nicer way
to<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.980> for<00:02:02.220> signing<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.610> work<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:03.540> the
