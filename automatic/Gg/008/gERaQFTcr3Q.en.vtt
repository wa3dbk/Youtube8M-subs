00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
the one thing I've noticed is that a lot

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.209 
the one thing I've noticed is that a lot
of<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.289> times<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:32.590> alternate<00:00:33.590> form<00:00:34.010> of<00:00:34.129> the

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
of the times the alternate form of the

of the times the alternate form of the
Transformers<00:00:34.909> was<00:00:35.809> not<00:00:36.440> only<00:00:36.710> just<00:00:36.949> for

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
Transformers was not only just for

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.279 
Transformers was not only just for
disguise<00:00:37.640> but<00:00:38.059> also<00:00:38.210> for<00:00:38.629> utilitarian

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
disguise but also for utilitarian

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.459 
disguise but also for utilitarian
purposes<00:00:40.479> like<00:00:41.479> for<00:00:41.539> instance<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.109> know<00:00:42.140> yeah

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
purposes like for instance you know yeah

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.770 
purposes like for instance you know yeah
Optimus<00:00:42.949> could<00:00:42.979> Optimus<00:00:43.729> or<00:00:43.940> jazz<00:00:44.239> or<00:00:44.539> whoever

Optimus could Optimus or jazz or whoever
could<00:00:44.989> run<00:00:45.699> but<00:00:46.699> they<00:00:47.210> could<00:00:47.389> also<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:48.530> know

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
could run but they could also you know

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.689 
could run but they could also you know
if<00:00:48.679> they<00:00:48.800> really<00:00:48.829> wanted<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.429> be<00:00:49.550> more

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
if they really wanted to be more

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.939 
if they really wanted to be more
efficient<00:00:50.300> or<00:00:50.539> they<00:00:51.260> really<00:00:51.499> needed<00:00:51.679> to<00:00:51.800> go

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
efficient or they really needed to go

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.660 
efficient or they really needed to go
fast<00:00:52.329> transform<00:00:53.329> into<00:00:53.449> a<00:00:53.539> car<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.769> know<00:00:54.920> so

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
fast transform into a car you know so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.789 
fast transform into a car you know so
you<00:00:55.699> don't<00:00:55.789> have<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:56.449> motion<00:00:57.319> going<00:00:57.530> here

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
you don't have this motion going here

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.479 
you don't have this motion going here
like<00:00:57.979> this<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:58.999> know<00:00:59.149> an<00:00:59.269> i<00:00:59.389> tip<00:00:59.679> then<00:01:00.679> Nina

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
like this you know an i tip then Nina

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.960 
like this you know an i tip then Nina
there<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.059> go<00:01:02.209> and<00:01:02.569> this<00:01:02.719> zoom<00:01:03.400> off<00:01:04.400> to<00:01:04.790> you

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
there you go and this zoom off to you

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.569 
there you go and this zoom off to you
know<00:01:05.030> wherever<00:01:05.690> you<00:01:05.840> got<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.080> go<00:01:06.430> same<00:01:07.430> thing

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
know wherever you got to go same thing

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.100 
know wherever you got to go same thing
for<00:01:07.670> Decepticons<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.390> know<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.630> Decepticons

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
for Decepticons you know the Decepticons

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.980 
for Decepticons you know the Decepticons
could<00:01:09.289> fly<00:01:09.500> like<00:01:09.530> Superman<00:01:10.539> but<00:01:11.710> they<00:01:13.899> but<00:01:14.899> if

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
could fly like Superman but they but if

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.109 
could fly like Superman but they but if
they<00:01:15.079> needed<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.409> go<00:01:15.469> faster<00:01:16.159> transform<00:01:17.000> into

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
they needed to go faster transform into

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.770 
they needed to go faster transform into
supersonic<00:01:17.689> jets<00:01:17.960> things<00:01:18.859> like<00:01:19.039> that<00:01:19.390> if<00:01:20.390> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
supersonic jets things like that if you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.130 
supersonic jets things like that if you
ever<00:01:20.810> read<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:21.590> comics<00:01:22.329> in<00:01:23.329> the<00:01:23.390> comics<00:01:23.899> right
