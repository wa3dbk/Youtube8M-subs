00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
for cooling the product down let me go

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
for cooling the product down let me go
ahead<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.400> show<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> how<00:01:30.259> it<00:01:31.259> works<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
ahead and show you how it works with a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.330 
ahead and show you how it works with a
dualshock<00:01:32.400> 3<00:01:32.610> controller<00:01:33.829> you<00:01:34.829> turn<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
dualshock 3 controller you turn on the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.010 
dualshock 3 controller you turn on the
dock<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.780> it's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
dock here as you can see there it's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.569 
dock here as you can see there it's
green<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> has<00:01:38.430> no

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
green right now because it has no

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
green right now because it has no
controllers<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.240> once<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.600> drop<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
controllers in it once you drop a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
controllers in it once you drop a
controller<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:44.220> see

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
controller and just like this you see

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.080 
controller and just like this you see
that<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.790> light<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.329> turned<00:01:45.840> red<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> i'll

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that the light now turned red so i'll

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the controller is actually charging as i

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
the controller is actually charging as i
said<00:01:55.290> before<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.890> takes<00:01:56.009> about<00:01:56.219> two<00:01:56.610> hours<00:01:56.640> for

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
said before it takes about two hours for

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.420 
said before it takes about two hours for
the<00:01:57.210> controller<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.780> fully<00:01:58.110> charge<00:01:58.399> which<00:01:59.399> is

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the controller to fully charge which is

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.600 
the controller to fully charge which is
pretty<00:01:59.909> decent<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.500> adapter<00:02:01.979> here<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.369> pops

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
pretty decent the adapter here just pops

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.060 
pretty decent the adapter here just pops
in<00:02:02.759> from<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.969> back<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.360> controller<00:02:04.070> just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
in from the back of the controller just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.749 
in from the back of the controller just
like<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:06.500> then<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.649> simply<00:02:07.890> drop<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.640> you

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
like that then you simply drop in you

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.590 
like that then you simply drop in you
can<00:02:08.910> told<00:02:09.149> her<00:02:09.209> into<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> dock

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
can told her into the dock

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.800 
can told her into the dock
and<00:02:12.600> there<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.410> go<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.950> charging<00:02:14.810> so

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and there we go it is charging so

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.960 
and there we go it is charging so
although<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.590> must<00:02:17.130> say<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.670> product

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
although I must say that this product

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.470 
although I must say that this product
does<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> very<00:02:19.410> very<00:02:19.709> nice<00:02:19.950> design<00:02:20.480> it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
does have a very very nice design it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.390 
does have a very very nice design it
charges<00:02:22.050> controllers<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.740> does<00:02:22.890> exactly<00:02:23.190> what

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
charges controllers it does exactly what

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.520 
charges controllers it does exactly what
it's<00:02:23.580> supposed<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.390> would<00:02:24.900> give<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.319> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it's supposed to do I would give it and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's supposed to do I would give it and
9<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.520> 10<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.420> only<00:02:27.720> thing<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.110> did

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
9 out of 10 the only thing that I did

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.620 
9 out of 10 the only thing that I did
not<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.770> about<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:29.280> dock<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.360> when

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
not like about this dock was that when

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.910 
not like about this dock was that when
you<00:02:30.720> place<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.110> controller<00:02:31.440> down<00:02:31.650> here

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
you place the controller down here

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.100 
you place the controller down here
you'll<00:02:32.910> see<00:02:32.940> how<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.180> controller<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> bit

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you'll see how the controller is a bit

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.910 
you'll see how the controller is a bit
loose<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.989> dick<00:02:37.200> bothered<00:02:37.620> me<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> little

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
loose and that dick bothered me a little

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.610 
loose and that dick bothered me a little
bit<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:38.850> not<00:02:38.940> really<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.270> actual<00:02:40.020> problem<00:02:40.500> as

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
bit it's not really a actual problem as

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.260 
bit it's not really a actual problem as
it<00:02:40.650> does<00:02:40.980> charge<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.400> control<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.850> does<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
it does charge of control and does it

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.390 
it does charge of control and does it
everything<00:02:42.690> as<00:02:42.810> its<00:02:42.959> supposed<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:44.220> it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
everything as its supposed to do but it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.560 
everything as its supposed to do but it
doesn't<00:02:44.430> normally<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:45.269> bit<00:02:45.390> when

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
doesn't normally a little bit when

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.180 
doesn't normally a little bit when
you're<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.870> moving<00:02:46.590> your<00:02:46.680> desk<00:02:46.860> round<00:02:47.100> or

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
you're like moving your desk round or

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.570 
you're like moving your desk round or
something<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:48.030> controller's<00:02:48.570> wobbly<00:02:49.580> that's

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
something the controller's wobbly that's

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.690 
something the controller's wobbly that's
the<00:02:50.820> only<00:02:51.269> con<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.590> product<00:02:52.920> so
