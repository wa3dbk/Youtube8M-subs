package and then it'll ask you to reboot
your<00:01:05.189> device<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.960> test

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
your device and that's really the test

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
your device and that's really the test
because<00:01:07.590> normally<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.610> reboot<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
because normally if you reboot a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.850 
because normally if you reboot a
tethered<00:01:09.840> jailbreak<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.350> actually<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
tethered jailbreak you actually have to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.350 
tethered jailbreak you actually have to
connect<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.369> computer<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.330> a

like<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.210> time<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.930> real

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
like that but this time this is the real

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.740 
like that but this time this is the real
test<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> reboot<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.880> by<00:01:18.210> typing<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
test but a reboot just by typing that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.359 
test but a reboot just by typing that
and<00:01:19.049> we're<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> reboot<00:01:20.220> without

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and we're going to reboot without

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.160 
and we're going to reboot without
needing<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.000> connect<00:01:21.390> our<00:01:21.540> device<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> any

anything<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.369> ready<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:24.060> because

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
anything it's just ready to go because

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.630 
anything it's just ready to go because
it<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:24.960> an<00:01:25.290> untethered<00:01:26.250> jailbreak

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it is now an untethered jailbreak

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.490 
it is now an untethered jailbreak
instead<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.509> tethered<00:01:27.869> jailbreak<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
instead of a tethered jailbreak so that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170 
instead of a tethered jailbreak so that
makes<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.829> world<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.280> difference<00:01:29.340> especially
