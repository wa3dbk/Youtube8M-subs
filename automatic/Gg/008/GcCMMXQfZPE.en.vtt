00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.850
 I want to introduce you to the ATV park 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.799
 Chinese manufacturer that is to say 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.530
 In principle, it is very good for the mountain 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.340
 the terrain is also good for urban 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.590
 terrain in general we give the chassis 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 on the chassis installed two 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.520
 shock absorber with stiffness regulator 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.640
 that allow you to regulate it under 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380
 your weight is your comfort set 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.510
 brake system both in front and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.080
 rear hydraulic i.e. disc 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.920
 brakes 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.780
 everything is completely rubber we get 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.390
 fell on this life and as for the mountain 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.390
 terrain wheels completely 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:47.420
 one-piece without any holes openings 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 there are they strengthened move on to the motor 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 which we have four stroke 125 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.480
 cubic centimeters box system 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
 gear shift semi-automatic 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.489
 that is, there is no clutch you just 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.710
 shift gears present in 4 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.540
 transfer and one back that is also 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.729
 are present back in the afternoon at the back 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 on the back of the annual also 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.320
 shock absorber with regulator installed 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.900
 stiffness 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.550
 brake system installed 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.890
 hydraulic 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:29.040
 It turns out the drive chain principle 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.870
 there is a very fast motor drain 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.210
 useful for those who learn to ride only 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.310
 that is, when we pull it out 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 mutes the motor but can not start 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 motor until we put on 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.960
 place put in place with we can start 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:49.110
 we go to this part here is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.620
 metal footboard that goes 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.360
 teeth specifically to 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.730

 protective arc ie foot 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.850
 accidentally flew off so that is 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.060
 wheel or wherever 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.390
 fuel system carburetor viz 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.220

 air also we have an electro starter 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.750
 electric starter 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.150
 here there are chuk for replacement 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.489
 oils that is at a certain kilometers

 same when you drive just fill in 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.070
 when me these oils are poured here 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.230
 from the bottom there is a board that spins up and 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.810
 all the oil flows that is when replacing we 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.030
 unscrew this bolt oil flows a 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.890
 then just twist it into place 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.600

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:16.130
 it also lights up when turned on 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:22.370
 reverse it lights up red 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:26.350
 there is also no motor on the steering wheel and that is 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.350
 motor silenced call upon 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.300
 dipped headlamp switches
