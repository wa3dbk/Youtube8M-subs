00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.400

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.480
 and beside me sabine sick only completely 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.730

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.620
 otherwise we are at the christmas decoration 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.480
 tinkering penetrate here in pontoniere home 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.219
 in Buch next to the beautiful 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.590
 highway may also be seen 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.300
 Perhaps you can hear in the background the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.330
 highway through the rhine valley straight 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 porto nieheim and here on the left 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.029
 the tribe is the 13 there was still young 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.689
 and wizard is about as we are 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.450
 Both of you and I decorate brinkmann 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:39.570
 seen that you are so beautiful 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:43.530
 este hast knows what exactly is that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.969
 shrub snowed with this spree that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.149
 I am very modern this year 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.199
 everything should be so snowy so that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.860
 is very much bought and used 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 and maybe on nature and art 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.629
 So first come together and become 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.850
 then in the future with this snow spray there 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.710
 So to speak, we still have conversation below 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 Two blueberries we wanted to join 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.400
 Get us blueberries at nursery school 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.049
 who are now but still too small so 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.369
 We would like to talk to you now 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.290
 do not abuse us 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 think about what else could plant 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.909
 one will use to spray again 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 Eight a corkscrew hate the why 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.250
 we have a devil to hunt plants 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.630
 Corkscrew both taken the one to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.500
 can talk now you show us 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.500
 contradict 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.970
 A commercial eulogies they can 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.870
 shopping hardware stores and just not 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 speak against me 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.520
 I do that there is a reason why 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.890
 we are outside or fast in the white 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.720
 rated so spray 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.760
 that works very well so how 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.790
 There's also already ready to buy 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.280
 the branches but you can do that too 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.270
 Do it yourself and you can do it everywhere 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 also for dry fruits to use 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.940
 For example, you can use it everywhere 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.740
 and that looks so nice 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.720
 if she does not give any natural anymore 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.460
 like now just how one sees easily 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.430
 then you can produce it artificially 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.170
 that's how accurate we are 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.290
 Wish you real snow too 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.290
 Christmas
