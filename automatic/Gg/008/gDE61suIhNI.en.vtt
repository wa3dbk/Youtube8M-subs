think<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.880> dual<00:02:32.510> LED<00:02:33.080> right<00:02:33.650> there<00:02:33.980> an<00:02:34.940> eight

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
think of dual LED right there an eight

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.490 
think of dual LED right there an eight
megapixel<00:02:35.450> autofocus<00:02:36.850> camera<00:02:37.850> also<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.990> 1.3

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500

megapixel<00:02:41.440> front-facing<00:02:42.440> camera<00:02:44.020> also<00:02:45.020> has

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
megapixel front-facing camera also has

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.040 
megapixel front-facing camera also has

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.870 

and<00:02:51.459> all<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.670> typical<00:02:53.530> Android<00:02:54.880> Android

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
and all the typical Android Android

and all the typical Android Android
things<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.270> you'd<00:02:56.420> expect<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:57.680> can

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
things that you'd expect you can

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.800 
things that you'd expect you can
download<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.220> broadband<00:02:58.880> speed<00:02:59.150> test<00:02:59.390> give<00:02:59.690> you

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
download a broadband speed test give you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.460 
download a broadband speed test give you
a<00:02:59.840> look<00:02:59.989> at<00:03:00.050> what<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.380> forty<00:03:01.040> signal<00:03:02.470> looks

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
a look at what the forty signal looks

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.500 
a look at what the forty signal looks
like<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.920> now<00:03:03.950> broadband<00:03:04.610> speed<00:03:04.910> test<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.390> mean

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
like and now broadband speed test I mean

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.300 
like and now broadband speed test I mean
we're<00:03:05.690> not<00:03:05.780> gonna<00:03:06.010> say<00:03:07.010> that's<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.280> most

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
we're not gonna say that's the most

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.570 
we're not gonna say that's the most
accurate<00:03:07.730> test<00:03:08.690> in<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.959> world<00:03:09.200> however<00:03:12.580> what

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
accurate test in the world however what

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.580 
accurate test in the world however what
I<00:03:13.610> can<00:03:13.700> say<00:03:14.300> is<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:16.750> at<00:03:17.750> least<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.200> lets<00:03:18.350> you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
I can say is that at least it lets you

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.910 
I can say is that at least it lets you
you<00:03:19.190> know<00:03:19.280> do<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.489> comparison<00:03:20.120> between<00:03:20.209> devices

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
you know do a comparison between devices

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.390 
you know do a comparison between devices
so

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
so

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.539 
so
there's<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.560> interface<00:03:25.560> there<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.250> retrieving

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
there's a interface there to retrieving

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:35.360 
there's a interface there to retrieving
the<00:03:26.610> server<00:03:26.819> list

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.410 

okay<00:03:36.370> it's<00:03:36.490> got<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.730> server<00:03:36.910> list<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.360> it

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
okay it's got the server list and it

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.640 
okay it's got the server list and it
says<00:03:37.540> begin<00:03:37.840> test<00:03:38.080> I'm<00:03:38.200> gonna<00:03:38.320> bring<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.620> my

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
says begin test I'm gonna bring in my

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.150 
says begin test I'm gonna bring in my
iPhone<00:03:39.220> here<00:03:39.430> as<00:03:39.520> well<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.150> while<00:03:40.390> my<00:03:40.570> iPhone

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
iPhone here as well so while my iPhone

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.720 
iPhone here as well so while my iPhone
I'm<00:03:42.160> gonna<00:03:42.310> pull<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:42.610> off<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.910> Wi-Fi<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:45.580> we're

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
I'm gonna pull it off of Wi-Fi so we're

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.230 
I'm gonna pull it off of Wi-Fi so we're
on<00:03:45.900> AT&amp;T<00:03:46.900> 3G<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:49.410> Verizon's<00:03:50.410> 4G<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:52.030> let<00:03:52.180> me

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
on AT&amp;T 3G and Verizon's 4G and let me

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:01.980 
on AT&amp;T 3G and Verizon's 4G and let me
just<00:03:52.420> hit<00:03:52.510> begin<00:03:52.810> test<00:03:53.080> on<00:03:53.260> both<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.620> these

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.900 

to<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.770> test<00:04:03.070> here<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.370> finished<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.790> the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
to this test here is finished on the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.980 
to this test here is finished on the
thunderbolt<00:04:07.050> as<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.170> can<00:04:08.320> see<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.560> got<00:04:08.710> 12

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
thunderbolt as you can see it got 12

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.320 
thunderbolt as you can see it got 12
megabits<00:04:10.990> down<00:04:11.860> 22<00:04:12.760> up<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.880> then<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.030> iphone

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
megabits down 22 up and then the iphone

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.280 
megabits down 22 up and then the iphone
still<00:04:16.570> going<00:04:16.900> here

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
still going here

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.870 
still going here
I<00:04:17.320> got<00:04:17.620> 2.7<00:04:18.400> down<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:20.760> they'll<00:04:21.760> probably

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
I got 2.7 down and they'll probably

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:30.570 
I got 2.7 down and they'll probably
about<00:04:22.180> 1.5<00:04:26.550> 1.4<00:04:27.550> up<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.530> again<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:30.460> know

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
about 1.5 1.4 up so and again you know

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.800 
about 1.5 1.4 up so and again you know
we're<00:04:30.730> not<00:04:30.820> gonna<00:04:30.970> say<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.510> these<00:04:31.630> are<00:04:31.690> the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
we're not gonna say that these are the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.420 
we're not gonna say that these are the
most<00:04:31.960> accurate<00:04:32.200> speed<00:04:32.620> tests<00:04:32.950> out<00:04:33.100> there

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
most accurate speed tests out there

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.060 
most accurate speed tests out there
because<00:04:34.240> obviously<00:04:34.480> it<00:04:34.930> depends<00:04:35.260> on<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:36.040> know

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
because obviously it depends on you know

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.160 
because obviously it depends on you know
where<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.430> are<00:04:36.460> what<00:04:37.390> you're<00:04:37.570> doing<00:04:37.600> etcetera

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
where you are what you're doing etcetera

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.740 
where you are what you're doing etcetera
but<00:04:38.440> obviously<00:04:39.220> 3G<00:04:39.820> versus<00:04:40.330> 4G<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:42.600> can<00:04:43.600> see

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
but obviously 3G versus 4G you can see

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.750 
but obviously 3G versus 4G you can see
that<00:04:43.870> there's<00:04:44.050> a<00:04:44.170> pretty<00:04:44.950> stark<00:04:45.400> difference

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
that there's a pretty stark difference

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.700 
that there's a pretty stark difference
there<00:04:46.020> one<00:04:47.020> thing<00:04:47.260> though<00:04:47.700> that<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:49.840> know<00:04:49.990> you

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
there one thing though that you know you

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.840 
there one thing though that you know you
have<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.920> put<00:04:51.070> up<00:04:51.160> with<00:04:51.190> when<00:04:51.610> you<00:04:51.700> get<00:04:51.820> a

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
have to put up with when you get a

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.700 
have to put up with when you get a
difference<00:04:52.210> like<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.540> is<00:04:52.780> this<00:04:53.320> battery

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
difference like that is this battery

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.140 
difference like that is this battery
it's<00:04:53.920> not<00:04:54.070> gonna<00:04:54.220> last<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.640> for<00:04:54.790> too<00:04:54.940> long

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
it's not gonna last you for too long

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.940 
it's not gonna last you for too long
especially<00:04:55.660> if<00:04:56.020> you're<00:04:56.140> using<00:04:56.290> a<00:04:56.440> lot<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.620> 4G

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
especially if you're using a lot of 4G

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.870 
especially if you're using a lot of 4G
data<00:04:57.640> or<00:04:58.420> apps<00:04:58.720> or<00:04:58.990> anything<00:04:59.170> like<00:04:59.320> that<00:04:59.880> you

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
data or apps or anything like that you

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.780 
data or apps or anything like that you
know<00:05:00.970> basically<00:05:01.240> just<00:05:01.480> data<00:05:02.430> streaming<00:05:03.430> video

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
know basically just data streaming video

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.410 
know basically just data streaming video
etc

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
etc

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.750 
etc
you<00:05:05.080> can<00:05:05.230> only<00:05:05.350> expect<00:05:05.680> around<00:05:05.860> at<00:05:06.490> least<00:05:06.640> from

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
you can only expect around at least from

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.690 
you can only expect around at least from
what<00:05:07.030> we<00:05:07.180> found<00:05:07.390> four<00:05:07.810> hours<00:05:08.020> of<00:05:08.050> battery<00:05:08.170> life

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
what we found four hours of battery life

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.100 
what we found four hours of battery life
if<00:05:09.700> you're<00:05:09.850> just<00:05:09.970> using<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:10.330> as<00:05:10.390> a<00:05:10.420> phone<00:05:10.690> and

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
if you're just using it as a phone and

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.330 
if you're just using it as a phone and
you<00:05:11.260> know<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.380> little<00:05:11.560> data<00:05:11.830> here<00:05:12.040> and<00:05:12.160> there

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
you know a little data here and there

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
don't know if it's charged up probably

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.710 
don't know if it's charged up probably
not<00:06:15.290> but<00:06:16.130> they<00:06:16.250> look<00:06:16.400> very<00:06:16.430> similar<00:06:16.940> so<00:06:17.090> HTC

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
similar devices so you know they they

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.570 
similar devices so you know they they
have<00:06:30.260> a<00:06:30.290> recipe<00:06:30.949> that<00:06:30.979> works<00:06:31.310> and<00:06:31.460> they're

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
have a recipe that works and they're

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.920 
have a recipe that works and they're
gonna<00:06:31.699> kind<00:06:31.910> of<00:06:32.000> follow<00:06:32.240> and<00:06:32.510> stick<00:06:32.720> with<00:06:32.810> that

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
recipe but that is pretty much it that

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.740 
recipe but that is pretty much it that
is<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.650> HTC<00:06:37.430> Thunderbolt<00:06:38.120> the<00:06:38.750> first<00:06:39.320> 4G<00:06:40.160> LTE
