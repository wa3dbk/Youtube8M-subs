Scott not saying it's over because the

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.219 
Scott not saying it's over because the
moment<00:04:45.000> he<00:04:45.060> two-footed<00:04:45.539> the<00:04:45.690> first<00:04:45.870> jump<00:04:46.080> it's

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
Sandra they call it so after the fact

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.490 
Sandra they call it so after the fact
that<00:04:59.759> it's<00:04:59.970> just<00:05:00.150> like<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:00.660> not<00:05:00.900> compelling

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
that it's just like it's not compelling

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.379 
that it's just like it's not compelling
storytelling<00:05:02.130> it's<00:05:02.580> not<00:05:02.759> interesting<00:05:03.270> it's

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
storytelling it's not interesting it's

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.879 
storytelling it's not interesting it's
so<00:05:03.570> it's<00:05:03.870> like<00:05:03.960> it<00:05:04.050> happened<00:05:04.229> two<00:05:04.530> weeks<00:05:04.560> ago

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
so it's like it happened two weeks ago

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.529 
so it's like it happened two weeks ago
it<00:05:05.130> feels<00:05:05.250> like<00:05:05.460> it's<00:05:05.550> like<00:05:05.639> it's<00:05:05.759> no<00:05:05.910> such<00:05:06.300> old

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
it feels like it's like it's no such old

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.600 
it feels like it's like it's no such old
news<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.020> then<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.160> fact<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.430> they're

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
news and then just the fact that they're

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.700 
news and then just the fact that they're
under<00:05:09.000> reacting<00:05:09.509> in<00:05:09.599> parts<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:09.960> overreacting

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
under reacting in parts and overreacting

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.320 
under reacting in parts and overreacting
in<00:05:10.830> parts<00:05:11.099> so<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.550> just<00:05:11.729> it<00:05:11.820> doesn't<00:05:12.150> feel<00:05:12.270> like

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
in parts so it just it doesn't feel like

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.240 
in parts so it just it doesn't feel like
the<00:05:12.630> proper<00:05:13.050> reaction<00:05:13.229> it<00:05:13.710> just<00:05:13.860> feels<00:05:14.070> like<00:05:14.160> a

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
the proper reaction it just feels like a

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.560 
the proper reaction it just feels like a
total<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:14.729> again<00:05:14.970> it's<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.270> kind<00:05:15.449> of<00:05:15.479> a

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
total so again it's a kind of a

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.810 
total so again it's a kind of a
disservice<00:05:15.900> for<00:05:16.320> them<00:05:16.500> because<00:05:16.949> it's<00:05:17.160> not<00:05:17.340> fun

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
disservice for them because it's not fun

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.969 
disservice for them because it's not fun
to<00:05:17.849> listen<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.449> them<00:05:18.599> call<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.229> action<00:05:19.620> it's

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
to listen to them call the action it's

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.710 
to listen to them call the action it's
just<00:05:20.190> not<00:05:20.370> it's<00:05:20.910> just<00:05:21.060> not<00:05:21.210> going<00:05:21.509> well<00:05:21.690> for
