now also I like the fact that with
Toyota<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.300> particular<00:00:48.690> vehicle<00:00:48.809> we

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
Toyota on this particular vehicle we

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.139 
Toyota on this particular vehicle we
have<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> LR<00:00:49.590> wheel<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.489> Toyota<00:00:50.670> push<00:00:51.030> this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
have the LR wheel but Toyota push this

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.029 
have the LR wheel but Toyota push this
extra<00:00:51.539> loop<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> wheel<00:00:52.260> itself<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
extra loop on the wheel itself so in the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.139 
extra loop on the wheel itself so in the
event<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> flat<00:00:53.850> tire

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
event that you want to have a flat tire

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
event that you want to have a flat tire
just<00:00:54.719> designing<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.140> holding<00:00:55.379> time<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
just designing up holding time on the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.709 
just designing up holding time on the
rim<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.550> hopefully<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.059> extra<00:00:57.270> Bhalla<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
rim so hopefully you got extra Bhalla to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.000 
rim so hopefully you got extra Bhalla to
to<00:00:57.840> pull<00:00:57.989> over<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> safe<00:00:58.289> location

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
to pull over to a safe location

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.319 
to pull over to a safe location
instead<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> having<00:00:59.609> stopped<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> immediate

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
instead of having stopped in immediate

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.700 
instead of having stopped in immediate
danger<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> definitely<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
danger so you can definitely see the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.969 
danger so you can definitely see the
benefit<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.359> also

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
benefit of that also

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.130 
benefit of that also
this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> xle<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:06.210> only<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.750> the
