00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.499
 Hello people and autumn is coming for one 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:18.750
 the right of us 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.750
 and to my first Esperia on the cooler 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.329
 around 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.349
 yes the first project according to even Sniper Elite 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.949
 It is not 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.340
 Shooter Volvo like here was just around Leist 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.249
 percent 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:39.639
 and one of Ludo Raft Basler 4 Modern Warfare Black on the ground Kramp 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.250
 Percent as it is here sets tactics among others 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 So just a few percent off another more complex way 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.290
 if you have to stand here sentry wat more or less over 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.880
 to sneak 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.880
 Turn it off quietly 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.530
 and 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.530
 that was the way to avoid what happened 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.750
 makes him live 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.030
 arc 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.119
 that's just a charred one too creating cool stuff 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.790
 Procure Krumbholz Hechenrieder 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.660
 Percent Oakland 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.070
 could create another year then it does not seem to the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 save the same places I'm actually good cards now 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.990
 Aalen 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.930
 the students come tanks 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.400
 Percent appreciate more hidden 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.970
 those 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 right here 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.500
 he comes 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 a 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.229
 Nat great 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.439
 So here we have to hang later 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.869
 The weather was then a couple of branches showing Schweppe Reitallee Jepsen 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.449
 we only inform you 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.219
 conwert imposed 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.219
 bad in the year 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.419
 yes rifle scope 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.849
 Come back was clear 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.849
 dean 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.759
 omen 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.759
 finds faster 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.469
 so 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:10.199
 Gera farther you have a gun a few grenades and still hold 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:14.869
 around 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.419
 percent 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.419
 Parents had to do it during Stohler 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:25.339
 percent 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.599
 Warner Music Hall for four years 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.859
 so set 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.450
 I have to watch her that not much at a bottleneck Velbert and show 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.169
 I do not have that much 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.169
 Almost escaped in January 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.679
 I wonder why I aim so high 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.430
 because I lost a little bit of gravity but I break 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:09.639
 does not have to bring much first 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.709
 because I have the level 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.839
 once played through and that was on amateur 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.839
 Gravity is not included 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.129
 okay now years 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.749
 also Mr. Somji CEO Lakshmi 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.589
 it's very fun it's well worth the tip 

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:32.059
 Corks, too, I think it's cheaper to go to court 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:33.849
 percent 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.830
 Hertha at some point pack what is then public and loading time and 8 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.669
 or so 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.710
 Expect a proper one 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.340
 you once hinted 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.559
 and has sold a lot of money now I know Bush was hot 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.559
 and I can and I have not really dealt with it and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.139
 Nina Hagen sold 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.849
 and then I was told 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.259
 I'm coming game set 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.380
 I have never tried it and it was very appealing then 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.460
 it is 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:11.610
 St 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.610
 St 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.999
 4 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.999
 I can 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.559
 4 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:38.559
 at least not taken 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.099
 He almost manages to make Munich an informant 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.280
 and lead the way, that's the second place in the table still weak in chats 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.150
 and venue further 7 years later 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.660
 Hafes did you like it if there is a thumbs up so serious 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.759
 I would 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.289
 and prompt Karmann on a canal 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.729
 Percent help a lot 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.259
 Well, where we are still culturally ailing Rentzsch 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.869
 yes then you are 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:08.979
 Part 2
