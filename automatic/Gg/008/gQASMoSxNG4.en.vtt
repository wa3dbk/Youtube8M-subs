00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
way to progress this right from from the

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.299 
way to progress this right from from the
basic<00:01:01.970> basic<00:01:02.390> level<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:02.900> that's<00:01:03.830> really<00:01:04.129> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
basic basic level and that's really the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.040 
basic basic level and that's really the
most<00:01:04.460> important<00:01:04.970> thing<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.269> my<00:01:05.300> opinion<00:01:05.510> that

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
most important thing in my opinion that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.230 
most important thing in my opinion that
your<00:01:06.170> basics<00:01:06.590> are<00:01:06.740> set<00:01:06.920> soundly<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.640> want<00:01:08.150> to

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
your basics are set soundly you want to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.700 
your basics are set soundly you want to
burn<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.660> stuff<00:01:08.810> into<00:01:09.229> your<00:01:09.320> system

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
burn this stuff into your system

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.010 
burn this stuff into your system
correctly<00:01:10.340> that's<00:01:11.119> why<00:01:11.330> we're<00:01:11.479> going<00:01:11.660> slow

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
correctly that's why we're going slow

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.170 
correctly that's why we're going slow
and<00:01:12.229> we're<00:01:12.320> taking<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.710> piece<00:01:12.860> by<00:01:13.100> piece<00:01:13.180> so

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
and we're taking a piece by piece so

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.999 
and we're taking a piece by piece so

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
application on that in just a minute

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.510 
application on that in just a minute
and<00:01:26.509> we've<00:01:26.660> shown<00:01:27.320> our<00:01:27.470> left<00:01:27.710> side<00:01:27.890> kick<00:01:28.250> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.580 
and we've shown our left side kick I
really<00:01:29.330> like<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:29.660> left<00:01:29.899> side<00:01:30.080> kick<00:01:30.350> with

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
really like that left side kick with

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.710 
really like that left side kick with
with<00:01:31.190> them<00:01:31.340> we<00:01:31.460> tie<00:01:31.640> because<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.210> really

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
with them we tie because it really

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.150 
with them we tie because it really
there's<00:01:32.960> not<00:01:33.110> much<00:01:33.289> power<00:01:33.500> difference<00:01:33.890> at<00:01:34.039> all

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
there's not much power difference at all

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.100 
there's not much power difference at all
between<00:01:34.729> dominant<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.479> non-dominant<00:01:35.509> leg

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
between dominant and non-dominant leg

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.389 
between dominant and non-dominant leg
they<00:01:36.440> can<00:01:36.560> kick<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.770> just<00:01:36.979> about<00:01:37.100> as<00:01:37.220> hard

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
they can kick you just about as hard

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.620 
they can kick you just about as hard
with<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:37.640> one<00:01:37.850> as<00:01:37.970> they<00:01:38.060> do<00:01:38.119> with<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.479> one

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
with this one as they do with this one

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.109 
with this one as they do with this one
so<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:38.960> doubles<00:01:39.380> doubles<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.430> danger<00:01:40.580> level

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
so it doubles doubles the danger level

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.450 
so it doubles doubles the danger level
from<00:01:41.360> from<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.720> kicking<00:01:42.020> standpoint<00:01:42.560> what<00:01:43.399> I

want to do next is look at the foot jab
which<00:01:46.100> is<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.369> Thai<00:01:46.520> equivalent<00:01:47.000> of<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.149> front

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
different ways as well from this

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.320 
different ways as well from this
distance<00:02:59.110> right<00:02:59.409> here<00:02:59.440> all<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.370> have<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.909> do<00:03:01.060> is

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
distance right here all I have to do is

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.869 
distance right here all I have to do is
lift<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.379> take<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.590> little<00:03:03.010> bit<00:03:03.159> of<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.340> hop<00:03:03.549> on

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
lift and take a little bit of a hop on

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.449 
lift and take a little bit of a hop on
the<00:03:04.480> rear<00:03:04.750> foot<00:03:05.049> so<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:05.830> notice<00:03:06.159> I'm<00:03:06.280> not

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
the rear foot so you notice I'm not

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.490 
the rear foot so you notice I'm not
staying<00:03:07.000> stationary<00:03:07.330> here<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.080> doing<00:03:08.319> that

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
staying stationary here and doing that

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.410 
staying stationary here and doing that
that<00:03:08.920> won't<00:03:09.129> quite<00:03:09.400> reach<00:03:09.670> because<00:03:09.879> he's

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
that won't quite reach because he's

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.780 
that won't quite reach because he's
maintaining<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.170> distance<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:12.370> won't<00:03:12.580> let

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
maintaining a distance that won't let

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.059 
maintaining a distance that won't let
give<00:03:13.180> me<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.510> without<00:03:13.840> moving<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:14.980> the

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
give me that without moving in so the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.369 
give me that without moving in so the
first<00:03:15.310> way<00:03:15.519> is<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:15.970> from<00:03:16.330> here<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.989> lift<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
first way is just from here you lift the

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.729 
first way is just from here you lift the
leg<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.739> you'll<00:03:17.830> notice<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.489> leg<00:03:18.730> lifts

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
leg and you'll notice that the leg lifts

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.710 
leg and you'll notice that the leg lifts
relatively<00:03:20.739> straight<00:03:21.129> it<00:03:21.459> doesn't<00:03:22.060> bend<00:03:22.330> and

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
relatively straight it doesn't bend and

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.020 
relatively straight it doesn't bend and
then<00:03:22.840> straighten<00:03:23.410> out<00:03:23.560> your<00:03:23.879> outside<00:03:24.879> of

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
then straighten out your outside of

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.360 
then straighten out your outside of
range<00:03:25.269> so<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.540> can<00:03:25.810> get<00:03:25.959> away<00:03:26.170> with<00:03:26.409> this<00:03:27.069> kind

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
range so you can get away with this kind

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.530 
range so you can get away with this kind
of<00:03:27.549> emotion<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.650> foot<00:03:29.980> lifts<00:03:30.450> there's<00:03:31.450> a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
of emotion the foot lifts there's a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.020 
of emotion the foot lifts there's a
little<00:03:31.780> hop<00:03:32.019> off<00:03:32.349> of<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.709> rear<00:03:32.890> leg<00:03:33.099> that

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
little hop off of the rear leg that

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.940 
little hop off of the rear leg that
takes<00:03:34.390> us<00:03:34.599> forward<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.260> we've<00:03:35.410> got<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.590> little

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
takes us forward and we've got a little

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.360 
takes us forward and we've got a little
bit<00:03:36.129> of<00:03:36.640> hip<00:03:36.970> extension<00:03:37.599> here<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.069> can<00:03:39.280> be

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
bit of hip extension here so I can be

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.479 
bit of hip extension here so I can be
done<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.760> body<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.720> can<00:03:40.870> be<00:03:40.989> done<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:42.340> the

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
done to the body it can be done to the

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.069 
done to the body it can be done to the
foot<00:03:42.819> but<00:03:43.090> generally<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.599> won't<00:03:43.690> see<00:03:43.930> that

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079

done<00:03:44.290> with<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.440> hop<00:03:44.739> because<00:03:45.040> that's<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.310> pretty

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
done with a hop because that's a pretty

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.250

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.760 
little too far away we hop it like so we
switch<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.729> and<00:05:34.969> that's<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.139> same<00:05:36.439> switch

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
switch it and that's the same switch

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.409 
switch it and that's the same switch
that<00:05:36.949> we<00:05:37.069> did<00:05:37.340> when<00:05:37.879> we<00:05:37.909> were<00:05:38.060> going<00:05:38.180> to<00:05:38.270> throw

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
that we did when we were going to throw

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.629 
that we did when we were going to throw
our<00:05:38.539> left<00:05:38.719> side<00:05:38.900> kick<00:05:39.229> so<00:05:40.099> from<00:05:40.279> a<00:05:40.370> tactical

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
our left side kick so from a tactical

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.550 
our left side kick so from a tactical
standpoint<00:05:41.240> sometimes<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:42.020> see<00:05:42.229> them<00:05:42.349> added

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
standpoint sometimes you see them added

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.550 
standpoint sometimes you see them added
about<00:05:42.740> this<00:05:43.370> distance<00:05:43.939> this<00:05:44.900> little<00:05:45.259> float

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
about this distance this little float

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.499 
about this distance this little float
sometimes<00:05:46.250> they'll<00:05:46.430> do<00:05:46.520> that<00:05:46.669> switch<00:05:47.060> again

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
sometimes they'll do that switch again

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.200 
sometimes they'll do that switch again
trying<00:05:48.349> to<00:05:48.469> see<00:05:48.620> what<00:05:48.770> that<00:05:48.919> guy<00:05:49.099> does<00:05:49.210> maybe

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
trying to see what that guy does maybe

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.070 
trying to see what that guy does maybe
from<00:05:50.569> here

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
from here

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.219 
from here
I've<00:05:51.349> stung<00:05:51.680> them<00:05:51.800> once<00:05:52.219> here<00:05:52.750> so<00:05:53.750> he<00:05:53.900> starts

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
I've stung them once here so he starts

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.809 
I've stung them once here so he starts
to<00:05:54.349> shield<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:55.159> then<00:05:55.310> I'm<00:05:55.430> gonna<00:05:55.580> look<00:05:55.669> at

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
to shield and then I'm gonna look at

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.640 
to shield and then I'm gonna look at
breaking<00:05:56.060> my<00:05:56.330> rhythm<00:05:56.690> breaking<00:05:57.050> my<00:05:57.169> timing

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
breaking my rhythm breaking my timing

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.320 
breaking my rhythm breaking my timing
we'll<00:05:58.159> talk<00:05:58.370> about<00:05:58.520> that<00:05:58.729> a<00:05:58.789> little<00:05:58.879> bit<00:05:59.000> later

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
we'll talk about that a little bit later

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.680 
we'll talk about that a little bit later
and<00:06:00.050> going<00:06:00.409> on<00:06:00.710> another<00:06:01.009> line<00:06:01.300> so<00:06:02.300> we<00:06:02.419> switch

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
and going on another line so we switch

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.930 
and going on another line so we switch
it<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.110> then<00:06:04.039> we<00:06:04.159> could<00:06:04.310> use<00:06:04.339> that<00:06:04.490> foot<00:06:04.819> you

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
it and then we could use that foot you

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.409 
it and then we could use that foot you
have<00:06:04.969> again<00:06:05.650> but<00:06:06.650> it<00:06:06.770> could<00:06:06.919> also<00:06:07.129> be<00:06:07.520> a<00:06:07.789> switch

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
have again but it could also be a switch

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.029 
have again but it could also be a switch
to<00:06:09.229> left<00:06:09.439> kick<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:11.150> leg<00:06:11.389> to<00:06:11.839> left<00:06:12.050> kick<00:06:12.289> the

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
to left kick the leg to left kick the

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.459 
to left kick the leg to left kick the
body<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:14.360> it<00:06:14.479> could<00:06:14.599> also<00:06:14.810> be<00:06:15.050> if<00:06:15.289> I'm<00:06:15.439> a

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
body and it could also be if I'm a

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.459 
body and it could also be if I'm a
little<00:06:15.830> tighter<00:06:16.099> to<00:06:16.810> throw<00:06:17.810> that<00:06:17.960> left<00:06:18.199> knee

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
little tighter to throw that left knee

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.459 
little tighter to throw that left knee
same<00:06:19.310> switch<00:06:19.610> for<00:06:19.879> all<00:06:19.969> three<00:06:20.330> so<00:06:21.169> what<00:06:21.319> you

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
same switch for all three so what you

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:30.239 
same switch for all three so what you
start<00:06:21.740> having<00:06:22.009> here<00:06:22.370> is

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:30.249 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:32.309
