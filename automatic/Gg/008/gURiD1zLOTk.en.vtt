00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.060
 so friends welcome back to here 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.980
 next follow dear lord of the rings and 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.349
 we are following where we are now 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.969
 times the levels where we do not have everything 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.509
 found a search once 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.100
 that's right here in the prologue 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.779
 in the second scene we are still missing 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.320
 an item that we have directly in front 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.000
 left and we would go out and there 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.449
 we are already making it the brand 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 armor and then we have it here 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.370
 prologue all three items and all 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.760
 centers and the plan well then it works 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.489
 Continue to the level of the black rider 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.110
 namely two more items we are missing 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.350
 we see then when we at the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.680
 tree where the school is up and down 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.500
 rides when we go down here 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:57.710
 after the sequence is over so now 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.390
 the journey changes position 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 and now we can do it here 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 go down and there we have tomorrow 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.439
 we turn into one at a time 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 to assemble a scarecrow 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.130
 and also something something us here 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.130
 the next iphone gives 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.439
 well then we have right at this 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.439
 We also have a second one 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.920
 a second old one more you have to 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.330
 first here with a small tractor 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.590
 so we get stuck here in the level 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.500
 first we have to go up and the bird 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.990
 scare away the nas well 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.800
 somehow we'll do it like that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.750
 bird is gone and then we go here 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.220
 Cross the tree once again 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.650
 14 plus here in the background we see 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.310
 then still with reald rest but have 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.920
 we do 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.440
 we really need the item here 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.970
 and that is behind this 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.550
 these two to the left with 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.869
 dark cave is totally overlooked 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.750
 not easy to see because you have to 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.220
 really be ready for anything like that 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.590
 Let's not do it and then have it 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.320
 We here next item one 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.740
 soup pot and then it was in the 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.320
 level the black rider also center 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.060
 the construction plan and the three teams and so on 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.459
 is it at the mines of moria here 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.140
 yes my favorite shoes was like me 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.610
 I hated several here 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.900
 minutes needed to find that 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.500
 you really need it 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.000
 go forth 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.590
 this makes it more than first then 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.230
 does not work that last time either 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.760
 know what was going on so that's what 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.920
 then the last chest we have 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.670
 then we have ten here and in 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.170
 this level in the next sequence where 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.290
 then the stairs down is there to see 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.820
 up here we have a target that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.550
 Let's shoot against with flounces 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.800
 and zack filter down the next album 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.080
 what we can absorb and then 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.489
 all we need is an old one here 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.810
 is now the helm 1 maria ochs and that 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.930
 we have the last album here directly 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:09.370
 behind the bridge of kazaa stupid 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:11.540
 right after the sequence where bongo bongo 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.040
 then let the ball rock afterwards 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.599
 jumps and then we can do that 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.219
 record third album and then have 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.269
 what's done in this level also ten 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:22.180
 Ten of the construction plan and three items 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.989
 Then Amon hands 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.700
 we could not do that yet 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.049
 should there just be the means still 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.120
 not have so we look at exactly here 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.829
 this place where he is still in the first 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.280
 Sequence are now we are throwing here 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.280
 above 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:42.109
 that falls down on the tower yes 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:44.389
 that which brings him to reason is well 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.459
 that's good, and then we'll go 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:50.269
 once down once 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.719
 or you can start here 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.719
 ever since equip the medium 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:08.450
 so and we tailor it once 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.280
 up so we come up there 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.150
 here is a plate to cut the cap 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.920
 but I have a bit there 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.609
 clumsy hired so still with the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.890
 rope upwards 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.840
 and now briefly briefly to the right 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.450
 switch to the hammer this is this 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.730
 Shockwaves These shockwaves ax us 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.470
 have that equip once and then 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.500
 we have the whole thing from the top once 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.810
 down 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.760
 and then we can jump down and 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.720
 the last item here at this level 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.670
 collect and then we have here now 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.820
 hamann would have hated me too 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.760
 this level is just at the end so 10 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.040
 sound blueprint and the three items and now 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.920
 take care once in highspeed this 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.730
 assembled and everything sits up 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:05:00.190
 a millimeter first piece overloaded 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.190
 after that we take the green caution and 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.950
 I'm having a hard time with that 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.760
 It is not easy at all 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.200
 So that's really extreme custom work 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.040
 then the blue box directly behind 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.040
 turn to the green 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.220
 he sits too and then that again 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.690
 red is now but the thick head of 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.539
 the gandalf in the way there we have to 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.789
 once to place it briefly and now 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.630
 the the left here once green and 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.389
 down and then hamburg so now 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.370
 just collect the tour 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.740
 Well that's the ninth one is missing 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.030
 that's right here behind that we see 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.009
 namely, I'm actually from it 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.840
 assume that I have the added 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.169
 here we need the short one 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.729
 berserker for the stones 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.810
 in front of it are few backwards but 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:55.440
 after and then we go with one 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.909
 small characters down then we go 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.909
 down with a little character 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.419
 but that's exactly what I have by the way 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.780
 once played cut together and 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.699
 Now even 1 comment so here 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.960
 left we have now the rest the 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.159
 we have collected there too 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:17.130
 10 out of 10 3 out of 3 items and the blueprint 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.080
 and then what to the last breath 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.360
 we are still missing that is right at the beginning 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.710
 from the level on the track of the hobbits 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.199
 we simply need to only sam 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:31.380
 run behind or much more forward 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:33.780
 and then we dig once and then 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.699
 we have the shield so that was it 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.500
 already and see you then in the 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.960
 next episode if it continues then 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.849
 and there we will all quests or something 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.539
 good as all quests first deliver 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.539
 See you
