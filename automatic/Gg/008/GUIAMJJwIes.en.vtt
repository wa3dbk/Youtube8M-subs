00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
going to argue about that right now

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.549

because I know I'm right and I know

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.310 
because I know I'm right and I know
you're<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:58.859> wrong<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.989> resolution<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
you're all wrong so the resolution and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.740 
you're all wrong so the resolution and
size<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> actual<00:01:05.610> video<00:01:06.150> was<00:01:06.479> really

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
size of the actual video was really

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.350 
size of the actual video was really
weird<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.950> basically<00:01:08.220> because<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.850> vegas

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
weird that's basically because my vegas

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.050 
weird that's basically because my vegas
was<00:01:10.100> buzzing<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.220> something<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.909> don't

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
was buzzing or something and I don't

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.370 
was buzzing or something and I don't
know<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.330> wasn't<00:01:12.750> working<00:01:12.900> whenever<00:01:13.320> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
know it just wasn't working whenever I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.310 
know it just wasn't working whenever I
tried<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> render<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.420> put<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:16.200> with

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
settings right now and hopefully it'll

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.670 
settings right now and hopefully it'll
