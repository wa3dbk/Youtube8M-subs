00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
think if the game was a little bit

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.690 
think if the game was a little bit
longer<00:07:12.500> we<00:07:12.800> would<00:07:13.220> have<00:07:13.310> done<00:07:13.340> it<00:07:13.580> you<00:07:13.670> know

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
longer we would have done it you know

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.640 
longer we would have done it you know
because<00:07:14.180> that<00:07:14.510> guy<00:07:14.630> wasn't<00:07:14.900> our<00:07:15.140> that<00:07:15.320> he<00:07:15.500> got

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
because that guy wasn't our that he got

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.560 
because that guy wasn't our that he got
he<00:07:15.830> got<00:07:15.860> the<00:07:16.160> fair<00:07:16.370> share<00:07:16.610> look<00:07:16.850> there<00:07:17.090> but<00:07:17.480> we

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.570 
he got the fair share look there but we

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.720 
he got the fair share look there but we
can<00:07:17.750> be<00:07:17.900> finished<00:07:18.350> second<00:07:18.860> in<00:07:18.980> the<00:07:19.070> world<00:07:19.460> cup
