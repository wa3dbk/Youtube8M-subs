an<00:00:19.330> additional<00:00:20.130> fan<00:00:21.130> there's<00:00:21.820> a<00:00:21.910> power

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
an additional fan there's a power

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.070 
an additional fan there's a power
connection<00:00:22.510> there<00:00:22.920> if<00:00:23.920> we<00:00:24.039> move<00:00:24.220> over<00:00:24.340> here

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080

the<00:00:26.080> power<00:00:26.289> supply<00:00:26.740> is<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.240> PCIe<00:00:28.240> connection

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
the power supply is a PCIe connection

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.549 
the power supply is a PCIe connection
used<00:00:30.100> to<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:31.090> older<00:00:31.449> models<00:00:31.810> just<00:00:32.080> had<00:00:32.320> this

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
used to the older models just had this

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.790 
used to the older models just had this
positive<00:00:33.400> and<00:00:33.550> negative<00:00:33.850> yellow<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.420> black

positive and negative yellow and black

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.140 
positive and negative yellow and black
connections<00:00:35.800> so<00:00:35.949> you'd<00:00:36.070> have<00:00:36.129> to<00:00:36.370> splice<00:00:36.760> and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
connections so you'd have to splice and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.950 
connections so you'd have to splice and
sacrifice<00:00:37.629> a<00:00:37.890> PCIe<00:00:38.890> cable<00:00:39.519> and<00:00:39.780> connect<00:00:40.780> it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
sacrifice a PCIe cable and connect it

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.960 
sacrifice a PCIe cable and connect it
there<00:00:41.140> which<00:00:41.830> was<00:00:42.010> kind<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.370> pain<00:00:42.519> so<00:00:42.850> it's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
there which was kind of a pain so it's

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.710 
there which was kind of a pain so it's
nice<00:00:43.150> they've<00:00:43.330> added<00:00:43.720> this<00:00:43.870> PCIe<00:00:44.860> connection

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720
