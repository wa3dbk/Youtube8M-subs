00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
from that I don't think that many games

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.719 
from that I don't think that many games
added<00:04:12.079> anything<00:04:12.290> fun<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.859> title<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.459> most

the time when we played multiple player
games<00:04:15.590> we<00:04:15.919> would<00:04:16.039> have<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.340> option<00:04:16.549> turned

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
bad and I hope in the next release they

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.689 
bad and I hope in the next release they
add<00:04:32.930> more<00:04:33.169> content<00:04:33.710> like<00:04:34.099> maybe<00:04:34.340> an<00:04:34.520> online

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
add more content like maybe an online

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.149 
add more content like maybe an online
game<00:04:35.240> option<00:04:35.780> however<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.500> way<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.740> title<00:04:36.919> is

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
game option however the way the title is

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.950 
game option however the way the title is
right<00:04:37.400> now<00:04:37.639> it<00:04:38.060> would<00:04:38.180> only<00:04:38.210> be<00:04:38.509> fun<00:04:38.750> for<00:04:38.930> a

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
right now it would only be fun for a

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.779 
right now it would only be fun for a
real<00:04:39.110> fan<00:04:39.409> of<00:04:39.440> wheel<00:04:39.710> of<00:04:39.830> fortune<00:04:40.310> because<00:04:40.639> it

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
real fan of wheel of fortune because it

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.430 
real fan of wheel of fortune because it
would<00:04:40.880> get<00:04:41.000> really<00:04:41.210> dull<00:04:41.570> fast<00:04:41.960> if<00:04:42.259> you're<00:04:42.380> not

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
would get really dull fast if you're not

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.589 
would get really dull fast if you're not
really<00:04:42.979> into<00:04:43.219> the<00:04:43.340> experience<00:04:43.969> so<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.479> think

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
really into the experience so I think

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.149 
really into the experience so I think
it's<00:04:44.840> worth<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:44.990> rent<00:04:45.260> for<00:04:45.380> those<00:04:45.529> people<00:04:45.979> but

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
it's worth the rent for those people but

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.470 
it's worth the rent for those people but
anyone<00:04:46.550> else<00:04:46.760> I<00:04:47.029> think

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
anyone else I think

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.940 
anyone else I think
should<00:04:47.630> skip<00:04:47.840> it<00:04:47.950> not<00:04:48.950> in<00:04:49.130> this<00:04:49.250> puzzle<00:04:49.550> sorry
