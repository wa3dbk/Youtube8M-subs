00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
my voice does not really sound like this

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.800 
my voice does not really sound like this
it<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.050> makes<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> sound<00:00:22.500> retarded

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810

and<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.609> how<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> add<00:00:28.400> codes<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:30.349> because

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and so how to add codes here because

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.350 
and so how to add codes here because
this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.470> very<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:32.120> confusing<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
this is very actually confusing if you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.580 
this is very actually confusing if you
don't<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.660> how<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.020> took<00:00:34.170> me<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> while<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
don't know how it took me a while to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:44.060 
don't know how it took me a while to
figure<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.270> just<00:00:36.270> turn<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:37.649> DSI<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:43.070> then

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
figure it out just turn my DSI here then

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.860 
figure it out just turn my DSI here then
you<00:00:44.190> click<00:00:44.399> all<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> closed<00:00:45.239> automatically

you click all the closed automatically

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.860 
you click all the closed automatically
radicals<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.120> choose<00:00:48.450> to

updates it deletes everything off your
thing<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.160> guess<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.329> useful<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.840> have

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
thing I guess it's useful if you have

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.799 
thing I guess it's useful if you have
bunch<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.350> stupid<00:00:58.530> games<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.809> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
bunch of stupid games you don't want and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.389 
bunch of stupid games you don't want and
then<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.320> software<00:01:01.800> upgrade<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.250> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
then there's a software upgrade what you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.350 
then there's a software upgrade what you
do<00:01:02.750> once<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.939> never<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.090> them<00:01:06.299> again

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
do once you get I never do them again

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.530 
do once you get I never do them again
but<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.979> add<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.280> games<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.150> animal
