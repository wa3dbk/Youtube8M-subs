00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
sure that you're holding it on the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.109 
sure that you're holding it on the
barrel<00:01:19.979> long<00:01:20.159> enough<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> hair

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
barrel long enough for all of the hair

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.670 
barrel long enough for all of the hair
to<00:01:21.240> heat<00:01:21.420> up<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.869> feel<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> top

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
to heat up you can feel from the top

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.850 
to heat up you can feel from the top
when<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> gets<00:01:23.700> warm<00:01:24.650> there<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
when it gets warm there we go and I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.140 
when it gets warm there we go and I
think<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.400> three<00:01:29.610> should<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.970> actually

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
think just three should do it actually

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.690 
think just three should do it actually
so<00:01:30.540> we'll<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.840> wrap<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.200> last<00:01:31.409> section<00:01:34.700> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
so we'll just wrap this last section and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.670 
so we'll just wrap this last section and
we're<00:01:35.939> gonna<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.240> pinning<00:01:36.630> big<00:01:36.990> barrel<00:01:37.409> curls

we're gonna be pinning big barrel curls

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.800 
we're gonna be pinning big barrel curls
so<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> help<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.390> form<00:01:39.630> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.290 
now I've pinned about three big curls
around<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.400> little<00:02:25.610> bit<00:02:25.730> messy<00:02:25.850> but<00:02:26.270> I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
around and it's a little bit messy but I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.990 
around and it's a little bit messy but I
like<00:02:26.540> how<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.810> volume<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.440> on<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.100> it

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
like how the volume is on that so it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.790 
like how the volume is on that so it
works<00:02:29.209> for<00:02:29.360> me<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.810> I'm<00:02:30.110> just<00:02:30.230> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.560> take

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.180 
works for me and I'm just going to take
the<00:02:30.980> rest<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.550> hair<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.770> I'm<00:02:33.770> just<00:02:33.860> going

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
the rest of the hair and I'm just going

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.010 
the rest of the hair and I'm just going
to<00:02:34.459> make<00:02:35.110> twist<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.260> into<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:37.090> low<00:02:38.090> button<00:02:38.480> or<00:02:38.870> a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
to make twist it into a low button or a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.880 
to make twist it into a low button or a
button<00:02:39.319> right<00:02:39.530> under<00:02:39.800> your<00:02:40.040> bungee<00:02:41.650> just<00:02:42.650> keep

button right under your bungee just keep
twisting<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.090> it'll<00:02:44.270> start<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.569> take<00:02:44.810> the

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
twisting and it'll start to take the

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.699 
twisting and it'll start to take the
form<00:02:45.230> itself<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:46.970> just<00:02:47.180> wrap<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.360> around

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
and since these curls are pretty loose

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.180 
and since these curls are pretty loose
and<00:02:50.720> big<00:02:50.870> it'll<00:02:51.140> be<00:02:51.200> easy<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.590> place<00:02:51.950> them
