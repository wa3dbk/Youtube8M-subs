how a trackball works I cleaned the
rollers<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.509> think<00:01:10.720> something<00:01:11.020> got<00:01:11.140> stuck<00:01:11.259> on

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
one of the rollers during shipping so it

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.289 
one of the rollers during shipping so it
actually<00:01:13.600> wasn't<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.049> hard<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:15.189> fix<00:01:15.520> but

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
actually wasn't that hard to fix but

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.120 
actually wasn't that hard to fix but
then<00:01:16.420> there's<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.689> joystick<00:01:17.170> after<00:01:18.100> a

then there's the joystick after a

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.169 

before<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:32.950> could<00:01:33.189> do<00:01:33.280> surgery<00:01:33.729> on<00:01:33.819> it<00:01:33.939> once

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
before I could do surgery on it once

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.969 
before I could do surgery on it once
again<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.630> healed<00:01:34.869> itself<00:01:35.259> though<00:01:35.499> so<00:01:35.770> I

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
again it healed itself though so I

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.580 
again it healed itself though so I
really<00:01:36.670> questioned<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.840> build<00:01:38.079> quality<00:01:38.289> on

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
really questioned the build quality on

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.769 
really questioned the build quality on
this<00:01:38.859> thing<00:01:39.100> considering<00:01:39.729> how<00:01:40.060> expensive<00:01:40.420> it

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:40.779 
this thing considering how expensive it

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:44.099 
this thing considering how expensive it
is<00:01:40.899> it's<00:01:41.529> like<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:41.950> fine<00:01:42.429> automobile<00:01:42.999> I<00:01:43.810> don't

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
programming this thing is easy it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.780 
programming this thing is easy it
required<00:02:29.480> three<00:02:30.080> different<00:02:30.500> computers<00:02:30.980> until

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
required three different computers until

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.700 
required three different computers until
I<00:02:31.850> could<00:02:32.090> find<00:02:32.420> one<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.990> actually<00:02:33.470> worked

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
I could find one that actually worked

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.400 
I could find one that actually worked
with<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.850> X<00:02:35.000> arcade<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.630> programming<00:02:36.320> and

with the X arcade for programming and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.170 
with the X arcade for programming and
once<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.100> had<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.280> programmed<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.940> could<00:02:38.090> then

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
once I had it programmed I could then

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.300 
once I had it programmed I could then
put<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.570> on<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.810> my<00:02:38.960> gaming<00:02:39.230> PC<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.070> only

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
put it on to my gaming PC but the only

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.040 
put it on to my gaming PC but the only
computer<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.820> worked<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.240> one<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.810> had

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
computer that worked is one that I had

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.570 
computer that worked is one that I had
built<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.640> 2002<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:44.840> requires<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:46.100> kind<00:02:46.370> of

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
built in 2002 it requires this kind of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.600 
built in 2002 it requires this kind of
keyboard<00:02:47.090> input<00:02:47.750> on<00:02:47.900> your<00:02:48.710> computer<00:02:49.160> as<00:02:49.310> well

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
not for playing for playing you just

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.560 
not for playing for playing you just
need<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.320> USP<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.580> like<00:02:55.760> everything<00:02:56.180> with

pretty<00:02:58.880> much<00:02:59.030> good<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.330> go<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.690> can<00:02:59.960> have

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
pretty much good to go you can have

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.990 
pretty much good to go you can have
three<00:03:00.320> different<00:03:00.370> customizable<00:03:01.370> programming

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
three different customizable programming

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.900

features of the tank stick and it's an

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.090 
features of the tank stick and it's an
excellent<00:03:11.780> trackball<00:03:12.440> by<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.650> way<00:03:12.890> it's<00:03:13.040> very

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
excellent trackball by the way it's very

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.120

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
heavy very solid very rigid I feel like

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.240 
heavy very solid very rigid I feel like
I<00:03:16.220> know<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.490> personally<00:03:17.000> now<00:03:17.590> uses<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.620> USB

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
I know it personally now uses a USB

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.400 
I know it personally now uses a USB
output<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.270> work<00:03:20.420> with<00:03:20.630> your<00:03:20.780> PC<00:03:21.200> and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
output to work with your PC and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.250 
output to work with your PC and
functions<00:03:21.830> like<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.220> mouse<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.090> in<00:03:23.630> fact<00:03:23.840> if<00:03:24.050> you

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
functions like a mouse so in fact if you

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.860 
functions like a mouse so in fact if you
only<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:25.970> navigate<00:03:26.570> around

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
only have this you can navigate around

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.780 
only have this you can navigate around
the<00:03:27.230> screen<00:03:27.500> with<00:03:27.650> your<00:03:27.770> trackball<00:03:28.220> which<00:03:28.640> is

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
the screen with your trackball which is

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.910 
the screen with your trackball which is
a<00:03:28.820> really<00:03:29.090> kick-ass<00:03:29.330> trackball<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.320> can't

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
a really kick-ass trackball I can't

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.500 
a really kick-ass trackball I can't
compliment<00:03:31.460> the<00:03:31.670> trackball<00:03:32.150> enough

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
compliment the trackball enough

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.690 
compliment the trackball enough
seriously<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.170> rocks<00:03:33.410> one<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.580> other

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
seriously it rocks one of the other

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.000 
seriously it rocks one of the other
reasons<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.210> went<00:03:35.360> with<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.720> X<00:03:35.960> arcade<00:03:36.500> tank

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
reasons I went with the X arcade tank

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.380 
reasons I went with the X arcade tank
stick<00:03:37.310> is<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.700> can<00:03:37.850> buy<00:03:37.970> one<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.180> these

2<00:03:44.000> I'm<00:03:44.990> going<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.350> review<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.740> separately

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
2 I'm going to review this separately

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.890 
2 I'm going to review this separately
and<00:03:46.310> talk<00:03:46.520> about<00:03:46.670> how<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.180> works<00:03:47.420> with<00:03:47.600> each<00:03:47.750> of

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
and talk about how it works with each of

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.310 
and talk about how it works with each of
the<00:03:47.990> game<00:03:48.140> consoles<00:03:48.710> but<00:03:49.460> in<00:03:49.580> short<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:51.110> works

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
the game consoles but in short it works

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.520 
the game consoles but in short it works
the<00:03:51.470> way<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.680> should<00:03:52.780> then<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.930> plug<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.350> wire

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
the way it should then you plug the wire

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.949 
the way it should then you plug the wire
from<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.830> X<00:03:54.950> arcade<00:03:55.310> into<00:03:55.550> this<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.090> you've

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
from the X arcade into this and you've

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.350 
from the X arcade into this and you've
got<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.200> Sega<00:03:57.590> Dreamcast<00:03:58.070> controller<00:03:58.360> that's

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
got a Sega Dreamcast controller that's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.910 
got a Sega Dreamcast controller that's
quite<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.690> bit<00:03:59.870> larger<00:04:00.200> than<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.470> Dreamcast

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
quite a bit larger than the Dreamcast

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.600 
quite a bit larger than the Dreamcast
itself

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
itself

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.780 
itself
I<00:04:01.640> like<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.300> button<00:04:02.570> configuration<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.790> like

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
I like the button configuration I like

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.480 
I like the button configuration I like
the<00:04:04.910> buttons<00:04:05.170> themselves<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.320> joystick<00:04:07.160> from

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
the buttons themselves the joystick from

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.460 
the buttons themselves the joystick from
my<00:04:07.700> experience<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.600> from<00:04:08.660> what<00:04:09.230> I've<00:04:09.320> read

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
my experience and from what I've read

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.710 
my experience and from what I've read
online<00:04:09.620> seems<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.280> be<00:04:10.370> better<00:04:10.580> for<00:04:11.209> arcade

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
online seems to be better for arcade

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.740 
online seems to be better for arcade
games<00:04:12.050> than<00:04:12.770> fighting<00:04:13.400> games<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:14.300> I<00:04:14.330> do<00:04:14.450> like

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
games than fighting games but I do like

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.870 
games than fighting games but I do like
about<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.170> tank<00:04:15.440> stick<00:04:15.770> in<00:04:15.980> particular<00:04:16.700> is

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
about the tank stick in particular is

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.750 
about the tank stick in particular is
its<00:04:17.060> weight<00:04:17.420> it<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:18.410> as<00:04:18.590> heavy<00:04:18.890> as<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.190> tank<00:04:19.580> and

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
its weight it is as heavy as a tank and

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.670 
its weight it is as heavy as a tank and
that<00:04:19.820> gives<00:04:20.120> stability<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.410> don't<00:04:21.560> have

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
that gives stability so you don't have

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.530 
that gives stability so you don't have
to<00:04:21.799> have<00:04:21.950> one<00:04:21.980> hand<00:04:22.460> really<00:04:22.640> forcing<00:04:23.210> down<00:04:23.360> the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
to have one hand really forcing down the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.660 
to have one hand really forcing down the
controller<00:04:23.900> as<00:04:24.140> you're<00:04:24.590> trying<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:25.040> pull<00:04:25.520> off
