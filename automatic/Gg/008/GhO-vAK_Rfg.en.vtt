00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.029
 very good everyone here my second video 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.530
 and what is the beginning of a new 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.970
 series of videos in which I will bring you 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.280
 information about all the troops of 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.469
 clash of plants from the barbarian to 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.119
 the golem all the troops and well then 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.379
 like new to make it more exciting 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.880
 let's start from the troop more 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.859
 simple the barbarian 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.269
 well here we are seeing the four 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.710
 different aspects in which 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.019
 presents the respective ncaa barbarian 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.579
 level level 1 and 2 the barbarian is 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.220
 natural without any change so no 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.320
 I'm going to comment on anything in level 3 change 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.699
 and 4 the appearance of the barbarian varies is like 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.309
 who has a brown ribbon on his forehead 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.989
 and the size of his sword also increases 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.670
 is already going to level 5 the way 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.620
 rather more abrupt since the barbarian 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.680
 now he comes with a Viking helmet 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.019
 At least that seems and his sword 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.510
 presents a brown color I do not know if 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.659
 it will be gold I do not know if it will be bronze but if 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.689
 good some of those and already happening to the level 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.369
 6 the brutal change completely changes 

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.559
 all parents black his helmet is 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:59.780
 different and good the truth is that the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 helmet brings you an air pretty close to 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.940
 the master league the emblem is 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.270
 the theft is also different and good 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.759
 yes yes 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.859
 without thinking it like its appearance its 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.409
 strength increases impressively though 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.880
 good quiet that now I will put the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.520
 table of all the increase and defense of 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.990
 each level and well then almost no zeros 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.170
 more wait let's move on to the table 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.170
 statistics 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.900
 well what are you looking at the table of the 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.490
 who spoke does not have much to comment 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.990
 but good in two ways for 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.110
 provide us with a bit of work 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.729
 I will comment something good here is explained jce 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.960
 everything is not missing 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.610
 I tried to collect all the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.130
 possible information so that it is as 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.930
 complete possible and good what I believe 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.570
 more serves is to see that , for example, 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.759
 verbs are attacked second by second by 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.470
 what if you have them at the maximum level 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.470
 each hit erre that was an effort to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.570
 26 damage now building what is not 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.070
 a lot but since the barbarians are a 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.500
 unit that they have to go in group to 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.780
 must do something a group of 50 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.580
 barbarians yes he does something and in fact 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.330
 can make true true 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.970
 bestiality is good the truth is that no 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.009
 is a reality that I recommended a lot for 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.650
 I prefer archers because 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.860
 also this needs a pretty level 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.350
 barbarian high before level 5 not what 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.590
 I recommend it also has a range of 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.390
 0.4 so they have to get closer 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.400
 enough to the buildings that is a 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.090
 mortar we go in a matter of seconds 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.090
 how do I put you in one
