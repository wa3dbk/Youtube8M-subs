00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
5 as you can see here it's actually

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.100 
5 as you can see here it's actually
pretty<00:00:26.760> easy<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.150> set<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.540> testing<00:00:27.900> server

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
pretty easy to set up a testing server

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.920 
pretty easy to set up a testing server
if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.190> guys<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.580> ramp<00:00:29.940> installed<00:00:30.360> or<00:00:30.630> zamp

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
if you guys have ramp installed or zamp

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.709 
if you guys have ramp installed or zamp
if<00:00:31.590> you're<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:31.950> Linux<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:32.700> Windows<00:00:32.879> you<00:00:33.570> can

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
if you're on Linux or Windows you can

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.889 
if you're on Linux or Windows you can
run<00:00:33.899> either/or<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.340> believe<00:00:35.610> Mac<00:00:36.059> runs<00:00:36.420> map

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
run either/or and I believe Mac runs map

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.669 
run either/or and I believe Mac runs map

2<00:05:10.129> equals<00:05:11.129> 10<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:14.460> then<00:05:14.969> we'll<00:05:15.090> just<00:05:15.270> check

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
2 equals 10 and then we'll just check

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.920 
2 equals 10 and then we'll just check
them<00:05:15.569> out

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:26.659 

num1<00:05:19.340> plus<00:05:20.340> num2<00:05:24.710> we'll<00:05:25.710> change<00:05:25.949> that<00:05:26.069> so<00:05:26.430> it's

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
num1 plus num2 we'll change that so it's

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:33.230 
num1 plus num2 we'll change that so it's
proper<00:05:28.159> ok<00:05:30.110> save<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.819> come<00:05:32.819> back<00:05:32.969> to<00:05:33.120> your
