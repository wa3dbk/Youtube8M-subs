00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.540
 the youtube guys is I'm here to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.929
 do a little tutorial showing here 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.370
 a point about this beauty here that 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.260
 has already taken some time to adapt 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 zinho that he takes here is the hdmi output 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.090
 huh 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.850
 you can pick up any device that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.920
 have these hdmi hdmi outputs and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.199
 transform our family 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.080
 There you go, you can use it. 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.660
 to connect in the simple and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.420
 so it's a beauty because these engines 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.579
 they are much cheaper me to tv and sometimes 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.790
 Do you want to use the device like that? 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.250
 because they do not have the hdmi input and you 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.739
 May be using the vigil is much more 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.850
 easy for an enthusiasm to decide that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.539
 so here my problem is as follows 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:57.090
 to that use the xbox and half to use nor 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.520
 Very well, what turned out right. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.320
 The cool thing is that my adapter has a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.690
 output p2 also audio 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.670
 So you can connect me to the sound that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.450
 the staff is in doubt will transform 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.460
 to sounds the hdmi and get the picture only stay 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.640
 where then he has here this adapter 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.710
 do not just leave the audio line you 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 You can turn the sound on, yes, I got my 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.009
 so now I'm going to show you how it is 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.009
 What works for this track? 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.829
 I 'm already connected until after class 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.829
 Just call here. 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.830
 it's all working beauty that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.550
 You can see a very good image. 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 he will not compare himself with tvs right 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.170
 the hd is from hd but it is a very 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.140
 very good indeed 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.220
 Then there to play cool and quiet 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.869
 very cool device , just turn here 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.250
 Come and play a little to prove it. 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.250
 and as mass 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:53.290
