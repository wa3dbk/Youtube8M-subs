all<00:00:02.220> right<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:03.000> my<00:00:04.009> method<00:00:05.009> for<00:00:05.220> opening

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
all right this is my method for opening

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.120 
all right this is my method for opening
a<00:00:06.089> Gibson<00:00:06.569> guitar<00:00:06.990> case<00:00:07.550> this<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.700> one

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
a Gibson guitar case this is one

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.320 
a Gibson guitar case this is one
obviously<00:00:11.130> took<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> clasp<00:00:11.730> off<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.090> one

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
obviously took the clasp off this one

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.030 
obviously took the clasp off this one
but<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.780> want<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.139> sell<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.410> now<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.769> I'm<00:00:13.889> going

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
but I want to sell it now so I'm going

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.510 
but I want to sell it now so I'm going
to<00:00:14.070> replace<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.030> clasp<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:16.310> I've<00:00:17.310> forgotten

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
to replace the clasp and I've forgotten

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.420 
to replace the clasp and I've forgotten
the<00:00:17.760> number<00:00:18.029> combination<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.430> actually

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the number combination so actually

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.689 
the number combination so actually
devised<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.970> method<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.570> how<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> pick<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:25.699> so

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
devised this method of how to pick it so

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.230 
devised this method of how to pick it so
finally<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:28.580> simply<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> piece<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.119> paper

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
finally it is simply a piece of paper

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.530 
finally it is simply a piece of paper
this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.199> some<00:00:31.349> backing<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.540> some

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
this is just some backing from a some

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.430 
this is just some backing from a some
metal<00:00:33.899> shielding<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:35.309> our<00:00:35.520> cavity<00:00:36.260> fold<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
metal shielding it's our cavity fold it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.959 
metal shielding it's our cavity fold it
up<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.340> nice<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.610> small<00:00:40.730> we're<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
up so it's nice and small we're going to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.490 
up so it's nice and small we're going to
do<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.360> racket<00:00:43.820> clasp<00:00:45.320> hold<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
do with that racket clasp hold it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.279 
do with that racket clasp hold it
between<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.800> fingers<00:00:47.390> what<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> allow<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
between your fingers what I allow you to

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.279 
between your fingers what I allow you to
do<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.250> feel<00:00:50.579> any<00:00:50.820> movement<00:00:54.289> okay

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
do is just go to feel any movement okay

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.840 
do is just go to feel any movement okay
so<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.559> you'll<00:00:55.680> find<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so what you'll find is that because of

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.110 
so what you'll find is that because of
the<00:00:56.940> machining<00:00:57.120> tolerances<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:58.140> these<00:00:58.969> one<00:00:59.969> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the machining tolerances on these one of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.650 
the machining tolerances on these one of
the<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:01.050> splines<00:01:01.520> goes<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.670> against<00:01:03.030> one

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the little splines goes up against one

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
the little splines goes up against one
of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> tumblers<00:01:04.320> other<00:01:04.650> than<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> others<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
of the tumblers other than the others so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
of the tumblers other than the others so
you<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.510> need<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.840> work<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.260> which<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.470> is

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you just need to work out which one is

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.539 
you just need to work out which one is
the<00:01:08.810> way<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:11.070> keep<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the way to do that just keep the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.899 
the way to do that just keep the
pressure<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.380> just<00:01:13.380> rifle<00:01:13.920> through

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.929 

till<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> feel<00:01:18.270> better<00:01:18.869> give<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.939> keep

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
till you feel better give on this keep

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.980 
till you feel better give on this keep
tension<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> point<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.630> way

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
tension on here so you point it that way

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.789 
tension on here so you point it that way
I<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:26.130> feel<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.549> give<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.799> okay

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
I just feel like give a little bit okay

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.460 
I just feel like give a little bit okay
so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.939> feel<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.659> set<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
so I feel like that one set because it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.679 
so I feel like that one set because it
moved<00:01:31.650> our<00:01:31.950> way<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.509> would

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
moved our way a little bit so if I would

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.319 
moved our way a little bit so if I would
slip<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.470> need<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> look<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.040> these<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.490> try

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
slip just need to look at these to try

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.910 
slip just need to look at these to try
this<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:37.369> now<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.150> by<00:01:39.240> look

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
this one now you can see just by look

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.190 
this one now you can see just by look
that's<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> combination<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:42.930> I'll<00:01:43.020> do

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that's the combination so what I'll do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.350 
that's the combination so what I'll do
just<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.680> make<00:01:43.740> sure<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> show<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
just to make sure just to show you that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.240 
just to make sure just to show you that
that<00:01:45.390> works

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
that works

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:56.680 
that works
pushing<00:01:47.250> folds

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.930 

rumble<00:01:57.690> through<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.830> now<00:01:58.980> set<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.910> a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
rumble through it so it's now set to a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.540 
rumble through it so it's now set to a
different<00:02:00.270> chord<00:02:00.510> which<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.860> know

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.910 

okay<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> put<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.110> tension<00:02:07.380> back<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:09.860> able<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
okay so put the tension back on able to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.170 
okay so put the tension back on able to
play<00:02:11.070> with<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.280> one<00:02:11.460> so<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
play with this one so I know that this

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.610 
play with this one so I know that this
one<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.600> first<00:02:13.050> one

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
one is the first one

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
one is the first one
wait<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.340> splines<00:02:14.730> against<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.330> tumbler

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
wait a little splines against a tumbler

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.560 
wait a little splines against a tumbler
but<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.650> might<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.040> different<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.400> y'all<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.510> I'm

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
but I might be different on y'all so I'm

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.890 
but I might be different on y'all so I'm
going<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:18.960> first<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:20.250> scroll<00:02:20.580> through

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
going to do first just scroll through

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.220 
going to do first just scroll through
supply<00:02:21.900> which<00:02:22.170> way<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.440> go<00:02:26.450> you'll<00:02:27.450> feel<00:02:27.930> just

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
supply which way you go you'll feel just

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.940 
supply which way you go you'll feel just
a<00:02:28.650> lot<00:02:28.800> better<00:02:29.040> given<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:31.350> just<00:02:31.560> try<00:02:31.890> it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
a lot better given that so just try it

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:43.510 
a lot better given that so just try it
again

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.199 

yeah<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.000> feels<00:02:45.210> like<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:46.790> just<00:02:47.790> started

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
yeah so it feels like this just started

00:02:48.209 --> 00:03:04.880 
yeah so it feels like this just started
to<00:02:48.420> go<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.630> next<00:03:03.290> okay<00:03:04.290> can't<00:03:04.709> feel
