 still that controversy of attaining 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.240
 60 fps if your computer is good and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.610
 does not reach 60 fps 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.770

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.829

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.390
 above 30 fps

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.850
 file is always is going to have to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.739
 setting on the video version there is not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.289
 nothing much just came back to show you 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.910

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.329
 They will not lose your account and will not 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.370
 take bank account of that make a backup 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.859
 if you think you're being stung by 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.210
 this file 6 returns the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.670
 original files there may be a block 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.369
 of notes is for you take a look 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 It's one of the things I've had in the game. 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.000
 that will greatly help the performance of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.790
 Here you go, it 's this file here. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 you will copy he's not coming 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.140
 making its part of the document the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.600
 Company Information | 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.210
 and I'll put it in here I already have 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.150
 but I'll put it back by reminding me 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.310
 a backup before the touch placed here 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.360
 you can close this other file here 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.010
 You will copy the check from your 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.490
 part of the deficit not in there 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:50.350
 source where my separate trf-3 is 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:55.330
 having your f-3 folder and put here already 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.899
 here and just as I started to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.119
 to win basic fps junk there explodes there 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.899
 Nuno Melo and sets in the best shape 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.000
 possible 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.100
 remembering that if you diminish some 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.410
 things on the menu if your computer 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.780
 so powerful you will reach 60 fps 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.540
 I do not guarantee this to everyone. 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.450
 Everyone has to be different, right. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.090
 the informational video looks at you before 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.110
 and then the files galera either know 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.110
 I'm fanboy
