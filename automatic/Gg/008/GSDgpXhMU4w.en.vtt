can<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.079> they're<00:00:52.379> fully<00:00:52.710> functional<00:00:53.340> they're

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
can see they're fully functional they're

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.380 
can see they're fully functional they're
all<00:00:54.440> all-metal<00:00:55.440> same<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> main<00:00:56.640> gear<00:00:56.910> also

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
all all-metal same as the main gear also

all all-metal same as the main gear also
their<00:00:57.870> functional<00:00:58.829> hydraulic<00:00:59.280> system<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
their functional hydraulic system it's a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.970 
their functional hydraulic system it's a
spring<00:01:00.750> system<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.680> nothing

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
spring system in there you know nothing

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.170 
spring system in there you know nothing
too<00:01:02.129> fancy<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.609> keeping<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.030> nice<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
too fancy just keeping it nice and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.780 
too fancy just keeping it nice and
simple<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.140> absorbs<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.799> lot<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> landings

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
simple but absorbs a lot of the landings

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
one thing I really like about this model

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.670 
one thing I really like about this model
when<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.049> building<00:01:13.200> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
when I was building it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
when I was building it
I<00:01:13.710> thought<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> servos<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.030> were<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.360> there

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
I thought the servos that were in there

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.760 
I thought the servos that were in there
we're<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.140> some<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.650> know

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.200 
we're just gonna be some you know
generic<00:01:17.159> service<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.670> they're<00:01:17.850> actually<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
generic service but they're actually the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.230 
generic service but they're actually the
T<00:01:18.689> pro<00:01:18.960> servos<00:01:19.470> they're<00:01:19.920> nine<00:01:20.189> gram<00:01:20.490> metal

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
T pro servos they're nine gram metal

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
T pro servos they're nine gram metal
gear<00:01:21.450> T<00:01:21.750> pro<00:01:21.990> servo<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.530> something<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
gear T pro servo that's something I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
gear T pro servo that's something I
really<00:01:23.400> love<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> bat<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> know
