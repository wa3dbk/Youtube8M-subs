great<00:02:15.230> advantage<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.739> this<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.070> you've<00:02:16.220> got<00:02:16.310> a

great advantage of this is you've got a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.250 
great advantage of this is you've got a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
battery in both so it gives you up to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.009 
battery in both so it gives you up to
about<00:02:18.560> 17<00:02:19.220> hours<00:02:19.549> of<00:02:20.030> claimed<00:02:20.329> battery<00:02:20.870> life

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
about 17 hours of claimed battery life
