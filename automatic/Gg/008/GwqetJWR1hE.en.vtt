eyelashes are coming unglued um probably

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
eyelashes are coming unglued um probably
I<00:01:24.150> rather<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:26.130> realized<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.729> I've

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I rather have not realized that I've

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.499 
I rather have not realized that I've
lipstick<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.540> teeth<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:27.960> um<00:01:29.509> well

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
lipstick on my teeth because um well

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.700 
lipstick on my teeth because um well
first<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.020> don't<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.259> wear<00:01:31.500> fake

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
first of all I don't really wear fake

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.160 
first of all I don't really wear fake
eyelashes<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.000> think<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.689> just

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
eyelashes but I think that that just

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.560 
eyelashes but I think that that just
kind<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.439> happens<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.220> lipstick<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.909> wearing

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
kind of happens so lipstick and wearing

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.420 
kind of happens so lipstick and wearing
like<00:01:36.810> fig<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.650> means<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> put

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
like fig out that means like you put

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
like fig out that means like you put
them<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.900> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.470> looks

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
them on that and it kind of just looks

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.760 
them on that and it kind of just looks
like<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:41.310> messy<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.150> trashy<00:01:42.990> time<00:01:43.500> F

because<00:03:41.360> it's<00:03:42.360> just<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.260> different

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
because it's just it's a different

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.530 
because it's just it's a different
feeling<00:03:43.620> than<00:03:44.269> like<00:03:45.950> embarrassment<00:03:46.950> um<00:03:47.850> it's

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
feeling than like embarrassment um it's

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.199 
feeling than like embarrassment um it's
just<00:03:49.019> gross<00:03:49.560> but<00:03:50.100> it's<00:03:50.280> over<00:03:50.519> when<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.060> over

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
just gross but it's over when it's over

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.580 
just gross but it's over when it's over
and<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.660> don't<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.049> think<00:03:52.230> about<00:03:52.410> it

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and you don't have to think about it

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.190 
and you don't have to think about it
ever<00:03:52.950> again<00:03:53.209> so<00:03:54.209> i<00:03:54.269> think<00:03:54.510> i'll<00:03:54.780> have<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.080> go

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
ever again so i think i'll have to go

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.100 
ever again so i think i'll have to go
for<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.440> ketchup<00:03:56.420> would<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.570> rather<00:03:57.690> be<00:03:58.080> able
