00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
but what I don't want to discuss is how

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
but what I don't want to discuss is how
Infinity<00:00:36.780> Ward<00:00:36.989> should<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.590> sledgehammer<00:00:38.340> or

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
Infinity Ward should or sledgehammer or

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.750 
Infinity Ward should or sledgehammer or
whatever<00:00:38.910> should<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.660> about<00:00:39.809> nerfing<00:00:40.500> these

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
whatever should go about nerfing these

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.330 
whatever should go about nerfing these
now<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.600> first<00:00:42.899> problem<00:00:43.170> at<00:00:43.500> hand<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> hip

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
now the first problem at hand is the hip

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.950 
now the first problem at hand is the hip
spread<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.809> single<00:00:46.260> fmg9<00:00:47.719> actually<00:00:48.719> has

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
spread now the single fmg9 actually has

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
spread now the single fmg9 actually has
the<00:00:48.989> same<00:00:49.530> hips<00:00:49.860> spread<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.640> does<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the same hips spread as it does with a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.319 
the same hips spread as it does with a
Kimbo<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.199> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> ridiculous<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.879> needs

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
Kimbo on it which is ridiculous it needs

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.840 
Kimbo on it which is ridiculous it needs
to<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:54.780> hip<00:00:55.379> spread<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> Kimbo<00:00:56.640> as

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
to have more hip spread with a Kimbo as

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
to have more hip spread with a Kimbo as
a<00:00:57.480> matter<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.750> fact<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:58.199> you're<00:00:58.320> watching<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
a matter of fact if you're watching in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
a matter of fact if you're watching in
720p<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.760> might<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.149> able<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> see

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
720p right now you might be able to see

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.080 
720p right now you might be able to see
my<00:01:00.750> cursor<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.320> how<00:01:01.469> small<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.160> actually

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
my cursor and how small it is actually

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
my cursor and how small it is actually
may<00:01:03.510> even<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.899> able<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.530> 360<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:06.360> uh

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
may even be able to see it at 360 but uh

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.469 
may even be able to see it at 360 but uh
and<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.710> probably<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.150> might<00:01:09.270> have

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and you probably can it you might have

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.760 
and you probably can it you might have
to<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:09.960> bit<00:01:10.140> closer<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> screen

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
to get a little bit closer to the screen

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.910 
to get a little bit closer to the screen
but<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.720> but<00:01:12.720> still<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.290> hip

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
but I don't know but still the hip

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.870 
but I don't know but still the hip
spread<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:15.020> way<00:01:16.020> too<00:01:16.080> low<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:17.130> needs<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
spread is way too low it needs to be a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.130 
spread is way too low it needs to be a
lot<00:01:18.299> bigger<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> Kimbo<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:21.140> that's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
lot bigger with a Kimbo and that's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
lot bigger with a Kimbo and that's
pretty<00:01:22.350> much<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.580> exact

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
pretty much all I don't have exact

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.749 
pretty much all I don't have exact
numbers<00:01:24.060> I've<00:01:24.960> heard<00:01:25.250> 5.5<00:01:26.250> being<00:01:26.549> tossed

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
numbers I've heard 5.5 being tossed

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.700 
numbers I've heard 5.5 being tossed
around<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:27.479> way<00:01:27.720> too<00:01:27.780> complicated<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
around but that's way too complicated to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
around but that's way too complicated to
explain<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.299> an<00:01:30.450> idea<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> what

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
explain but that's an idea as to what

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.819 
explain but that's an idea as to what
they<00:01:31.500> should<00:01:31.680> set<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.950> hips<00:01:32.579> spread<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
they should set the hips spread to and

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.830 
they should set the hips spread to and
that's<00:01:34.829> with<00:01:35.070> steady<00:01:35.340> game<00:01:35.520> without<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that's with steady game without it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.710 
that's with steady game without it
should<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.229> even<00:01:37.500> bigger<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:38.460> anyways<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:39.420> in

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
should be even bigger but anyways I'm in

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440 
should be even bigger but anyways I'm in
the<00:01:39.810> next<00:01:40.079> part<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:41.189> rounds<00:01:41.670> per<00:01:41.880> minute<00:01:42.119> on

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the next part the rounds per minute on

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.609 
the next part the rounds per minute on
the<00:01:42.930> fmg9<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.829> ridiculous<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:45.689> single<00:01:46.350> fmg9

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the fmg9 is ridiculous the single fmg9

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.710 
the fmg9 is ridiculous the single fmg9
has<00:01:47.159> about<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.750> 1035<00:01:48.750> around<00:01:49.170> per<00:01:49.350> minute<00:01:49.649> rate

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
has about a 1035 around per minute rate

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.810 
has about a 1035 around per minute rate
which<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> fastest<00:01:53.310> guns<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
which is one of the fastest guns in the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.660 
which is one of the fastest guns in the
game<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> actually<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
game if I think it actually is the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.510 
game if I think it actually is the
second<00:01:57.000> fastest<00:01:57.420> next<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> p<00:01:57.960> 99<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:58.770> p99

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
second fastest next to the p 99 but p99

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.600 
second fastest next to the p 99 but p99
you<00:01:59.670> need<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> rapid<00:02:00.270> fire<00:02:00.420> mod<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.810> fire<00:02:01.189> at<00:02:02.189> max

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you need a rapid fire mod to fire at max

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.499 
you need a rapid fire mod to fire at max
speed<00:02:02.759> anyways<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:05.159> fire<00:02:05.670> rate<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.149> these

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
speed anyways so the fire rate on these

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.020 
speed anyways so the fire rate on these
with<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> Kimbo<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:08.550> basic<00:02:09.000> math

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
with a Kimbo if you can do basic math

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.940 
with a Kimbo if you can do basic math
you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.509> tell<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.819> 2070<00:02:12.230> which<00:02:13.230> combined

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you can tell that is 2070 which combined

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.280 
you can tell that is 2070 which combined
that<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.370> his<00:02:14.489> damage<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.230> fact<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that with his damage and the fact that

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.780 
that with his damage and the fact that
it's<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.590> 325<00:02:17.160> shot<00:02:17.459> kill<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.739> just<00:02:19.790> retarded

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
it's a 325 shot kill it's just retarded

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
it's a 325 shot kill it's just retarded
Lee<00:02:21.330> overpowered<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.800> would

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
Lee overpowered just in that you would

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.580 
Lee overpowered just in that you would
you<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:23.790> able<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.269> run<00:02:24.900> around<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.379> spray

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
you be able to just run around and spray

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.710 
you be able to just run around and spray
like<00:02:25.769> that<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.879> think<00:02:27.330> they<00:02:27.450> should<00:02:27.599> be<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
like that so I think they should be a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.330 
like that so I think they should be a
nerve<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.379> at<00:02:28.470> least<00:02:29.030> 800<00:02:30.030> RPM<00:02:30.739> atma<00:02:31.739> well<00:02:32.130> at

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
nerve to at least 800 RPM atma well at

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.589 
nerve to at least 800 RPM atma well at
most<00:02:32.760> 800<00:02:33.360> RPM<00:02:34.790> maybe<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:36.090> higher<00:02:36.300> may

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
most 800 RPM maybe a little higher may

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.589 
most 800 RPM maybe a little higher may
probably<00:02:37.110> lower<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.819> still<00:02:41.120> they<00:02:42.120> need<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.480> be

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
probably lower but still they need to be

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.780 
probably lower but still they need to be
nerfed<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> lower<00:02:43.709> fire<00:02:44.040> rate<00:02:44.340> because

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
nerfed to a lower fire rate because

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.300 
nerfed to a lower fire rate because
right<00:02:45.239> now<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.810> use<00:02:46.019> even<00:02:46.739> even<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
right now you can use even even the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.370 
right now you can use even even the
single<00:02:47.670> one<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.090> use<00:02:48.120> as<00:02:48.450> an<00:02:48.630> SMG<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
single one you can use as an SMG and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.650 
single one you can use as an SMG and
they're<00:02:50.040> supposed<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> be<00:02:50.670> secondaries<00:02:51.450> not

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
they're supposed to be secondaries not

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
they're supposed to be secondaries not
primaries<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:55.110> brings<00:02:55.260> me<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> next

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
primaries so that brings me to the next

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.180 
primaries so that brings me to the next
part<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.400> damage<00:02:57.049> currently<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.410> 4220

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
part the damage currently it is a 4220

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.789 
part the damage currently it is a 4220
damage<00:02:59.489> gun<00:02:59.790> which<00:03:00.660> means<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> two-shot

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
damage gun which means it is a two-shot

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.370 
damage gun which means it is a two-shot
headshot<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.610> three<00:03:03.599> shot<00:03:03.780> kill<00:03:04.049> at<00:03:04.140> close

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
headshot a three shot kill at close

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.949

range and a five shot kill at long range

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.640 
range and a five shot kill at long range
now<00:03:07.200> even<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.860> now<00:03:08.959> that's<00:03:09.959> about<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.349> par<00:03:10.590> with

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
now even it now that's about on par with

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.289 
now even it now that's about on par with
most<00:03:11.099> of<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.280> SMGs<00:03:11.849> again<00:03:12.890> but<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.430> makes<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
most of the SMGs again but it makes the

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.500 
most of the SMGs again but it makes the
g18<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.349> be<00:03:16.970> scorpions<00:03:17.970> pretty<00:03:18.389> much

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
g18 and be scorpions pretty much

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.420 
g18 and be scorpions pretty much
pointless<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:19.139> they<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:19.500> load<00:03:19.709> low

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
pointless because they have load low

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.550 
pointless because they have load low
damage<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:22.530> ga<00:03:22.739> teens<00:03:23.010> have<00:03:23.160> high<00:03:23.609> fire<00:03:23.880> rate

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
damage the ga teens have high fire rate

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.470 
damage the ga teens have high fire rate
but<00:03:25.560> not<00:03:25.769> as<00:03:25.889> much<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.250> fmg9<00:03:26.549> s<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:29.450> has<00:03:30.450> a

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
but not as much the fmg9 s and has a

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.420 
but not as much the fmg9 s and has a
lower<00:03:30.750> clip<00:03:31.079> size<00:03:31.290> lower<00:03:31.560> damage<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.190> all<00:03:32.310> of

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
lower clip size lower damage and all of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.349 
lower clip size lower damage and all of
that<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:35.220> damage<00:03:35.430> needs<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:36.030> lowered

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
that so the damage needs to be lowered

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.990 
that so the damage needs to be lowered
to<00:03:36.569> at<00:03:36.690> least<00:03:36.900> thirty<00:03:37.380> maximum<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.250> twenty

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
to at least thirty maximum and twenty

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.530 
to at least thirty maximum and twenty
minimum<00:03:39.389> i<00:03:39.600> would<00:03:40.019> say<00:03:40.410> put<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.829> at<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> 32<00:03:41.609> 17<00:03:42.209> or

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
minimum i would say put it at a 32 17 or

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.640 
minimum i would say put it at a 32 17 or
something<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:44.420> on<00:03:45.420> top<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.230> course

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
something and on top of that of course

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.440 
something and on top of that of course
you'd<00:03:46.799> have<00:03:46.889> to<00:03:47.100> nerf<00:03:47.310> MP<00:03:47.760> sevens<00:03:48.120> as<00:03:48.239> well

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
you'd have to nerf MP sevens as well

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.120 
you'd have to nerf MP sevens as well
because<00:03:48.870> those<00:03:49.139> are<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.620> same<00:03:49.799> damage

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
because those are about the same damage

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.550 
because those are about the same damage
they<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.209> lower<00:03:51.450> minimum<00:03:51.780> damage<00:03:52.200> but

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
they have a lower minimum damage but

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.979 
they have a lower minimum damage but
still<00:03:54.709> anyways<00:03:55.790> akimbo<00:03:56.790> that's<00:03:57.569> that's

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
still anyways akimbo that's that's

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.080 
still anyways akimbo that's that's
pretty<00:03:58.079> much<00:03:58.349> it<00:03:58.410> for<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.859> fmg9<00:03:59.160> s<00:03:59.670> in<00:03:59.730> general

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
pretty much it for the fmg9 s in general

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.479 
pretty much it for the fmg9 s in general
however<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:01.049> would<00:04:01.380> need<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.549> nerf<00:04:03.359> the

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
however you would need to nerf the

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.170 
however you would need to nerf the
akimbo<00:04:05.870> MP<00:04:06.870> nines<00:04:07.139> as<00:04:07.530> well<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.130> probably<00:04:08.940> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
akimbo MP nines as well and probably the

g8 teams maybe I don't know I wouldn't

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.960 
g8 teams maybe I don't know I wouldn't

weapon information as well soon I'm

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.000 
weapon information as well soon I'm
still<00:05:37.750> trying<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.020> get<00:05:38.140> a<00:05:38.200> video<00:05:38.380> out<00:05:38.560> on<00:05:38.919> the

still trying to get a video out on the

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.550 
still trying to get a video out on the
Fed<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.640> fire<00:05:40.330> rate<00:05:40.630> increase<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.320> stuff

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
Fed and the fire rate increase and stuff

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.150 
Fed and the fire rate increase and stuff
but<00:05:42.010> it's<00:05:42.280> kind<00:05:42.610> of<00:05:42.669> hard<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:42.970> do<00:05:43.210> but<00:05:43.990> if<00:05:44.380> i<00:05:44.950> get

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
but it's kind of hard to do but if i get

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.409 
but it's kind of hard to do but if i get
if<00:05:45.340> i<00:05:45.540> get<00:05:46.540> it<00:05:46.690> and<00:05:46.810> managed<00:05:47.140> to<00:05:47.290> figure<00:05:47.470> it<00:05:47.710> out

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
if i get it and managed to figure it out

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.450 
if i get it and managed to figure it out
definitely<00:05:49.470> expect<00:05:50.470> that<00:05:50.620> in<00:05:50.740> your<00:05:50.860> sub<00:05:51.070> boxes

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
definitely expect that in your sub boxes

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.670 
definitely expect that in your sub boxes
soon<00:05:51.729> because<00:05:52.150> apparently<00:05:52.660> a<00:05:52.960> silenced<00:05:53.560> or

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
soon because apparently a silenced or

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.340 
soon because apparently a silenced or
extended<00:05:54.190> mag<00:05:54.370> fat<00:05:54.700> increases<00:05:55.110> your<00:05:56.110> fire

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
extended mag fat increases your fire

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.260 
extended mag fat increases your fire
rate<00:05:56.620> by<00:05:56.770> about<00:05:57.010> seven<00:05:57.370> percent<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:57.940> this<00:05:58.120> has

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
rate by about seven percent and this has

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.909 
rate by about seven percent and this has
been<00:05:58.390> known<00:05:58.600> for<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:58.870> while<00:05:58.960> now<00:05:59.140> actually<00:05:59.800> I'm
