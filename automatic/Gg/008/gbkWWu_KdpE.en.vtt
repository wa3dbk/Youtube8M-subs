we<00:00:17.470> originally<00:00:17.680> started<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.430> earthworks

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
we originally started the earthworks

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.750 
we originally started the earthworks
around<00:00:19.119> about<00:00:19.330> November<00:00:19.930> 2009<00:00:20.890> but<00:00:21.460> the<00:00:21.580> main

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
around about November 2009 but the main

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.640 
around about November 2009 but the main
construction<00:00:22.180> of<00:00:22.510> the<00:00:22.599> plant<00:00:22.869> commenced<00:00:23.500> in

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
construction of the plant commenced in

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.089 
construction of the plant commenced in
april<00:00:24.040> 2010<00:00:24.880> so<00:00:25.320> we're<00:00:26.320> completed<00:00:26.800> in<00:00:26.950> just

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
april 2010 so we're completed in just

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.560 
april 2010 so we're completed in just
under<00:00:27.460> a<00:00:27.490> year<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.880> modern<00:00:34.210> state<00:00:34.450> of

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
under a year so is the modern state of

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.560 
under a year so is the modern state of
the<00:00:34.660> art<00:00:34.840> class<00:00:35.110> cheers<00:00:35.860> not<00:00:36.130> only<00:00:36.570> this

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
the art class cheers not only this

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.400 
the art class cheers not only this
technology<00:00:38.310> which<00:00:39.310> is<00:00:39.520> so<00:00:39.960> super<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.170> type<00:00:41.380> of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
technology which is so super the type of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.500 
technology which is so super the type of
form<00:00:42.750> basically<00:00:43.750> it's<00:00:43.899> a<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.510> gravity

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
form basically it's a it's a gravity

float<00:00:47.070> vacation<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.360> that<00:00:49.570> we<00:00:49.840> become<00:00:50.260> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
float vacation so that we become the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.880 
float vacation so that we become the
gold<00:00:50.860> on<00:00:51.160> those<00:00:51.850> three<00:00:52.060> sections<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.680> Acacia

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
gold on those three sections the Acacia

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.430 
gold on those three sections the Acacia
is<00:00:54.520> in<00:00:55.390> monstrovia<00:00:57.060> motor<00:00:58.060> system<00:00:58.570> which<00:01:01.440> not

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
is in monstrovia motor system which not

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.950 
is in monstrovia motor system which not
only<00:01:02.470> gives<00:01:02.920> you<00:01:03.100> very<00:01:03.370> good<00:01:03.670> recoveries<00:01:04.239> it's

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
only gives you very good recoveries it's

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.530 
only gives you very good recoveries it's
well<00:01:05.680> trying<00:01:06.159> to<00:01:06.280> test<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.670> throughout<00:01:06.880> the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
well trying to test it throughout the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:20.480 
well trying to test it throughout the
world<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:07.990> it's<00:01:08.740> also<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.689> secure

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.730 

the<00:01:21.490> whole<00:01:21.640> plant<00:01:21.970> was<00:01:22.360> budgeted<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.290> come<00:01:23.590> in

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the whole plant was budgeted to come in

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.490 
the whole plant was budgeted to come in
at<00:01:23.920> around<00:01:24.490> about<00:01:24.730> 18<00:01:25.210> million<00:01:25.480> with<00:01:25.840> another

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
at around about 18 million with another

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.560 
at around about 18 million with another
two<00:01:26.800> in<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.100> bit<00:01:27.280> million<00:01:27.640> for<00:01:27.880> power

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
two in a bit million for power

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.040 
two in a bit million for power
generation<00:01:29.850> thus<00:01:30.850> far<00:01:31.090> with<00:01:31.330> we're<00:01:31.720> still

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
generation thus far with we're still

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.550 
generation thus far with we're still
within<00:01:32.260> budget<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:34.180> look<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.600> save<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.320> few

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
within budget and we look to save a few

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.120 
within budget and we look to save a few
paintings<00:01:35.800> by<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.100> time<00:01:36.430> we're<00:01:36.580> finished

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.230 

well<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.190> course<00:01:42.220> we've<00:01:42.790> got<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.120> have

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
well of course we've got to have

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.530 
well of course we've got to have
generators<00:01:43.780> for<00:01:44.170> backup<00:01:44.590> power<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
generators for backup power in the

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.300 
generators for backup power in the
future<00:01:47.050> we're<00:01:47.260> expecting<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.950> hydroelectric

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
future we're expecting a hydroelectric

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.080 
future we're expecting a hydroelectric
scheme<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.180> start<00:01:50.100> working<00:01:51.100> not<00:01:51.759> 20

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
scheme to start working not 20

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.690 
scheme to start working not 20
kilometers<00:01:52.630> away<00:01:52.780> from<00:01:52.900> here<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.500> then<00:01:54.430> we

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
kilometers away from here and then we

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.100 
kilometers away from here and then we
hope<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.030> be<00:01:55.150> able<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.360> switch<00:01:55.570> over<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.900> that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
hope to be able to switch over to that

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.690 
hope to be able to switch over to that
of<00:01:56.380> course<00:01:56.470> we'll<00:01:56.830> have<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.220> major

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
of course we'll have a a major

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.480 
of course we'll have a a major
cost-saving<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.600> us<00:01:58.720> but<00:01:59.320> in<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.530> meantime<00:01:59.560> we

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
cost-saving to us but in the meantime we

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.340 
cost-saving to us but in the meantime we
need<00:02:00.520> all<00:02:00.820> five<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.119> these<00:02:01.420> generators<00:02:01.960> to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
need all five of these generators to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.749 
need all five of these generators to
keep<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.680> plant<00:02:02.920> running<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.550> unknown

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
keep the plant running and the unknown

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.109 
keep the plant running and the unknown
at<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.270> moment<00:02:04.300> and<00:02:04.900> we<00:02:05.050> have<00:02:05.200> five<00:02:05.560> install
