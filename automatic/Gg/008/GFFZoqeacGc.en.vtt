00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
yeah my advice would be if it's too hot

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.310 
yeah my advice would be if it's too hot
for<00:03:40.580> you<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.269> actually<00:03:41.630> layer<00:03:43.090> with<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.330> jumper

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
for you to actually layer with a jumper

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.810 
for you to actually layer with a jumper
like<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:46.510> then<00:03:48.880> get<00:03:49.880> yourself<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.480> tank<00:03:50.840> top

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
like this then get yourself a tank top

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.860 
like this then get yourself a tank top
which<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:53.120> slightly<00:03:53.959> too<00:03:54.230> big<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.799> it<00:03:55.790> does<00:03:56.660> do

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
which is slightly too big and it does do

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.259 
which is slightly too big and it does do
the<00:03:56.959> trick<00:03:57.230> if<00:03:58.010> you've<00:03:58.430> if<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:58.820> don't<00:03:59.090> wear<00:03:59.239> a

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
you've got quite a large chest then you

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.400 
you've got quite a large chest then you
can<00:04:06.200> always<00:04:06.560> get<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:07.070> sports<00:04:08.030> bra<00:04:08.299> or<00:04:08.750> two<00:04:09.140> and
