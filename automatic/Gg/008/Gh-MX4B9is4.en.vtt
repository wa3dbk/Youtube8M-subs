00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
which saves us a lot of time now it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.859 
which saves us a lot of time now it's
instead<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.900> four<00:01:37.500> weeks<00:01:37.650> being<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.909> tight

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
instead of four weeks being a tight

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.960 
instead of four weeks being a tight
deadline<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.530> weeks<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:40.950> an<00:01:41.490> acceptable

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
deadline for weeks is now an acceptable

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.280

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
we've been able to use the light table

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.770 
we've been able to use the light table
feature<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.909> onion<00:02:21.209> skin<00:02:21.480> feature

feature and the onion skin feature

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.300 
feature and the onion skin feature
probably<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.549> most<00:02:23.730> right<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:26.159> light

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
probably the most right now the light

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.339 
probably the most right now the light
table<00:02:26.459> feature<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.940> obviously<00:02:27.239> great<00:02:28.049> because

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
table feature is obviously great because

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.110 
table feature is obviously great because
it<00:02:28.500> allows<00:02:28.530> us<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:29.010> when<00:02:29.400> we're<00:02:29.549> doing<00:02:29.700> cleanup

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
it allows us to when we're doing cleanup

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.280 
it allows us to when we're doing cleanup
it<00:02:30.239> allows<00:02:30.390> us<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.840> focus<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
it allows us to just focus on the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.339 
it allows us to just focus on the
drawing<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.830> opposed<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:33.080> figure<00:02:34.080> out<00:02:34.200> where

the flipping papers and trying to figure

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
out where the drawings actually are so

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.680 
out where the drawings actually are so
we<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.129> focus<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.670> cleanup<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.269> line<00:02:39.450> and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
we can just focus on cleanup in line and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.710 
we can just focus on cleanup in line and
the<00:02:40.640> onion<00:02:41.640> skin<00:02:41.819> tool<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.209> great<00:02:42.420> because<00:02:42.599> now

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
the onion skin tool is great because now

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.589 
the onion skin tool is great because now
before<00:02:43.530> we're<00:02:43.739> working<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.069> paper<00:02:44.599> characters

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
before we're working on paper characters

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.160 
before we're working on paper characters
we<00:02:45.720> tend<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.049> scale<00:02:46.980> up<00:02:47.190> or<00:02:47.280> down<00:02:47.489> as<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:48.989> if

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
we tend to scale up or down as we go if

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.319 
we tend to scale up or down as we go if
it<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:49.379> long<00:02:49.590> animation<00:02:50.310> sequence<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:51.269> we

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
it was long animation sequence now we

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.640 
it was long animation sequence now we
don't<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.629> problem<00:02:51.989> since<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.500> have

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
don't have that problem since we have

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.289 
don't have that problem since we have
the<00:02:52.920> onion<00:02:53.129> skin<00:02:53.280> tool<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:53.819> always<00:02:53.940> make

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
the onion skin tool we can always make

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.110 
the onion skin tool we can always make
sure<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.629> everything<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.079> scaled<00:02:55.620> properly

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
sure that everything is scaled properly

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.720 
sure that everything is scaled properly
here<00:02:57.120> at<00:02:57.209> house<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.359> cool<00:02:57.629> we<00:02:57.840> have<00:02:57.989> design<00:02:58.349> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
here at house a cool we have design and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.849 
here at house a cool we have design and
layout<00:02:59.730> here<00:03:00.030> which<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.900> great<00:03:01.349> for<00:03:01.379> us<00:03:01.620> in

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
layout here which is great for us in

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.319 
layout here which is great for us in
storyboard<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:02.609> they<00:03:02.819> are<00:03:02.940> able<00:03:03.120> to

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
storyboard because they are able to

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.690 
storyboard because they are able to
upload<00:03:04.170> their<00:03:04.530> files<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.220> server<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
upload their files to the server and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.789 
upload their files to the server and
then<00:03:06.299> we<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.629> create<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.140> library<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.680> we

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
then we can create the library that we

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.460 
then we can create the library that we
can<00:03:07.970> direct<00:03:08.970> insert<00:03:09.750> directly<00:03:10.140> into<00:03:10.349> toon

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
can direct insert directly into toon

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.140 
can direct insert directly into toon
boom<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.859> use<00:03:11.420> layouts<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.750> designs

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
boom and use layouts and designs

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.550 
boom and use layouts and designs
directly<00:03:15.150> into<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.690> program<00:03:15.959> which<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.410> great

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
directly into the program which is great

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.990 
directly into the program which is great
for<00:03:16.590> us<00:03:16.769> because<00:03:16.890> then<00:03:17.190> our<00:03:17.400> characters<00:03:17.880> are

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
for us because then our characters are

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.819 
for us because then our characters are
actually<00:03:18.269> acting<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> vironment<00:03:19.109> that

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
actually acting in the vironment that

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.420 
actually acting in the vironment that
they<00:03:20.609> will<00:03:20.819> be<00:03:20.940> acting<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.630> want<00:03:22.319> when<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.160> hits

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
they will be acting in want when it hits

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.289 
they will be acting in want when it hits
the<00:03:23.549> air<00:03:23.669> so<00:03:24.419> we<00:03:24.599> have<00:03:24.720> no<00:03:25.819> there's<00:03:26.819> no<00:03:26.940> hiccups

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
the air so we have no there's no hiccups

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.120 
the air so we have no there's no hiccups
along<00:03:27.419> the<00:03:27.569> way<00:03:27.690> when<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.410> gets<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.650> layout<00:03:28.799> or

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
along the way when it gets to layout or

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.159 
along the way when it gets to layout or
to<00:03:29.340> design<00:03:29.639> that<00:03:29.849> they<00:03:29.970> can't<00:03:30.209> actually<00:03:30.840> have

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
to design that they can't actually have

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.870 
to design that they can't actually have
to<00:03:31.290> change<00:03:31.620> things<00:03:31.829> so<00:03:32.609> we're<00:03:32.760> actually

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
to change things so we're actually

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.789 
to change things so we're actually
everything<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.599> now<00:03:33.720> working<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.380> little<00:03:34.680> bit

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
everything is now working a little bit

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.120 
everything is now working a little bit
more<00:03:34.950> cohesively<00:03:35.840> in<00:03:36.840> terms<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.349> revisions

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
more cohesively in terms of revisions

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.520 
more cohesively in terms of revisions
now<00:03:38.549> that<00:03:38.790> we<00:03:38.880> send<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.299> director<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.169> actual

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
now that we send the director and actual

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.770 
now that we send the director and actual
file<00:03:40.950> they're<00:03:41.609> actually<00:03:42.000> they're<00:03:42.389> able<00:03:42.569> to

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
file they're actually they're able to

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.059 
file they're actually they're able to
make<00:03:42.900> comments<00:03:43.290> directly<00:03:43.620> onto<00:03:43.859> the

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
make comments directly onto the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.309 
make comments directly onto the
storyboard<00:03:44.609> itself<00:03:44.970> whereas<00:03:45.690> before<00:03:45.840> we

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
storyboard itself whereas before we

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.839 
storyboard itself whereas before we
would<00:03:46.440> get<00:03:46.590> written<00:03:47.130> comments<00:03:47.519> which<00:03:47.669> can

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
would get written comments which can

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.120 
would get written comments which can
sometimes<00:03:48.060> be<00:03:48.480> vague<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.109> now<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
sometimes be vague so now that the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.030 
sometimes be vague so now that the
director<00:03:50.430> has<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.579> ability<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.560> jot<00:03:52.560> down<00:03:52.590> or

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
director has the ability to jot down or

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.099 
director has the ability to jot down or
rough<00:03:53.340> out<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.639> seeing<00:03:54.090> exactly<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.870> way<00:03:54.989> they

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
rough out of seeing exactly the way they

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.409 
rough out of seeing exactly the way they
want<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.380> we<00:03:55.769> now<00:03:55.889> have<00:03:56.099> no<00:03:56.370> discrepancies<00:03:57.180> as

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
want it we now have no discrepancies as

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.659 
want it we now have no discrepancies as
to<00:03:57.599> what<00:03:57.810> we<00:03:57.989> can<00:03:58.230> do<00:03:58.379> what<00:03:59.010> we<00:03:59.040> do<00:03:59.220> for<00:03:59.370> them<00:03:59.519> in

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
to what we can do what we do for them in

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.809 
to what we can do what we do for them in
the<00:03:59.970> revision<00:04:00.329> process<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:01.250> working<00:04:02.250> on<00:04:02.459> the

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
the revision process and working on the

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.569 
the revision process and working on the
original<00:04:03.209> file<00:04:03.450> with<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.739> do<00:04:04.859> revisions<00:04:05.430> is

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
original file with to do revisions is

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.800 
original file with to do revisions is
great<00:04:05.790> because<00:04:05.879> we<00:04:05.970> can<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.389> clean<00:04:06.780> up

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
great because we can just clean up

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.839 
great because we can just clean up
directly<00:04:07.379> on<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.620> file<00:04:07.829> remove<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.669> layer

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
directly on that file remove the layer

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.610 
directly on that file remove the layer
that<00:04:09.060> we<00:04:09.120> no<00:04:09.299> longer<00:04:09.329> need<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.049> just<00:04:10.440> keep

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
that we no longer need and just keep

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.890 
that we no longer need and just keep
moving<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.940> keeps<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.180> nice<00:04:12.389> clean<00:04:12.629> file

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
moving on and it keeps a nice clean file

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.710 
moving on and it keeps a nice clean file
and<00:04:13.230> makes<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.099> very<00:04:14.280> convenient<00:04:14.849> for<00:04:14.879> us<00:04:15.000> sorry

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
and makes a very convenient for us sorry

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.479 
and makes a very convenient for us sorry

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
but Pro is great for delivery since it

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.640 
but Pro is great for delivery since it

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.279 
JPEGs which is great to deliver to
clients<00:04:32.389> because<00:04:32.539> men<00:04:32.690> they<00:04:32.810> don't<00:04:32.990> have<00:04:33.110> to
