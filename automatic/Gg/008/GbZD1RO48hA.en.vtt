00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:08.360 

once<00:00:58.270> you've<00:00:58.390> done<00:00:58.540> that<00:00:59.880> we<00:01:00.880> want<00:01:01.060> to<00:01:01.210> do<00:01:01.330> just

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.490 

that<00:01:09.370> we<00:01:09.910> wanna<00:01:10.120> do<00:01:11.550> wanna<00:01:12.550> remove<00:01:12.940> two<00:01:13.330> screws

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that we wanna do wanna remove two screws

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.540 
that we wanna do wanna remove two screws
one<00:01:14.500> up<00:01:14.650> here<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.729> one<00:01:15.850> on<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.090> other<00:01:16.120> side

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
one up here the one on the other side

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:31.469 
one up here the one on the other side
and<00:01:18.550> keep<00:01:19.270> them<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.840> don't<00:01:19.960> lose<00:01:20.260> them

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.840 

so<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.049> comes<00:01:32.290> up<00:01:32.500> hold<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.400> don't<00:01:33.549> just

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
so it comes up hold it so you don't just

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.050 
so it comes up hold it so you don't just
in<00:01:34.240> case<00:01:34.420> bits<00:01:34.659> come<00:01:34.900> out<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:36.400> can<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.820> make

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
in case bits come out you can just make

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
in case bits come out you can just make
sure<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.360> don't<00:01:37.479> lose<00:01:37.689> any<00:01:37.900> of<00:01:37.990> those<00:01:38.170> pieces

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.710 

once<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.920> comes<00:01:45.189> off<00:01:45.369> might<00:01:46.240> be<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.420> bit<00:01:46.600> more

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
once that comes off might be a bit more

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.680 
once that comes off might be a bit more
Tetris<00:01:47.259> trips<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.670> make<00:01:48.820> sure<00:01:48.850> just<00:01:49.509> don't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
Tetris trips but make sure just don't

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.550 
Tetris trips but make sure just don't
worry<00:01:49.810> about<00:01:49.930> that

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
worry about that

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.340 
worry about that
keep<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.039> screw<00:01:51.310> where<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:52.229> check<00:01:53.229> the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
keep the screw where it is check the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.139 
keep the screw where it is check the
float<00:01:53.680> make<00:01:54.039> sure<00:01:54.189> there's<00:01:54.369> no<00:01:54.520> picture<00:01:55.000> and

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
float make sure there's no picture and

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.429 
float make sure there's no picture and
flu<00:01:55.420> cleaner<00:01:56.340> clean<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.610> base<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:58.149> it<00:01:58.439> clean

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
flu cleaner clean the base of it clean

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.190 
flu cleaner clean the base of it clean
how<00:01:59.649> far<00:02:00.130> do<00:02:00.310> we<00:02:00.340> have<00:02:00.549> to<00:02:00.700> do<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.899> what<00:02:02.080> you

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
how far do we have to do and what you

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.380 
how far do we have to do and what you
want<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.439> do<00:02:02.819> make<00:02:03.819> sure<00:02:03.850> where<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.119> pin

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
want to do make sure where this pin

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.730 
want to do make sure where this pin
doesn't<00:02:04.600> come<00:02:04.899> out<00:02:05.020> here<00:02:05.259> because<00:02:05.409> if<00:02:05.619> you

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
doesn't come out here because if you

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.740 
doesn't come out here because if you
lose<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.100> pin<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.399> are<00:02:06.640> going<00:02:07.360> trouble

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
lose that pin you are going trouble

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.620 
lose that pin you are going trouble
because<00:02:08.110> okay<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:08.950> basically<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:10.390> happens

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
because okay so basically what happens

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.530 
because okay so basically what happens
is<00:02:10.810> as<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.980> front<00:02:12.280> moves<00:02:12.430> up<00:02:12.730> there's<00:02:13.360> this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
is as the front moves up there's this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.470 
is as the front moves up there's this
needle<00:02:14.019> here<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:15.069> closes<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> petrel<00:02:16.209> as<00:02:16.420> a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
needle here with closes the petrel as a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.990 
needle here with closes the petrel as a
floating<00:02:16.989> zone<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:18.100> while<00:02:18.280> common<00:02:18.640> error<00:02:18.819> is

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
floating zone so while common error is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.840 
floating zone so while common error is
as<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.750> moves<00:02:19.900> up<00:02:20.049> and<00:02:20.200> down<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.560> many<00:02:20.620> times

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
as it moves up and down so many times

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.900 
as it moves up and down so many times
the<00:02:21.850> pins<00:02:22.180> get<00:02:22.569> pushed<00:02:22.810> inwards<00:02:23.350> which<00:02:24.340> stops

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
the pins get pushed inwards which stops

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.930 
the pins get pushed inwards which stops
the<00:02:25.090> flow<00:02:25.330> from<00:02:25.660> moving<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.049> up<00:02:26.170> far<00:02:26.799> enough<00:02:26.950> to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
the flow from moving it up far enough to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.300 
the flow from moving it up far enough to
turn<00:02:28.239> off<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.480> petrol<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.860> want<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.130> do

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
turn off the petrol so you want to do

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.160 
turn off the petrol so you want to do
make<00:02:31.120> sure<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.360> pin<00:02:31.569> doesn't<00:02:31.870> come<00:02:32.019> out

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
make sure that pin doesn't come out

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.949 
make sure that pin doesn't come out
again<00:02:32.470> when<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.519> hold<00:02:33.819> it<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.510> want<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.750> hold

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
again when I hold it you want to hold

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.400 
again when I hold it you want to hold
one<00:02:35.080> side<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.579> I'll<00:02:36.579> push<00:02:36.970> towards<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.750> push

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
one side and I'll push towards you push

outwards and do the same on the other

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.930 
outwards and do the same on the other
side<00:02:41.049> push<00:02:41.410> outwards<00:02:41.920> once<00:02:42.670> you've<00:02:42.760> done<00:02:42.880> that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
side push outwards once you've done that

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.449 
side push outwards once you've done that
it<00:02:43.930> should<00:02:44.140> be<00:02:44.260> easy<00:02:44.590> up<00:02:44.829> at<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.040> picture<00:02:45.340> to

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
it should be easy up at a picture to

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.900 
it should be easy up at a picture to
open<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:45.940> close<00:02:46.230> if<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:48.160> want<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:48.579> can<00:02:48.700> turn

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
open and close if you want you can turn

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.610 
open and close if you want you can turn
on<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.150> petrol<00:02:49.510> into<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.810> quick<00:02:50.019> test<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.470> it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
on the petrol into a quick test of it

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.680 
on the petrol into a quick test of it
but<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.070> don't<00:02:51.190> really<00:02:51.400> need<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.700> basically

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
but you don't really need to basically

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.720 
but you don't really need to basically
just<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.019> trial<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.470> error<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:54.489> keep

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
just a trial and error so you just keep

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.030 
just a trial and error so you just keep
on<00:02:54.880> trying<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.600> trying<00:02:55.810> until<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.829> get

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
on trying and trying until you get

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.509 
on trying and trying until you get
perfectly<00:02:57.959> next<00:02:58.959> we<00:02:59.079> want<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.290> put<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.250> float

tightened<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.630> then<00:03:28.810> slowly<00:03:29.250> put<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> back

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
tightened and then slowly put that back

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.090 
tightened and then slowly put that back
on<00:03:30.840> slowly<00:03:33.840> get<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.930> screws<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.709> put<00:03:35.980> them

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
on slowly get the screws and put them

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.920 
on slowly get the screws and put them
back<00:03:36.220> in

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.570 

as<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.960> tightening<00:03:43.680> them<00:03:43.830> doing<00:03:44.070> tight<00:03:44.340> and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
as a tightening them doing tight and

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.370 
as a tightening them doing tight and
once<00:03:44.850> they're<00:03:45.120> too<00:03:45.450> much<00:03:45.600> just<00:03:45.960> tighten<00:03:46.260> it

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
once they're too much just tighten it

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.620 
once they're too much just tighten it
enough<00:03:46.860> till<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.370> holds<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.880> actual<00:03:48.180> base<00:03:48.330> in

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
enough till it holds the actual base in

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.870 
enough till it holds the actual base in
place<00:03:51.860> in<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.190> then<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.370> want<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.580> tighten

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
place in and then you want to tighten

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.870 
place in and then you want to tighten
both<00:03:54.300> screws<00:03:54.410> gradually<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.400> base<00:03:56.580> goes

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
both screws gradually so the base goes

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.100 
both screws gradually so the base goes
in<00:03:57.110> evenly<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:58.650> both<00:03:58.680> sides<00:03:59.390> so<00:04:00.390> when<00:04:00.540> the

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
in evenly on both sides so when the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.220 
in evenly on both sides so when the
screw<00:04:01.380> stops<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:01.980> side<00:04:02.990> once<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.110> get

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
screw stops on that side once you get

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.020 
screw stops on that side once you get
starts<00:04:04.470> get<00:04:04.620> stiffest<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.400> side<00:04:05.610> then<00:04:05.850> go

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
starts get stiffest on this side then go

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.230 
starts get stiffest on this side then go
back<00:04:06.210> to<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.510> side<00:04:06.950> turn<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.070> in<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.190> bit<00:04:08.430> go

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
back to this side turn it in a bit go

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.280
