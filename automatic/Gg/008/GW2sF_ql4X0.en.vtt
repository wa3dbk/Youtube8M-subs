hailey<00:00:10.599> it<00:00:10.660> more<00:00:10.900> darker<00:00:11.440> she's<00:00:12.009> gonna<00:00:12.129> have<00:00:12.280> a

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
hailey it more darker she's gonna have a

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.220 
hailey it more darker she's gonna have a
lot<00:00:12.400> of<00:00:12.639> movement<00:00:12.849> in<00:00:13.209> the<00:00:13.299> head<00:00:13.509> so<00:00:14.049> what<00:00:14.200> I

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
lot of movement in the head so what I

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.740 
lot of movement in the head so what I
might<00:00:14.440> do<00:00:14.679> is<00:00:14.860> we<00:00:15.039> turn<00:00:15.429> everything<00:00:15.549> down<00:00:15.999> and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
might do is we turn everything down and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.840 
might do is we turn everything down and
create<00:00:17.110> bring<00:00:17.470> some<00:00:17.680> depth<00:00:17.950> inside<00:00:18.340> so

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
create bring some depth inside so

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.400 
create bring some depth inside so
there's<00:00:19.000> more<00:00:19.180> separation<00:00:19.750> in<00:00:19.840> movement<00:00:20.230> with

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
there's more separation in movement with

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.370 
there's more separation in movement with
a<00:00:20.440> haircut<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:22.300> quite<00:00:22.660> like<00:00:22.870> the<00:00:22.990> color<00:00:23.170> she<00:00:23.350> has

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
a haircut I quite like the color she has

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.290 
a haircut I quite like the color she has
I<00:00:23.830> think<00:00:24.370> we<00:00:24.430> should<00:00:24.580> start<00:00:24.820> and<00:00:24.970> bring<00:00:25.120> some

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
I think we should start and bring some

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.270 
I think we should start and bring some
back<00:00:25.540> in<00:00:26.080> between<00:00:26.500> this<00:00:26.740> is<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.950> make<00:00:27.100> more

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
back in between this is to make more

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.750 
back in between this is to make more
separation<00:00:27.910> really<00:00:29.070> picture<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.190> head<00:00:30.370> so

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
separation really picture the head so

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.800 
blonde with a light brown with gold
mixed<00:01:52.250> together<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:53.030> get<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.299> kind<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.630> a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
mixed together to get that kind of a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.990 
mixed together to get that kind of a
deep<00:01:54.049> honey<00:01:54.320> tone<00:01:54.650> just<00:01:55.430> create<00:01:55.759> kind<00:01:55.880> of

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
deep honey tone just create kind of

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.149 
deep honey tone just create kind of
separation<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.619> hair<00:01:57.829> as<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.009> was

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
separation to that the hair as I was

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.469 
separation to that the hair as I was
saying<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.640> know<00:01:58.729> we<00:01:58.850> don't<00:01:58.939> really<00:01:59.030> did<00:01:59.299> much

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
saying you know we don't really did much

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.240 
saying you know we don't really did much
if<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.229> look<00:02:00.380> at<00:02:00.470> it's<00:02:00.619> like<00:02:00.829> a<00:02:00.860> full<00:02:01.130> head<00:02:01.220> of

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
if you look at it's like a full head of

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.219 
if you look at it's like a full head of
highlights<00:02:01.729> but<00:02:01.909> you're<00:02:02.030> not<00:02:02.090> lifting<00:02:02.899> their

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
highlights but you're not lifting their

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.499 
highlights but you're not lifting their
hair<00:02:03.409> we're<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.130> adding<00:02:04.369> depth<00:02:04.820> in<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.000> so

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
hair we're just adding depth in it so

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.929 
hair we're just adding depth in it so
instead<00:02:05.689> of<00:02:05.780> lifting<00:02:06.200> your<00:02:06.680> darkening<00:02:07.610> but

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
instead of lifting your darkening but

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.580 
instead of lifting your darkening but
using<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.299> highlight<00:02:08.630> technique<00:02:09.019> uh-huh

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
using the highlight technique uh-huh

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.530 
using the highlight technique uh-huh
that's<00:02:09.799> been<00:02:09.950> we<00:02:10.340> call<00:02:10.579> it<00:02:10.700> really<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:11.180> low

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
that's been we call it really like low

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.420 
that's been we call it really like low
light<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.110> I'm<00:02:12.560> calling<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.220> kind<00:02:13.370> of

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
light and I'm calling that it's kind of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.810 
light and I'm calling that it's kind of
a<00:02:13.549> low<00:02:13.670> light<00:02:13.850> but<00:02:13.880> work<00:02:14.180> for<00:02:14.360> more<00:02:14.480> separation

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
a low light but work for more separation

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.100 
a low light but work for more separation
when<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.880> have<00:02:17.030> all<00:02:17.180> these<00:02:17.299> people<00:02:17.660> most<00:02:18.019> of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
when you have all these people most of

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.170 
when you have all these people most of
the<00:02:18.170> sanding<00:02:18.620> key<00:02:18.950> pondering<00:02:19.250> highlights<00:02:19.670> so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the sanding key pondering highlights so

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.729 
the sanding key pondering highlights so
what<00:02:20.329> happened<00:02:20.630> in<00:02:20.720> having<00:02:21.049> two<00:02:21.500> blonde

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
what happened in having two blonde

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.920 
what happened in having two blonde
minutes<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.310> lends<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:23.120> brick<00:02:23.329> to<00:02:23.600> break<00:02:23.810> this

down<00:02:24.140> make<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:24.980> more<00:02:25.220> like<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.430> commercial<00:02:26.239> or

gamma<00:02:26.780> separation<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:28.190> what<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.459> normally<00:02:28.579> do

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
gamma separation is what you normally do

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.369 
gamma separation is what you normally do
yes<00:02:30.269> what's<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.390> color<00:02:31.599> for<00:02:31.840> we<00:02:31.989> love<00:02:32.140> to

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
yes what's the color for we love to

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.440 
yes what's the color for we love to
achieve<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.040> book<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.150> should<00:02:34.360> the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
achieve this book but that should the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.729 
achieve this book but that should the
survey<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.989> should<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.379> really<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.709> very

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
survey that should is really is very

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.850 
survey that should is really is very
very<00:02:35.980> I'm<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.610> using<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.909> semi-permanent<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
very I'm just using a semi-permanent and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.830 
very I'm just using a semi-permanent and
it's<00:02:39.430> not<00:02:39.580> great<00:02:39.790> about<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:40.090> formula<00:02:40.599> when<00:02:40.750> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
it's not great about the formula when I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.740 
it's not great about the formula when I
think<00:02:41.049> about<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.860> kind<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.099> technique<00:02:42.599> it<00:02:43.599> is

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
think about this kind of technique it is

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.600 
think about this kind of technique it is
all<00:02:43.989> about<00:02:44.230> technique<00:02:44.860> how<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.069> can<00:02:45.250> approach

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
all about technique how you can approach

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.479 
all about technique how you can approach
it<00:02:45.640> that's<00:02:46.360> what's<00:02:46.629> making<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.959> really<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:48.129> a

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
it that's what's making it really but a

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.640 
it that's what's making it really but a
value<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.269> what<00:02:49.480> what<00:02:49.660> what<00:02:49.810> are<00:02:49.900> we<00:02:49.989> I'm<00:02:50.379> doing

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
value of what what what are we I'm doing

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.440 
value of what what what are we I'm doing
now<00:02:50.799> because<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.670> color<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:52.090> said<00:02:52.299> I'm<00:02:52.390> just

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
now because the color it said I'm just

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.440 
now because the color it said I'm just
using<00:02:52.840> like<00:02:53.129> 20<00:02:54.129> grams<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.459> further<00:02:54.730> but<00:02:55.330> the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
using like 20 grams of further but the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.509 
using like 20 grams of further but the
idea<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> concept<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.440> approaching<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.099> it

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
idea in the concept of approaching it it

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.180 
idea in the concept of approaching it it
was<00:02:57.730> really<00:02:58.180> cost<00:02:58.840> like<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.709> service<00:03:00.069> the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
was really cost like that service the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.460 
was really cost like that service the
sound<00:03:00.430> course<00:03:00.760> possibly<00:03:01.480> suppose<00:03:02.200> Alan

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
sound course possibly suppose Alan

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.339 
sound course possibly suppose Alan
porcelain<00:03:03.459> business<00:03:03.879> and<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.269> look<00:03:04.480> at<00:03:04.599> that<00:03:04.780> is

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
porcelain business and I look at that is

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.660 
porcelain business and I look at that is
what<00:03:05.530> make<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.829> make<00:03:05.980> money<00:03:06.190> because<00:03:06.370> you're

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
what make you make money because you're

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.849 
what make you make money because you're
using<00:03:06.819> less<00:03:07.000> product<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:08.019> your<00:03:08.200> idea<00:03:08.530> how<00:03:08.799> to

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
using less product but your idea how to

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:09.539 
using less product but your idea how to
approach<00:03:09.069> it

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
approach it

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.819 
approach it
that's<00:03:09.849> make<00:03:10.060> sure<00:03:10.209> well<00:03:10.500> okay<00:03:11.500> that's<00:03:11.680> what

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
that's make sure well okay that's what

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:12.990 
that's make sure well okay that's what
your<00:03:11.920> client<00:03:12.190> comes<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.430> paint<00:03:12.700> up<00:03:12.790> for<00:03:12.970> a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
your client comes to paint up for a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.380 
your client comes to paint up for a
brother

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
brother

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.900 
brother
but<00:03:13.930> what<00:03:14.109> idea<00:03:14.470> behind<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:15.069> technicality<00:03:15.310> we

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
but what idea behind a technicality we

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.080 
but what idea behind a technicality we
are<00:03:16.030> doing<00:03:16.269> yeah<00:03:17.370> I'm<00:03:18.370> gonna<00:03:18.489> get<00:03:18.670> make<00:03:18.849> sense

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
are doing yeah I'm gonna get make sense

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.190 
are doing yeah I'm gonna get make sense
but<00:03:19.829> when<00:03:20.829> I<00:03:20.950> silently<00:03:21.700> does<00:03:21.959> use<00:03:22.959> less

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
but when I silently does use less

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.710 
but when I silently does use less
brother<00:03:23.549> Japan<00:03:24.549> comes<00:03:24.879> your<00:03:25.209> resolving<00:03:25.569> their

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
brother Japan comes your resolving their

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.449 
brother Japan comes your resolving their
problem<00:03:26.109> without<00:03:26.859> really<00:03:27.069> doing<00:03:27.129> too<00:03:27.430> much

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
problem without really doing too much

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.420 
problem without really doing too much
yeah<00:03:28.060> do<00:03:28.629> less<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.799> looks<00:03:29.980> more<00:03:30.220> like<00:03:30.400> a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
yeah do less and it looks more like a

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.260 
yeah do less and it looks more like a
change

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:52.260 

right
