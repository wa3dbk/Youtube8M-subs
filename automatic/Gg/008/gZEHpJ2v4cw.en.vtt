00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.400 

well<00:00:46.980> Q<00:00:47.339> actually<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:48.420> zombie<00:00:48.929> hawgs<00:00:49.109> right

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410

well Q actually these zombie hawgs right
there<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.769> middle<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.219> CL<00:00:50.989> obviously

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
there in the middle like CL obviously

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.200 
there in the middle like CL obviously
until<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.829> wheel<00:00:52.980> goes<00:00:53.039> Edward<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.089> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
until the wheel goes Edward to the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.139 
until the wheel goes Edward to the
bearing<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.739> weird<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.609> bearings<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
bearing and weird to the bearings you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.920 
bearing and weird to the bearings you
let's<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.579> well<00:01:02.210> what<00:01:03.210> goes<00:01:03.360> inward<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
let's do that well what goes inward to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630 
let's do that well what goes inward to
the<00:01:04.019> bearing<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.860> water<00:01:05.190> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the bearing and when you get water it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550 
the bearing and when you get water it
just<00:01:05.940> all<00:01:06.180> goes<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.930> bearing<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
just all goes in there that bearing and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
just all goes in there that bearing and
it<00:01:07.649> doesn't<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.009> work<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.399> well<00:01:11.360> another

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it doesn't really work out well another
