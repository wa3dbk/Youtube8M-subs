logo<00:02:47.210> on<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.480> too<00:02:48.400> I'm<00:02:49.400> assuming<00:02:49.820> that's<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
logo on it too I'm assuming that's the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.730 
logo on it too I'm assuming that's the
side<00:02:50.300> where<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.540> leans<00:02:50.690> back<00:02:50.930> more<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.260> that's

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
side where it leans back more and that's

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.460 
side where it leans back more and that's
I<00:02:51.950> where<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.190> leans<00:02:52.340> back<00:02:52.580> glass<00:02:53.290> guess<00:02:54.290> it

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
I where it leans back glass guess it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.340 
I where it leans back glass guess it
