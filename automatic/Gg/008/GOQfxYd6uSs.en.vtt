now if you want there are a few battles

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.960 
now if you want there are a few battles
on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> way<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.910> take<00:00:18.359> or<00:00:19.970> or

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
on the way in that you can take or or

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.580 
on the way in that you can take or or
you<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.600> was<00:00:21.750> trying<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.320> which

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
you can do what I was trying to do which

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.200 
you can do what I was trying to do which
is<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:23.100> jump<00:00:23.430> over<00:00:23.580> them<00:00:23.850> because<00:00:24.090> they

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
is to just jump over them because they

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.660 
is to just jump over them because they
only<00:00:24.359> give<00:00:24.600> me<00:00:24.810> two<00:00:25.140> SP<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.830> point<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
only give me two SP at this point with a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.290 
only give me two SP at this point with a
level<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.449> 9<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:29.820> not<00:00:30.029> worth

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
level of 9 so it's really not worth

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.849 
level of 9 so it's really not worth
taking<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.750> time<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.109> fight<00:00:31.289> them<00:00:31.500> honestly

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
taking the time to fight them honestly

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.580 
taking the time to fight them honestly
and<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.759> gonna<00:00:32.910> jump<00:00:33.270> over<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:36.590> and

and so I'm just gonna jump over them and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.530 
and so I'm just gonna jump over them and
as<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.770> keep<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> right<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.210> find

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
do this great attack it's impossible to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.090 
do this great attack it's impossible to
avoid<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.409> prepare<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.979> so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
avoid I just have to prepare a bit so

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.529 
avoid I just have to prepare a bit so
hang<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.429> for<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> second<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:42.149> thanks<00:01:42.420> for

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
hang on for a second well thanks for

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.020 
hang on for a second well thanks for
telegraphing<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.520> basically<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.819> your

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
telegraphing it basically that's your

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
telegraphing it basically that's your
cue<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.450> use<00:01:45.569> the<00:01:45.719> out-of-sight<00:01:46.170> attack

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
cue to use the out-of-sight attack

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.609 
cue to use the out-of-sight attack
because<00:01:47.069> I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.520> does<00:01:47.670> 10<00:01:48.030> damage<00:01:48.619> by

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
because I think it does 10 damage by

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.459 
because I think it does 10 damage by
itself<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.569> you<00:01:51.569> want<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> use<00:01:51.959> out<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> sight

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
itself so you want to use out of sight

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.029 
itself so you want to use out of sight
and<00:01:52.709> avoid<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.189> thing<00:01:54.289> so<00:01:55.289> let's<00:01:55.439> let<00:01:55.739> him<00:01:55.860> go

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
and avoid this thing so let's let him go

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.479 
and avoid this thing so let's let him go
here<00:02:00.649> yeah<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.860> looks<00:02:02.039> like<00:02:02.099> that<00:02:02.310> might

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
here yeah that looks like that might

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.740 
here yeah that looks like that might
have<00:02:02.610> been<00:02:02.700> bad<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.179> were<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> let<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> hit

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
have been bad if I were to let it hit

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.209 
have been bad if I were to let it hit
face<00:02:03.899> though

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
face though

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.949 
face though
can<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.670> use<00:02:05.819> the<00:02:05.939> hammer<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.420> guy<00:02:06.539> no<00:02:06.719> he

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
can we use the hammer on this guy no he

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.839 
can we use the hammer on this guy no he
can't<00:02:07.200> because<00:02:07.649> he's<00:02:07.890> slightly<00:02:08.549> elevated<00:02:10.849> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
can't because he's slightly elevated so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.220 
can't because he's slightly elevated so
