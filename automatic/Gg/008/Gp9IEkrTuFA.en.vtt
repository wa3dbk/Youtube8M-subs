00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello how about friends we are with a new 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.760
 chapter of 'los y twix part 9 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.420
 we go with the presentation and we begin 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.420
 with the video 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.900
 and good guys continuing with this video 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.250
 the topic that I'm using today is 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.640
 call circles and we can find it 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.890
 totally free in the big boss network 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.400
 You see gives you a great look to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.739
 iphone since the icons puts them 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:47.050
 totally round good guys I hope 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.510
 I'm going to show you I have it 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.600
 installed as you can see there are certain 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.870
 icons that blink with a red light and 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.290
 others with a white light this is what 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.300
 does activboard the applications that 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.850
 they have a red background is because there is a 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.500
 new notification and that of the white background 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.020
 it simply does not indicate that it is 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.530
 running the application in second 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.800
 flat I'm going to take me for example there 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.810
 to enter a call and we see the 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 phone icon that is blank 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.050
 I'm going to cut the call now and if it 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.840
 they fix appears the notification of a 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.709
 missed call and the icon goes to the bottom 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.750
 red with that we already know that we have a 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.550
 active notification these guys do not 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.869
 have more configurations and combines 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.660
 perfectly with color badges well the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.490
 second touch I'm going to show you it's called 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:48.640
 spin we can download it from internet 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.410
 and it's super simple this tweet guys if 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.330
 we put a song down 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.700
 the volume so as not to have problems of 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.270
 copyright if we put the song by 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.840
 example this camelot block the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.550
 equipment modifies the player in the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.649
 lock screen for example here 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.739
 we can see that the cover appears 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.590
 round shape and the background appears a bit 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.340
 degraded we can advance the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.310
 songs and go back already 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.330
 we can advance the songs to 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.159
 certain points we want 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.430
 we slide this and forward the song 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.370
 at minute 15 already and of course we can 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.060
 give play pause also to the songs 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.409
 directly from the lock screen 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.049
 logically it works only for the 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.299
 songs that have covers already by 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.900
 example here does not have and see that shows 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.730
 one by default already and that's what it does 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.549
 now I'm going to show you a little what they are 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.160
 the settings of this tweet for 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.990
 this we go to settings 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.590
 as settings 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.230
 and we go down until he shows us the part 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.560
 of them and here it is 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.170
 Well good that we can do here activate 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.880
 and turn off the background illustration 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.200
 that shows in a sample the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:17.210
 blur the background the darker the clock 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.030
 of 24 hours and that every modification that 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.200
 we were asked to do a sprint like that 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.410
 that I will not do more modifications 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.020
 so I leave it to you so that 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.900
 experience now but it is very good 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.870
 tweet good guys the third and last 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.800
 tour is called into and we can 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.850
 download logically for insane 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.220
 law that what this tweet does adds 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.960
 a button in the youtube application 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.670
 so that to download videos and to which 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.160
 it is the grace that we can 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.180
 For example, watching a video through 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.000
 example a video here 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.450
 of soda slip 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.730
 and we are watching this video and we say no 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.890
 I want to download it to see it later 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.780
 example I'm going to 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.300
 skip the skip ad 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.810
 of this one 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.989
 and as you can see, a button is added that says 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.360
 into then if I want to download 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.420
 this video I press this button and I can 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.580
 download it in hd and normal sd 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.410
 of galache this is that it starts to 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.450
 download but since itunes store is already 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.450
 say the grace of this that I can 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.590
 play the video as music as 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:42.440
 song or video as you can 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.870
 say what it can be used for 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.370
 good if you reproduce a video 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.150
 as video to lock the screen in the 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.340
 reproduction 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.110
 the video is going to have for example this 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.430
 this video is here I downloaded it with into 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.150
 notice that he is reproducing it as 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.889
 song already notice that it's like song 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.180
 then I do block 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.180
 the device 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.050
 the playback does not stop or I can 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.139
 keep listening to the song for example 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.419
 with the screen blocked for example 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.969
 here I put him play and I can continue 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.560
 listening to or overtake the already 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.030
 and 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.940
 good 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.680
 the previous video of that was in 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.100
 background so let's see how 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:44.610
 will spend at itunes store and is 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.610
 ending and there finished downloading 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.320
 well here I can search the video 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.920
 also with this with the search engine but 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.920
 love 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.280
 and as you can see the video that 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.470
 just download and play it as 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.650
 video because it appears on the screen 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.780
 complete then what is the disadvantage 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.860
 of these that I lock the screen 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:17.340
 is going to stop the reproduction already good 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.490
 already this tweet has no more settings 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.940
 you lower it do not install and occupy it 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.220
 nothing more than that and good if you like 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.620
 as I have the iphone in this moment of 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.800
 personalized with an icon theme 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:35.400
 down to hit my ass can see 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.380
 the previous videos of cydia tweet and 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.840
 there shows a little how to do or achieve 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.210
 this so guys if you liked the 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:46.160
