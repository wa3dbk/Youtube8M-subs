00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.670 
the video it has a smaller cap meaning
that<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.269> fit<00:02:16.540> only<00:02:16.750> as<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.049> ponytail

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
that it is fit only as a ponytail

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.380 
that it is fit only as a ponytail
because<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.220> not<00:02:18.340> big<00:02:18.549> enough<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.939> wear<00:02:19.120> as<00:02:19.360> a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
because it's not big enough to wear as a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.680 
because it's not big enough to wear as a
half<00:02:19.720> leg<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.349> it's<00:02:21.340> still<00:02:22.120> worth<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.510> at<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
half leg so it's still worth it at the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.960 
half leg so it's still worth it at the
ponytail<00:02:23.290> because<00:02:23.470> it's<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:24.040> hairdo<00:02:24.430> itself

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
ponytail because it's a hairdo itself

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.770 
ponytail because it's a hairdo itself
you<00:02:25.450> look<00:02:25.660> polished<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.260> look

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
you look polished you look

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.270 
you look polished you look
and<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.140> takes<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.470> less<00:02:27.590> than<00:02:27.830> five<00:02:28.040> minutes

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
and it takes you less than five minutes

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.960 
and it takes you less than five minutes
to<00:02:28.520> do<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:30.190> yeah<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.220> would<00:02:31.340> definitely<00:02:31.610> suggest

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
to do so yeah I would definitely suggest

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.059 
to do so yeah I would definitely suggest
getting<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.690> because<00:02:32.840> how<00:02:33.230> Rick<00:02:33.560> takes<00:02:33.920> a

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
getting it because how Rick takes a

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.350 
getting it because how Rick takes a
little<00:02:34.220> extra<00:02:34.459> time<00:02:34.700> because<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.240> to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
little extra time because you have to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.420 
little extra time because you have to
blend<00:02:35.569> in<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:35.870> your<00:02:35.990> Paris<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.400> a

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430

okay you're going to store by putting

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.800 
okay you're going to store by putting
your<00:03:27.330> hair<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.960> ponytail<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:29.540> already<00:03:30.540> have

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
your hair in a ponytail I already have

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.260 
your hair in a ponytail I already have
gel<00:03:31.110> on<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.380> from<00:03:31.620> earlier<00:03:32.070> but<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.940> would

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
gel on it from earlier but I would

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.820 
gel on it from earlier but I would
recommend<00:03:33.570> putting<00:03:33.870> gel<00:03:34.170> on<00:03:34.380> there<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.800> that

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
recommend putting gel on there so that

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.220 
recommend putting gel on there so that
every<00:03:35.370> piece<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.060> hair<00:03:36.390> will<00:03:36.600> actually<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:37.020> in

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
every piece of hair will actually be in

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.310 
every piece of hair will actually be in
the<00:03:37.350> ponytail<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:38.760> doesn't<00:03:39.150> matter<00:03:39.300> how<00:03:39.660> messy

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
the ponytail it doesn't matter how messy

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.780 
the ponytail it doesn't matter how messy
the<00:03:40.530> point<00:03:40.770> so<00:03:40.950> now<00:03:40.980> we're<00:03:41.310> going<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.490> get<00:03:41.610> to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
the point so now we're going to get to

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.170 
the point so now we're going to get to
the<00:03:41.910> ponytail<00:03:42.480> now<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:44.310> see<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.700> cab<00:03:44.940> it

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the ponytail now you can see the cab it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.449 
the ponytail now you can see the cab it
kind<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.510> looks<00:03:45.750> like<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.930> cup<00:03:46.290> side<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.920> this

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
kind of looks like a cup side and this

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.400 
kind of looks like a cup side and this
is<00:03:47.670> why<00:03:47.820> it's<00:03:47.880> really<00:03:48.330> fitted<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.020> doesn't

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
is why it's really fitted so it doesn't

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.740 
is why it's really fitted so it doesn't
stretch<00:03:49.770> or<00:03:49.980> anything<00:03:50.400> at<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.360> bottom<00:03:51.720> part

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750
