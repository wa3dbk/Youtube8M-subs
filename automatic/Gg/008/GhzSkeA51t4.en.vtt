00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.370
 Hey. 

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.160
 In today's video, I'll show Easter eggs from different games, 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.379
 referring to the iconic fantastic saga of George 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.109
 Lucas - Star Wars. 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.960
 There are a huge number of references to this epic 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.500
 in a variety of films, TV shows, cartoons and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.429
 in general, in all that is possible. 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.090
 Although the title says "Top 10", and to some extent 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.130
 this is so - here I will show 10 games with easter eggs themselves 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.360
 the games are in free order. 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640
 But if you wish, you can write in the comments 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.440
 your top of what is shown in this video and position 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.210
 it is all at your discretion. 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.470
 Or simply write your favorite reference to 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 Star Wars, even those that are not from games. 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.850
 I will start with Bioshok Infinit. 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.660
 At the level when you need to save Elizabeth from the tower, 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.949
 you will pass different cabinets through which 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.679
 see what she does. 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.949
 In a room with pictures, Elizabeth will open for a short moment. 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.089
 portal, apparently to Paris. 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.840
 On the other side of the portal will be seen the cinema, 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.219
 on its sign it says that it is now on the screens 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.210
 movie called “Revenge of the Jedi”. 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.840
 That is what could be called the sixth episode of the Star 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.510
 Wars, but in December of the 82nd, George Lucas decided that "Revenge" 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.819
 does not fit and returned to its original 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.290
 Variant - "Return of the Jedi." 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.660
 Here, but a little later, Booker says “This 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.310
 work is getting worse and worse. ” 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.140
 This is a reference to Lando Calrissian’s phrase in “The Empire 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.661
 strikes back "-" This deal ceases all 

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:16.910
 worse and worse". 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.990
 The next game is LEGO Indiana Jones: Original Adventures. 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.160
 In LEGO remake of the first scene from the film “In Search of the Lost 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.180
 the ark ”after you take the idol out of the cave 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.200
 Indiana Jones trying to cheat 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.840
 Rene Belloc, the villain of all archaeological finds 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.030
 at Indy, and instead of an idol, give him the golden head of C-3PO. 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.490
 Belloc, of course, won't do it. 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340
 Instead, he will begin to mock Jones 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 walking around it just like C-3PO does, 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.950
 even sounds will parody. 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.480
 In addition to the game Morrowind: Bladmun in Bjorn's caves 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.140
 there is a small dead end at the very end 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.270
 whose skeleton is hanging from the ceiling, and lying down below 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.270
 sword. 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.140
 This parody is sent to the fifth episode - “The Empire 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.380
 strikes back. ” 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.910
 There Luke woke up in an ice cave hanging upside down, 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.910
 frozen foot to the arch. 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.850
 And below is his lightsaber. 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.800
 This is not the only game where there is such Easter eggs. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.929
 In general, it can often be found in different games. 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.080
 For example, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.349
 In one of the very first video with easter eggs 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.709
 I already showed it. 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.409
 As in Bladmun, exploring the Cold Beach Cave 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.379
 not far from Winterhold, inside you'll find a similar 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.550
 a skeleton hanging from the ice upside down, and below will 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.550
 lay the sword 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.069
 Just be careful here, in a cave some snow 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.069
 trolls. 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.840
 The third and last such Easter eggs with a parody of 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.590
 the scene from “The Empire Strikes Back” can be found 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.409
 in the old Duke Nukem 3D. 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.170
 In the second episode, at the level of the Lunar Reactor in some 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.780
 the moment you get to the huge cliff that 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.090
 will need to jump over. 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.450
 By activating the jetpack and, preferably, the immortality mode, 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.629
 start going down until the other side 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.239
 bump into a cave. 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.510
 Inside you will find no longer a skeleton, but Luke himself. 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.180
 Here he hangs with his feet bound by a rope, and below 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.400
 not a sword but a cannon. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.040
 Well, he also has no hands. 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.510
 In this case, Duke will pronounce some kind of joke about the force. 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.950
 Interestingly, in the film in this scene, Luke is the third 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.629
 just use force to draw a lightsaber 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.629
 from the ground. 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.410
 In the same game on the eighth level of the fourth episode 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.219
 there will be a moment when you fall into the garbage press. 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.279
 There is a sign on the wall with the number of this press. 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.529
 - Unit 3263827. 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.279
 Exactly the same number was at the garbage block in prison, 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.420
 in which Luke, Han, Leia and Chewbacca are miraculously shunned 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.189
 death in the fourth episode “New Hope” 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.680
 Next on the list is Batman: Arkham City. 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.139
 This possible Easter eggs can only be found during 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.080
 or after completing the Dadshot side mission “Shot 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.110
 in the darkness". 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.689
 After the second or third kill you will find the closed 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.189
 stash with weapons Dadshot. 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.049
 Inside among the pistols and other guns will lie 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.379
 something very like a lightsaber. 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.960
 Why this possible Easter eggs is because this 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.519
 the sword is very much like a sight for a sniper rifle. 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.859
 At the same time, it may be Easter eggs because 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.140
 that the actor who voiced the Joker in the game is 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.219
 Mark Hammil, the one who played Luke Skywalker 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.849
 in the original trilogy and it can be so so 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.049
 by reference to this. 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.340
 There is a mention of Star Wars and in the old quest 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.129
 the game LukaArt Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road. 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.799
 Although it is not surprising. 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.709
 Probably in every game LukasArts is at least 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.290
 At least one reference to the famous film epic. 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.919
 All the same, this unit created by George himself 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.919
 Lucas. 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.350
 In general, after the initial screen saver in the game will go 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.129
 titles, during which the top and bottom will change 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.560
 different pictures. 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.620
 On one of these will be Sam, holding a gun, 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.729
 on which is written “What is my purpose? 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.250
 Call 1-800 Star Wars. " 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.539
 The next game is the first part of Dead Space. 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.250
 On the fourth chapter, "Ishimura" falls into a cloud of space 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.379
 debris and we need to restore the meteorite system 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.580
 protect the ship and activate the protective guns to shoot down 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.139
 asteroids and debris. 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.080
 Heading to the captain's bridge. 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.050
 There in the center you will see a big hologram of the planet. 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.580
 Take a closer look at it. 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.750
 This planet is very similar to a combat space station. 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.910
 - The Death Star. 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.531
 There is even something like a huge crater that 

00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.330
 depicts the Death Star energy weapon that 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.800
 destroys whole planets. 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.250
 A reference to Star Wars is in the game of the company Rareware 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.110
 for console Nintendo 64 - Conker's Bad Fur Day. 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.199
 When Conker first dies he gets into some afterlife 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.639
 the world where it first meets death named Gregg 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.450
 which explains that squirrels, like cats, cannot 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.530
 die once and tells how to get extra 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.530
 of life. 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.169
 But before that, as soon as Gregg appears he appears 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.729
 - “I am death by the name of Gregg,” to which Conker asks “And 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.169
 are you too small to be death? ” 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.470
 This is a parody of the phrase from “New Hope”, which 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.919
 pronounces in prison Leia when he sees Luke in a storm trooper costume 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.570
 “But aren't you too small to be an attack aircraft?” 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.139
 And finally, the last game on this Fallout list: 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.139
 New Vegas. 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.020
 The game has perk Wild Waste, activating that you 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.289
 will find a variety of strange easter eggs and references 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.349
 all over the world. 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.530
 One of these easter eggs will be in town 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.530
 Nipton 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.800
 There one of the burned down and destroyed houses lie 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.500
 two human skeletons. 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.479
 They were called Owen and Beru. 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.030
 Similarly, the names of uncle and aunt Luke Skywalker, 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.090
 in the fourth episode of “New Hope” they are killed by imperial 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.680
 stormtroopers, later near the house Luke finds them burnt down 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680
 body. 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.690
 If you like this release, share it with 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.300
 friends on social networks and do not forget to put 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.510
 Like, then I will know what you like and sometimes 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.789
 I can do these thematic videos. 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.820
 In the meantime, it was the last Easter eggs in the video, on what 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.689
 I will leave you until next week. 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.819
 Do not forget to subscribe to the channel to find out 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:25.929
 about the new commercials the very first.
