00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
to need a bit more redstone you also

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.110 
to need a bit more redstone you also
need<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:37.459> repeaters<00:02:38.500> dispensers<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:40.120> lever

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
need this repeaters dispensers a lever

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.040 
need this repeaters dispensers a lever
pressure<00:02:41.900> plate<00:02:42.230> or<00:02:42.410> button<00:02:43.280> I'm<00:02:43.870> guessing<00:02:44.870> a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
pressure plate or button I'm guessing a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.310 
pressure plate or button I'm guessing a
button<00:02:45.650> would<00:02:46.010> work<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.489> best<00:02:49.060> because<00:02:50.320> you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
button would work the best because you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.350 
button would work the best because you
know<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:52.190> got<00:02:52.310> its<00:02:52.459> reasons<00:02:52.820> for<00:02:53.060> working

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
know it's got its reasons for working

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.190 
know it's got its reasons for working
better<00:02:56.709> actually<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.830> won't<00:02:57.950> work<00:02:59.050> you<00:03:00.050> are

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
better actually that won't work you are

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.199 
better actually that won't work you are
right<00:03:00.350> anyone<00:03:01.280> who<00:03:01.400> figured<00:03:01.730> out<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.060> that

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
right anyone who figured out that that

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.740 
right anyone who figured out that that
won't<00:03:02.480> work<00:03:02.690> before<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.170> continued<00:03:04.750> the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
won't work before I continued the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.270 
won't work before I continued the
redstone<00:03:06.320> repeaters<00:03:06.680> here<00:03:06.830> let<00:03:06.980> me<00:03:07.040> just<00:03:07.190> show

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
redstone repeaters here let me just show

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.220 
redstone repeaters here let me just show
you<00:03:07.310> something<00:03:07.700> real<00:03:07.820> quick<00:03:07.880> on<00:03:08.120> them<00:03:08.269> see

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
you something real quick on them see

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.990 
you something real quick on them see
this<00:03:09.320> little<00:03:09.380> arrow<00:03:09.769> here<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.610> may<00:03:10.730> not<00:03:10.850> be

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
this little arrow here you may not be

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.160 
this little arrow here you may not be
able<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.209> see<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:11.420> there<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:11.810> an<00:03:11.930> arrow

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
able to see it but there is an arrow

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.650 
able to see it but there is an arrow
there<00:03:12.410> let<00:03:13.400> me<00:03:13.489> show<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.640> with<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.120> texture

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
there let me show you with a texture

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.210 
there let me show you with a texture
pack<00:03:14.840> on<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.260> shows<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.739> arrow<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.040> bit

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
pack on that shows the arrow a bit

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.539 
pack on that shows the arrow a bit
better<00:03:20.290> see<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.470> arrow<00:03:21.650> right<00:03:21.860> here<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
better see that arrow right here on the

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.810 
better see that arrow right here on the
side<00:03:22.989> if<00:03:23.989> i<00:03:24.290> start<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.010> red<00:03:25.220> stone<00:03:25.430> from<00:03:25.670> the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
side if i start the red stone from the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.910 
side if i start the red stone from the
side<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.420> will<00:03:26.630> carry<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.200> current<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
side this will carry the current the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.220 
side this will carry the current the
redstone<00:03:28.250> current<00:03:28.519> through<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.930> but<00:03:29.930> if<00:03:30.080> i

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
redstone current through it but if i

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.020 
redstone current through it but if i
start<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.920> side<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.340> will<00:03:31.489> not<00:03:31.730> carry

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
start it on the side it will not carry

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.589 
start it on the side it will not carry
the<00:03:32.299> current<00:03:32.630> through<00:03:33.910> so

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.720 

the<00:03:38.599> redstone<00:03:38.959> repeater<00:03:39.260> all<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.829> them<00:03:40.010> and

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
the redstone repeater all of them and

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.129 
the redstone repeater all of them and
the<00:03:40.879> redstone<00:03:41.150> clock<00:03:41.239> have<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.629> be<00:03:41.719> facing<00:03:41.959> the

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
the redstone clock have to be facing the

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.920 
the redstone clock have to be facing the
same<00:03:42.290> way<00:03:42.349> so<00:03:43.099> make<00:03:43.280> sure<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.819> arrows<00:03:44.269> go<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.689> a

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
same way so make sure the arrows go in a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.610 
same way so make sure the arrows go in a
circle<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:48.400> yeah<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:50.299> that's<00:03:50.659> that<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.109> need

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
circle and yeah so that's that I need

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.110 
circle and yeah so that's that I need
redstone<00:03:51.980> repeaters<00:03:52.400> back<00:03:54.849> let<00:03:55.849> me<00:03:55.939> switch

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
redstone repeaters back let me switch

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.660 
redstone repeaters back let me switch
back<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.599> default<00:03:57.109> texture<00:03:57.650> pack<00:03:57.799> oh<00:03:58.069> yeah

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
back to the default texture pack oh yeah

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.250 
back to the default texture pack oh yeah
now<00:03:58.849> you<00:03:58.909> can<00:03:59.090> switch<00:03:59.269> your<00:03:59.299> texture<00:03:59.810> packs<00:04:00.019> in

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
now you can switch your texture packs in

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.849 
now you can switch your texture packs in
game<00:04:00.530> it's<00:04:01.250> kind<00:04:01.430> of<00:04:01.549> helpful<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.620> I<00:04:03.650> have<00:04:03.799> a

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
game it's kind of helpful so I have a

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.890 
game it's kind of helpful so I have a
bit<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.069> a<00:04:04.159> cold<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:05.000> now<00:04:05.480> what<00:04:05.900> we<00:04:06.019> do<00:04:06.169> is<00:04:06.379> we

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
bit of a cold so now what we do is we

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.550 
bit of a cold so now what we do is we
extend<00:04:08.900> these<00:04:09.379> corners<00:04:09.799> sorry<00:04:10.579> sorry<00:04:11.120> I

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
extend these corners sorry sorry I

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.379 
extend these corners sorry sorry I
skipped<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.709> step<00:04:12.769> right<00:04:13.669> click<00:04:13.909> all<00:04:14.090> of<00:04:14.209> these

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
skipped a step right click all of these

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.689 
skipped a step right click all of these
until<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.230> one<00:04:15.379> that<00:04:15.560> moves<00:04:15.829> is<00:04:16.220> all<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.609> way

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
until the one that moves is all the way

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.490 
until the one that moves is all the way
in<00:04:16.789> the<00:04:16.880> back<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.660> arrow<00:04:19.900> there<00:04:20.900> we<00:04:20.989> go<00:04:21.079> now

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
in the back of the arrow there we go now

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.070 
in the back of the arrow there we go now
extend<00:04:21.919> all<00:04:22.130> four<00:04:22.849> of<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.300> corners<00:04:23.750> where<00:04:23.960> the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
extend all four of the corners where the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.430 
extend all four of the corners where the
redstone<00:04:24.979> is<00:04:25.009> like<00:04:25.970> like<00:04:26.449> so<00:04:28.960> do<00:04:29.960> not<00:04:30.080> connect

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
redstone is like like so do not connect

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.960 
redstone is like like so do not connect
them<00:04:30.680> just<00:04:31.639> put<00:04:31.820> them<00:04:31.940> like<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.919> then

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
them just put them like that and then

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.040 
them just put them like that and then
put<00:04:34.970> dispensers<00:04:35.930> at<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:37.490> end<00:04:37.729> of<00:04:38.090> all<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:38.690> them

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
put dispensers at the end of all of them

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.129 
put dispensers at the end of all of them
if<00:04:39.259> you<00:04:40.190> are<00:04:40.310> any<00:04:40.550> good<00:04:40.970> with<00:04:41.150> redstone<00:04:41.479> at<00:04:41.870> all

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
if you are any good with redstone at all

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.779 
if you are any good with redstone at all
then<00:04:42.680> you<00:04:42.830> probably<00:04:42.860> already<00:04:43.340> figured<00:04:43.490> out

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
then you probably already figured out

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.580 
then you probably already figured out
how<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.300> going<00:04:44.419> to<00:04:44.509> work<00:04:46.539> what<00:04:47.539> we<00:04:47.659> do<00:04:47.870> put

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
how this is going to work what we do put

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.379 
how this is going to work what we do put
a<00:04:48.650> lover<00:04:48.860> here<00:04:49.130> switch<00:04:49.759> it<00:04:49.789> then<00:04:50.060> destroy<00:04:50.360> it

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
a lover here switch it then destroy it

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.050 
a lover here switch it then destroy it
immediately<00:04:51.039> so<00:04:52.039> it<00:04:52.130> works<00:04:52.280> evenly<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:55.060> now

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
immediately so it works evenly and now

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:04.670 
immediately so it works evenly and now
we're<00:04:56.330> going<00:04:56.479> to<00:04:56.599> fill<00:04:57.500> these<00:04:57.770> with<00:04:58.030> arrows<00:05:00.849> so

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:14.340 

just<00:05:05.680> get<00:05:05.860> myself<00:05:06.040> a<00:05:06.310> bunch<00:05:06.490> of<00:05:06.610> arrows<00:05:06.880> oops

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.400 

that<00:05:15.010> should<00:05:15.190> be<00:05:15.310> enough<00:05:15.490> arrows<00:05:16.170> plop<00:05:17.170> some

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
that should be enough arrows plop some

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.880 
that should be enough arrows plop some
in<00:05:17.530> there<00:05:17.770> in<00:05:18.310> here<00:05:20.610> they're<00:05:21.610> just<00:05:22.710> pop<00:05:23.710> some

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
in there in here they're just pop some

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.000 
in there in here they're just pop some
arrows<00:05:24.250> or<00:05:24.490> fire<00:05:25.120> toward<00:05:25.450> charges<00:05:26.200> and<00:05:26.710> all<00:05:26.860> of

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
arrows or fire toward charges and all of

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.770 
arrows or fire toward charges and all of
them<00:05:27.130> oh<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.700> saw<00:05:27.910> that<00:05:28.030> creeper<00:05:28.300> coming<00:05:28.570> over<00:05:28.750> i

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
them oh I saw that creeper coming over i

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.880 
them oh I saw that creeper coming over i
thought<00:05:28.960> i<00:05:28.990> was<00:05:29.140> in<00:05:29.230> survival<00:05:29.590> mode<00:05:29.650> for
