00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.730
 from your point we're going to see how 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.400
 fix the problem that we always 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.290
 is when we understand entering a 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.290
 server collection replied true 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.539
 sometimes by the versions but there are two 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.539
 options 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.170
 of my attempts to discover what I did many 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170
 things 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.079

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.079
 entry arrangements 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.159

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.950
 this is called 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.050
 the two metals properties 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.640
 this will help the part is a part to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.149
 another part have to look for the file 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149
 be a virtue 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.300
 you can go with this name 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.010
 straight 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.590
 and see what it says 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.070

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.640

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.640
 and that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.920

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.400

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.030
 our brand 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:58.560

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.480

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.300

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.200
