00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.840
 on 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.520
 No 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.410
 question of trust 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.379
 the mood of fighters on the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.809
 he was down from his friend zac 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.970
 more than disappointed when they came to the 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.100
 He responded very well 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.550
 behavior 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.970

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.590

 like it's not with me all morning 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.770
 spake 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.320
 you could be the ruler of the reef 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.299
 the whole island 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.450
 I was hoping to get the trident 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.890
 back what are you doing instead amplified 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.970
 the back in the cave because he 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.619
 is dangerous 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.909
 you have seen let laila we go 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.850
 but only because they take it away from you 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.240
 she did not want you to have him 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.130
 and you what are you doing you get and 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.180
 do exactly what you want says something 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.190
 I do not care 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.330
 Do not give yourself to them with one 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.060
 can not trust him 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.799
 Get out of my way when I tell you that 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.500
 for me on the nose rum I tell you go 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.080
 out of my way 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.450
 the used combs the sec against 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.679
 the locker it like he would equal 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.020
 get violent 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.890
 but at that moment rita came around the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:00.409
 corner 42 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:02.960
 What is going on here when I stumble 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.020
 well maybe detain you guys 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.459
 yes again in equilibrium the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.920
 lunch break and no more trouble 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.080
 it was said 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.380
 stunned de has as the scene with 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.380
 Zach had to go to the office with Rita 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.910
 I assume that had something with the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.660
 trident to do is not important all 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.370
 under control 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.630
 I know maybe not all 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.480
 Excited that you brought him back 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.440
 but you did the right thing 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.440
 That was certainly not easy
