00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
bulb with bluetooth audio as you can see

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.700 
bulb with bluetooth audio as you can see
it's<00:00:12.540> really<00:00:12.809> quite<00:00:12.960> big<00:00:13.170> compared<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.620> my

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
it's really quite big compared to my

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.650 
it's really quite big compared to my
fist<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.219> literally<00:00:14.759> fist-sized<00:00:15.330> I've<00:00:15.509> got

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
fist it's literally fist-sized I've got

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.750

big hands I'm quite tall and that is a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.599 
big hands I'm quite tall and that is a
massive<00:00:18.119> bulb<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.650> an<00:00:19.710> edison<00:00:20.160> screw

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
massive bulb it's got an edison screw

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.140 
massive bulb it's got an edison screw
fitting<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:22.189> that'll<00:00:23.189> fit<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> lot<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.789> desk

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
fitting so that'll fit in a lot of desk

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.720 
fitting so that'll fit in a lot of desk

two<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> floor<00:00:27.420> lamp<00:00:27.539> soon<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
two in in a floor lamp soon and the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.089 
two in in a floor lamp soon and the
speaker<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:30.210> 2.4<00:00:31.109> what<00:00:31.410> single<00:00:31.830> driver

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
speaker is a 2.4 what single driver

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.620 
speaker is a 2.4 what single driver
speaker<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.600> has<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> frequency<00:00:34.380> response<00:00:35.190> of

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
speaker it has a frequency response of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.560 
speaker it has a frequency response of
3617<00:00:36.630> kilohertz<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.460> sound<00:00:39.120> quality<00:00:39.329> from

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
3617 kilohertz so the sound quality from

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.200 
3617 kilohertz so the sound quality from
this<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.020> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.680> par<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.760> sort

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
this is going to be on par with a sort

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
this is going to be on par with a sort
of<00:00:42.350> lower<00:00:43.579> range<00:00:44.579> ipod<00:00:45.390> dock<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.770> 9<00:00:47.129> watt

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
of lower range ipod dock it's a 9 watt

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
of lower range ipod dock it's a 9 watt
bulb<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.719> when<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> bulb<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
bulb and so when it's just a bulb is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
bulb and so when it's just a bulb is
only<00:00:49.710> 9<00:00:49.950> watt<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.670> quite<00:00:51.000> low<00:00:51.210> for

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
only 9 watt which is quite low for

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.049 
only 9 watt which is quite low for
energy<00:00:52.079> saving<00:00:52.640> for<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> energy-saving

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
energy saving for the energy-saving

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.930 
energy saving for the energy-saving
conscious<00:00:54.719> amongst<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.550> comes<00:00:56.850> with

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
conscious amongst you and it comes with

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.389
