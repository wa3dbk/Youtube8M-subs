length of your necklace for an 18 inch

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.240 
length of your necklace for an 18 inch
necklace<00:00:46.900> you<00:00:47.900> would<00:00:48.050> measure<00:00:48.290> out<00:00:48.530> 18<00:00:48.980> inches

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
necklace you would measure out 18 inches

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.670 
necklace you would measure out 18 inches
and<00:00:49.489> double<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.149> 36<00:00:50.719> inches<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.410> I<00:00:51.500> would

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
and double that so 36 inches and I would

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.220 
and double that so 36 inches and I would
add<00:00:51.890> about<00:00:52.070> 4<00:00:52.520> or<00:00:52.640> 5<00:00:52.789> inches<00:00:53.030> more<00:00:53.449> on<00:00:53.690> that<00:00:53.930> and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
add about 4 or 5 inches more on that and

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.860 
add about 4 or 5 inches more on that and
what<00:00:54.559> this<00:00:54.710> will<00:00:54.920> do<00:00:55.160> is<00:00:55.460> basically<00:00:56.359> when<00:00:56.780> you

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
what this will do is basically when you

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.170 
what this will do is basically when you
use<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.079> slide<00:00:57.500> knot<00:00:57.769> you're<00:00:58.010> doubling<00:00:58.789> the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
use a slide knot you're doubling the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.569 
use a slide knot you're doubling the
leather<00:00:59.559> and<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:00.800> that's<00:01:01.039> why<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.250> went<00:01:01.519> ahead

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
leather and so that's why I went ahead

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.580 
leather and so that's why I went ahead
and<00:01:01.730> doubled<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.359> measurement<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.140> added<00:01:03.500> a

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
and doubled the measurement and added a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.320 
and doubled the measurement and added a
few<00:01:03.620> inches<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.129> added<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.610> few<00:01:04.640> inches<00:01:05.059> for<00:01:05.300> the

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
few inches I added a few inches for the

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.550 
few inches I added a few inches for the
knots<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.810> we're<00:01:05.960> going<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.110> have<00:01:06.289> on<00:01:06.440> the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.920 
it through the coils and tighten now the
more<00:04:28.460> times<00:04:28.700> you<00:04:28.850> cool<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.210> around<00:04:29.480> here<00:04:29.750> then

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
more times you cool it around here then

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
and I made this one too just for a

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.760 
and I made this one too just for a
demonstration<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:36.020> would<00:04:36.170> want<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.470> do<00:04:36.590> them

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
however many times you wrap that around

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.550 
however many times you wrap that around
is<00:04:41.240> how<00:04:41.510> many<00:04:41.690> of<00:04:41.750> these<00:04:41.900> little<00:04:41.960> coils<00:04:42.470> that

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
is how many of these little coils that

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.840 
is how many of these little coils that

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
and pushing up on the knot and this is

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.560 
and pushing up on the knot and this is
what<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.160> will<00:05:04.280> do<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.670> so<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.180> makes<00:05:05.390> an

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
what it will do and so it makes an

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.220 
what it will do and so it makes an
adjustable<00:05:06.520> necklace<00:05:07.520> or<00:05:07.970> chain<00:05:08.330> just<00:05:09.020> by
