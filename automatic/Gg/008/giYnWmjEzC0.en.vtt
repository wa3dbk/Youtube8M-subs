even use yet also I don't even think

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.179 
even use yet also I don't even think
you'd<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.259> able<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.040> these

you'd be able to do one of these
bounties<00:01:32.640> at<00:01:32.880> level<00:01:33.360> 20<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.990> how

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
bounties at level 20 because of how

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020

difficult<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.670> guess<00:01:35.880> I'll

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
difficult they can be and I guess I'll

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.749 
difficult they can be and I guess I'll
hop<00:01:36.240> into<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> part<00:01:36.869> next<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:38.250> far<00:01:38.640> as

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
hop into that part next here as far as

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.880 
hop into that part next here as far as
the<00:01:38.880> difficulty<00:01:39.329> goes<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.780> these<00:01:39.900> because

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the difficulty goes for these because

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.530 
the difficulty goes for these because
they<00:01:41.070> guarantee<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.670> an<00:01:41.759> exotic<00:01:42.150> weapon<00:01:42.420> at

they guarantee you an exotic weapon at

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.840 
they guarantee you an exotic weapon at
the<00:01:42.630> end<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.259> pretty<00:01:43.590> difficult<00:01:43.890> they

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the end they are pretty difficult they

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
the end they are pretty difficult they
involve<00:01:45.450> some<00:01:45.659> pretty<00:01:45.869> tedious<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
involve some pretty tedious and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
involve some pretty tedious and
frustrating<00:01:46.640> tasks<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
frustrating tasks and it's not like a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.969 
frustrating tasks and it's not like a
normal<00:01:48.570> bounty<00:01:49.200> where<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.950> thing
