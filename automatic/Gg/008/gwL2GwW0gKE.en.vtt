it keeps pH

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.420 
it keeps pH
right<00:02:20.610> because<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.300> keeps<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.629> body<00:02:21.810> alkaline

when<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.550> eat<00:02:23.760> anything<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.480> animal<00:02:24.930> origin

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
when we eat anything of animal origin

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.860 
when we eat anything of animal origin
it's<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:26.340> everything<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.120> animal<00:02:27.450> origin<00:02:27.599> is

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
it's all everything of animal origin is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.500 
it's all everything of animal origin is
very<00:02:28.050> acidic<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:29.400> by<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.640> way<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.849> soda<00:02:30.269> pop

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
very acidic and by the way a soda pop

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.960 
very acidic and by the way a soda pop
has<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.470> highest<00:02:31.890> acidity<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.400> anything<00:02:32.879> we

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
has the highest acidity of anything we

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.119 
has the highest acidity of anything we
can<00:02:33.120> put<00:02:33.239> into<00:02:33.420> our<00:02:33.510> body<00:02:33.780> pH<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.500> about<00:02:34.590> three

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
can put into our body pH of about three

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.839 
can put into our body pH of about three
and<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.650> created<00:02:38.250> an<00:02:38.370> acidic

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
and so now we have created an acidic

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.250 
and so now we have created an acidic
condition<00:02:39.330> within<00:02:39.629> our<00:02:39.750> body<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.110> our<00:02:40.200> body

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
condition within our body and our body

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.930 
condition within our body and our body
can't<00:02:40.650> function<00:02:40.890> properly<00:02:41.099> in<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.670> highly

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
can't function properly in a highly

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.240 
can't function properly in a highly
acidic<00:02:42.180> atmosphere<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.769> body<00:02:43.950> has<00:02:44.069> to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
acidic atmosphere so the body has to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.640 
acidic atmosphere so the body has to
find<00:02:44.580> some<00:02:44.910> way<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.150> neutralize<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:45.930> acidity

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
find some way to neutralize that acidity

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.680 
find some way to neutralize that acidity
and<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.920> most<00:02:47.400> alkaline<00:02:47.849> substance<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
and the most alkaline substance and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.050 
and the most alkaline substance and
greatest<00:02:49.080> quantity<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.500> calcium<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.849> body

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
greatest quantity is calcium so the body

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.580 
greatest quantity is calcium so the body
literally<00:02:51.450> starts<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:52.049> into<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.380> bones

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
literally starts going into the bones

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.229 
literally starts going into the bones
and<00:02:52.860> into<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.190> teeth<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.579> extracting<00:02:54.120> the

and into the teeth and extracting the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.150 
and into the teeth and extracting the
calcium<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.750> neutralize<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.470> acidity<00:02:55.829> caused

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
calcium to neutralize the acidity caused

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.740 
calcium to neutralize the acidity caused
by<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.430> consuming<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.120> animal<00:02:57.420> products
