thing about surfboards these days is

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.380 
thing about surfboards these days is
they<00:02:44.319> do<00:02:44.380> come<00:02:44.860> with<00:02:45.040> not<00:02:45.760> all<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.000> brands<00:02:46.239> but

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
they do come with not all the brands but

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.910 
they do come with not all the brands but
a<00:02:46.480> lot<00:02:46.630> on<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.810> putting<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.140> cubic<00:02:47.440> volume<00:02:47.769> on

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
a lot on the putting the cubic volume on

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.410 
a lot on the putting the cubic volume on
the<00:02:48.160> liter<00:02:48.370> edge<00:02:48.549> on<00:02:48.700> them<00:02:48.819> which<00:02:48.970> makes<00:02:49.239> it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the liter edge on them which makes it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.500 
the liter edge on them which makes it
quite<00:02:49.630> easy<00:02:49.870> for<00:02:50.670> for<00:02:51.670> me<00:02:51.819> it's<00:02:52.120> easier<00:02:52.480> for

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
quite easy for for me it's easier for

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.910 
quite easy for for me it's easier for
the<00:02:52.720> customer<00:02:53.140> actually<00:02:53.319> because<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:53.829> they

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the customer actually because then they

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.470 
the customer actually because then they
can<00:02:54.099> relate<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.549> lot<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.790> always<00:02:55.060> had<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.269> bit

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
can relate to a lot of always had a bit

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.050 
can relate to a lot of always had a bit
