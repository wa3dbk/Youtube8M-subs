the fit if you'll pardon the pun off the
backbeat<00:01:47.130> fit<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.729> reasonably<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:48.360> I'm

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
backbeat fit is reasonably good I'm

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.810 
backbeat fit is reasonably good I'm
usually<00:01:49.530> stuck<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:50.159> over<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> ear<00:01:50.579> type

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
usually stuck with over the ear type

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.280 
usually stuck with over the ear type
buds<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.659> won't<00:01:51.840> sit<00:01:52.079> nicely

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
buds because they just won't sit nicely

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740 
buds because they just won't sit nicely
on<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> ears<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> backbeat<00:01:54.149> stayed

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
on the ears but here the backbeat stayed

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
on the ears but here the backbeat stayed
comfortable<00:01:55.259> over<00:01:55.409> several<00:01:55.649> hours<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.070> mixed

comfortable over several hours of mixed
activity<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.909> did<00:01:57.899> notice<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> rear<00:01:58.619> cable

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
activity I did notice the rear cable

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.350 
activity I did notice the rear cable
rubbing<00:01:59.460> against<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> back<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> my<00:02:00.180> neck

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
rubbing against the back of my neck

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.569 
rubbing against the back of my neck
after<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.780> while<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.200> direct<00:02:01.409> Sun<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.009> I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
after a while in the direct Sun and I

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
after a while in the direct Sun and I
can<00:02:02.729> imagine<00:02:03.090> over<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.360> longer<00:02:03.630> span<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.079> time

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
can imagine over a longer span of time

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.630 
can imagine over a longer span of time
that<00:02:04.409> might<00:02:04.649> become<00:02:04.829> more<00:02:05.189> irritating<00:02:05.549> but

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that might become more irritating but

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.490 
that might become more irritating but
again<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.450> bank<00:02:06.630> baits<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.899> are<00:02:07.020> highly

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
again the bank baits that are highly

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.389 
again the bank baits that are highly
unique<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:08.039> this

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
unique in this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.699 
unique in this
it's<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> neat<00:02:09.569> trick<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.170> carrying<00:02:10.500> case

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
it's a neat trick that the carrying case

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.290 
it's a neat trick that the carrying case
of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> buds<00:02:11.129> also<00:02:11.459> doubles<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:11.879> an<00:02:12.000> arm

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
of the buds also doubles as an arm

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.930 
of the buds also doubles as an arm
carrying<00:02:12.870> case<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.010> very<00:02:14.460> bright<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
carrying case but it is very bright and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.420 
carrying case but it is very bright and
it<00:02:15.300> won't<00:02:15.570> suit<00:02:15.780> extroverts<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.590> also<00:02:17.040> wonder

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
it won't suit extroverts I also wonder

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.010 
it won't suit extroverts I also wonder
