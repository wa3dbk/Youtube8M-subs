the<00:00:19.119> others<00:00:19.509> it<00:00:19.960> just<00:00:20.259> doesn't<00:00:20.560> belong<00:00:20.980> but

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
the others it just doesn't belong but

the others it just doesn't belong but
you<00:00:21.910> know<00:00:22.029> if<00:00:22.150> I<00:00:22.270> could<00:00:22.420> set<00:00:22.600> my<00:00:22.720> class<00:00:22.900> up<00:00:23.110> this

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
you know if I could set my class up this

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.380 
you know if I could set my class up this
way<00:00:23.440> I<00:00:23.650> might<00:00:24.430> do<00:00:24.609> it<00:00:24.699> occasionally<00:00:24.940> is<00:00:25.270> this

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
way I might do it occasionally is this

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.080 
way I might do it occasionally is this
seems<00:00:25.869> like<00:00:25.930> a<00:00:26.020> pretty<00:00:26.260> good<00:00:26.410> setup

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
seems like a pretty good setup

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.700 
seems like a pretty good setup
nonetheless<00:00:28.090> it<00:00:28.240> got<00:00:28.539> me<00:00:28.689> thinking<00:00:29.050> what

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
nonetheless it got me thinking what

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.040 
nonetheless it got me thinking what
would<00:00:29.859> you<00:00:30.010> do<00:00:30.220> if<00:00:30.490> you<00:00:30.760> could<00:00:30.970> select<00:00:31.240> any<00:00:31.570> gun

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
would you do if you could select any gun

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.100 
would you do if you could select any gun
any<00:00:32.349> first<00:00:32.710> second<00:00:33.309> gadget<00:00:33.670> you<00:00:33.790> want<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.110> what

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
any first second gadget you want it what

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.899 
any first second gadget you want it what
would<00:00:35.260> people<00:00:35.410> use<00:00:35.710> wood<00:00:36.129> something<00:00:36.610> become

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:36.909 
would people use wood something become

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.850 
would people use wood something become
overpowered<00:00:37.750> because<00:00:38.229> you<00:00:38.379> could<00:00:38.559> use<00:00:38.830> a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
overpowered because you could use a

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.170 
overpowered because you could use a
different<00:00:39.309> combination<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.030> game

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
different combination and the game

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.420 
different combination and the game
already<00:00:40.390> lets<00:00:40.659> you<00:00:40.839> owed<00:00:41.559> it<00:00:41.920> just<00:00:42.100> make<00:00:42.309> it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
already lets you owed it just make it

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.100 
already lets you owed it just make it
even<00:00:42.580> more<00:00:42.670> painfully<00:00:43.420> obvious<00:00:43.570> that<00:00:43.989> the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
even more painfully obvious that the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.189 
even more painfully obvious that the
defibrillators<00:00:44.979> are<00:00:45.159> the<00:00:45.820> most<00:00:46.199> overpowered

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
defibrillators are the most overpowered

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.969 
defibrillators are the most overpowered
thing<00:00:47.589> in<00:00:47.739> this<00:00:47.890> game<00:00:48.250> this<00:00:48.790> clip<00:00:49.120> is

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
thing in this game this clip is

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.789 
thing in this game this clip is
ridiculous<00:00:50.979> on<00:00:51.159> so<00:00:51.489> many<00:00:51.670> levels<00:00:51.790> but<00:00:52.210> ya<00:00:53.080> know

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:53.799 
ridiculous on so many levels but ya know

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:55.020 
ridiculous on so many levels but ya know
anyway<00:00:54.250> that's<00:00:54.460> what<00:00:54.580> I<00:00:54.640> want<00:00:54.790> to<00:00:54.850> talk<00:00:55.000> about

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
anyway that's what I want to talk about

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.359 
anyway that's what I want to talk about
somewhat<00:00:55.900> coldly<00:00:56.530> inspired<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.100> could<00:00:57.220> say

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:57.369 
somewhat coldly inspired you could say

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.189 
somewhat coldly inspired you could say
but<00:00:57.400> really<00:00:57.850> it's<00:00:58.059> just<00:00:58.330> asking<00:00:58.750> how<00:00:58.780> does

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
but really it's just asking how does

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.320 
but really it's just asking how does
this<00:00:59.290> balance<00:00:59.680> actually<00:01:00.010> work<00:01:00.220> what<00:01:01.150> would<00:01:01.299> it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
this balance actually work what would it

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.479 
this balance actually work what would it
be<00:01:01.420> like<00:01:01.540> if<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.140> could<00:01:02.350> create<00:01:02.769> a<00:01:02.890> class<00:01:03.190> in

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
be like if you could create a class in

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.620 
be like if you could create a class in
battlefield<00:01:04.420> 3<00:01:04.590> i'm<00:01:05.590> sorry<00:01:06.369> puppy<00:01:06.820> no<00:01:07.270> scopes

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
battlefield 3 i'm sorry puppy no scopes

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.370 
battlefield 3 i'm sorry puppy no scopes
for<00:01:07.750> everyone<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.899> first<00:01:11.079> thing<00:01:11.229> that

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
for everyone so the first thing that

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.749 
for everyone so the first thing that
comes<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.799> mind<00:01:12.009> it<00:01:12.340> could<00:01:12.430> be<00:01:12.549> just

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
comes to mind it could be just

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.730 
comes to mind it could be just
absolutely<00:01:13.140> ridiculous<00:01:14.140> would<00:01:14.320> be<00:01:14.439> so

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
absolutely ridiculous would be so

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.130 
absolutely ridiculous would be so
flammable<00:01:14.799> one<00:01:15.490> with<00:01:16.149> those<00:01:16.299> occupy<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.840> same

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
flammable one with those occupy the same

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.109 
flammable one with those occupy the same
gadgets<00:01:17.619> lot<00:01:17.859> so<00:01:18.189> it<00:01:18.490> wouldn't<00:01:18.789> be<00:01:18.850> an<00:01:19.000> issue

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
gadgets lot so it wouldn't be an issue

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.969 
gadgets lot so it wouldn't be an issue
you<00:01:19.719> still<00:01:20.020> have<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.259> find<00:01:20.439> someone<00:01:20.770> else

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
you still have to find someone else

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.529 
you still have to find someone else
who's<00:01:21.280> willing<00:01:21.579> to<00:01:21.609> spawn<00:01:21.909> in<00:01:22.060> with<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.359> other

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
who's willing to spawn in with the other

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.630 
who's willing to spawn in with the other
side<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.079> that<00:01:23.259> combination<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:24.310> order<00:01:24.549> to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
side of that combination in order to

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.789 
side of that combination in order to
make<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:24.789> work<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.439> got<00:01:26.590> things

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
make it work and then you got things

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.919 
make it work and then you got things
like<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.310> med<00:01:27.490> kit<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.000> ammo<00:01:28.450> pack<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:28.899> I

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
like the med kit and the ammo pack and I

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.169 
like the med kit and the ammo pack and I
really<00:01:29.649> don't<00:01:29.829> see<00:01:29.890> how<00:01:30.039> letting<00:01:30.759> any<00:01:30.909> class

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
really don't see how letting any class

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.870 
really don't see how letting any class
have<00:01:31.450> those<00:01:31.689> to<00:01:31.869> be<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.049> serious<00:01:32.740> issue<00:01:32.920> if<00:01:33.759> you

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
have those to be a serious issue if you

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.880 
have those to be a serious issue if you
already<00:01:34.060> assume<00:01:34.659> that<00:01:34.990> you'll<00:01:35.469> be<00:01:35.619> able<00:01:35.710> to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
already assume that you'll be able to

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.739 
already assume that you'll be able to
find<00:01:36.159> one<00:01:36.520> most<00:01:36.789> of<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:36.999> time<00:01:37.179> and<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.600> just

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
find one most of the time and it just

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.989 
find one most of the time and it just
can<00:01:38.200> possibly<00:01:38.829> take<00:01:38.950> away<00:01:39.369> from<00:01:39.640> or<00:01:39.820> maybe

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
can possibly take away from or maybe

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.599 
can possibly take away from or maybe
make<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.749> worse<00:01:40.899> if<00:01:41.530> trying<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:41.979> find<00:01:42.219> some<00:01:42.460> guy

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
make it worse if trying to find some guy

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.560 
make it worse if trying to find some guy
who<00:01:42.670> has<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.210> mo<00:01:43.539> Oh<00:01:44.670> again<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:45.939> just<00:01:45.969> expect<00:01:46.420> to

who has a mo Oh again you just expect to

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.630 
who has a mo Oh again you just expect to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
find those packs just laying around on

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.609

the ground and you know maybe they don't
even<00:01:50.770> belong<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.130> your<00:01:51.249> team<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.780> hey<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:52.840> if

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
even belong to your team and hey so if

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.709 
even belong to your team and hey so if
you<00:01:53.619> can<00:01:53.799> have<00:01:53.979> one<00:01:54.219> yourself<00:01:54.670> as<00:01:55.299> opposed<00:01:55.600> to

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
you can have one yourself as opposed to

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.779 
you can have one yourself as opposed to
finding<00:01:56.049> someone<00:01:56.289> else<00:01:56.469> who<00:01:56.590> has<00:01:56.799> one<00:01:57.009> it's

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
finding someone else who has one it's

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.849 
finding someone else who has one it's
not<00:01:58.210> going<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.509> make<00:01:58.659> a<00:01:58.869> serious<00:01:59.380> shift<00:01:59.710> in<00:01:59.829> the

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
not going to make a serious shift in the

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.129 
not going to make a serious shift in the
balance<00:01:59.920> of<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.280> game<00:02:00.460> unless<00:02:01.149> you<00:02:01.630> have<00:02:01.659> like

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
balance of the game unless you have like

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:03.870 
balance of the game unless you have like
I<00:02:02.350> think<00:02:02.560> it's<00:02:02.649> bad<00:02:02.799> company<00:02:03.189> two<00:02:03.369> was<00:02:03.670> where

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
I think it's bad company two was where

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.510 
I think it's bad company two was where
you<00:02:04.450> had<00:02:04.600> ammo<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.319> noob<00:02:05.619> tubes<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.310> could

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
you had ammo and noob tubes that could

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.490 
you had ammo and noob tubes that could
get<00:02:06.639> annoying<00:02:06.759> what's<00:02:07.600> still<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.110> reload

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
get annoying what's still the reload

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.499 
get annoying what's still the reload
time

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
time

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.080

that includes the RPG and small reload
time<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.810> he<00:02:13.019> get<00:02:13.140> annoying<00:02:13.409> but<00:02:13.739> more<00:02:14.310> or

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
time and he get annoying but more or

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.670

less<00:02:14.519> keeps<00:02:14.760> them<00:02:14.939> from<00:02:15.060> being<00:02:15.239> spammed<00:02:15.720> even

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
less keeps them from being spammed even

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.130 
less keeps them from being spammed even
if<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:16.920> had<00:02:17.159> a<00:02:17.370> sniper<00:02:17.909> sitting<00:02:18.599> hundreds<00:02:19.049> of

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
if you had a sniper sitting hundreds of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.030 
if you had a sniper sitting hundreds of
meters<00:02:19.409> away<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> med<00:02:20.189> kit<00:02:20.870> yeah<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.560> could

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
meters away with a med kit yeah it could

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.309 
meters away with a med kit yeah it could
be<00:02:23.069> more<00:02:23.549> difficult<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.000> take<00:02:24.239> him<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.480> at<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
be more difficult to take him out at the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.660 
be more difficult to take him out at the
same<00:02:25.470> time<00:02:25.709> probably<00:02:26.069> gonna<00:02:26.250> need<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.579> get

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
same time probably gonna need to get

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.819 
same time probably gonna need to get
another<00:02:26.849> sniper<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.510> headshot<00:02:28.049> that<00:02:28.290> camping

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
another sniper and headshot that camping

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.119 
another sniper and headshot that camping
asshole<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.930> him<00:02:31.140> having<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.530> med<00:02:31.709> kit<00:02:31.739> and

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
asshole and so him having a med kit and

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.670 
asshole and so him having a med kit and
be<00:02:32.220> able<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.489> camp<00:02:32.879> there<00:02:33.209> yeah<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.049> guess<00:02:34.470> it's

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
be able to camp there yeah I guess it's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.300 
be able to camp there yeah I guess it's
not<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.280> biggest<00:02:35.700> game<00:02:36.060> breaker<00:02:37.310> honestly

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
not the biggest game breaker honestly

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.789 
not the biggest game breaker honestly
the<00:02:38.579> biggest<00:02:38.909> issue<00:02:39.390> with<00:02:39.689> this<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.079> could<00:02:40.590> see

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
the biggest issue with this I could see

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.099 
the biggest issue with this I could see
would<00:02:41.459> be<00:02:41.609> that<00:02:41.790> no<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.209> would<00:02:42.359> have<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.599> reason

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
would be that no one would have a reason

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.780 
would be that no one would have a reason
to<00:02:43.230> run<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.530> engineer<00:02:43.950> weapons<00:02:44.310> anymore<00:02:44.549> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
to run the engineer weapons anymore the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.509 
to run the engineer weapons anymore the
carbons<00:02:45.290> because<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.500> assault<00:02:46.829> rifles<00:02:47.250> are

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
carbons because the assault rifles are

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.030 
carbons because the assault rifles are
simply<00:02:48.150> better<00:02:48.420> or<00:02:49.139> pretty<00:02:49.440> much<00:02:49.500> every

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
simply better or pretty much every

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.280 
simply better or pretty much every
reason<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.489> far<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.819> i<00:02:50.940> know<00:02:51.000> i<00:02:51.389> do<00:02:51.870> more<00:02:52.079> damage

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
reason as far as i know i do more damage

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.059 
reason as far as i know i do more damage
and<00:02:53.299> okay<00:02:54.299> yeah<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.260> basically<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.799> that

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
and okay yeah it's basically just that

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.949 
and okay yeah it's basically just that
they<00:02:56.190> do<00:02:56.250> more<00:02:56.579> damage<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:57.060> deal<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:57.569> four

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
they do more damage you deal with four

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.649 
they do more damage you deal with four
shot<00:02:58.170> kills<00:02:58.409> up<00:02:58.560> close<00:02:58.739> instead<00:02:59.069> of<00:02:59.190> five

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
shot kills up close instead of five

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.539 
shot kills up close instead of five
what's<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.840> argue<00:03:01.139> with<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.190> guess

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
what's the argue with that so I guess

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.849 
what's the argue with that so I guess
that'd<00:03:02.819> be<00:03:02.849> an<00:03:03.090> entire<00:03:03.510> category<00:03:04.109> of<00:03:04.409> weapons

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
that'd be an entire category of weapons

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.559 
that'd be an entire category of weapons
that<00:03:04.950> people<00:03:05.310> would<00:03:05.489> be<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:05.970> oh<00:03:06.030> it's

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
that people would be like oh it's

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.080 
that people would be like oh it's
underpowered<00:03:07.049> everybody<00:03:08.010> can<00:03:08.190> use<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.489> m16

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
underpowered everybody can use the m16

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.149 
underpowered everybody can use the m16
now<00:03:09.480> or<00:03:09.690> what<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.260> popular<00:03:10.829> one<00:03:10.980> now<00:03:11.099> the

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
now or what is the popular one now the

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.059 
now or what is the popular one now the
416<00:03:11.909> now<00:03:12.540> everybody<00:03:13.109> can<00:03:13.290> use<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> same<00:03:13.799> gun

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
416 now everybody can use the same gun

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.689 
416 now everybody can use the same gun
that<00:03:14.810> could<00:03:15.810> get<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.079> little<00:03:16.500> old<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.069> yet<00:03:17.250> they

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
that could get a little old and yet they

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.759 
that could get a little old and yet they
people<00:03:18.030> now<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.049> fairly<00:03:19.319> good<00:03:19.560> between

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
people now it's is fairly good between

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.650 
people now it's is fairly good between
the<00:03:20.040> guns<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.400> battlefield<00:03:20.849> so<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
the guns and battlefield so if you

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.720 
the guns and battlefield so if you
wanted<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.109> run<00:03:22.260> something<00:03:22.290> else<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:23.010> guess<00:03:23.579> you

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
wanted to run something else I guess you

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.689 
wanted to run something else I guess you
could<00:03:23.879> put<00:03:23.910> me<00:03:24.470> personally<00:03:25.470> I'd<00:03:25.650> run<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:26.250> SKS

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
could put me personally I'd run the SKS

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.259 
could put me personally I'd run the SKS
a<00:03:26.940> whole<00:03:27.239> lot<00:03:27.449> more<00:03:28.310> now<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.370> could<00:03:29.849> say<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
a whole lot more now you could say this

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.659 
a whole lot more now you could say this
is<00:03:30.329> making<00:03:30.629> it<00:03:30.840> more<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.169> coal<00:03:31.410> duty<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.010> in

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
is making it more like coal duty and in

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.970 
is making it more like coal duty and in
some<00:03:32.970> kind<00:03:33.329> of<00:03:33.389> right<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.260> get<00:03:34.650> battlefield

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
some kind of right but I get battlefield

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.619 
some kind of right but I get battlefield
more<00:03:35.280> credit<00:03:35.549> than<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.699> is<00:03:36.180> your<00:03:36.359> choosing

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
more credit than that is your choosing

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.960 
more credit than that is your choosing
between<00:03:36.840> things<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.349> are<00:03:37.440> fairly

between things that are fairly
incomparable<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.599> you<00:03:39.660> got<00:03:39.870> even

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
incomparable you know you got even

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.599 
incomparable you know you got even
within<00:03:40.349> the<00:03:40.680> engineer<00:03:41.069> class<00:03:41.190> you've<00:03:41.430> got

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
within the engineer class you've got

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.000 
within the engineer class you've got
choices<00:03:41.879> between<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.959> repair<00:03:43.319> tool<00:03:43.530> which

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
choices between the repair tool which

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.819 
choices between the repair tool which
can<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.459> used<00:03:44.609> offensively<00:03:44.970> or<00:03:45.389> the<00:03:46.199> 18<00:03:46.530> months

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
can be used offensively or the 18 months

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.830 
can be used offensively or the 18 months
which<00:03:46.980> are<00:03:47.129> pretty<00:03:47.310> much<00:03:47.549> as<00:03:48.150> simply<00:03:48.780> a

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
which are pretty much as simply a

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.589 
which are pretty much as simply a
defensive<00:03:49.680> tool<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.519> be<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.090> oh<00:03:51.239> that's<00:03:51.510> a

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
defensive tool and be like oh that's a

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.990 
defensive tool and be like oh that's a
tough<00:03:51.870> choice<00:03:51.949> except<00:03:52.949> that<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.669> really

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
tough choice except that you really

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.789 
tough choice except that you really
normally<00:03:54.510> only<00:03:54.629> want<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.930> 18<00:03:55.319> minds<00:03:55.680> on

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
normally only want the 18 minds on

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.479 
normally only want the 18 minds on
defense<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.609> Rush<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:58.079> repair<00:03:58.440> tool<00:03:58.709> you

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
defense on Rush and the repair tool you

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.640 
defense on Rush and the repair tool you
normally<00:03:59.849> want<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.269> offense<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:00.810> maybe

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
normally want that on offense and maybe

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.199 
normally want that on offense and maybe
on<00:04:01.829> defense<00:04:02.190> too<00:04:02.370> if<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.579> can<00:04:02.879> manage<00:04:03.060> to

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
on defense too if you can manage to

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.240 
on defense too if you can manage to

style but a lot of them
you<00:04:23.340> know<00:04:23.460> why<00:04:23.790> would<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.180> want<00:04:24.480> a<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:24.840> fly

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
you know why would you want a so fly

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.260 
you know why would you want a so fly
them<00:04:25.290> if<00:04:25.500> there<00:04:26.250> weren't<00:04:26.490> vehicles<00:04:26.970> around

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
laser pointer yeah no I I don't know it

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.990 
laser pointer yeah no I I don't know it
would<00:04:34.140> eliminate<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:35.130> lot<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.370> options<00:04:35.790> but<00:04:35.940> I

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
would eliminate a lot of options but I

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.030 
would eliminate a lot of options but I
don't<00:04:36.210> see<00:04:36.420> many<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.690> them<00:04:36.870> as<00:04:37.080> being<00:04:37.350> options

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
don't see many of them as being options

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.190 
don't see many of them as being options
to<00:04:38.220> start<00:04:38.520> with<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:39.360> real<00:04:39.510> question<00:04:39.780> is<00:04:39.840> would

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
to start with the real question is would

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.490 
to start with the real question is would
it<00:04:40.260> make<00:04:40.710> more<00:04:41.280> options<00:04:41.850> Oh<00:04:42.030> in<00:04:42.960> general<00:04:43.380> the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
it make more options Oh in general the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.560 
it make more options Oh in general the
two<00:04:43.770> big<00:04:44.010> glasses<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.550> see<00:04:44.730> all<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.060> time<00:04:45.270> our

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
assault on infantry heavy maps and yeah

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.700 
assault on infantry heavy maps and yeah
the<00:04:48.390> assault<00:04:48.660> rifle<00:04:48.960> is<00:04:49.050> awesome<00:04:49.410> but<00:04:49.560> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
the assault rifle is awesome but the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.190 
the assault rifle is awesome but the
defibs<00:04:50.160> are<00:04:50.430> even<00:04:50.790> more<00:04:51.120> amazing<00:04:51.630> so<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:52.020> can

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
defibs are even more amazing so you can

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.070 
defibs are even more amazing so you can
see<00:04:52.380> lots<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.890> defibrillator<00:04:53.400> still<00:04:53.730> and

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
see lots of defibrillator still and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.409 
see lots of defibrillator still and
engineer<00:04:55.080> because<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:56.250> repair<00:04:56.850> tool<00:04:57.030> is

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
engineer because the repair tool is

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.760 
engineer because the repair tool is
fairly<00:04:57.720> useful<00:04:57.990> if<00:04:58.200> you've<00:04:58.320> got<00:04:58.500> your<00:04:58.650> own

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
fairly useful if you've got your own

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.770 
fairly useful if you've got your own
vehicles<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.400> otherwise<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.330> want<00:05:00.600> the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
vehicles and otherwise you want the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.670 
vehicles and otherwise you want the
Stinger<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.650> RPG<00:05:02.340> or<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.390> javelin<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.320> destroy

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
Stinger a RPG or the javelin to destroy

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.500 
Stinger a RPG or the javelin to destroy
enemy<00:05:05.040> vehicles<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.640> I<00:05:05.940> think<00:05:06.150> that's<00:05:06.330> what

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
enemy vehicles and I think that's what

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.330 
enemy vehicles and I think that's what
you'd<00:05:06.660> see<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.870> whole<00:05:07.110> lot<00:05:07.260> of<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.980> might<00:05:08.160> see

you'd see a whole lot of you might see

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.000 
you'd see a whole lot of you might see
some<00:05:08.550> more<00:05:08.669> changes<00:05:09.000> in<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.990> first<00:05:10.500> gadgets

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
you could see snipers who had a shotgun

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.840 
you could see snipers who had a shotgun
second<00:05:26.010> area<00:05:26.330> mmm<00:05:28.040> interesting<00:05:29.040> well<00:05:29.729> iguess

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
second area mmm interesting well iguess

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.060 
second area mmm interesting well iguess
the<00:05:30.120> 93r<00:05:30.690> is<00:05:31.080> no<00:05:31.350> longer<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.860> shotgun<00:05:32.460> so<00:05:33.169> um<00:05:34.169> I

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
the 93r is no longer a shotgun so um I

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.310 
the 93r is no longer a shotgun so um I
don't<00:05:35.370> know<00:05:35.430> how<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.550> would<00:05:35.729> change<00:05:35.880> things

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
don't know how that would change things

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.750 
don't know how that would change things
but<00:05:37.320> in<00:05:37.560> general<00:05:37.770> I<00:05:38.040> think<00:05:38.070> you<00:05:38.310> just<00:05:38.340> see<00:05:38.729> a

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
but in general I think you just see a

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.230 
but in general I think you just see a
whole<00:05:38.970> lot<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.180> defib<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:40.260> spa<00:05:41.000> that's<00:05:42.000> uh

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
whole lot of defib and spa that's uh

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.820 
whole lot of defib and spa that's uh
yeah<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:42.930> think<00:05:43.110> that's<00:05:43.440> what<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:43.740> would

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
yeah I think that's what it would

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.920 
yeah I think that's what it would
devolve<00:05:44.100> into<00:05:44.310> with<00:05:44.729> lots<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.450> lots<00:05:45.630> of

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
devolve into with lots and lots of

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.760 
devolve into with lots and lots of
assault<00:05:46.229> rifles<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:46.970> so<00:05:47.970> just<00:05:48.930> separating

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
assault rifles and so just separating

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.940 
assault rifles and so just separating
out<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:49.890> classes<00:05:50.490> I<00:05:50.700> don't<00:05:51.540> know<00:05:51.600> it<00:05:52.140> that's

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
out the classes I don't know it that's

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.070 
out the classes I don't know it that's
how<00:05:53.100> battlefield<00:05:53.640> does<00:05:53.820> it<00:05:54.000> but<00:05:54.600> in<00:05:54.690> terms<00:05:54.870> of

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
how battlefield does it but in terms of

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.250 
how battlefield does it but in terms of
choosing<00:05:55.380> between<00:05:55.729> making<00:05:56.729> trade-offs<00:05:57.260> and

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
choosing between making trade-offs and

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.990 
choosing between making trade-offs and
it<00:05:58.440> usually<00:05:58.590> comes<00:05:58.830> down<00:05:59.100> to<00:05:59.340> those<00:05:59.520> gadgets

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
it usually comes down to those gadgets

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.920 
it usually comes down to those gadgets
rather<00:06:00.840> than<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.229> guns<00:06:02.180> anyway<00:06:03.180> that<00:06:03.900> is

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
rather than the guns anyway that is

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.280 
rather than the guns anyway that is
