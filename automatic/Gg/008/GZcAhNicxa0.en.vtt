00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.180
 jean renault sandouville it's more than 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.500
 eight million vehicles produced 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.210
 since its origin 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.680
 This is the first time in Europe that has 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.510
 so many transformations in a factory 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.439
 to move from the particular vehicle to 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.060
 commercial vehicles 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.680
 we really built 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.900
 process plants completely 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.199
 new at the top compared to what is happening 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.730
 do better at renault I think that 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.470
 as was valladolid up 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.790
 now for a start we 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.449
 hope that sandouville will be a 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.420
 benchmark 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.400
 we have a montage with spaces 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.250
 completely airy work where we 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.800
 let's separate the part of choice from the pieces 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.620
 of the assembly of the parts of which it is called 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.720
 the full city ​​and then these pieces are 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.640
 taken in a wire-guided cart 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.799
 to the assembly station it is there 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.420
 the operator in the mounting parts and 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.650
 assembles them on the car that allows 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.870
 to have much more spaces 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.440
 unobstructed and facilitate the lives of 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.350
 operators 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.000
 we also transformed 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.620
 skills train technicians 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.150
 many operators went in 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.010
 moving to other factories 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.110
 group could not discover the vehicle 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.150
 utility there is plenty of specificity 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.040
 a very strong diversity in sheet metal with 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.780
 270 crate a hundred tents in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.540
 painting it happened first with 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.520
 relay trainers who gradually 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.360
 passed on their knowledge in 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.100
 training schools 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.190
 and then on string then there is a whole 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.410
 team that built the device 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.940
 team formation 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.690
 multidisciplinary with manufacturers 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.360
 quality logistics resources 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.090
 human and that leads to a device 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.040
 20-day training every 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.320
 employees who work on the line 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.760
 traffic have the same process of 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.860
 training whether it's the trades of the 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.960
 manufacturing 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.880
 the logistics the quality here we all 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.440
 the reconstruct posts that we know 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.060
 in chain it allows to learn everything 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.680
 which is key points the quality gestures 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.130
 the operators stay on their 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.510
 job 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.710
 they are taught directly the position of 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.140
 work is not the basic technique 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.570
 cdma chic never had the case of a basket 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.960
 it helps us to be better trained to have 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.549
 more than 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.380
 of autonomy that we will make the parts 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.540
 the goal is to introduce the new 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.069
 arriving their video post for that 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.060
 the operator has a better approach 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.250
 of his post and that he is already 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.230
 visualize some key points of the position 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.620
 with the operator's explanation all 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.650
 is clear 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.650
 the procedure to be followed for all 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.600
 and it's easier of importance it's 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.670
 to show them the good gesture had 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.340
 then realize it to get to 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.450
 joined perfect he great chefs 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.400
 he said after three thousand times 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.230
 low-Norman algest before I was agent 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.850
 of production too and knew nothing about 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.530
 see at the level of the dexterity of what 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.000
 I say it was very useful to me 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.010
 it's a very important investment 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.870
 for the machined sandouville for renault 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.370
 but it's also a device is 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.290
 totally indispensable to succeed 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.580
 starting new traffic 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.750
 the prospects are quite 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.420
 reassuring since with a vehicle 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.470
 utility its 10 12 years of future that 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.920
 are guaranteed for the machined 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.269
 Sandouville 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.269
 so it's quite exciting
