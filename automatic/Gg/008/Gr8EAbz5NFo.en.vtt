00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.250 
basically ileana really quick in a
nutshell

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
nutshell

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.289 
nutshell
the<00:04:02.859> only<00:04:03.010> thing<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.370> would<00:04:03.430> like<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.850> say<00:04:04.060> is

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
the only thing I would like to say is

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.699 
the only thing I would like to say is
that<00:04:04.329> she<00:04:04.660> does<00:04:04.810> not<00:04:04.840> come<00:04:05.139> with<00:04:05.319> this<00:04:05.470> shoe

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
that she does not come with this shoe

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.759 
that she does not come with this shoe
mold<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.160> on<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.519> back<00:04:06.730> here<00:04:07.620> as<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:08.739> can

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
mold that is on the back here as you can

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.410 
mold that is on the back here as you can
see<00:04:09.010> it's<00:04:09.129> like<00:04:09.250> really<00:04:09.489> detailed<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.209> stuff

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
see it's like really detailed and stuff

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.240 
see it's like really detailed and stuff
and<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.230> think<00:04:11.439> since<00:04:11.620> she's<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.799> new<00:04:12.010> doll<00:04:12.220> and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
and I think since she's a new doll and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.949 
and I think since she's a new doll and
Victorian<00:04:13.000> teak<00:04:13.209> as<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.360> new<00:04:13.540> doll<00:04:13.750> since

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
Victorian teak as a new doll since

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:14.670 
Victorian teak as a new doll since
Victoria<00:04:14.500> has

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
Victoria has

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.310 
Victoria has
new<00:04:14.859> shoe<00:04:15.069> mold<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.489> think<00:04:15.849> that<00:04:16.320> Ileana

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
new shoe mold I think that Ileana

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.069 
new shoe mold I think that Ileana
honesty<00:04:17.979> should<00:04:18.190> also<00:04:18.430> have<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:19.120> new<00:04:19.570> shoe<00:04:19.810> mold

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
honesty should also have a new shoe mold

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.570 
honesty should also have a new shoe mold
but<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.530> is<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:20.919> my<00:04:21.759> personal<00:04:21.820> opinion<00:04:23.580> so

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
but that is just my personal opinion so
