00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
things you can do with this webcam I

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.980 
things you can do with this webcam I
don't<00:03:06.100> know<00:03:06.250> if<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:06.520> just<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.660> software

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
don't know if it's just the software

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.600 
don't know if it's just the software
I've<00:03:08.110> got<00:03:08.320> my<00:03:08.440> computer<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:09.040> gives<00:03:09.370> me<00:03:09.490> these

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
I've got my computer that gives me these

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.990 
I've got my computer that gives me these
effects<00:03:10.030> but<00:03:10.860> either<00:03:11.860> way<00:03:12.220> they<00:03:12.430> they<00:03:12.850> are

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
effects but either way they they are

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.330 
effects but either way they they are
really<00:03:13.240> cool<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.470> basically<00:03:14.830> that's<00:03:15.040> what<00:03:15.280> it

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
really cool so basically that's what it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
really cool so basically that's what it
looks<00:03:15.610> like<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.330> then<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:18.250> basically<00:03:18.460> can

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
looks like and then you basically can

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.500 
looks like and then you basically can
just<00:03:19.600> click<00:03:19.840> on<00:03:19.990> them<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:21.790> have<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.210> click<00:03:22.360> on

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
just click on them we have to click on

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.630 
just click on them we have to click on
enable<00:03:22.870> effect<00:03:23.500> so<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:23.920> does<00:03:24.070> actually<00:03:24.220> do<00:03:24.520> the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
enable effect so it does actually do the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.000 
enable effect so it does actually do the
effect<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.050> will<00:03:26.140> change<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.770> guy

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
effect and it will change it to the guy

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.910 
effect and it will change it to the guy
but<00:03:27.370> then<00:03:28.090> I'm<00:03:28.240> gonna<00:03:28.360> be<00:03:28.450> able<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.690> say<00:03:28.960> let's
