works<00:00:29.150> image<00:00:30.150> based<00:00:30.420> lighting<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.900> basically

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
works image based lighting is basically

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.170 
works image based lighting is basically
taking<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:31.920> image<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.460> then<00:00:32.640> bending<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
taking one image and then bending that

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.120 
taking one image and then bending that
image<00:00:33.450> into<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.780> shape<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> sphere<00:00:34.469> that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
image into a shape of a sphere that

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340 
image into a shape of a sphere that
wraps<00:00:35.370> around<00:00:35.489> your<00:00:35.820> seat<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.630> then<00:00:36.870> generates

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
wraps around your seat it then generates

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.170 
wraps around your seat it then generates
light<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.280> image<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.670> directs

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
light just like the image and directs

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.729 
light just like the image and directs
that<00:00:39.329> light<00:00:39.570> inward<00:00:39.930> towards<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> center<00:00:40.710> of

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that light inward towards the center of

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.770 
that light inward towards the center of
that<00:00:40.950> sphere<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.149> at<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> center<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
that sphere and at the center of that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
that sphere and at the center of that

iphone<00:00:44.730> 4<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.730> let's<00:00:47.910> begin<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.450> scene

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
iphone 4 so let's begin with this scene

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.740 
iphone 4 so let's begin with this scene
of<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:48.989> horse<00:00:49.260> before<00:00:50.129> using<00:00:50.550> IBL<00:00:51.120> first

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
of my horse before using IBL first

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
of my horse before using IBL first
adjust<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> lighting<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:53.309> don't<00:00:53.399> need<00:00:53.610> too

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
adjust the lighting we don't need too

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.160 
adjust the lighting we don't need too
much<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> other<00:00:54.390> lighting<00:00:54.660> such<00:00:55.020> as

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
much of the other lighting such as

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200 
much of the other lighting such as
directional<00:00:55.440> light<00:00:55.770> spotlight<00:00:56.430> point<00:00:57.000> light

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
directional light spotlight point light

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.860 
directional light spotlight point light
nor<00:00:57.750> ambient<00:00:58.230> light<00:00:59.149> by<00:01:00.149> default<00:01:00.390> every

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
nor ambient light by default every

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
nor ambient light by default every
project<00:01:01.379> has<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:01.920> lights<00:01:02.210> directional<00:01:03.210> light

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
project has two lights directional light

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660 
project has two lights directional light
and<00:01:03.570> ambien<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.739> let's<00:01:04.920> turn<00:01:05.100> em<00:01:05.280> biet<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and ambien so let's turn em biet to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.590 
and ambien so let's turn em biet to
black

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.000 

then<00:01:12.600> change<00:01:12.840> directional<00:01:13.410> light<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.800> dark

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
then change directional light to dark

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
then change directional light to dark
gray<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:15.270> wish<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.480> keep<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:16.080> shadow

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
gray we wish to keep some shadow

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.440 
gray we wish to keep some shadow
contrast<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.460> we'll<00:01:17.580> leave<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.000> directional

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
contrast so we'll leave this directional

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.719 
contrast so we'll leave this directional
light<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> darker<00:01:20.130> color

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.820 

okay<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.330> ready<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.690> add<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.080> some<00:01:25.290> IBL

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
okay so we are ready to add in some IBL

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.980 
okay so we are ready to add in some IBL
so<00:01:26.340> let's<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> stage<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> atmosphere

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
so let's go to stage then to atmosphere

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.660 
so let's go to stage then to atmosphere
then<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.140> modify<00:01:31.500> panel<00:01:31.650> let's<00:01:32.460> scroll

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
then on the modify panel let's scroll

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.310 
then on the modify panel let's scroll
down<00:01:32.910> to<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.150> image<00:01:33.810> based<00:01:34.170> lighting

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
down to the image based lighting

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.980 
down to the image based lighting
settings<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:38.070> turn<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.460> IBL<00:01:38.970> simply<00:01:39.780> click<00:01:39.960> on

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
settings to turn on IBL simply click on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.290 
settings to turn on IBL simply click on
this<00:01:40.260> check<00:01:40.500> box<00:01:40.940> automatically<00:01:41.940> there<00:01:42.210> is

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
this check box automatically there is

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.570 
this check box automatically there is
already<00:01:42.510> one<00:01:42.660> IBL<00:01:43.290> image<00:01:43.619> already<00:01:43.830> loaded<00:01:44.369> for

already one IBL image already loaded for

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.690 
already one IBL image already loaded for
us<00:01:44.700> remember<00:01:45.660> IBL<00:01:46.440> is<00:01:46.590> basically<00:01:47.100> taking<00:01:47.490> one

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
us remember IBL is basically taking one

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
us remember IBL is basically taking one
texture<00:01:48.030> map<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.570> wrapping<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.229> around<00:01:49.290> your

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
texture map and wrapping it around your

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.680 
texture map and wrapping it around your
scene<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.100> generating<00:01:50.550> light<00:01:50.700> inward<00:01:51.149> towards

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
scene in generating light inward towards

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.249 
scene in generating light inward towards
your<00:01:51.810> scene<00:01:52.940> because<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.930> simply

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
your scene because of that we can simply

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
your scene because of that we can simply
change<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.680> image<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.220> create<00:01:56.729> new<00:01:56.759> IBL<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
change this image and create new IBL and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
change this image and create new IBL and
thus<00:01:58.229> change<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> filling<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.310> entire

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
thus change the filling of the entire

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.109 
thus change the filling of the entire
project<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.399> templates<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.940> choose

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
project on the templates we can choose

IBL<00:02:30.790> map<00:02:31.030> changed<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.980> did<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.250> sky<00:02:38.910> and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
IBL map changed and so did the sky and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.020 
IBL map changed and so did the sky and
the<00:02:40.709> weather<00:02:41.709> looks<00:02:41.980> much<00:02:42.190> colder<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.819> the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
the weather looks much colder and the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.610 
the weather looks much colder and the
lighting<00:02:43.239> helps<00:02:43.569> create<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.050> feeling<00:02:46.620> we

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
lighting helps create that feeling we

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.890 
lighting helps create that feeling we
can<00:02:47.709> also<00:02:47.830> choose<00:02:48.130> IBL<00:02:48.610> horror<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.120> see<00:02:49.780> how

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
can also choose IBL horror and see how

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.840 
can also choose IBL horror and see how
the<00:02:49.959> IBL<00:02:50.410> map<00:02:50.620> changed<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.610> entire

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
the IBL map changed and the entire

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.460 
the IBL map changed and the entire
feeling<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.450> project<00:02:52.840> change<00:02:53.080> based<00:02:53.350> on

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
feeling of the project change based on

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.890 
feeling of the project change based on
the<00:02:53.590> IBL<00:02:53.980> map<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.370> chose<00:02:54.730> lighting<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.569> that

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
the IBL map I chose lighting can be that

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.680 
the IBL map I chose lighting can be that
