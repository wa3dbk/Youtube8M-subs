00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.270
 to be the weapon 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.370
 that I showed you in the video where how 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.110
 make a homemade weapon 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:17.880
 simple can modify it by putting 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.420
 a piece of wood cutting it like this 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.870
 as if it were like that to grab him 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 and squeezing it with 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:31.290
 and the tape and here back then too 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.010
 just one but a longer and 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.629
 I squeezed it with thread and with ribbon 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.489
 and they have to leave a little box and for 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.489
 put your mouth and be able to blow like that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.260
 well what else 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.410
 and there it is 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:03.640
 Thus says the time for you inside 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:07.450
 modify and have many weapons inside 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.909
 for example Russians of these 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.460
 we grabbed a box of matches 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.540
 and we put it in the longest way that 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.630
 behind 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.000
 and then we no longer put there we blow and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.080
 if we need more then just take out 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.780
 the look can vary it can be bought 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 this is a laser too but it has a look 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.440
 do not steal is how you look too and this 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.300
 can be the previous video and go if 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.850
 had for another alternative look is a 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.110
 all pvc tube but thicker and not 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.410
 they put it on tape 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.410
 up here 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.649
 and no longer with a marker you drew on 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.250
 a cross and a little circle in the cigar 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.360
 center and some more like that and here they come and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.360
 they can shoot everything 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.950
 Y 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:07.000
