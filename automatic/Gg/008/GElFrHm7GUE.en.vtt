 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.029
 Today Olga the bird and we will talk to 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 you today to asparagus 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.280
 green asparagus is different from white 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.120
 that it does not need to be cleaned by some 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.120
 kind of asparagus can be enough 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.050
 thick trunks in this case it can 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.750
 also peel it asparagus enough 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.480
 tough on the end so its possible or 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.199
 trim or peel as well as white 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.199
 asparagus 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 I shared a criminal case later 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.220
 green 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.000
 legs, and they will also cook for 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.000
 separately 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.920
 bring in the end 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:36.910
 singing add a little bit a little bit 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 a little salt and if you are tall for 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:45.430
 you can put asparagus at full length 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.150
 if you have a low pot like mine 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.180
 I will cut the asparagus into several pieces 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.990
 keep in mind that asparagus heads are boiled 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.720
 very quickly and so i drop in 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.620
 say hot water in the head 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.470

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.399

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.320

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:26.860

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:38.620
