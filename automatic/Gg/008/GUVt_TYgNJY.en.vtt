00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.389

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.050
 they are not in the daily routine of use but 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.509
 that like they help to spoil you not to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.579
 the best at the end of the week or a day 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.860
 that you have about 15-20 minutes to 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.450
 relax are very parents things that I 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.460
 I have already wearing them a while and 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.110
 I want to share with you the first 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.400
 What I'm going to talk about is a mask for 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.240
 the hair then this mask 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.600
 specifically it is a mask 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.380
 Cholesterol without cholesterol 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.100
 return as vitality to the hair and 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.440
 this and hydrates it a lot not then what 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.940
 what I do is that at least once a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.750
 week especially because my hair is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.300
 very dry I try to wash it dry 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.340
 the hair with the towel I put it on 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.960
 all the hair from the roots of the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.270
 tips even if you want to be only 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.560
 from the bottom to the bottom I do it all 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.140
 The hair 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 he grabbed his hair or they were like 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.399
 so that the product is concentrated and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.380
 he left it about 20 minutes and then I 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.670
 at stake and my hair for the rest of the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.649
 week feels much more so much 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.619
 more hydrated not over all the next 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.830
 product is something that can both 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.720
 buy it I've already done like this one 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.399
 in charge this father outcome to the best 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.079
 try products like this do not stay 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.000
 white chocolate that are things that are not 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.970
 you usually have at home like to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.009
 mask use it once a week and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.530
 like the hair do not know the face too 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.840
 see what I need if I need this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 hydrate if I need to lower the levels 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.709
 of oils 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.170
 if I need if I have many this 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.689
 little bars and I want to get them cleaned 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.689
 deep depending on what you want 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.599
 for my skin it is what I will use no 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.030
 these are sorry for the pronounce 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:06.000
 always more as it is said it rides very well 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.690
 it's something like that they sell them on the wall mart 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.460
 They cost 29 pesos I think and it's something father 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.290
 because no no 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.550
 you save time then you can do 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.340
 other things while you wear the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.930
 mask and you put it about 15 or 20 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.160
 minutes that always what I do is that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.230
 I put on my hair mask 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.510
 here also the mask for the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.580
 face good choice for the body 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.670
 for the body this is a product like 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.230
 of luxury I consider it luxury although 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.220
 sell it on the super it makes me very 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.659
 expensive but proxy is worth what it is this is 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:46.340

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:49.069

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.489

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.500

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.989

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.760
 formula and also feels very hydrated 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.670
 then the morning the skin feels 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.150

 I have dermatitis on my arms then 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.500

 Dead cells all the dirt and take them out

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.550

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.840
 to go make a pedicure in shape 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.870
 or sometimes we do not want to spend the money 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.129
 like every two weeks or three weeks I 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.959

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:51.479

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:04.679
