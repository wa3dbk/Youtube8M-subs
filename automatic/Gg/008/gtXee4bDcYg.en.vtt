00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
anyway that's what's getting into the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.420 
anyway that's what's getting into the
clothes<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.570> takes<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.430> getting

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
clothes and it just takes really getting

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.540 
clothes and it just takes really getting
in<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.980> cleaning<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.219> real<00:00:59.520> good

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
in there and cleaning it up real good

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
in there and cleaning it up real good
because<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.719> some<00:01:00.930> nasty<00:01:01.680> stuff<00:01:01.739> over

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
because it's just some nasty stuff over

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.140 
because it's just some nasty stuff over
time<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.510> no<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:05.150> completely

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
time there's really no way to completely

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.469 
time there's really no way to completely
prevent<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.290> can't<00:01:08.100> actually<00:01:08.479> replace

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
prevent that you can't actually replace

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.910 
prevent that you can't actually replace
that<00:01:09.869> gasket<00:01:11.720> but<00:01:12.720> again<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.320> easiest<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that gasket but again the easiest way is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.270 
that gasket but again the easiest way is
just<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.549> clean<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.890> just<00:01:16.890> take<00:01:17.100> some

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
just to clean it all that just take some

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
just to clean it all that just take some
time<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.180> keep<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.390> along<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
time with it and keep going along and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.039 
time with it and keep going along and
rubbing<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.119> couple<00:01:21.119> different<00:01:21.479> wipes<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
rubbing it a couple different wipes a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.359 
rubbing it a couple different wipes a
couple<00:01:22.740> different<00:01:23.040> rags<00:01:23.659> show<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
couple different rags show you with the

couple different rags show you with the
that<00:01:26.369> towel<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.210> your<00:01:27.390> clothes<00:01:27.630> are

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that towel here if your clothes are

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
going along the back and they just

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.480 
going along the back and they just
happen<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> brush<00:01:30.720> against<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:32.310> pretty

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
happen to brush against that it's pretty

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
happen to brush against that it's pretty
easy<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:33.150> start<00:01:33.630> getting<00:01:33.900> some<00:01:34.140> marks

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
easy to start getting some marks

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.450 
easy to start getting some marks
especially<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> white<00:01:36.509> t-shirt<00:01:37.460> part

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
especially on like a white t-shirt part

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.840 
especially on like a white t-shirt part
of<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.680> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.860> minimized<00:01:41.340> by<00:01:41.579> doing

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of it is going to be minimized by doing

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.050 
of it is going to be minimized by doing
smaller<00:01:42.240> loads<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:43.619> clothes<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.759> dryer

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
smaller loads of clothes in the dryer

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.130 
smaller loads of clothes in the dryer
there's<00:01:45.750> no<00:01:45.899> there's<00:01:46.229> no<00:01:46.380> way<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:49.020> know

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
there's no there's no way to you know

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.469 
there's no there's no way to you know
keep<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.649> completely<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.520> that'll

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
keep it out completely but that'll

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.940 
keep it out completely but that'll
minimize<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.500> way<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> clothes

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
minimize it and that way the clothes

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.130 
minimize it and that way the clothes
aren't<00:01:53.310> pressing<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:54.540> up<00:01:54.659> against<00:01:54.930> because

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
aren't pressing right up against because

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.660 
aren't pressing right up against because
if<00:01:55.290> you've<00:01:55.470> got<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> super<00:01:55.860> full<00:01:56.219> load<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
if you've got a super full load and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.039 
if you've got a super full load and
they're<00:01:56.850> pressing<00:01:57.030> right<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.509> against<00:01:57.810> there

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
they're pressing right up against there

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.160 
they're pressing right up against there
all<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.040> takes<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.750> small<00:02:00.750> touch<00:02:02.329> but

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
all it takes is a small touch but

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.320 
all it takes is a small touch but
cleaning<00:02:05.979> this<00:02:06.100> out<00:02:06.310> once<00:02:06.549> in<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.790> while<00:02:06.939> also

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
cleaning this out once in a while also

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.320 
cleaning this out once in a while also
will<00:02:07.869> minimize<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.819> what<00:02:10.030> I'm<00:02:10.119> doing

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
will minimize it so just what I'm doing

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.000 
will minimize it so just what I'm doing
here

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
here

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.809 
here
that's<00:02:12.010> how<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.280> get<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.610> done<00:02:13.530> good<00:02:14.530> yeah<00:02:14.819> yeah

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
that's how to get it done good yeah yeah

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.760 
that's how to get it done good yeah yeah
so<00:02:16.030> once<00:02:16.209> you're<00:02:16.420> all<00:02:16.630> done<00:02:16.660> cleaning<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.650> up

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
so once you're all done cleaning it up

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.130 
so once you're all done cleaning it up
with<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> chemical<00:02:18.430> make<00:02:19.300> sure<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.630> use<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> dry

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
with a chemical make sure you use a dry

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.590 
with a chemical make sure you use a dry
rag<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:21.069> go<00:02:21.250> around<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.880> clean<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.390> really

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
rag and go around and clean it really

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.630
