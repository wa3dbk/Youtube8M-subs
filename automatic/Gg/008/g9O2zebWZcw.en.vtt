wise<00:02:06.950> software<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.160> where<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.640> little

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
wise software is where it's a little

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.860 
wise software is where it's a little
different<00:02:09.300> here<00:02:09.690> from<00:02:09.750> AT&amp;T<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.340> i<00:02:12.060> guess<00:02:12.750> from

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
different here from AT&amp;T so i guess from

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.640 
different here from AT&amp;T so i guess from
the<00:02:12.959> beginning<00:02:13.349> first

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
folder here on the home screen which is

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.740 
folder here on the home screen which is
fine<00:02:41.069> they're<00:02:41.370> also<00:02:41.519> here<00:02:41.849> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> app<00:02:42.510> drawer

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
fine they're also here in the app drawer

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
and that's good I guess but compared to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.500 
and that's good I guess but compared to
say<00:02:46.620> Sprint's<00:02:47.010> version<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:47.459> has<00:02:47.489> 11<00:02:48.120> app<00:02:48.269> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
say Sprint's version which has 11 app to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.300 
say Sprint's version which has 11 app to
apps<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:49.889> two<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.190> half

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
apps I think it's like two and a half

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.210 
apps I think it's like two and a half
three<00:02:50.609> this<00:02:51.569> has<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> lot<00:02:52.079> more<00:02:52.139> you've<00:02:53.069> also

turn it off and on let's see if we can

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.719 
turn it off and on let's see if we can
find<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:57.629> nope<00:03:58.019> not<00:03:58.260> under<00:03:58.590> general<00:03:59.069> how<00:03:59.430> about

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
find it nope not under general how about

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.680 
find it nope not under general how about
I<00:04:00.209> bet<00:04:00.750> it's<00:04:00.900> under<00:04:01.139> advanced<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.479> sure<00:04:03.479> it<00:04:03.569> is

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
I bet it's under advanced and sure it is

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.270 
I bet it's under advanced and sure it is
show<00:04:04.049> browser<00:04:04.290> bar<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.739> can<00:04:04.829> turn<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.069> on<00:04:05.220> and

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
show browser bar you can turn it on and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.909 
show browser bar you can turn it on and
off<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.909> actually<00:04:06.120> collects<00:04:06.959> analytics<00:04:07.590> by

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
off it actually collects analytics by

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.860 
off it actually collects analytics by
the<00:04:07.979> way<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.250> if<00:04:08.579> you<00:04:08.699> don't<00:04:08.879> like<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.359> that's

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
the way so if you don't like that that's

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.680 
the way so if you don't like that that's
I<00:04:10.440> suggest<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.340> turn<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.639> off<00:04:11.760> or<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.030> suggest

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
I suggest you turn it off or I suggest

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.390 
I suggest you turn it off or I suggest
you<00:04:12.750> use<00:04:12.900> Chrome<00:04:13.290> which<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:13.650> most<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.190> time

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
you use Chrome which I do most the time

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.490 
you use Chrome which I do most the time
anyway<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:15.329> only<00:04:15.510> real<00:04:15.659> difference<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:16.169> this

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
anyway the only real difference is this

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.589 
anyway the only real difference is this
will<00:04:16.799> actually<00:04:17.190> run<00:04:17.519> flash<00:04:17.849> and<00:04:18.090> hey<00:04:18.239> look<00:04:18.449> at
