00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
could have fought to buy a new weapon

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.940 
could have fought to buy a new weapon
and<00:01:44.330> his<00:01:45.330> skills<00:01:45.690> isn't<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> writer

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and his skills isn't that good a writer

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:56.300 
and his skills isn't that good a writer
so<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:48.980> PT<00:01:50.960> kind<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:55.010> this<00:01:56.010> is<00:01:56.160> something

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
so I PT kind of and this is something

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.020 
so I PT kind of and this is something
like<00:01:56.610> southern<00:01:57.000> Tang<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:59.030> literally

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
like southern Tang as in literally

started<00:02:00.690> attacking<00:02:00.990> someone<00:02:01.760> who's<00:02:02.760> not

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
started attacking someone who's not

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.280 
started attacking someone who's not
aware<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.250> me<00:02:05.610> my<00:02:06.270> presence<00:02:07.940> but<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.240> mean<00:02:10.050> it's

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
aware of me my presence but I mean it's

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.850 
aware of me my presence but I mean it's
really<00:02:10.619> different<00:02:10.800> from<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.550> think

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
really different from that I think

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.110 
really different from that I think
virtually<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.980> actually<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> quite<00:02:17.640> quite

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
virtually this is actually a quite quite

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.830 
virtually this is actually a quite quite
a<00:02:18.150> small<00:02:18.330> map<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.870> would<00:02:19.080> say<00:02:19.970> as<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.600> see

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the responding real is not far away from

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.250 
the responding real is not far away from
each<00:02:25.010> other<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:27.090> look<00:02:27.330> at<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.930> kill<00:02:28.140> him

that<00:03:45.670> is<00:03:45.900> I'm<00:03:46.900> not<00:03:47.080> sure<00:03:47.140> why<00:03:48.130> is<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.460> maybe

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
that is I'm not sure why is it maybe

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.070 
that is I'm not sure why is it maybe
it's<00:03:49.480> because<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.810> its<00:03:50.110> firepower<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.810> of

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
it's because of its firepower and of

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.590 
it's because of its firepower and of
course<00:03:53.350> that's<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:54.220> really<00:03:54.730> good<00:03:54.880> reason<00:03:55.150> why

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
course that's a really good reason why

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:04.020 
course that's a really good reason why
did<00:03:56.130> make<00:03:57.130> it<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.490> expensive<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:59.460> yes<00:04:03.030> well

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030
