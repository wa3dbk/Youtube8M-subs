00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
pretty much the same - and that's a very

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.359 
pretty much the same - and that's a very
good<00:00:31.679> thing

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
good thing

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.760 
good thing
thump<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.510> front<00:00:33.750> panel<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.350> Caravan

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
thump the front panel on this Caravan

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
thump the front panel on this Caravan
and<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> really<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.579> feel<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.210> made

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and it really just feel like it's made

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.290 
and it really just feel like it's made
from<00:00:36.660> solid<00:00:37.140> metal<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.739> that's<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:38.940> quite<00:00:39.180> so

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
from solid metal and that's not quite so

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.569 
from solid metal and that's not quite so
far<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> truth<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.559> underneath<00:00:41.190> it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
far from the truth because underneath it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.119 
far from the truth because underneath it
has<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> tubular<00:00:42.270> steel<00:00:42.629> frame<00:00:43.020> which<00:00:43.800> helps

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
has a tubular steel frame which helps

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.940 
has a tubular steel frame which helps
with<00:00:44.280> build<00:00:44.550> quality<00:00:44.960> rigidity<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.350> makes<00:00:46.800> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
with build quality rigidity and makes it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.819 
with build quality rigidity and makes it
a<00:00:47.039> breeze<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.640> tow<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> roads<00:00:48.829> the

a breeze to tow out on the roads the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.160 
a breeze to tow out on the roads the
question<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> good<00:00:51.210> caravan<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

holiday in for long periods of time
there's<00:00:54.960> only<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.230> way<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> find<00:00:55.770> out

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
