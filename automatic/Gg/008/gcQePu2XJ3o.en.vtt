00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.840
 step 1 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.960
 commit to lifting weights at least three to four times a week 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:15.819
 your mind to discourage your muscles with stress resistance which causes 

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:19.670
 that your muscles grow larger to prevent stress from returning to 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:20.640
 occur 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.980
 once you go home lets the shane muscle through a good 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.910
 nutrition and rest this one that will be bigger and had you repeat this 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.579
 process again 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.120
 ideally you should exercise your muscles once every 72 hours so 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.089
 that you can perform two workouts from the upper body to the 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.920
 week and two workouts of the lower body a week 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.570
 Step 2 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.020
 Concentrate on eating at least five to seven times a day by eating 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.490
 Balanced meals with carbohydrates proteins and fats 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.690
 If your goal is to build muscle then you must be eating so 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.050
 minus 15 18 x your current body weight 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.690
 your carbohydrates should equal 45% of your intake your proteins should be 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.409
 equal to 35% of intake approximately and your fats should be 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.770
 equal to the remaining 20% ​​of your intake 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.300
 you should focus on more than half of these meals are constituted by 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.410
 solid foods and the remainder may be the substitute for the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.680
 food 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.610
 step 3 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.960
 you should concentrate on stretching for at least half of the time you raise 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.970
 pesetas 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.080
 one of the biggest mistakes I see is that people train to train and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.680
 train without doing any stretching 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.240
 Stretching helps restore normal tissue length when you're 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.750
 constantly training your muscle orders will be shortened and enlarged 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.540
 which will make us weaker and slower with a higher incidence of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.780
 injuries 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.960
 Thus 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.619
 if you're lifting weights four hours a week at least you should dedicate 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.050
 two additional hours to stretch 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.430
 you must counteract the shortening of muscle tissue that occurs with 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.080
 the heavy ones otherwise you become an injury that is only waiting 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.949
 happen 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.729
 Step 4 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.729
 edited to the supplement if they have not been in the market for more than 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:20.959
 three years 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.579
 I learned this philosophy from a strength coach to you to Adriano 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.200
 that recommended not to approve any supplement until it had been in 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.930
 the market for at least three years to verify what would have happened 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.839
 the test of time 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.779
 explore your life much easier and help you avoid all the fuss 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.299
 advertising in the latest bodybuilding and conditioning magazine 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.619
 if you follow this rule you will discover that only a small handful of supplements 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.139
 they are still in the market 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.299
 these are the ones that you should not miss a high quality multivitamin 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.209
 fish oil capsules creatine powder and protein powder 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.139

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.180
