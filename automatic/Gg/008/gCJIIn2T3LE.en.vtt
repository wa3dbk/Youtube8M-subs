one<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:54.540> fix<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.989> because<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.230> door<00:02:55.440> would<00:02:55.560> not

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
one to fix it because the door would not

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.680 
one to fix it because the door would not
hold<00:02:55.859> properly<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.549> just<00:02:56.760> would<00:02:56.940> not<00:02:57.120> work<00:02:57.480> at

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690
