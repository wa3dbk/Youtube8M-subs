00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
flexibility in some areas and this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.300 
flexibility in some areas and this
actually<00:01:12.119> has<00:01:12.330> all<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.750> those<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> in

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
a retail pant so it was extremely

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
a retail pant so it was extremely
exciting<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.130> then<00:01:17.490> try<00:01:17.729> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
exciting to get these in and then try to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.670 
exciting to get these in and then try to
use<00:01:17.880> them<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.689> first<00:01:18.900> couple<00:01:19.200> times<00:01:19.350> get

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
use them for the first couple times get

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
use them for the first couple times get
used<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.479> it's<00:01:21.479> worked<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.840> really

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
used to them and it's worked out really

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.609 
used to them and it's worked out really
well

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
well

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.980 
well
now<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.490> couple<00:01:23.909> parts<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.810> like

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
now a couple parts that I really like

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
now a couple parts that I really like
and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.710> think<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:26.009> upgrades

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and then I really think are upgrades

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.050 
and then I really think are upgrades
over<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> 20<00:01:27.060> k<00:01:27.210> pant<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.549> top<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
over the 20 k pant right here the top of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.929 
over the 20 k pant right here the top of
your<00:01:30.150> thigh<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:31.380> has<00:01:31.590> d3o<00:01:32.130> foam<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.729> and

your thigh this has d3o foam in it and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
your thigh this has d3o foam in it and
if<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.299> remember<00:01:33.450> back<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> e<00:01:34.110> flex<00:01:34.530> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
if you remember back from the e flex to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.060 
if you remember back from the e flex to
review<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.119> d3o<00:01:36.600> foam<00:01:36.930> allows<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> lot<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
review that d3o foam allows for a lot of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.920 
review that d3o foam allows for a lot of
shock<00:01:38.250> absorption<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.939> also<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> lot<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
shock absorption and also a lot of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.260 
shock absorption and also a lot of
flexibility<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.950> time<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:42.180> we

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
flexibility at the same time so what we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.080 
flexibility at the same time so what we
have<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.229> somewhat<00:01:43.799> flexible<00:01:44.040> pad<00:01:44.490> but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
have here is a somewhat flexible pad but

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.850 
have here is a somewhat flexible pad but
when<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.390> puck<00:01:45.600> hits<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.619> flex

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
when that puck hits it it's just a flex

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800 
when that puck hits it it's just a flex
right<00:01:47.070> off<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:48.000> also<00:01:48.240> padding

well it's probably not going to hurt at

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.720 
well it's probably not going to hurt at
least<00:02:48.900> not<00:02:49.049> hurt<00:02:49.230> too<00:02:49.500> bad<00:02:49.709> because<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.579> this

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
least not hurt too bad because of this

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.729

padding<00:02:51.120> right<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.319> will<00:02:52.410> say<00:02:52.709> that

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
padding right here now I will say that

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.199 
padding right here now I will say that
this<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> first<00:02:53.459> time<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.910> I've<00:02:54.000> had<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
this is the first time that I've had a

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.759 
this is the first time that I've had a
pant<00:02:54.510> with<00:02:54.660> an<00:02:54.810> inner<00:02:54.959> belt<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.650> I've

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
pant with an inner belt that I've

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.339 
pant with an inner belt that I've
actually<00:02:55.980> left<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.760> in<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.329> part<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.170> is

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
actually left it in and part of that is

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.589 
actually left it in and part of that is
because<00:02:58.560> these<00:02:59.069> pants<00:02:59.549> are<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.000> bulky<00:03:00.269> and

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
because these pants are so bulky and

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.650 
because these pants are so bulky and
that<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.349> do<00:03:01.590> tuck<00:03:02.370> my<00:03:02.549> chest<00:03:02.790> protector<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.390> now

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
that I do tuck my chest protector in now

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.869 
that I do tuck my chest protector in now
said<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.290> allows<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.640> able<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
said it allows for that to be able to

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.970 
said it allows for that to be able to
work<00:03:06.150> as<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.629> was<00:03:06.750> intended<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.829> actually

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
work as it was intended so I actually

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.100 
work as it was intended so I actually
really<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:08.760> now<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:09.989> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
really like that now but I think the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.170 
really like that now but I think the
best<00:03:10.410> part<00:03:10.739> about<00:03:10.799> these<00:03:11.099> pants<00:03:11.519> is<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
best part about these pants is the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.390 
best part about these pants is the
integrated<00:03:12.870> straps<00:03:13.170> right<00:03:13.440> here<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:14.190> allows

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
integrated straps right here that allows

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.800 
integrated straps right here that allows
you<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.640> connect<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.269> CCM<00:03:15.780> premier

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you to connect it to the CCM premier

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.309 
you to connect it to the CCM premier
chest<00:03:16.410> protector<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.239> now<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.569> don't<00:03:18.690> have<00:03:19.019> to

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
chest protector and now I don't have to

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.660 
chest protector and now I don't have to
tie<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.829> chest<00:03:20.190> protector

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
tie in the chest protector

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.009 
tie in the chest protector
I<00:03:20.819> don't<00:03:21.239> even<00:03:21.329> necessarily<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.440> use

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
I don't even necessarily have to use

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.330 
I don't even necessarily have to use
suspenders<00:03:25.019> anymore<00:03:25.440> even<00:03:25.920> though<00:03:26.040> sometimes

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
suspenders anymore even though sometimes

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.030 
suspenders anymore even though sometimes
I<00:03:26.609> still<00:03:26.880> will<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:28.079> really<00:03:28.709> don't<00:03:28.859> need<00:03:28.980> to

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
I still will I really don't need to

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.860 
I still will I really don't need to
because<00:03:29.579> these<00:03:29.790> pads<00:03:30.120> right<00:03:30.329> here<00:03:30.389> are<00:03:30.750> these

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
because these pads right here are these

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.690 
because these pads right here are these
straps<00:03:31.260> right<00:03:31.440> here<00:03:31.500> actually<00:03:32.340> connect<00:03:32.639> to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
straps right here actually connect to

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.580 
straps right here actually connect to
the<00:03:32.849> chest<00:03:33.239> protector<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.780> then<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.349> just

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
the chest protector and then I just

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.400 
the chest protector and then I just
tighten<00:03:34.889> them<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.609> fits<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:35.940> perfectly

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
tighten them and it fits in perfectly

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.870 
tighten them and it fits in perfectly
now<00:03:37.410> if<00:03:37.560> there<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.739> any<00:03:38.160> downside<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.639> these

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
now if there is any downside to these

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.339 
now if there is any downside to these
pants<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.450> definitely<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.049> they<00:03:40.200> are

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
pants it's definitely that they are

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.059 
pants it's definitely that they are
heavy<00:03:40.739> very<00:03:41.700> very<00:03:42.060> heavy<00:03:42.389> and<00:03:42.660> again<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.799> don't

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
heavy very very heavy and again I don't

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.199 
heavy very very heavy and again I don't
think<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:44.340> necessarily<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.940> bad<00:03:45.030> thing

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
think that's necessarily a bad thing

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.240 
think that's necessarily a bad thing
because<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.959> prefer<00:03:46.169> bulk<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.859> I<00:03:46.919> prefer

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
because I prefer bulk and I prefer

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.860 
because I prefer bulk and I prefer
protection<00:03:47.790> especially<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.359> pan<00:03:48.540> area

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
protection especially in the pan area

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.390 
protection especially in the pan area
because<00:03:49.109> that's<00:03:49.260> where<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> lot<00:03:49.889> of<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.160> shots

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
because that's where a lot of the shots

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.849 
because that's where a lot of the shots
go<00:03:50.669> and<00:03:50.910> especially<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.959> through<00:03:52.260> here<00:03:52.530> you're

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
go and especially in through here you're

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.110 
go and especially in through here you're
going<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.160> want<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.400> lot<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.579> protection

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
going to want a lot of protection

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.420 
going to want a lot of protection
because<00:03:54.450> those<00:03:54.989> incoming<00:03:55.470> shots<00:03:55.769> may<00:03:56.160> or<00:03:56.340> may

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
because those incoming shots may or may

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.580 
because those incoming shots may or may
not<00:03:56.459> hit<00:03:56.760> your<00:03:56.910> chest<00:03:57.060> protector<00:03:57.540> or<00:03:57.750> your<00:03:58.380> cup

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
not hit your chest protector or your cup

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.259 
not hit your chest protector or your cup
and<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.190> having<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.549> extra<00:03:59.849> padding<00:04:00.239> in

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
and so having that extra padding in

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.270 
and so having that extra padding in
there<00:04:00.510> really<00:04:00.780> works<00:04:00.989> out<00:04:01.200> well<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.250> I

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
there really works out well so I

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.610 
there really works out well so I
definitely<00:04:02.940> recommend<00:04:03.180> picking<00:04:03.870> these<00:04:04.079> up<00:04:04.139> at

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
definitely recommend picking these up at

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.800 
definitely recommend picking these up at
