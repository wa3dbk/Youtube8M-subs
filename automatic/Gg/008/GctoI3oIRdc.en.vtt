matte grey it's like a it's not gunmetal

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.720 
matte grey it's like a it's not gunmetal
gray<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.810> has<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.290> little<00:01:40.650> shine<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> but

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
gray it has a little shine to it but

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.820 
gray it has a little shine to it but
it's<00:01:41.880> basically<00:01:42.450> your<00:01:42.810> simple<00:01:43.200> gray<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.620> of

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
it's basically your simple gray and of

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's basically your simple gray and of
course<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> wheels<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:44.730> red<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.420> very

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
course the wheels are red which is very

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.200 
course the wheels are red which is very
nice<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.010> kanji<00:01:47.730> here<00:01:48.060> on

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
nice and you do have the kanji here on

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.570 
nice and you do have the kanji here on
the<00:01:48.570> sides<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.140> i<00:01:50.040> mentioned<00:01:50.370> it's<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
the sides as i mentioned it's the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.730 
the sides as i mentioned it's the
butterfly<00:01:51.030> transformation<00:01:51.870> so<00:01:52.200> basically

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
butterfly transformation so basically

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
butterfly transformation so basically
all<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.070> do<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.520> split<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:56.360> robot<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.540> half

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
all you do is split the robot in half

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
all you do is split the robot in half
and<00:01:58.140> flip<00:01:58.620> it<00:01:58.650> around<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.250> there<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.000> have

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and flip it around and there you have

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.380 
and flip it around and there you have
sideswipe<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.110> its<00:02:01.740> robot<00:02:02.130> mode<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.729> mean<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
sideswipe in its robot mode I mean the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.610 
sideswipe in its robot mode I mean the
arms<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.900> new<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.600> blades<00:02:06.900> are<00:02:07.080> obviously

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
arms are new the blades are obviously

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.440 
arms are new the blades are obviously
new<00:02:07.860> which<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.129> kind<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.459> weird<00:02:08.640> he's<00:02:08.849> got<00:02:09.030> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
in yeah it's hidden in vehicle mode so

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.690 
in yeah it's hidden in vehicle mode so
it's<00:02:41.470> kind<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.769> interesting<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:42.489> did

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.020 
pick up this one be a little different
now<00:03:11.560> let's<00:03:11.769> really<00:03:11.950> take<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.220> look<00:03:12.489> at<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
now let's really take a look at the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.550 
now let's really take a look at the
bumblebees<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:15.000> had<00:03:16.000> initially<00:03:16.330> passed<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:17.290> one

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
bumblebees I had initially passed on one

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.449 
bumblebees I had initially passed on one
step<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:18.069> bumblebee<00:03:18.549> because<00:03:19.269> um<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:21.040> be<00:03:21.160> honest

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
step a bumblebee because um to be honest

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.610 
step a bumblebee because um to be honest
I<00:03:21.580> missed<00:03:21.790> out<00:03:21.910> on<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.150> review<00:03:22.450> but<00:03:22.690> also<00:03:22.900> it

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
I missed out on the review but also it

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.059 
I missed out on the review but also it
looked<00:03:24.489> very<00:03:24.790> plain<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.690> lot<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.590> detailing

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
looked very plain a lot of the detailing

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.050 
looked very plain a lot of the detailing
you're<00:03:27.340> seeing<00:03:27.640> here<00:03:28.000> was<00:03:28.989> left<00:03:29.320> off<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.910> when

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
you're seeing here was left off so when

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.630 
you're seeing here was left off so when
I<00:03:31.120> heard<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.510> nine<00:03:31.720> ops<00:03:31.989> version<00:03:32.560> was<00:03:33.220> coming

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
I heard the nine ops version was coming

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.840 
I heard the nine ops version was coming
out<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:34.150> figured<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:36.040> Takara<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.420> venture

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
out I figured the Takara a venture

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.699 
out I figured the Takara a venture
version<00:03:39.850> would<00:03:40.480> actually<00:03:41.200> be<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:42.780> better<00:03:43.780> use

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
version would actually be a better use

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.680 
version would actually be a better use
of<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.980> mold<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.579> compare<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.269> night<00:03:46.480> off

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
of the mold to compare to the night off

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.509 
of the mold to compare to the night off
because<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.170> can<00:03:47.319> see<00:03:47.560> they<00:03:47.890> have<00:03:48.069> the

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
because you can see they have the

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.599 
because you can see they have the
venture<00:03:49.420> has<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> lot<00:03:50.170> more<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.829> black

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
venture has a lot more that black

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.479 
venture has a lot more that black
detailing<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.660> striping<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.889> headlights

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
detailing the striping the headlights

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.330 
detailing the striping the headlights
and<00:03:54.790> stuff<00:03:55.109> it's<00:03:56.109> all<00:03:56.319> it<00:03:56.530> means<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:56.950> paint

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
and stuff it's all it means just paint

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.160 
and stuff it's all it means just paint
it<00:03:57.430> better<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.810> am<00:03:59.139> kind<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.410> surprised<00:03:59.829> at<00:04:00.040> this

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
it better I am kind of surprised at this

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.920 
it better I am kind of surprised at this
this<00:04:02.170> mold<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.340> actually<00:04:03.880> a<00:04:03.940> little<00:04:04.030> heftier<00:04:04.690> I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
this mold is actually a little heftier I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.720 
this mold is actually a little heftier I
mean<00:04:05.260> it's<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.410> same<00:04:05.620> transformation<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.519> one

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
mean it's the same transformation is one

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.000 
mean it's the same transformation is one
strip<00:04:07.030> step<00:04:07.630> drift<00:04:07.989> which<00:04:08.200> we<00:04:08.380> reviewed

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
strip step drift which we reviewed

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.220 
strip step drift which we reviewed
before<00:04:09.220> but<00:04:10.060> that<00:04:10.090> was<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.359> lighter<00:04:10.660> car<00:04:10.989> this

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
before but that was a lighter car this

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.900 
before but that was a lighter car this
does<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.010> little<00:04:12.310> bit<00:04:12.549> of<00:04:12.579> heft<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.590> and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
does have a little bit of heft to it and

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.990 
does have a little bit of heft to it and
if<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.030> really<00:04:16.239> just<00:04:16.539> look<00:04:16.780> top<00:04:17.109> down<00:04:18.000> it's

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
if you really just look top down it's

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.090 
if you really just look top down it's
simply<00:04:19.630> put<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.169> can<00:04:20.320> just<00:04:20.470> basically<00:04:20.620> say

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
simply put you can just basically say

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.710 
simply put you can just basically say
whether<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:21.519> yellow<00:04:21.820> there's<00:04:22.120> black<00:04:22.450> and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
whether is yellow there's black and

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.420 
whether is yellow there's black and
whenever<00:04:22.840> is<00:04:23.020> black<00:04:23.289> there's<00:04:23.560> yellow<00:04:23.800> but

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
whenever is black there's yellow but

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.370 
whenever is black there's yellow but
it's<00:04:24.669> a<00:04:24.760> little<00:04:24.910> bit<00:04:25.120> more<00:04:25.870> different<00:04:26.320> than

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
it's a little bit more different than

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.110 
it's a little bit more different than
that<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.039> I<00:04:27.220> think<00:04:27.250> there<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:27.639> going<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:28.000> be<00:04:28.060> a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
that and I think there is going to be a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.180 
that and I think there is going to be a
tu<00:04:28.900> cara<00:04:29.169> version<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.800> night<00:04:29.950> ops

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
tu cara version of the night ops

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.820 
tu cara version of the night ops
bumblebee<00:04:30.930> here<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.080> can<00:04:32.200> see<00:04:32.440> where<00:04:32.650> there's

bumblebee here you can see where there's

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.620 
bumblebee here you can see where there's
like<00:04:33.039> a<00:04:33.070> yellow<00:04:33.370> grill<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:34.300> has<00:04:34.479> actually

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
like a yellow grill this has actually

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.090 
like a yellow grill this has actually
been<00:04:34.900> painted<00:04:35.320> gold<00:04:35.590> um

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
been painted gold um

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.310 

you<00:04:38.610> know<00:04:38.700> I<00:04:38.730> like<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.240> I'm<00:04:39.330> basically<00:04:39.750> like

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
you know I like and I'm basically like

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.410 
you know I like and I'm basically like
how<00:04:40.530> it's<00:04:40.740> just<00:04:40.920> black<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.550> not<00:04:41.880> striped

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
how it's just black and not striped

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.150 
how it's just black and not striped
black<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:44.460> sides<00:04:44.790> here<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.810> can<00:04:45.990> see<00:04:46.260> they've

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
black the sides here you can see they've

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.800 
black the sides here you can see they've
done<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.610> little<00:04:48.120> bit<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.480> different

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
done a little bit of the different

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.540 
done a little bit of the different
striping<00:04:50.960> going<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.230> back<00:04:52.470> there<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.520> a

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
striping going to the back there is a

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.730 
striping going to the back there is a
little<00:04:53.880> bit<00:04:54.030> of<00:04:54.180> detail<00:04:54.570> missing<00:04:54.870> here<00:04:55.560> with

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
little bit of detail missing here with

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.590 
little bit of detail missing here with
the<00:04:55.830> little<00:04:56.180> points<00:04:57.180> would<00:04:57.330> be<00:04:57.450> the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
the little points would be the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.400 
the little points would be the
taillights<00:04:58.200> but<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:59.790> is<00:04:59.970> what<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.180> is<00:05:00.270> and

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
taillights but it is what it is and

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.260 
taillights but it is what it is and
transformation<00:05:01.410> is<00:05:01.650> just<00:05:01.710> like<00:05:02.040> drift<00:05:02.430> hold

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
transformation is just like drift hold

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
transformation is just like drift hold
the<00:05:04.940> figure<00:05:05.940> together<00:05:06.270> maybe<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:07.020> could<00:05:07.080> do<00:05:07.260> a

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
the figure together maybe I could do a

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.160 
the figure together maybe I could do a
little<00:05:07.620> bit<00:05:07.830> her<00:05:07.950> on<00:05:07.980> this<00:05:08.220> one<00:05:08.430> just<00:05:09.030> up<00:05:09.360> and

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
little bit her on this one just up and

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.370 
little bit her on this one just up and
Adam<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:12.240> know<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.480> again<00:05:12.660> that's<00:05:13.140> what<00:05:13.350> I

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
Adam you know and again that's what I

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.500 
Adam you know and again that's what I
like<00:05:13.560> about<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.950> Takara<00:05:14.340> one<00:05:14.640> they<00:05:15.000> actually

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
like about the Takara one they actually

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.890 
like about the Takara one they actually
explain<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.530> transformation<00:05:17.250> a<00:05:17.400> lot<00:05:17.640> better

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
explain the transformation a lot better

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.390 
explain the transformation a lot better
even<00:05:18.900> on<00:05:19.050> with<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.410> Hasbro<00:05:19.830> instructions

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
even on with the Hasbro instructions

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.430 
even on with the Hasbro instructions
which<00:05:20.550> are<00:05:20.640> just<00:05:20.990> dynamic<00:05:21.990> printed<00:05:22.350> on

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
which are just dynamic printed on

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.560 
which are just dynamic printed on
packaging<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.520> kind<00:05:23.820> of<00:05:23.910> makes<00:05:24.090> it<00:05:24.240> look<00:05:24.540> like

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
packaging it kind of makes it look like

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.840 
packaging it kind of makes it look like
you're<00:05:24.870> folding<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.680> car<00:05:25.920> in<00:05:26.070> half<00:05:26.280> instead

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
you're folding the car in half instead

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.420 
you're folding the car in half instead
of<00:05:27.650> bringing<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.950> front<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.400> rear

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
of bringing the front and the rear

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.670 
of bringing the front and the rear
together<00:05:30.000> because<00:05:30.540> of<00:05:30.720> how<00:05:30.870> it's<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.140> angled

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
together because of how it's the angled

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.250 
together because of how it's the angled
view<00:05:31.950> but<00:05:32.640> here<00:05:32.820> in<00:05:32.940> robot<00:05:33.330> mode<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.870> can<00:05:33.900> see

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
view but here in robot mode you can see

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.690 
view but here in robot mode you can see
that<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.680> know<00:05:34.710> why<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:34.890> lot<00:05:35.100> of<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.310> details

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
that you know why a lot of the details

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.570 
that you know why a lot of the details
carry<00:05:36.060> over<00:05:36.300> because<00:05:36.870> this<00:05:37.800> is<00:05:38.010> using<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.430> lot

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
carry over because this is using a lot

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.730 
carry over because this is using a lot
of<00:05:38.700> car<00:05:38.940> parts<00:05:38.970> which<00:05:39.900> is<00:05:40.050> very<00:05:40.260> nice<00:05:40.560> that's

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
of car parts which is very nice that's

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.490 
of car parts which is very nice that's
actually<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.280> complaint<00:05:41.700> I<00:05:41.850> get<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.060> lot<00:05:42.500> from

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
actually a complaint I get a lot from

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.530 
actually a complaint I get a lot from
collectors<00:05:44.010> is<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.640> lot<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.330> newer

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
collectors is a lot of the newer

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.280 
collectors is a lot of the newer
transformers<00:05:46.700> don't<00:05:47.700> use<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.360> parts<00:05:48.870> of<00:05:49.020> the

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
transformers don't use the parts of the

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.710 
transformers don't use the parts of the
car<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:50.130> form<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.610> limbs<00:05:50.850> it's<00:05:51.090> like<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.240> shell

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
car to form the limbs it's like a shell

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.380 
car to form the limbs it's like a shell
or<00:05:51.750> casing<00:05:52.620> or<00:05:52.770> just<00:05:53.310> flips<00:05:53.640> up<00:05:53.850> and<00:05:54.000> folds<00:05:54.300> out

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
or casing or just flips up and folds out

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.620 
or casing or just flips up and folds out
of<00:05:54.540> the<00:05:54.630> way<00:05:54.750> here<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.290> mean<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:56.340> actual<00:05:56.970> front

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
of the way here I mean the actual front

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.350 
of the way here I mean the actual front
end<00:05:57.780> of<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:57.930> car<00:05:58.020> is<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.950> chest<00:05:59.310> and<00:05:59.670> that's

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
end of the car is the chest and that's

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.020 
end of the car is the chest and that's
kind<00:06:00.660> of<00:06:00.720> cool<00:06:00.930> now<00:06:01.740> here<00:06:02.190> I<00:06:02.370> think<00:06:02.760> you<00:06:02.850> can

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
kind of cool now here I think you can

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.660 
kind of cool now here I think you can
see<00:06:03.240> where<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:04.380> dakar<00:06:04.740> version<00:06:05.280> probably

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
see where the dakar version probably

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.940 
see where the dakar version probably
shines<00:06:06.150> a<00:06:06.270> little<00:06:06.360> bit<00:06:06.570> better<00:06:06.750> where<00:06:07.620> is<00:06:07.770> how

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
shines a little bit better where is how

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.830 
shines a little bit better where is how
you<00:06:08.010> have<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:08.490> black<00:06:08.700> detailing<00:06:09.240> here<00:06:09.600> on<00:06:09.720> the

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
you have the black detailing here on the

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.650 
you have the black detailing here on the
legs<00:06:10.110> it's<00:06:10.920> just<00:06:11.190> flat<00:06:11.580> black<00:06:11.970> and<00:06:12.390> I'm

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
legs it's just flat black and I'm

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.950 
legs it's just flat black and I'm
assuming<00:06:13.050> that<00:06:13.470> on<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.830> Takara<00:06:14.250> version<00:06:14.960> if

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
assuming that on the Takara version if

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.990 
assuming that on the Takara version if
it<00:06:16.170> is<00:06:16.320> happening<00:06:16.740> I'm<00:06:16.800> not<00:06:16.920> 100<00:06:17.220> sure<00:06:17.370> will

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
it is happening I'm not 100 sure will

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.670 
it is happening I'm not 100 sure will
probably<00:06:18.360> be<00:06:18.450> some<00:06:18.480> yellow<00:06:18.930> detailing<00:06:19.590> or

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
probably be some yellow detailing or

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.830 
probably be some yellow detailing or
something<00:06:20.010> like<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.610> pop<00:06:21.570> out<00:06:21.810> the

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
something like that to pop out the

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.650 
something like that to pop out the
insides<00:06:22.530> I<00:06:22.860> do<00:06:23.130> like<00:06:23.490> how<00:06:23.700> the<00:06:23.760> hands<00:06:24.240> here<00:06:24.480> are

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
insides I do like how the hands here are

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.110 
insides I do like how the hands here are
painted<00:06:25.350> you<00:06:25.980> have<00:06:26.070> that<00:06:26.220> little<00:06:26.520> black

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
painted you have that little black
