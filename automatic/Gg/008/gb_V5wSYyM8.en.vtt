this<00:00:12.389> video<00:00:12.660> we're<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> use<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.349> very

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
this video we're going to use a very

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.259 
this video we're going to use a very
simple<00:00:13.860> way<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.280> measuring<00:00:14.490> you're<00:00:15.089> going<00:00:15.210> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
simple way of measuring you're going to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.779 
simple way of measuring you're going to
need<00:00:15.420> your<00:00:15.540> airsoft<00:00:15.900> gun<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:17.070> tape<00:00:17.520> measure

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
need your airsoft gun and a tape measure

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
need your airsoft gun and a tape measure
now<00:00:18.420> my<00:00:18.600> tape<00:00:18.810> measure<00:00:18.840> happens<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.740> show

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
now my tape measure happens to show

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.160 
now my tape measure happens to show
centimeter<00:00:20.640> markings<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.990> if<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
centimeter markings on it but if you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
centimeter markings on it but if you
need<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> convert<00:00:22.740> from<00:00:23.189> inches<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
need to convert from inches to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.050 
need to convert from inches to
millimeters<00:00:25.099> you're<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> use<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> twenty

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
millimeters you're going to use a twenty

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.300 
millimeters you're going to use a twenty
five<00:00:27.240> point<00:00:27.660> four<00:00:28.050> millimeter<00:00:28.680> conversion

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
five point four millimeter conversion

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.759 
five point four millimeter conversion
meaning<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.820> inch<00:00:30.000> equals<00:00:30.210> 25.4<00:00:30.779> millimeters

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
meaning one inch equals 25.4 millimeters

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.380 
meaning one inch equals 25.4 millimeters
so<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.640> first<00:00:32.820> thing<00:00:32.940> I'm<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.270> is

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
turn<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:33.719> airsoft<00:00:34.050> gun<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.739> end<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
turn my airsoft gun up on end to make it

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.479 
turn my airsoft gun up on end to make it
easier<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.180> myself<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:37.050> measure<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.280> next

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
easier on myself to measure the next

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.410 
easier on myself to measure the next
thing<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.700> want<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.090> kind<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.360> start

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
thing you want to do is kind of start

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.600 
thing you want to do is kind of start
from<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.350> inner<00:00:40.649> barrel<00:00:41.100> starts

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
from where your inner barrel starts

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.660 
from where your inner barrel starts
inside<00:00:42.090> your<00:00:42.329> outer<00:00:42.480> barrel<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.670> measure

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
inside your outer barrel and measure

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.840 
inside your outer barrel and measure
back<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> where<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:47.100> hop-up<00:00:47.370> unit

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
back to where the hop-up unit

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.260 
back to where the hop-up unit
feed<00:00:48.300> tube<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.829> from<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.730> point<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
feed tube is now from that point you

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.209 
feed tube is now from that point you
want<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> subtract<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.320> five<00:00:52.710> millimeters

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
want to subtract about five millimeters

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.459 
want to subtract about five millimeters
to<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.480> where<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> end<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> inner

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
to get to where the end of the inner

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.099 
to get to where the end of the inner
barrel<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.690> coming<00:00:57.899> up

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
barrel actually is and this is coming up

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.330 
barrel actually is and this is coming up
about<00:00:59.989> 363<00:01:00.989> millimeters<00:01:01.530> which<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.309> know

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
about 363 millimeters which as you know

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.060 
about 363 millimeters which as you know
is<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.699> pretty<00:01:02.969> standard<00:01:03.359> size<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.229> m4s<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
is a pretty standard size for m4s of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.789 
is a pretty standard size for m4s of
course<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.210> always<00:01:06.450> adjust<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.500> length

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
course I can always adjust that length

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
course I can always adjust that length
depending<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.760> I'm<00:01:08.909> using<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.450> for

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
depending on what I'm using it for

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.109 
depending on what I'm using it for
there's<00:01:10.290> absolutely<00:01:10.890> no<00:01:11.220> issue<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.909> going

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
there's absolutely no issue with going

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.240 
there's absolutely no issue with going
with<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> shorter<00:01:13.020> inner<00:01:13.290> barrel<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:13.979> also

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
with a shorter inner barrel you can also

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.609 
with a shorter inner barrel you can also
add<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> mock<00:01:15.210> suppressor<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> longer

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
add on a mock suppressor to get a longer

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.200 
add on a mock suppressor to get a longer
inner<00:01:16.950> barrel<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.640> hide<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
inner barrel it will hide it and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
inner barrel it will hide it and
increase<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> tactical<00:01:19.530> look<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.890> your

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
increase the tactical look of your

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
increase the tactical look of your
airsoft<00:01:20.400> gun<00:01:20.700> keep<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.270> mind<00:01:21.479> though<00:01:21.630> when

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
airsoft gun keep in mind though when

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.300 
airsoft gun keep in mind though when
adjusting<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.470> inner<00:01:22.680> barrel<00:01:23.070> length

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
adjusting your inner barrel length

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
adjusting your inner barrel length
either<00:01:23.549> really<00:01:24.119> shorter<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> lot<00:01:25.080> longer<00:01:25.350> be

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
either really shorter or a lot longer be

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.859 
either really shorter or a lot longer be
mindful<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> type<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> cylinder<00:01:27.689> you're

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
mindful of the type of cylinder you're

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.080
