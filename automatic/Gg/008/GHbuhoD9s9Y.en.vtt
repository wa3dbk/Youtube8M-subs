start<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> most<00:00:43.620> pointless<00:00:44.129> one<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
start with the most pointless one and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.910 
start with the most pointless one and
work<00:00:45.030> our<00:00:45.239> way<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.500> sorry<00:00:46.500> about<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> lack

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of visuals and also my voice but I think

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.920 
of visuals and also my voice but I think
you've<00:00:51.030> gotten<00:00:51.210> used<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> me<00:00:51.629> throwing
