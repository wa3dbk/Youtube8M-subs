that's gonna work out to be a couple of
teaspoons<00:04:26.300> we<00:04:27.300> can<00:04:27.450> add<00:04:27.630> more<00:04:27.930> if<00:04:28.080> we<00:04:28.260> decide

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
teaspoons we can add more if we decide

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.650 
teaspoons we can add more if we decide
we<00:04:28.620> want<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.430> little<00:04:30.300> salt<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.850> then<00:04:34.070> just<00:04:35.070> a

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.390 
nice little swirl or two of olive oil
and<00:04:40.080> we'll<00:04:40.230> toss<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.770> up

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.250 

and<00:04:46.400> that's<00:04:46.580> all<00:04:46.730> there<00:04:46.880> is<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.420> so<00:04:48.400> now

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
and that's all there is to it so now

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.749 
and that's all there is to it so now
let's<00:04:51.260> open<00:04:51.470> those<00:04:51.830> parchment<00:04:52.310> packages

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.579 

okay<00:04:57.419> now<00:04:57.779> you<00:04:57.839> have<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.139> careful<00:04:58.529> with

00:04:58.579 --> 00:04:58.589 
okay now you have to be careful with

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:59.779 
okay now you have to be careful with
these<00:04:58.710> one<00:04:58.919> of<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.069> reasons<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.460> let<00:04:59.610> them

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
these one of the reasons you let them

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.290 
these one of the reasons you let them
sit<00:05:00.089> is<00:05:00.659> to<00:05:00.960> let<00:05:01.289> the<00:05:01.409> steam<00:05:01.710> die<00:05:01.979> down<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:03.120> that

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
sit is to let the steam die down so that

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.209 
sit is to let the steam die down so that
you<00:05:03.449> don't<00:05:03.629> burn<00:05:03.900> yourself<00:05:04.139> when<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:04.919> open

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
you don't burn yourself when you open

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.679 
you don't burn yourself when you open
them<00:05:05.339> also<00:05:06.349> just<00:05:07.349> finish<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.770> off<00:05:08.069> to<00:05:08.279> cooking

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
them also just finish it off to cooking

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:15.969 
them also just finish it off to cooking
and<00:05:09.689> go<00:05:11.240> see<00:05:12.240> there's<00:05:12.419> quite<00:05:12.659> a<00:05:12.689> bit<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:12.900> liquid

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.980 

so<00:05:16.979> I'm<00:05:17.309> just<00:05:17.580> going<00:05:17.729> to<00:05:17.759> take<00:05:17.999> the<00:05:18.449> vegetables

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
so I'm just going to take the vegetables

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.260 
so I'm just going to take the vegetables
like<00:05:19.139> so<00:05:22.339> the<00:05:23.339> whole<00:05:23.520> thing<00:05:23.789> right<00:05:23.969> over<00:05:24.180> to

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
like so the whole thing right over to

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.570
