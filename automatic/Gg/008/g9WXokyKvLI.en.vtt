00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.630
 in alice in wonderland ride 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.710
 in wonderland is a dj selector of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.350
 four pages will ask for two 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.260
 throws for me no tool can be 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.910
 free do not worry relax good it's 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.470
 still not 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.420
 I do not like dancing but I 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.980
 I like the dj selector to go 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.400
 to be interested in what is happening 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.380
 this week in the selection of the dj 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:37.880
 selector game you have right inc yutz 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.880
 it was nice to talk to you limited 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 finally 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.360
 hello it's arnaud rebotini in 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.360
 selector 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.299
 so I'm motivated again I'm on 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 will say composer producer and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.259
 singer and dj am a little schizophrenic 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 in music I like to go for a style 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.840
 to another one will summarize my career my 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.409
 solo career under armor at the betting 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.009
 which is really pretty techno 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.479
 classical 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.030
 I'm trying to do it quite 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.360
 modern the other rock side is called 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.080
 blackstrobe and who she tends more 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.479
 neo disco with intention towards the south 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.600
 the blues are sometimes big 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600
 guitars 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.369
 and that's it and I think it's a 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.630
 finally quite classic approach 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.249
 baroque in general to use the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.560
 old instruments for karine music 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:02.049
 modern is a rock band that have 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.179
 says to in sixties who does things 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.409
 very modern 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.630
 I try to be a little like that love 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.200
 instruments to make a music 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.200
 current 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.550
 and right now I'm trying to 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.650
 finish writing the max 3 bay album 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.420
 a maxi kg output with a 12th that goes 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.420
 go out here at wholesale 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.160
 there he is the dj these two things 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.560
 different there is an incredible pleasure 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.290
 in live and another very different 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.740
 in the budget so first piece 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.750
 to place a young South African artist who 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.060
 is called little black it comes out at urban 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.340
 life red label the two autocrats I 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.680
 find his music really interesting 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.050
 especially completely offset with 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.120
 the idea that we can make ourselves the newcomer 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.730
 and from my head that there because the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.350
 southern African traits not what 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.060
 was holding the reins before and what was 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.570
 a little exploited and it does a kind of 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.850
 cold wave on the trocl has almost qualified 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.910
 afro rating with some talent we see 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.910
 the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.290
 second type of my playlist 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.020
 I have a little I choose more by the clip 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.460
 which was a bit produced and a style 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.720
 subway pie ix namely crisis is a 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.090
 little everything that is a bit naked or disks 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.160
 or black or the things I like 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.440
 play that are pretty musical very 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.530
 dances are mean are these 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.850
 chances are a free dry turbo etc 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.850
 reckless with your love 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.830
 he 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.200
 m 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.630
 so third title my playlist down 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.580
 it's the best 10 tracks dance of 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.330
 all the time so that's good of will 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.010
 fashion depeche 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.840
 so we will be absolutely indisputable 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.730
 coming because it's a song to 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.230
 absolute romanticism a perfect song 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.610
 and an unstoppable dance piece so I 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.880
 think we 've never done better than 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.880
 never had 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.439
 fourth title of my break east so 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.360
 it's a little autopromo semiane wagner 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.159
 so we went that I created a 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.580
 product that just came out a 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:17.090
 little already jumped of m the clip is pretty 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.090
 town case 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.490
 we 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.510
 Yes 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.980
 fifth and last choice of my 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.470
 playlist 7 garnier this is maybe the 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.480
 the best is 1.1 m coolness 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.220
 absolute it's johnny guitar watson so 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.330
 1 1 12 classic man who has a cart 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.220
 blues guitarist and who has a period 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.410
 disco and his hyper speech pair 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.790
 interesting it's a little influenced 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.790
 important right now for me 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.149
 only that 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.950
 Custom 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.500
 the audience to the ears 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.949
 green 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.590
 2 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.590
 6 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:07:00.110
