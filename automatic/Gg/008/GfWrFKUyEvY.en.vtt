like<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.450> obviously<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> power<00:01:40.650> cable

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
like this obviously with the power cable

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
like this obviously with the power cable
going<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> other<00:01:41.520> side<00:01:42.049> mounts<00:01:43.049> into<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
like this the GPS snaps into that pulls

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
like this the GPS snaps into that pulls
the<00:01:46.079> power<00:01:46.259> through<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> cradle<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.100> then

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the power through the cradle and then

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.469 
the power through the cradle and then
