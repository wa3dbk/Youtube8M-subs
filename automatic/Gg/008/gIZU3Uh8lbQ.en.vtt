00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.690
 let's try all the same to understand 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.550
 with theory is to deal with 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.490
 theory we need to cheat on try 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.019
 understand what phimosis is and for that 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.450
 we will need this young one 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.070
 man because everyone has already appeared 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.289
 a lot of questions what is he doing here 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.710
 probably know those who regularly 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.360
 watching our show 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.369
 heard a lot of my artistic 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.710
 abilities so when we were preparing 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.609
 to this program our director fell at his feet 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.829
 asked me not to draw anything 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:37.329
 so we decided to draw this one 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.120
 a young man who will be with us 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:54.100
 how would a dummy farm here 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:57.129
 imagine that is how would he us 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.199
 just help without pictures all 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.030
 explain and children can stay near 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.480
 TVs as you understand the truth and 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:11.280
 so there is a head that is not visible there 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:15.880
 foreskin with phimosis phimosis this situation 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.300
 when you can not bare the head when 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.840
 head exposure impossible phimosis 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.350
 There are two types 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.620
 physiological phimosis 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.570
 normal natural phimosis is 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.850
 inability to bare the head off 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:41.350
 boy before the end of the genital period 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:48.000
 maturation everything is clear that is again 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:49.870
 pay attention phimosis to 15 years is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.690
 physiology 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:57.220
 This rule is understandable, but sometimes you are moss 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.900
 pathological phimosis as a disease 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.020
 when 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.300
 adult or after graduation 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.630
 puberty head is not 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.420
 moves back or another option when we 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.990
 could free the head for example in 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.300
 ten years and at 11 we can not that is if 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.460
 it happened this too should not be 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.560
 if already at the age of ten it was opened then 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.100
 11 it should open even more 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.360
 this way if we discuss the topic 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:33.790
 boy boy then phimosis for boy 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.820
 this is the norm this is physiology dear friends 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.680
