00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 I want to ask some air 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.109
 breathe in those parts is without doubt 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.050
 also here from the lagoon 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.179
 the area is sad, it's just morning 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.089
 it's half past eight 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.740
 clearly everyone knows 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.439
 very sad news 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.900
 news and everyone right now we are 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.510
 absolutely close to the family 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 we say difficult to comment and I can not 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.800
 comment because I have not seen images 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.859
 I still only heard and I read that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 which was written sad then sad 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.120
 because similar incidents do not occur 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.910
 they never want to see they wouldn't want to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.000
 never see real reason then saw that 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.020
 you also played an important role 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 I say to avoid such things that 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.690
 what should we get to do 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.270
 I explain to you was blamed on 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.250
 track and I think the track is good or bad 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.570
 has little to do with it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 antonelli falls and after two three seconds 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.810
 even that on the ground wrapped by a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 water cloud is hit by another 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.930
 unfortunate Italian unfortunately therefore i 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.810
 reaction times are really long 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.689
 indeed from the images it even turns out 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.189
 that there was no reaction from 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.210
 part of zanetti in the sense that he has it 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:31.290
 hit without having seen it so I don't know 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.420
 how but like like I said before I don't have 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.400
 seen the images therefore also difficult 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.630
 command over something you haven't seen 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.450
 what I say is unfortunately incidents 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.649
 where the pilot is overwhelmed by that 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.409
 following him 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.979
 they are impossible to be able to 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.920
 resolve in the sense unfortunately they are not 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.969
 accidents that the security does not count 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 it matters because it is impossible to solve us 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.189
 we are working a lot for safety for 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.600
 the circuits for a thousand things but this 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.479
 kind of accidents like that unfortunately 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.099
 that even simoncelli happened if it happened 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.550
 they will see again we hope not to see 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.379
 never, however, can loris still happen 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.450
 you rightly say I can't comment 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.640
 not having seen the images then 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.349
 rightly you cannot express yourself more than 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.420
 so much about something you haven't seen though 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.790
 then I ask you just for yours 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.940
 not a pilot experience when you are 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.780
 in an atmospheric condition in this 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.599
 case because visibility was 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.760
 the conditions are very small for the time 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.099
 of the time I ask you then as a pilot 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.209
 when you find yourself having to start 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:46.800
 having to start running in situations that 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.510
 you know they are even more risky 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.640
 then there really should be 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.140
 do something because then as you say 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.269
 time and fatality 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.340
 sometimes the fatality can be 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.349
 avoided but I say that in 330 races that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.030
 I have done world-wide it happened also to 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.099
 you in more than one occasion to compete 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.540
 in difficult weather conditions ie 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.580
 rain of so much rain 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.230
 clearly on that occasion the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.860
 visibility and many times minimum and it is not 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.550
 perfect 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.620
 I say that when the visibility 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.050
 absolutely not good or acceptable 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.000
 the races and must be stopped 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.440
 clearly what we do anyway 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.330
 let's always do as I said 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.950
 I have seen absolutely no images 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.720
 I don't know what kind of conditions it was 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.390
 read since it was definitely there 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.299
 rain so I can't comment 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.430
 let's say the fact but I say that when there 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.930
 they are like sic scampi conditions 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.510
 we say difficult to visibility 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.450
 absolutely right to stop this 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.140
 knew 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.599
 andrea unfortunately I didn't know him though 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.330
 this thing struck me very much 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.280
 because for me they are like children like 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.590
 of the companions 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.830
 I did it for many years and I have 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.709
 an incredible sadness inside 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.470
 because in the end it's a pilot you hear 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.720
 always invincible but unfortunately in the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.269
 things happen in life 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.410
 such 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.810
 but also yours from this point of 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.030
 view because talking is with travel 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.180
 first even with your fellow pilots or 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.160
 former pilots a concept emerged on 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.350
 which I wanted to know how you think it is 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.630
 difficult and perhaps for this reason does not exist 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.250
 still an organism that is above all 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.050
 and that collects the opinions of the pilots is 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.210
 that he decides when is the case 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.710
 there is no need to run because everyone is there 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.660
 they said it is very difficult to put 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.000
 pilots agree because the pilot 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.979
 perhaps by nature and always thinks of himself and 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.300
 so if that day feels like doing 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.830
 the great performance is not able 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.440
 maybe lucidly say no better 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.860
 stop and don't run if the agreement doesn't 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.210
 well i think everyone gets along 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.729
 it's always very difficult 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.220
 I must say that on our side in 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.320
 motogp we have a safety commission 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.030
 important we are all working well 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.070
 these years pilots are very united 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.600
 from this point of view then 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.090
 we always try to analyze 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.169
 situation after situation to search 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.720
 to always improve 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.419
 but it is clear that everyone agrees 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.940
 this is not never sure sure 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.650
 but a character like you with yours 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.840
 experience and above all with yours 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.330
 empathy for pilots because 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.220
 I can tell you you are anyway 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.889
 recognized by all 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:29.760
 you're nice everyone nobody talks badly 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:31.740
 so you have a certain charisma for you 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.390
 it is a beautiful responsibility in the sense that 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.440
 I mean everybody trusts 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.210
 you certainly have a high responsibility 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.840
 but I have to say that the relationship of 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.400
 trust between us and the pilots is 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.190
 very high so the phone rings me 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.740
 on many occasions and they ask me 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.720
 advice ask me to do something e 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.880
 there are always absolutely us 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.180
 we are always absolutely at the service 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.040
 of pilots to make them say the 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.960
 safer and simpler races possible 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.190
 we are here for those then 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.340
 let's make it easier 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.530
 although unfortunately as you said fatality 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.130
 they are fatal and cannot be canceled 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.130
 all
