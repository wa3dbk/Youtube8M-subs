00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.790
 beautiful all boy are j and here we are 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.770
 after the beauty of a week 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.380
 come back with a new new video 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.630
 episode of the skill is broken glory on 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.639
 seventh seems to me and how I had it 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.139
 promised in the past two episodes I will go 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.410
 to make me a new team and a team 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.660
 obviously to scream anyway vi 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.240
 I ask to leave a like immediately 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.300
 for the return because oh well it was one 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.150
 quite challenging week and it is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.630
 it was an episode in which you nevertheless 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.300
 I bring three games here as you have seen 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.850
 I immediately went to buy medium of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.730
 a great schoeler then the bus to fa 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.460
 eto'o, however, training is calibrated 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.710
 that I chose the 4 5 1 is a module that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.670
 personally I didn't like it much earlier 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.770
 to prove it with this team here are the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.239
 the players I choose are among mine 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.039
 schoeler favorite vabbè eto'o ha 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.780
 only four stars but I bought it 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.840
 by agreement and in any case I needed a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.120
 fast attacker is still a hybrid 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 it's not a team based on just one 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.400
 nation but on the Russian league on the bpl 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.260
 then morocco and also on france 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.869
 in short, for that it also aroused to 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.720
 use kabul 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.939
 diakite seems to me and frey is a team 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.590
 I must say really very nice there 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.530
 I recommend more than anything because it costs 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.909
 I also bought little as you saw 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.009
 also kabul 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.220
 great defender and this right back 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.520
 which is good used to make agreement to me 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.890
 who of how and then I go to buy the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.330
 sissoko of my cast all 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.280
 a very very strong player 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.940
 it was used as you tell us but I like them 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.610
 very much his warcraft since you love to 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.580
 aids it seems to me it is therefore the level of 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.570
 average attack and defense intensity 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.000
 high 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.490
 I immediately go to create a new one 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.860
 rose for pink generating judgment use for 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.409
 do it first of course 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.720
 here is a very very nice team 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.990
 Assaidi I took it to the left as 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.350
 who in any case had 9 in agreement having 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.050
 josè enrique and tar out then two links 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.239
 green and go to put in too 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.040
 the players obviously more bench 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.500
 tired to make them rest as a thing 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.170
 I recommend this instead of buying 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.120
 the physical forms and in any case I tell you 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.890
 immediately that shitty porter 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.239
 kawashima nicolò them of the other team 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.209
 I will change silver because it makes me 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.010
 really worth it and i will still buy a 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.450
 Algerian goalkeeper always of the standard 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.070
 liege 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.900
 however first game against one 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.890
 bpl team i really have to say 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.170
 very very strong and already after 4 minutes me 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.510
 in short, I had left the view 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.250
 last episode to try 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.340
 to climb since in any case we see a lot 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.070
 well from a distance but here I will change it 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.720
 right here I wanted to change it already because 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.610
 indeed free hours indeed now the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.680
 change here I leave nations really a lot 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.790
 long but very very beautiful 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.380
 started by maggie who then finds out if 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.140
 in short, it comes from said on the band 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.180
 left passing by tar out ev safa e 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.459
 a lot of with a little skill try 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.019
 drunk the opposing defenders to the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.150
 end I can 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.700
 I also do a roulette before 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.829
 cross and find the tok in the head the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.760
 really puts a nice one in 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.620
 goals 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.100
 a long action, however, nothing 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.620
 still a nice action and here 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.959
 I can always find another goal with 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.610
 eto'o look at maggie cross on the fly 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.070
 first come first 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.920
 the non- goal goal paraded with actions 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.570
 very beautiful a beautiful goal and 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.900
 sometimes and also nice to see these 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.360
 goals 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.370
 the opponent decides to retreat e 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.260
 so victory by 2 to 1 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.760
 I must say deserved, however, because mine 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.390
 opponent must be made at the bottom of that shot 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.680
 so I'm going to look for a new one 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.380
 opponent here didn't find me matches 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.390
 in fact my connection lately 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.330
 very dancer like I say in every 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.190
 video practically and here is that 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.930
 meets an opponent with a bpl 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.390
 we say practically from Manchester 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.270
 united and some English players 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.970
 then there was the inter then randomly placed 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.660
 a rather strange team 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.000
 in any case with however going into 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.829
 advantage with samuel eto'o who does 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.169
 really good action here receives 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.990
 from right-back right ronaldo this falls 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.430
 with a touch of sole a fake and then 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.520
 truly end with you right 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.470
 very precise however in the second half the 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.450
 my opponent puts the bug he puts in 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.910
 medical and at the first opportunity to score 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.320
 for him he can find this goal is 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.720
 still pretty nice with the 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.310
 sleeves a nice volley 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.080
 but wrap equal to the ninetieth I wanted 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.620
 absolutely win a right from the outside 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.240
 area that deserves a truly replay 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.190
 beautiful goal taranto in this 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.810
 episode made two beautiful goals a 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.770
 and this is the other you will see in the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.229
 next game so I also win the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.090
 second game for 2 1 the 90th are 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.430
 was a bit lucky but here is a goal 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.840
 really very nice I'm going to look 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.300
 the last game against this 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.860
 opponent fell a lot team 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.169
 stronger than anywhere else he played 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.120
 cono true high but had an understanding 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.470
 quite poor at 91 that would be 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.410
 was 81 without the boss he had 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.510
 however bumpers in olic attack 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.040
 fabregas xabi alonso the home page o 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.910
 however the overall players are high and 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.849
 here he immediately finds this goal more or less 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.400
 in seems in the 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.650
 however, in the second half, however, count 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.710
 out look back with ascom being able to 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.569
 then very precise surgical right 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.330
 really tar guys got a monster 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.970
 which assigns we tell the person in shape 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.830
 I don't like it but he comes back in anyway 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.780
 game leftovers is doubled with 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.150
 esseen and then second shot for him 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.479
 second goal I tried to attack in 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.460
 all the ways plus the bulls afa great 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.629
 scott then returns with his agility passes 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.190
 in the middle of 4 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:03.389
 eto'o of head puts it inside 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:06.610
 ninetieth we are two with two faces 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.620
 because it deserves it or it is in any case 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.599
 extra time he finds with van 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.530
 third third goal is really 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.960
 here it makes you angry because I am all 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.190
 times on I take we say goals to each 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.229
 whole that make my do 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.569
 opponent however this episode yes 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.190
 concludes here with a defeat then 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.389
 two wins a defeat I remember 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.620
