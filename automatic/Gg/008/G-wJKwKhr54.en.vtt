looks like it's just a plain white
t-shirt<00:03:45.700> but<00:03:45.940> if<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.630> look<00:03:46.810> up<00:03:47.049> close<00:03:47.079> and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
it's kind of I don't really know how to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.670 
it's kind of I don't really know how to
describe<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.390> really<00:03:52.720> odd<00:03:53.019> pattern

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
describe it it's a really odd pattern

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.860 
describe it it's a really odd pattern
and<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:55.959> texture<00:03:56.650> it's<00:03:56.980> like<00:03:57.250> leave<00:03:57.609> I<00:03:57.910> ended

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
and like texture it's like leave I ended

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.930 
and like texture it's like leave I ended
in<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.290> certain<00:03:59.560> way<00:03:59.829> to

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
in a certain way to

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.910 
in a certain way to
make<00:04:01.030> this<00:04:01.180> pattern<00:04:01.660> stand<00:04:02.140> up<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.650> it's<00:04:02.770> kind

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
make this pattern stand up so it's kind

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.240 
make this pattern stand up so it's kind
of<00:04:03.010> 3d<00:04:04.050> but<00:04:05.050> i'll<00:04:05.230> put<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.500> clothes<00:04:05.680> up<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:06.040> so

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
of 3d but i'll put the clothes up in so

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.290 
of 3d but i'll put the clothes up in so
that<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.460> can<00:04:06.580> kind<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.790> tell<00:04:07.030> what<00:04:07.210> I'm

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
that you can kind of tell what I'm

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.910 
that you can kind of tell what I'm
talking<00:04:07.660> about<00:04:07.750> but<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.440> just<00:04:08.620> thought<00:04:08.740> it<00:04:08.860> was

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
talking about but I just thought it was

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.250 
talking about but I just thought it was
such<00:04:09.100> an<00:04:09.220> interesting<00:04:09.550> pattern<00:04:09.880> so<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.750> got

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
such an interesting pattern so I got

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.230 
such an interesting pattern so I got
that<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.770> this<00:04:12.130> looks<00:04:12.370> really<00:04:12.670> cute<00:04:12.940> tucked

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
that and this looks really cute tucked

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.720 
that and this looks really cute tucked
into<00:04:13.420> like<00:04:13.960> a<00:04:14.110> little<00:04:14.440> skater<00:04:14.740> skirt<00:04:15.130> or<00:04:15.370> some

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
into like a little skater skirt or some

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.970 
into like a little skater skirt or some
high-waisted<00:04:15.910> shorts<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.870> then<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.680> went<00:04:17.890> to

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
high-waisted shorts and then I went to

good<00:04:43.900> on<00:04:44.020> me<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.440> but<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.340> top<00:04:45.610> it's

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
good on me and but this is the top it's

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.940 
good on me and but this is the top it's
just<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.420> little<00:04:46.660> crop<00:04:46.930> top<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.410> it's<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.740> pink

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
just a little crop top and it's a pink

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.250 
just a little crop top and it's a pink
and<00:04:48.070> white<00:04:48.190> pattern<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.840> I've<00:04:49.960> not<00:04:50.140> actually

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
and white pattern and I've not actually

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.130 
and white pattern and I've not actually
worn<00:04:50.710> this<00:04:50.800> yet<00:04:51.160> but<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.600> think<00:04:52.720> this<00:04:52.960> would

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
worn this yet but I think this would

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.260 
worn this yet but I think this would
look<00:04:53.170> really<00:04:53.590> nice<00:04:53.830> with<00:04:53.890> just<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.700> black
