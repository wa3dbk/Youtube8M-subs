 we have britain 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.350
 generally on the bottom 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.800
 diaphragmatic breathing it begins 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.590
 here 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.200
 by this very same we will visit the bottom

 Yushchenko also breathe in principle 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.630
 normal life every workout in 3d times 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.929
 starts with mandatory 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.029
 instructing on breathing technique 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 proper breathing is the most important thing 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.849
 for those who swim underwater without 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.369
 oxygen cylinders 5 how the environment breathes 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.169

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.489
 Kuryanov today is 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:37.379
 the only one in the republic 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.930
 an instructor for this sport in his 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690
 case this is exactly the example when 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.420
 passion grows into something 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.300
 more and gradually changes 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420
 worldview 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 I already have 4 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 about great condition 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.290
 two extra 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.290
 closer interaction 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.720
 that is, the whole life did not 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.310
 easier to treat 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.280
 both in Russia and abroad annually 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.570
 competitions are held on 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.630
 freediving but for you the Russian Federation from mari el 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.159
 it still remains something like 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.159
 extreme infatuation sometimes with 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.280
 practical bias 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.220
 For example, Alexander Putin is engaged in 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.540
 Fedorinov to 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.340
 cultivate in another fund 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.790
 underwater hunting 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.170
 lots of 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.210
 still not seen how people are engaged 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.560
 underwater hunting 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 but a number interested 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 at the institute once tried what is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.040
 the capital is hooked 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.180
 through friends found maxims and decided 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.939
 to try 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.790
 need a lot of new 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.010
 because all agree their 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.120
 the nuances of their subtleties 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.030
 but myself that later was me 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 need this increased delay 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.080
 breathing under water 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.650
 as for the financial aspect 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.900
 then free and perhaps not the most 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.920
 expensive sport 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.720
 you have damask wetsuits here and 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.560
 all that is required freediver from him 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.470
 Of course deal more expensively in 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.690
 the pools of stock exchanges corals today 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.709
 increased but in summer you can 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.709
 like to dive on the lakes of maria el 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.579
 the cleanest 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.789
 he has a failure 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.159
 in the summer or winter on the lake in the pool or 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.309
 at sea wednesday young remains unique 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:40.679
 fondness allowing 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.729
 be there where there is no urban bustle and 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.819
 traffic jams constantly calls to mobiles 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.730
 and other example of modern life 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.659
 not only relieve stress but also find a way 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.510
 to myself returning carts 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.480
 the cradle of life is perhaps the most important 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.370
 the opportunity that gives Fedorenko 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.970
 probably that is why most 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.260
 of those who tried once free 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.989
 dive back to this 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:00.860
 in math
