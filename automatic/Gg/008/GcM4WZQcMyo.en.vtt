00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
you're actually going to pull the sugar

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.560 
you're actually going to pull the sugar
paste<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:56.020> needs<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.620> be<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:57.820> too<00:01:58.180> thin

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
paste it needs to be not too thin

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.290 
paste it needs to be not too thin
because<00:01:58.810> if<00:01:59.020> it's<00:01:59.170> too<00:01:59.440> thin<00:01:59.770> then<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:01.090> will

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
because if it's too thin then it will

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.630 
because if it's too thin then it will
actually<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.870> break<00:02:02.170> away<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:03.370> won't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
actually just break away it won't

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.730 
actually just break away it won't
actually<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:04.060> deal<00:02:04.330> on<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.780> skin<00:02:05.170> over<00:02:05.500> hair

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
actually a deal on to the skin over hair

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.940 
actually a deal on to the skin over hair
so<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.070> needs<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:07.170> not<00:02:08.170> too<00:02:08.440> thick<00:02:08.710> either

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
so it needs to be not too thick either

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.360 
so it needs to be not too thick either
it's<00:02:09.459> like<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.690> medium<00:02:10.690> thickness<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:12.160> once

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
it's like a medium thickness so once

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's like a medium thickness so once
you've<00:02:12.550> actually<00:02:12.700> got<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.209> little<00:02:13.420> lip<00:02:13.600> area

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
you've actually got the little lip area

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.100 
you've actually got the little lip area
which<00:02:14.380> needs<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.920> be<00:02:15.040> very<00:02:15.910> thick<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.810> can

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
which needs to be very thick so you can

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.330 
which needs to be very thick so you can
actually<00:02:17.910> pull<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.030> off<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.480> grab<00:02:19.690> hold<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.080> it
