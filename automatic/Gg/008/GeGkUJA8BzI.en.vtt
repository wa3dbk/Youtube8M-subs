00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello to all that I hope you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.850
 okay here a property of the agent 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.429
 steve heit then today we're going 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.080
 move on to the second part of this tutorial 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.120
 tutorial titled creating a mockup 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.920
 complex web graphics that you 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.080
 will find in my profile on 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 twitter.com is so wrong this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.710
 training will be devoted to cutting and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.529
 to the montage html css of the latter 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.869
 so here's a little glimpse of the dusit 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.500
 goes up so we will start by creating 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.759
 our homepage of course with all 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 the links that will be active 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.860
 a little cider jquery so there is that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.110
 three images and it's the same picture that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.079
 repeats itself it's normal you'll be free 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.090
 to put as much as you like 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.910
 our guarantee blocks that we had created 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 above who are active in the link 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.879
 active 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.739
 and then the little block in a few words 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 and then a little active footer 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.930
 also a little more an aesthetic effect 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.000
 to rollover on small icons of 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.040
 social networks we have small effects 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.110
 of transparency 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.670
 of course and in the slider there are also some 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.200
 buttons next previous 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 so we'll see how to change if you 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.860
 want to put that in French nex and 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.920
 the brief 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.100
 we decline the page presentations 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.570
 with this block we find the block 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.409
 guarantees a little more deploy the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.200
 references so the same with this system 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.659
 of opacity to the rollover so there the interest 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.439
 to dereference that we will create a 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.020
 little gallery jquery so click 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.770
 of course the image will be displayed in addition 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.750
 great and you see there we created by 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.579
 example a group of four because we 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.860
 had four references in the print 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.130
 world so we created a group of four 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.350
 images a following images two next 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.729
 images three following image 4 this is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.140
 always the same rim images that get 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.320
 repeat a it's normal it's for 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.619
 example and then we created a second 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.030
 group for sent artwork 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.950
 four images too which is repeated so 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.440
 it's still the same image that appears 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.670
 at normal so here we will see how 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.420
 we create groups 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.560
 all this in dreamweaver and manage at 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.260
 better our livebox 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.819
 we will not decline the pages 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.940
 customers and useful links because 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.290
 now you know how to make pages 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:33.020
 web so free to you to create your 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.690
 own pages and a contact page 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.030
 so we'll see how to install a 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.630
 contact form in css3 and in 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.970
 html5 with a php send on will see 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.780
 how to use also easyphp in order to 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.910
 do our mailing tests so it's very 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.930
 simple it's a pretty small form 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.590
 aesthetic at the click 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.430
 well it gets a little clearer if 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.350
 we never forget anything 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.700
 to inform I do not know a field where by 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.299
 example an email you see the harm is 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.700
 not valid 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.470
 he will tell us tac please enter 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.380
 a valid email address 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.650
 ok good great we will put Damien ral 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.840
 bastille melty.fr is sent here 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.519
 I forgot to write a message in you 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.890
 so say it so we write a little 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.780
 message and we click send and the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.670
 voiceless message directly in our 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.440
 mailboxes of course we will also integrate 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.890
 a small google maps 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.060
 history of doing of course his site so 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.790
 there it is better to have a minimum 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.709
 basic html css to be able to well 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.060
 follow the very formation of the bases of 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.340
 beginners class that there I'm not going 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.310
 to intervene on the related explanations 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.109
 to the basics to tags and classes etc 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.390
 if it's a first for you then 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.570
 down I advise you rather this 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.880
 training that you will find also on 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.739
 my profile 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.280
 this one will be a little bit more adapted 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.620
 for beginners it is really focused 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.350
 beginner with lots of explanations and 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.340
 full of tips 1 to get started 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.140
 so here we are we will not see 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.630
 in this training how to make this 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.040
 full responsive website because the model is 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.450
 a little bit too complex 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.920
 I'm afraid that beginners will be a 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.049
 little bit lost so the full 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.910
 responsive will be for the next 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.430
 training 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.570
 so I tell you very good tutorial and I 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.570
 find you right away
