but it's gonna be well I personally

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
think it's gonna be very fallout ask

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.250 
think it's gonna be very fallout ask
because<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.760> believe<00:02:48.030> fallout<00:02:48.570> was<00:02:48.780> kind<00:02:49.140> of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
because I believe fallout was kind of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.320 
because I believe fallout was kind of
loosely<00:02:49.530> based<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.130> Mad<00:02:50.400> Max<00:02:50.700> right<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.209> i'm

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
loosely based on Mad Max right if i'm

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.660 
loosely based on Mad Max right if i'm
not<00:02:51.450> mistaken<00:02:51.600> maybe<00:02:52.530> i'm<00:02:52.739> just<00:02:52.769> talking<00:02:53.580> out

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
not mistaken maybe i'm just talking out

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.670 
not mistaken maybe i'm just talking out
of<00:02:53.730> my<00:02:53.850> ass<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.390> don't<00:02:54.570> know<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:54.930> that's<00:02:55.380> what<00:02:55.620> I

of my ass I don't know but that's what I
thought<00:02:56.130> anyway<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.239> gonna<00:02:57.360> be<00:02:57.540> very
