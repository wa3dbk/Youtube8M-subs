it um so I'm gonna upload today directly
um<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.190> I'm<00:00:38.280> gonna<00:00:38.370> do

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
um I think this is what I'm gonna do

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.819 
um I think this is what I'm gonna do
about<00:00:38.670> uploading<00:00:39.030> we'll<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> sticks

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
about uploading we'll see if the sticks

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.569 
about uploading we'll see if the sticks
I<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.879> could<00:00:42.120> um<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.550> been

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I really think it could um I have been

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
I really think it could um I have been
known<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> past<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.960> make<00:00:46.140> promises<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
known in the past to make promises and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.209 
known in the past to make promises and
keep<00:00:47.370> them<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> also<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> opposite<00:00:49.860> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
keep them and also do the opposite so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.600 
keep them and also do the opposite so
it's<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.850> hit<00:00:51.120> or<00:00:51.270> miss<00:00:51.300> uh<00:00:52.100> at<00:00:53.100> least<00:00:53.460> I'm

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it's really hit or miss uh at least I'm

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.010 
it's really hit or miss uh at least I'm
not<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:54.090> consistent<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> way

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
not like really consistent in the way

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
not like really consistent in the way
that<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> always<00:00:55.590> promise<00:00:56.070> make<00:00:56.280> videos<00:00:56.579> and
