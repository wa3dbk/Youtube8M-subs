00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.530
 hello to everyone today a very recipe 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.660
 particular on my channel 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.200
 as you could read from the title 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.460
 I will make a dessert with cooked bimby 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.470
 however dawn Rome therefore with the steam is the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.690
 first time I tried this cake 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.870
 all these muffins have remained 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.760
 stunned I didn't really think that that 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.160
 they could come out so soft and so 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.840
 good and then you think you don't have to 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.550
 you will have to turn on the oven then 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.650
 they will simply cook that way in 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.800
 receptacle of Rome for this reason 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.350
 very hot period is just fine ok 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.220
 to achieve our muffins autor one 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.680
 marbled it will take 135 grams 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.120
 of flour I use this ideal for 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.000
 then special cakes for cakes then 80 g 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.080
 of brown sugar two medium eggs a 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.950
 teaspoon of vanilla extract 125 g 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.460
 of yogurt 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.900
 I use this which is nougat though 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.659
 because I like the taste but you 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.270
 you can use the taste of yogurt 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.110
 which is what you like more than you prefer 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.259
 In short then we will need 50 thousand liters 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.659
 of sunflower oil and 2 heaped teaspoons 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.590
 of baking powder a spoon 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.509
 plenty of bitter cocoa and finally there 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.399
 it will take a liter and a half of water per 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.140
 steam cooking inside the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.979
 bocale we will enter all the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:44.140
 ingredients then the eggs the sugar 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:46.259
 of cane the teaspoon of extract of 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.259
 vanilla 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.660
 The Yogurt 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.100
 sunflower oil 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.579
 flour 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.670
 and finally the leaven that we say that 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.670
 matches the two teaspoons 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:33.630
 correspond to about half a sachet now 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:36.690
 we close both with the cover that counts and 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:43.680
 let's go for 50 seconds a 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:46.349
 speed 5 and a half hours about half of the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.780
 compound we will go to transfer 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:54.959
 inside a small bowl and not me 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.480
 he called to one side while in that 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.099
 advanced then the other half 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.140
 we're going to reach the spoon 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.140
 plenty of bitter cocoa 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.470
 and we mix everything well for others 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:28.250
 twenty seconds always at speed 5 and 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:31.580
 half so now we are left with i 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.090
 two mixtures the two cocoa compounds e 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.510
 the other white and we should alternate them 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.610
 so we'll put a couple of spoons 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.610
 let's say white and then two dark spoons 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.380
 then to cocoa and use of gods 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.190
 aluminum molds I have 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.459
 previously greased with a little oil 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:58.060
 then just muffin molds 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:04:06.349
 we are going to put a spoon of 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:09.400
 white dough on the bottom of each one that is 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.400
 a spoonful of cocoa mixture on top 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400
 so 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.880
 now again white dough on top 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.970
 and finally back to cocoa 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.819
 wanting we can also create from 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.750
 surface decorations so 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:21.870
 such as to give even more effect 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.810
 then stored with the doses I have there 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:29.550
 given they come out 5 but so far 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:32.690
 we're going to cover we're going to wash the 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.849
 simply laundry with water 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.330
 therefore we remove these excesses of of 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.129
 cocoa 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.190
 we're going to add a liter and a half 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:43.349
 of water need not be 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.120
 boiling reported that it is not 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.340
 ice cold eco at room temperature 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.030
 now that it's hot so definitely 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.030
 warm 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:03.050
 ok my name is the container of roma above 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:09.360
 is set exactly for 45 minutes 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:11.580
 temperature goes rome speed mi 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.630
 I forgot to tell you something about me 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.700
 I recommend after forty minutes 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.310
 then 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.850
 when there will be only five minutes to 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.890
 term 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.600
 you always do the toothpick test 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.830
 because they could cook in 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.110
 just 40 minutes 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.390
 I set 45 because it is usually 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.760
 but you never know that time 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.310
 because it always depends however also 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.520
 from the temperature there is 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.290
 externally therefore there being warmer 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.080
 then there were also before 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:48.020
 I say here does not estimate Emilianoc ready fim 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.340
 8 exactly in 40 minutes then how 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.320
 I told you before 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.500
 you do the toothpick test in fact me 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.140
 I set 45 minutes for security 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.070
 but once there were five left 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.020
 minutes to the end 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.130
 I did the toothpick test and saw 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:08.270
 that the toothpick had come out dry 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:12.410
 see now I'll show you too 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:15.050
 the inside look how beautiful they are 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.120
 you can see it very soft 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.760
 and then you can't imagine that good 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.330
 perfume that they have then as you will have 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.970
 could notice the realization is really 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.040
 very simple and has a lot of 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:31.130
 satisfaction therefore those who have children do not 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.250
 may not really try this recipe 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:36.410
 then as I have already told you and I repeat it in 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.700
 this very hot period does not turn on 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.700
 the oven is ideal 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:47.320
 look how beautiful they look like they are fake 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.880
 well militated and I'm very soft 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.640
 plus they are very healthy because 

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.640
 first of all they do not contain butter 

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.610
 they are also lighter and then remember 

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.290
 that steaming keeps everyone 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.230
 the nutritional values ​​of foods 

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.540
 therefore not 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:07.980
 they are even more salts for that too 

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.980
 nothing is altered 

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.340
 I really hope this recipe is there 

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.500
 liked you now I send you a 

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.610
 very big kiss and see you at 

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.610
