products of oil they discovered on the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.799 
products of oil they discovered on the
way<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.000> hand<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.690> be

way so so one hand they need to be

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.540 
way so so one hand they need to be
replaced<00:00:40.170> down<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> other<00:00:41.190> hand<00:00:41.460> the

potentials there to reduce it from would
you<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.840> add<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.700> it's<00:00:47.700> very<00:00:48.000> durable

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you know add some it's very durable

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.189 
you know add some it's very durable
though<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:50.629> like<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.840> looking<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
though I know like I was looking at a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.250 
though I know like I was looking at a
chemical<00:00:53.059> what<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.289> yes<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.890> pace<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:57.260> work

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
chemical what one yes the pace of work

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.639 
chemical what one yes the pace of work
that's<00:00:58.859> intriguing<00:00:59.629> okay<00:01:00.629> came<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.230> read

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that's intriguing okay came up read

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.750 
that's intriguing okay came up read
about<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.660> process<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.690> low-temperature

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
about a process for low-temperature

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.359 
about a process for low-temperature
pyrolysis<00:01:06.500> it's<00:01:07.500> basically<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.070> pressure

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
pyrolysis it's basically a pressure

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.679 
pyrolysis it's basically a pressure
cooker<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:10.320> catalyzed<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.689> citric

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
cooker and that's catalyzed by citric

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.270 
cooker and that's catalyzed by citric
acid<00:01:13.760> our<00:01:14.760> citric<00:01:15.270> acid<00:01:15.689> could<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.619> grown<00:01:16.890> from

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
acid our citric acid could be grown from

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.810 
acid our citric acid could be grown from
molasses<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.290> molasses<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:20.009> grown<00:01:20.430> from

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
molasses and molasses was grown from

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.140 
molasses and molasses was grown from
what<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.210> produced<00:01:21.689> from<00:01:21.840> would<00:01:22.400> know<00:01:24.830> yeah

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
what was produced from would know yeah

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.490 
what was produced from would know yeah
near<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> Allies<00:01:27.600> made<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> very<00:01:28.049> good<00:01:28.140> job<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
near the Allies made a very good job of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.969 
near the Allies made a very good job of
depriving<00:01:29.240> Hitler<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.390> oil<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.590> he<00:01:31.890> was

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
depriving Hitler of oil so he was

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.530 
depriving Hitler of oil so he was
producing<00:01:32.900> his<00:01:33.950> fuel<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.369> lot<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.820> us<00:01:35.909> fuel<00:01:36.240> from

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
producing his fuel a lot of us fuel from

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.530 
producing his fuel a lot of us fuel from
coal<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:39.630> also<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.320> they're<00:01:40.470> using<00:01:40.650> wood<00:01:41.540> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
coal but also that they're using wood to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.109 
coal but also that they're using wood to
tower<00:01:43.290> vehicle<00:01:43.770> sometimes<00:01:45.229> but<00:01:46.229> they're<00:01:46.320> also

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
tower vehicle sometimes but they're also

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.740 
tower vehicle sometimes but they're also
turning<00:01:48.119> wood<00:01:48.740> into<00:01:50.509> digesting<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.689> think

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
turning wood into digesting it I think

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.359 
turning wood into digesting it I think
with<00:01:52.020> acid<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:53.579> produce<00:01:53.899> molasses<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:56.250> they

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
with acid to produce molasses and they

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.410 
with acid to produce molasses and they
did<00:01:56.869> yea<00:01:57.869> though<00:01:57.930> feeding<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.619> animals

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
did yea though feeding it to animals

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.240 
did yea though feeding it to animals
they<00:02:00.420> didn't<00:02:00.659> do<00:02:00.780> well<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.380> survived<00:02:01.860> on

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
they didn't do well but they survived on

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.760 
they didn't do well but they survived on
this<00:02:02.460> molasses<00:02:03.149> derived<00:02:03.540> from<00:02:03.689> wood<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.740> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this molasses derived from wood so that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.340 
this molasses derived from wood so that
molasses<00:02:05.490> could<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.880> used<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.479> feed<00:02:06.719> gris<00:02:07.140> bees

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
molasses could be used to feed gris bees

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.369 
molasses could be used to feed gris bees
to<00:02:08.009> produce<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.489> citric<00:02:08.879> acid<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.229> whole

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
to produce the citric acid so as a whole

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.780 
to produce the citric acid so as a whole
chain<00:02:10.709> of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
chain of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.440 
chain of
industries<00:02:12.209> at<00:02:12.360> work<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:13.730> yeah<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:15.000> think<00:02:15.120> it'll

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
industries at work I yeah I think it'll

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.470 
industries at work I yeah I think it'll
it'll<00:02:15.689> happen<00:02:15.989> by<00:02:16.319> accident<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:17.040> all<00:02:17.609> people

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
it'll happen by accident that all people

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.050 
it'll happen by accident that all people
will<00:02:18.780> see<00:02:18.989> opportunities<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.739> use<00:02:20.700> someone

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
will see opportunities to use someone

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.500 
will see opportunities to use someone
else's<00:02:21.390> waste<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:24.950> yeah<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.250> replace<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
else's waste and yeah and replace the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.490 
else's waste and yeah and replace the
petrochemicals<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.379> only

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
petrochemicals so it's like is the only

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.750 
petrochemicals so it's like is the only
danger<00:02:31.739> if<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.159> that<00:02:32.280> people<00:02:32.549> start

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
danger if that is that people start

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.539 
danger if that is that people start
using<00:02:33.079> sort<00:02:34.079> of<00:02:34.140> productive<00:02:34.409> Lander<00:02:35.129> that

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
using sort of productive Lander that

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.000 
using sort of productive Lander that
food<00:02:35.819> could<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.090> grown<00:02:36.359> so<00:02:36.959> it's<00:02:37.079> eating<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:37.889> in

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
food could be grown so it's eating it in

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.849 
food could be grown so it's eating it in
that<00:02:38.189> he<00:02:39.150> let<00:02:39.420> that's<00:02:39.599> Mon<00:02:39.840> bios<00:02:40.109> problem<00:02:40.650> that

perfect kindling for fire know if they

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.740 
perfect kindling for fire know if they
leave<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.840> lying<00:03:07.109> around<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:08.599> could<00:03:09.599> take

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
leave it lying around that could take

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.159 
leave it lying around that could take
out<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.079> whole<00:03:10.169> forest<00:03:10.819> so<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.419> also<00:03:12.840> it's

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
out the whole forest so and also it's

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.990 
out the whole forest so and also it's
blocking<00:03:13.500> culverts<00:03:14.159> it's<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.790> jolly

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
blocking culverts it's a it's a jolly

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.610 
blocking culverts it's a it's a jolly
nuisance<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:15.750> council<00:03:16.169> blocks<00:03:16.440> the

this<00:04:23.900> would<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.229> small<00:04:24.800> scale<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:25.280> think<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:25.759> has

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
this would be small scale I think it has

to be small scale and local and a big
local<00:04:29.360> employer<00:04:29.720> all<00:04:30.409> the<00:04:30.590> soil<00:04:30.860> feasible

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
local employer all the soil feasible

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.550 
local employer all the soil feasible
feels<00:04:31.610> warm<00:04:32.080> just<00:04:33.080> wanting<00:04:33.349> a<00:04:33.409> septum

feels warm just wanting a septum

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.749 
feels warm just wanting a septum
absolutely<00:04:36.560> it'll<00:04:36.949> be<00:04:37.069> in<00:04:37.159> winter<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.520> those

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
absolutely it'll be in winter and those

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.420 
absolutely it'll be in winter and those
in<00:04:37.909> the<00:04:38.030> summer<00:04:38.240> it'll<00:04:38.539> be<00:04:38.659> covered<00:04:38.990> in<00:04:39.080> growth

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
in the summer it'll be covered in growth

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.740 
in the summer it'll be covered in growth
and<00:04:40.430> we'll<00:04:40.699> of<00:04:40.759> course<00:04:40.819> would<00:04:41.060> want<00:04:41.240> mulch<00:04:41.509> it

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
and we'll of course would want mulch it

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.629

as<00:04:41.840> well<00:04:42.020> around<00:04:42.259> here<00:04:42.440> because<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.430> soil

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
as well around here because the soil

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.460 
as well around here because the soil
gets<00:04:43.879> so<00:04:44.150> dry<00:04:44.479> water<00:04:45.229> logged<00:04:45.530> in<00:04:45.710> winter<00:04:46.360> and

gets so dry water logged in winter and
cracked<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.710> summer<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.789> we<00:04:49.819> chuck<00:04:50.690> mulch

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
round around the trees and plants and in

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.129 
round around the trees and plants and in
summer<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.090> doesn't<00:04:56.569> get<00:04:56.659> hot<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.020> in
