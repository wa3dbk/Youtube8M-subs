00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 that's why we leave the story 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.339
 First of all , let's have a look 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.589
 a very different topic and on 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.019
 a diet without animal 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.179
 Products 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.350
 For many it just seems like a thing 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.550
 the impossibility vegan make it but 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.289
 and many people think so too 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.180
 just always waive the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.289
 you may not see yourself 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.439
 Maybe they'll gain health 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.269
 get it or win 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.220
 of course for animal welfare but how 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.220
 it then looks like in the implementation 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.210
 rebecca otterbach is a teacher 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.170
 marathon runner and vegetarian of 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.660
 toddlers 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.230
 she likes and does not like dead animals 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.840
 the plate 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 because not only your cat is fine 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.960
 should 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.140
 it is a contradiction for them 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.450
 keeps pets and who caresses and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.120
 Everything for the power in things buys and 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.210
 but then at the same time but pig 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.970
 or cattle and then in 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.860
 Massentierhaltung stops to eat 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.840
 and now she's thinking about that, too 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.840
 Cream on the cat and you will taste it 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.080
 they are death candidates from birth 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.390
 born only so that your mother's milk gives 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.610
 The bigger the milk is, the higher 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.170
 also the meat mountain become the calves 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.000
 separated from their mothers 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.119
 the one later also give mel the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.470
 others are fattened and slaughtered 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.869
 the males die even faster 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.240
 chick of chickens is her birthday 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.280
 her todestag she was neither to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.890
 eggs are still suitable for roast chicken 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.830
 they are either gassed or 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.810
 shredded day-old chicks and calves 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.970
 So die for vegetarians too 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.950
 Eggs and dairy already eat 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.450
 again a contradiction without him live 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.450
 is called vegan life 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.820
 Rebecca wants to try and get it 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.440
 advice from ulrich bender ulrich bender 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 is like a djerba a vegan 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.780
 pal 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.640
 Rebecca has him in the vision was the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.989
 database found on the internet 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.370
 Many people think it would be very 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.380
 hard as not only complete 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.060
 vegan lifestyle to beat that 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.040
 is basically quite simple and in the process 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.390
 I want to help 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.130
 vegan nutrition is for ulrich bender 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.530
 do not give up enrichment 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.590
 he served up to show rebecca 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.650
 what it all is the bread covering this 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.299
 also belongs a vegan cheese now has it 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.080
 not make really good one away 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:40.510
 every cellar is available 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.299
 actually not yet rebecca is like 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.950
 cheese the wrong bender earlier so 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.260
 she would have to do without or 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.390
 actually quite paradise so I think 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.060
 cheese comes from the taste very much 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.319
 also close to that of the consistency 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.030
 bit different but not so 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.980
 in front of cheese, rebecca still has the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.590
 sweet bread spread most of all 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.980
 chocolate cream and there is mostly milk 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.870
 in it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.720
 which is in the vegan version through 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.310
 soya replaces ulrich varieties there are like 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:19.310
 the cheese only in the organic store or 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:21.140
 Shipment to the health one 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.269
 important question for marathon runner 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.340
 selbecker ulrich bender has the vegan 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.220
 Diet not harmed in the opposite 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.599
 have as part of a meeting with rebecca 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.950
 I thought so do you sometimes 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.250
 you can check it out 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.170
 from the doctor and have a blood picture 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.150
 let and that was fantastic good 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.909
 It is not better and better 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.060
 is the proof that I as 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.599
 vegan me with my memory 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.430
 the absolutely safe side move 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.150
 next topic for vegans on leather 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.459
 renounce 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.349
 I think art is a mix 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.430
 polyurethane and somehow still 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.410
 something could 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.150
 The vegan shoes are only available in shipping 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:09.760
 and they keep insanely long rebecca 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.760
 wears anyway and what is with 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.530
 getting used to is for 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.549
 rebecca during shopping constantly nachhaken 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.159
 to have to 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.690
 but when she does, she shows 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:28.879
 at the bakery with bread rolls 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.240
 and bread can cover that's it 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:34.400
 Well, the goal is good for today 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.250
 to buy a week in a normal 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.620
 Of course, supermarket vegetables are not 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.479
 problem 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.789
 the department for vegetarians and vegans 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.430
 can not satisfy all needs 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:50.210
 but for a week it is enough so yes 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:55.310
 his tofu and vegan ready meals 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.440
 Everything is there if not cheap 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.030
 spreads for vegetable lacks 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.240
 they are not even cheap 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.469
 section of animal products though 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.599
 chocolate cream without milk is still a dar 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.150
 just as limited also the selection at 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:12.020
 1 only in sherbet are not animal 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:23.630
 Products the wine has to stand 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:25.340
 stay guaranteed without gelatin 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.529
 Filtered bavaria is only available in 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.529
 from 8 euro the bottle 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.520
 Under the line you can with the 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.719
 were from a normal supermarket one 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.719
 feed vegan for a week 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.180
 one week later criticism in rebeccas 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.830
 she has the dishes for a week 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.690
 the vision buddy cooked her 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.940
 most people would have recommended her 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.669
 tasted it says and relapses 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:13.340
 if it did not become but it is 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:15.680
 not a vegan is always alone 1 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.330
 is rebecca clearly vegan after the week 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.480
 Nutrition is not more expensive because of the 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.100
 snacks fall away 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.430
 but that is also your problem 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.530
 while having trouble with me above all 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.230
 things in the little things 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.700
 in between in the snacks that me so 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.530
 also missing so if you through the 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.570
 pedestrian zone goes with the whole 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.310
 allurement 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.870
 I do not know if it will last forever 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.890
 really sticking to it that way 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.100
 little things in between, too 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.230
 to renounce consistently 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:50.760
 chocolate bar yoghurt particle that works 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:56.610
 Not everything but the possibility how to 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:58.140
 I do not see myself in now 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.580
 the next four weeks from the fries too 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.430
 but I will also feed you 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.540
 start self-experiment and she would me 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.280
 be happy if you see me 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.110
 We would go with it and we will 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.030
 our website a vegan 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.730
 have diary and indeed my vegan 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.740
 daily book I will report what falls 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.930
 easy for me something is difficult where 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.770
 are the stumbling blocks missing something 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.390
 I recipes movies photos information 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.950
 I'll fix everything there for myself 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.200
 then stop in the four weeks just like that 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.400
 accommodated and if they accompany me 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.720
 Maybe you want to do it too 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.100
 I would also like to talk about it 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.750
 happy and maybe just one 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.710
 week is because it will be the animal welfare 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.710
 definitely good for you
