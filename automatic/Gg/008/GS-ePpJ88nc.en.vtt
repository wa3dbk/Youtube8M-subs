night maybe you want to get a light like

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.880 
night maybe you want to get a light like
this<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.330> very<00:00:18.359> simple<00:00:19.350> light

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
this so this is just a very simple light

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.099 
this so this is just a very simple light
it<00:00:20.130> was<00:00:20.250> very<00:00:20.310> cheap<00:00:21.000> i<00:00:21.180> believe<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.779> about

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it was very cheap i believe it was about

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.710 
it was very cheap i believe it was about
twenty<00:00:22.529> five<00:00:22.680> dollars<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.460> amazon<00:00:24.060> something

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
twenty five dollars on amazon something

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
twenty five dollars on amazon something
around<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.050> range<00:00:25.410> twenty-five<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> thirty

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
around that range twenty-five to thirty

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.429 
around that range twenty-five to thirty
dollars<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.689> makes<00:00:28.080> me<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> little

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
dollars which makes me a little

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.230 
dollars which makes me a little
skeptical<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.369> how<00:00:29.519> good<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.880> just

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
skeptical to see how good it is just

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.269 
skeptical to see how good it is just
because<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.869> cheap<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.859> when<00:00:31.980> i<00:00:32.009> read

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
because it's so cheap but when i read

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.860 
because it's so cheap but when i read
through<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.820> reviews<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.630> one

through all the reviews this one
actually<00:00:34.250> reviewed<00:00:35.250> very<00:00:35.610> well<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> people

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
actually reviewed very well and people

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.990 
actually reviewed very well and people
had<00:00:36.630> very<00:00:36.989> good<00:00:37.320> things<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.340> say<00:00:38.370> about<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
had very good things to say about it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
had very good things to say about it
they<00:00:39.360> were<00:00:39.420> comparing<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.110> eighty<00:00:40.379> dollar

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
they were comparing it to eighty dollar

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
they were comparing it to eighty dollar
lights<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> saying<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.000> better<00:00:42.300> one

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
lights and saying that it's better one

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
lights and saying that it's better one
of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> features<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.890> i<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.160> about<00:00:44.610> this

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
of the features that i like about this

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.840 
of the features that i like about this
is<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:47.129> straight-up

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is that you can use just straight-up

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.540 
is that you can use just straight-up
double-a<00:00:48.809> batteries<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.219> also<00:00:50.370> use

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
double-a batteries but you can also use

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
double-a batteries but you can also use
a<00:00:50.730> rechargeable<00:00:51.719> battery<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.469> like

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
a rechargeable battery which I like

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.189 
a rechargeable battery which I like
because<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.570> had<00:00:54.780> double<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
because if it just had double a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.900 
because if it just had double a
batteries<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.129> break<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.670> bank

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
batteries that would break the bank

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.910 
batteries that would break the bank
because<00:00:57.239> batteries<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.020> expensive<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
because batteries are expensive and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.279 
because batteries are expensive and
you'd<00:00:59.070> constantly<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.969> buying<00:01:00.300> them<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:01.170> if

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you'd constantly be buying them but if

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.080 
you'd constantly be buying them but if
you<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.920> rechargeable<00:01:02.280> battery<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you have one rechargeable battery that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.910 
you have one rechargeable battery that
works<00:01:03.300> great<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> best<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.860> both

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
works great but it's the best of both

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.170 
works great but it's the best of both
worlds<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.729> your<00:01:05.850> rechargeable

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
worlds because if your rechargeable

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
worlds because if your rechargeable
battery<00:01:06.780> runs<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> pop<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
battery runs out then you pop in the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.640 
battery runs out then you pop in the
double<00:01:08.460> A's<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.320> switch

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
double A's and you got it so this switch

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
double A's and you got it so this switch
right<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.909> turns<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.630> just

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
right here is what turns it on you just

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
right here is what turns it on you just
flip<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.400> actually<00:01:14.580> takes<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
flip that there it actually takes it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.990 
flip that there it actually takes it
from<00:01:15.299> dim<00:01:15.630> too<00:01:16.170> bright<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.610> goes

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
from dim too bright it actually goes

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.950 
from dim too bright it actually goes
from<00:01:18.450> very<00:01:18.750> dim<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.580> bright<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.750> push

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
from very dim to very bright if you push

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.230 
from very dim to very bright if you push
this<00:01:21.990> button<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:23.100> lights<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this button right here it lights up and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.020 
this button right here it lights up and
that<00:01:24.390> shows<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.869> battery<00:01:25.290> charge<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.670> that's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that shows your battery charge so that's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.319 
that shows your battery charge so that's
four<00:01:27.630> lights<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.740> apparently<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:30.090> lights

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
four lights so apparently for lights

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630 
four lights so apparently for lights
means<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.500> batteries<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:32.070> fully<00:01:32.280> charged

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
means the batteries are fully charged

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.660 
means the batteries are fully charged
because<00:01:32.970> these<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.299> brand<00:01:33.630> new<00:01:33.659> batteries

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
because these are brand new batteries

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
because these are brand new batteries
cool<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.000> I'll<00:01:36.119> show<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.170> dimmer

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
cool so I'll show you what that dimmer

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560 
cool so I'll show you what that dimmer
switch<00:01:38.130> looks<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.909> end<00:01:39.060> hopefully

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
switch looks like on your end hopefully

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
switch looks like on your end hopefully
you<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.229> blinded<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> can

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you don't get so blinded that you can

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.880 
you don't get so blinded that you can
never<00:01:41.250> watch<00:01:41.520> youtube<00:01:41.909> videos<00:01:41.939> again<00:01:42.890> how

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
never watch youtube videos again how

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.500 
never watch youtube videos again how
does<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
does that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.350 
does that
how<00:01:44.630> does<00:01:45.620> that<00:01:45.710> feel<00:01:45.980> so<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:46.970> way<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.150> would
