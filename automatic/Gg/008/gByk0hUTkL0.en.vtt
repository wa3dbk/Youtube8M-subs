interactive<00:00:57.159> than<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.370> code<00:00:57.609> that<00:00:57.820> that's

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
interactive than I code that that's

another<00:00:58.570> like<00:00:59.229> better<00:00:59.530> bottoms<00:01:00.429> I<00:01:00.670> find<00:01:01.120> all

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
another like better bottoms I find all

my other source for their

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
my other source for their
think<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.960> i<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.589> simple<00:01:04.920> share<00:01:05.190> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
think that so i can put simple share it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.810 
think that so i can put simple share it
on<00:01:05.489> Facebook<00:01:05.940> or<00:01:06.150> whatever<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> do

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.140 

and<00:01:11.890> application<00:01:12.890> like<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.280> LED<00:01:13.460> options
