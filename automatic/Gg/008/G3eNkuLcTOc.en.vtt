in<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> middle<00:00:55.350> will<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.160> expand<00:00:56.640> contract<00:00:57.270> or

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
in the middle will it expand contract or

in the middle will it expand contract or
stay<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> same<00:00:58.430> well<00:00:59.430> here's<00:00:59.730> how<00:00:59.910> we're

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
stay the same well here's how we're

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
stay the same well here's how we're
going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> treat<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.719> we're<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.770> find

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
going to treat this we're going to find

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.700 
going to treat this we're going to find
what<00:01:02.340> happens<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.510> treat<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.019> as<00:01:04.229> two

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
what happens if we treat this as two

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.130 
what happens if we treat this as two
rings<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.220> outer<00:01:05.489> ring<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> an<00:01:06.570> inner<00:01:06.840> ring

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
rings an outer ring and an inner ring

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.050 
rings an outer ring and an inner ring
let's<00:01:07.740> treat<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> circle<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> bigger

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
let's treat it as a circle a bigger

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.750 
let's treat it as a circle a bigger
circle<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> littler<00:01:10.020> circle<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.729> big

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
circle in the littler circle so the big

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.710 
circle in the littler circle so the big
circle<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> expand<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> inner

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
circle is going to expand in the inner

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.940 
circle is going to expand in the inner
circle<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.470> also<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.820> expand<00:01:18.950> let's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
circle is also going to expand let's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.789 
circle is also going to expand let's
expand<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.610> both<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.380> then<00:01:22.380> we're<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
expand them both and then we're going to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.620 
expand them both and then we're going to
recombine<00:01:23.220> them<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.790> when<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.479> what

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
recombine them and when we do that what

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
recombine them and when we do that what
we're<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> find<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> inner<00:01:26.189> ones

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
we're going to find is if the inner ones

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
we're going to find is if the inner ones
expanded<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> outer<00:01:27.390> ones<00:01:27.689> expanded<00:01:28.259> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
expanded and the outer ones expanded of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.380 
expanded and the outer ones expanded of
course<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.670> where<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> finger<00:01:30.240> goes

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
course this is where the finger goes

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
course this is where the finger goes
inside<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:31.920> expanded<00:01:32.520> as

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
inside that one that one is expanded as

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.870 
inside that one that one is expanded as
well<00:01:33.259> therefore<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.710> both<00:01:35.009> expand<00:01:35.640> in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
well therefore they both expand in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.600 
well therefore they both expand in
linear<00:01:36.390> expansion<00:01:36.810> every<00:01:37.590> linear<00:01:37.860> dimension

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
linear expansion every linear dimension

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.130 
linear expansion every linear dimension
of<00:01:38.729> an<00:01:38.850> object<00:01:39.210> changes<00:01:39.270> by<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.750> same

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
of an object changes by the same

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.740 
of an object changes by the same
fraction<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.950> heated<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.310> cooled<00:01:41.750> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
fraction when it's heated or cooled so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.590 
fraction when it's heated or cooled so
that's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.590> good<00:01:43.860> way<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.270> ring<00:01:45.420> off

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that's a good way to get the ring off

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
that's a good way to get the ring off
run<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> under<00:01:46.560> hot<00:01:46.590> water<00:01:46.950> hopefully<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
run it under hot water hopefully it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.370 
run it under hot water hopefully it
expands<00:01:48.119> maybe<00:01:48.420> try<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> little<00:01:48.990> bit<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> dish

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
expands maybe try a little bit of dish

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.190 
expands maybe try a little bit of dish

hopefully<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> gets<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> good<00:01:53.040> start<00:01:53.399> on

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
hopefully that gets you a good start on

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.219
