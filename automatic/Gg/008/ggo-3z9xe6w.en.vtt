00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.040 

it's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.170> nice<00:00:37.410> looking<00:00:37.800> bow<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.840> wanted<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> go

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it's a nice looking bow I wanted to go

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.819 
it's a nice looking bow I wanted to go
for<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:41.059> reef<00:00:42.059> curved<00:00:42.390> rather<00:00:43.260> than<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.739> like

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
for a reef curved rather than just like

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.500 
for a reef curved rather than just like
the<00:00:43.980> long<00:00:44.160> standard<00:00:44.670> long<00:00:44.850> bow<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.239> because

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the long standard long bow just because

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.600 
the long standard long bow just because
I<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.680> look<00:00:46.950> much<00:00:47.280> better<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
I think they look much better and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.779 
I think they look much better and
otherwise<00:00:50.610> other<00:00:51.420> than<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> but

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
otherwise other than what it is but

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.889 
otherwise other than what it is but
there's<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.000> something<00:00:54.300> about<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
there's just something about them I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.260 
there's just something about them I
think<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.350> looks<00:00:55.500> much<00:00:55.770> better<00:00:56.039> than<00:00:56.270> any

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
think it looks much better than any

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.029 
think it looks much better than any
other<00:00:57.390> type<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.750> bow<00:00:58.020> base<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.920> these
