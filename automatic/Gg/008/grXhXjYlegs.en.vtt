 I imagine that this feeling of opening the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.480
 on top of the others we pass other 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.700
 it also happens constantly and at the end 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.259
 It is that I never know what to wear as an 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.809
 day it occurred to me why not take out 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.210
 key pieces of my wardrobe put them 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.520
 all together in a burrito in an array 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.160
