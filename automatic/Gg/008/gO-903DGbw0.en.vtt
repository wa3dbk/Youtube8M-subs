two so this is design of our bottle
rocket<00:00:13.009> excited<00:00:14.009> okay<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.599> did<00:00:15.780> here

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
rocket excited okay so what we did here

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.800 
rocket excited okay so what we did here
is<00:00:16.500> we<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.680> foam<00:00:17.310> football<00:00:17.730> at<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.880> top<00:00:18.119> can

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
is we have foam football at the top can

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.689 
is we have foam football at the top can
have<00:00:19.020> our<00:00:19.199> nose<00:00:19.410> cones<00:00:19.800> or<00:00:20.070> nose<00:00:20.220> cone<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
have our nose cones or nose cone and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.750 
have our nose cones or nose cone and
then<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.029> cardboard<00:00:21.769> or<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> thin<00:00:23.250> is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
then we have cardboard or a thin is

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.269 
then we have cardboard or a thin is
cardboard<00:00:24.449> fins<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.830> stuck<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.189> all

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
cardboard fins and we stuck it all

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.370 
cardboard fins and we stuck it all
together<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.670> duct<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
together with duct so these are the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.870 
together with duct so these are the
supplies<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:29.070> we're<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.519> using

have here is trying units in the next
one<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.480> circular<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.559> could<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.739> any

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
one is just circular one it could be any

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.090 
one is just circular one it could be any
honestly<00:00:50.850> any<00:00:51.030> shape<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:51.960> size<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.500> what

we're<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.180> cut<00:00:54.750> off

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
we're going to do is actually cut off

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.729 
we're going to do is actually cut off
the<00:00:55.530> top<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.190> bottle<00:00:56.610> rocket<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.739> place

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the top of this bottle rocket and place

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.369 
the top of this bottle rocket and place
a<00:00:58.980> different<00:00:59.250> nose<00:00:59.640> cone<00:00:59.910> using<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.989> foam

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a different nose cone using this foam

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.710 
a different nose cone using this foam
foot<00:01:01.590> bub<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.360> also

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
foot bub right here and so we are also

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.469 
foot bub right here and so we are also
using<00:01:07.130> just<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> regular<00:01:08.549> trash<00:01:08.790> bag<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.240> find

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
using just a regular trash bag you find

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that's that as well as to make it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.679 
that's that as well as to make it
attachable<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.729> whatever<00:01:15.090> part<00:01:15.390> we're<00:01:15.570> going

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
attachable to whatever part we're going

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.270 
attachable to whatever part we're going
to<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.869> putting<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.530> Rockets<00:01:16.950> we

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to be putting it on in the Rockets we

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.149 
to be putting it on in the Rockets we
are<00:01:17.580> using<00:01:17.759> string<00:01:18.360> yarn<00:01:19.229> whatever<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.950> want

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
are using string yarn whatever you want

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.179 
are using string yarn whatever you want
to<00:01:20.250> use<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.990> also<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> clay

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
to use so what we also have here is clay

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.770 
to use so what we also have here is clay
and<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.119> give<00:01:24.270> our<00:01:24.450> bottle

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and this is going to give our bottle

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
and this is going to give our bottle
some<00:01:25.290> direction<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:26.909> very

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
some direction and so it's not very

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.890 
some direction and so it's not very
flimsy<00:01:27.860> we<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:28.979> also<00:01:29.159> using<00:01:29.970> duct<00:01:30.329> tape<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
flimsy we are also using duct tape as a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.020 
flimsy we are also using duct tape as a
strong<00:01:31.170> adhesive<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.950> attach<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.549> bottles<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
strong adhesive to attach the bottles to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.370 
strong adhesive to attach the bottles to
attach<00:01:33.270> anything<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.930> because<00:01:34.200> regular

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
attach anything on it because regular

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
attach anything on it because regular
tape<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.189> strong<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.759> glue<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> too

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
tape is not as strong and glue is too

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.090 
tape is not as strong and glue is too
messy<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:37.140> melt<00:01:37.290> off<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> plastic<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
messy and can melt off the plastic so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.690 
messy and can melt off the plastic so
this<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> best<00:01:39.150> alternative<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.700> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
this is the best alternative and the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.340 
this is the best alternative and the
basic<00:01:42.030> thing<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> will<00:01:42.750> need<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
basic thing that you will need is like a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.069 
basic thing that you will need is like a
ruler<00:01:44.149> just<00:01:45.149> measure<00:01:45.390> everything<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
ruler just measure everything and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.499 
ruler just measure everything and
obviously<00:01:46.920> scissors<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:48.299> need<00:01:48.450> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
obviously scissors because we need to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.340 
obviously scissors because we need to
cut<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> bottles<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.439> yeah<00:01:50.220> okay

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
cut the bottles and yeah okay

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.899 
cut the bottles and yeah okay
that's<00:01:52.340> aside<00:01:52.700> all<00:01:53.510> other<00:01:54.700> materials<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:55.729> we

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
that's aside all other materials that we

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.910 
that's aside all other materials that we
use<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.690> be<00:01:56.900> kind<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.200> exercise<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:57.830> we

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
use that can be kind of exercise so we

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.310 
use that can be kind of exercise so we
didn't<00:01:58.100> put<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.400> ice<00:01:58.520> part<00:01:58.760> so<00:01:59.390> obviously

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
didn't put in the ice part so obviously

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.660 
didn't put in the ice part so obviously
we<00:02:00.470> use<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.590> sharpie<00:02:01.010> that's<00:02:01.160> kind<00:02:01.400> of<00:02:01.460> common

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
we use a sharpie that's kind of common

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.540 
we use a sharpie that's kind of common
knowledge<00:02:01.880> Geno<00:02:02.570> make<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.140> marks<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:03.650> we<00:02:04.340> use

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
knowledge Geno make the marks and we use

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.740 
knowledge Geno make the marks and we use
the<00:02:04.880> tape<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.479> we<00:02:05.810> can<00:02:06.050> measure<00:02:06.440> out<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
the tape so that we can measure out the

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.029 
the tape so that we can measure out the
that<00:02:08.750> thing<00:02:09.020> yeah<00:02:09.440> instead<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:09.860> using

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
that thing yeah instead of using

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.860 
that thing yeah instead of using
measuring<00:02:10.429> tape<00:02:10.670> as<00:02:10.880> well<00:02:11.150> as<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.540> use<00:02:11.660> the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
measuring tape as well as we use the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.740 
measuring tape as well as we use the
knife<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.470> be<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.250> more<00:02:13.490> sharp<00:02:13.730> object<00:02:14.150> end<00:02:14.360> up

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
knife to be a more sharp object end up

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.840 
knife to be a more sharp object end up
scissors<00:02:15.380> for<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:16.190> football<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.640> we<00:02:16.730> use

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.210 

so<00:02:23.850> here<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.080> bottom<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.710> rakia<00:02:26.100> we

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
so here is the bottom of the rakia we

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.860 
so here is the bottom of the rakia we
kept<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.640> more<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.180> rounder<00:02:27.540> bottle

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
kept it more of the rounder bottle

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.270 
kept it more of the rounder bottle
because<00:02:28.140> that's<00:02:28.290> how<00:02:28.380> Rockets<00:02:28.620> are<00:02:29.010> in

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
because that's how Rockets are in

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.950 
because that's how Rockets are in
general<00:02:29.640> how<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.030> saw<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.300> picture<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
general how we saw the picture is and

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.930 
general how we saw the picture is and
then<00:02:31.470> here<00:02:31.800> we<00:02:31.920> cut<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.250> font<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.610> bottle<00:02:32.880> in

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
then here we cut the font a bottle in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.790 
then here we cut the font a bottle in
half<00:02:33.120> because<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.750> has<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.590> type<00:02:34.770> of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
half because it has more of the type of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.710 
half because it has more of the type of
shape<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> football<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.150> we<00:02:36.240> can<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.540> an

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
shape of the football so we can have an

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.480 
shape of the football so we can have an
example<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.560> how<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.740> football<00:02:38.190> should<00:02:38.370> be

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
example of how the football should be

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.740 
example of how the football should be
placed<00:02:38.790> in

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.470 

so<00:02:45.230> um<00:02:46.040> here<00:02:46.490> what<00:02:46.640> I'm<00:02:46.730> going<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.940> show<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.090> is

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so um here what I'm going to show you is

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.470 
so um here what I'm going to show you is
how<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> cut<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.380> ball<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.150> football<00:02:50.150> in<00:02:50.300> half

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
how I cut the ball the football in half

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.680 
how I cut the ball the football in half
and<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.710> did<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.130> by<00:02:52.310> first<00:02:52.490> cutting<00:02:52.880> right<00:02:53.570> in

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
and I did this by first cutting right in

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.660 
and I did this by first cutting right in
the<00:02:53.780> center<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.380> football<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.190> then

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the center of the football and then

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.570 
the center of the football and then
drawing<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.660> line<00:02:57.080> around<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.470> diameter<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.400> it

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
drawing a line around the diameter of it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.400 
drawing a line around the diameter of it
so<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.210> can<00:02:59.330> see<00:03:01.330> that<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.570> would<00:03:02.750> be<00:03:03.200> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
so you can see that that would be the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.080 
so you can see that that would be the
sort<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:03.920> tracing<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.430> where<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.670> cut<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.970> and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
sort of tracing of where to cut it and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.850 
sort of tracing of where to cut it and
over<00:03:05.900> there<00:03:06.050> in<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.260> corner<00:03:06.380> on<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.740> right

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
over there in the corner on the right

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.460 
over there in the corner on the right
corner<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.310> see<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.420> half<00:03:08.600> of<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.900> Fanta

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
corner you can see the half of the Fanta

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.680 
corner you can see the half of the Fanta
bottle<00:03:09.710> that<00:03:09.860> was<00:03:09.950> cut<00:03:10.130> off<00:03:10.250> we<00:03:11.210> did<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.540> so

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
bottle that was cut off we did this so

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.630 
bottle that was cut off we did this so
that<00:03:11.870> we<00:03:11.960> can<00:03:12.110> place<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.800> half<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.550> the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
that we can place the half of the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.060 
that we can place the half of the
football<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.120> I'm<00:03:14.210> going<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.420> cut<00:03:14.570> soon<00:03:15.070> in

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
football that I'm going to cut soon in

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.180 
football that I'm going to cut soon in
there<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.730> can<00:03:16.880> act<00:03:17.060> as<00:03:17.210> our<00:03:17.480> nose<00:03:18.440> cone

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.550 

and<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.330> me<00:03:25.720> cutting<00:03:26.050> it<00:03:26.200> with<00:03:26.500> a

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
and this is just me cutting it with a

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.690 
and this is just me cutting it with a
knife

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.559 

so<00:03:30.700> here<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.270> placed<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.849> nose<00:03:33.849> cone<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.420> we

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
so here I placed the nose cone that we

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.199 
so here I placed the nose cone that we
have<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.200> football<00:03:35.530> into<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.790> half<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
have the football into that half of the

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.580 
have the football into that half of the
fan<00:03:37.390> of<00:03:37.510> bottle<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.989> that's<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.410> other<00:03:38.470> half

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
fan of bottle and that's the other half

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.390 
fan of bottle and that's the other half
of<00:03:38.920> football<00:03:40.020> then<00:03:41.020> I'm<00:03:41.140> placing<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.890> half

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
of football then I'm placing that half

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.089 
of football then I'm placing that half
onto<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.620> original<00:03:44.620> one<00:03:45.310> with<00:03:45.520> Libya<00:03:46.080> bottle

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
and then here I'm cutting sort of like a

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.280 
and then here I'm cutting sort of like a
hole<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.519> center<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.390> foam<00:03:52.630> because

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
that it can you know I'm just a weight

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:05.490 
that it can you know I'm just a weight
sort<00:03:58.330> of<00:04:03.239> we<00:04:04.239> want<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.600> make<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.930> all<00:04:05.019> balanced

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
sort of we want to make it all balanced

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.370 
sort of we want to make it all balanced
because<00:04:05.709> center<00:04:06.489> of<00:04:06.610> mass<00:04:06.790> be<00:04:07.090> announcing<00:04:07.810> of

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
because center of mass be announcing of

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.500 
because center of mass be announcing of
it<00:04:08.620> all<00:04:08.769> that's<00:04:09.069> why<00:04:09.220> we're<00:04:09.400> adding<00:04:09.489> clay<00:04:09.819> we

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
it all that's why we're adding clay we

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.820 
it all that's why we're adding clay we
first<00:04:10.750> add<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> little<00:04:11.140> too<00:04:11.260> much<00:04:11.410> clay<00:04:11.590> and

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
first add a little too much clay and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.710 
first add a little too much clay and
then<00:04:11.920> we<00:04:11.980> took<00:04:12.100> them<00:04:12.250> out<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.510> we<00:04:13.510> made<00:04:13.690> it

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
then we took them out and we made it

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.890 
then we took them out and we made it
perfect<00:04:17.850> here<00:04:18.850> I'm<00:04:19.060> just<00:04:19.269> taping<00:04:19.450> it<00:04:19.720> all

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
perfect here I'm just taping it all

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.110 
perfect here I'm just taping it all
nicely<00:04:20.229> together

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
nicely together

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.020 
nicely together
not<00:04:22.120> good<00:04:23.260> here<00:04:24.010> are<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.160> fins<00:04:24.400> so<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.729> need<00:04:24.910> a

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
not good here are the fins so I need a

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.490 
not good here are the fins so I need a
dino<00:04:25.300> with<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.479> quadratic<00:04:25.990> form<00:04:26.229> and<00:04:26.440> those

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
dino with the quadratic form and those

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.820 
dino with the quadratic form and those
are<00:04:26.650> just<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.919> unit's<00:04:27.639> we<00:04:27.760> used<00:04:28.590> we<00:04:29.590> found

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
are just the unit's we used we found

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.370 
are just the unit's we used we found
them<00:04:29.979> as<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.370> best<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.870> can<00:04:32.050> copy<00:04:32.229> them

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
them as the best and you can copy them

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.909 
them as the best and you can copy them
if<00:04:32.530> you<00:04:32.650> want

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
if you want

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.240 
if you want
yeah<00:04:34.229> here<00:04:35.229> I'm<00:04:35.350> just<00:04:35.530> cutting<00:04:35.710> them<00:04:35.979> you

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
yeah here I'm just cutting them you

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.469 
yeah here I'm just cutting them you
actually<00:04:36.400> be<00:04:36.700> pretty<00:04:36.910> precise<00:04:37.270> with<00:04:37.419> your

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
actually be pretty precise with your

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.610 
actually be pretty precise with your
cutting<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.770> way<00:04:38.890> we<00:04:39.039> just<00:04:39.190> found<00:04:39.370> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
cutting and the way we just found the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.990 
cutting and the way we just found the
length<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.860> all<00:04:41.950> that<00:04:42.100> stuff<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:42.520> by<00:04:42.700> just

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
length and all that stuff is by just

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.900 
length and all that stuff is by just
interpreting<00:04:43.750> our<00:04:43.810> bottle<00:04:44.140> rocket<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:45.070> here

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
interpreting our bottle rocket and here

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.190 
interpreting our bottle rocket and here
they're<00:04:46.060> obviously<00:04:46.419> being<00:04:46.630> taped<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.080> we'll

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
they're obviously being taped and we'll

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.900 
they're obviously being taped and we'll
show<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.410> process<00:04:47.860> of<00:04:47.979> that<00:04:48.130> but<00:04:48.729> they're

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
show you the process of that but they're

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:58.320 
show you the process of that but they're
there<00:04:50.220> oh<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:56.169> here<00:04:56.380> I<00:04:56.410> am<00:04:56.800> actually<00:04:57.610> using

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
there oh and here I am actually using

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.930 
there oh and here I am actually using
this<00:04:58.600> method<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.370> taking<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.430> piece<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.729> tape

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
this method of taking a piece of tape

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.460 
this method of taking a piece of tape
and<00:05:01.120> making<00:05:01.570> sure<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:01.900> wraps<00:05:02.110> around<00:05:02.229> the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
and making sure it wraps around the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.070 
and making sure it wraps around the
entire<00:05:02.760> rocket<00:05:03.760> precisely<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.810> then<00:05:04.960> I'm

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
entire rocket precisely and then I'm

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.560 
entire rocket precisely and then I'm
going<00:05:05.200> to<00:05:05.260> take<00:05:05.440> it<00:05:05.590> out<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:05.919> tink<00:05:06.850> marks<00:05:07.240> make

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
going to take it out and tink marks make

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.850 
going to take it out and tink marks make
mark<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.050> make<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.289> marks<00:05:08.530> of<00:05:08.620> where<00:05:08.800> to

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
mark and make the marks of where to

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.969 
mark and make the marks of where to
place<00:05:08.950> the<00:05:09.160> fins<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:10.090> I'm<00:05:10.180> measuring<00:05:10.419> out

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
place the fins so I'm measuring out

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.710 
place the fins so I'm measuring out
divided<00:05:11.979> by<00:05:12.100> three<00:05:12.400> yeah<00:05:12.669> divided<00:05:13.270> into<00:05:13.539> three

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
divided by three yeah divided into three

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.719 
divided by three yeah divided into three
sections<00:05:13.930> yeah<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:14.889> then<00:05:14.979> you're<00:05:15.100> taping<00:05:15.460> it

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
sections yeah and then you're taping it

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.210 
sections yeah and then you're taping it
back<00:05:15.880> on<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.330> we<00:05:16.450> can<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:16.960> can<00:05:16.990> see<00:05:17.320> how

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
back on so we can so you can see how

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.680 
back on so we can so you can see how
things<00:05:18.639> should<00:05:18.820> be<00:05:18.970> where<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.240> fins<00:05:19.450> should

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
things should be where the fins should

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.270 
things should be where the fins should
be<00:05:19.840> so<00:05:20.020> you'll<00:05:20.169> see<00:05:20.350> little<00:05:20.590> tick<00:05:20.860> marks<00:05:21.130> in

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
be so you'll see little tick marks in

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.279 
be so you'll see little tick marks in
there<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.669> these<00:05:22.210> are<00:05:22.360> like<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:22.750> each<00:05:22.900> of

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
there and these are like the each of

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.860 
there and these are like the each of
their<00:05:23.710> you<00:05:24.700> just<00:05:24.880> end<00:05:25.000> up<00:05:25.030> using<00:05:25.090> a<00:05:25.450> measuring

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
their you just end up using a measuring

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.500 
their you just end up using a measuring
tape<00:05:26.050> because<00:05:26.380> he<00:05:26.740> is<00:05:26.919> that<00:05:27.130> here<00:05:28.120> is<00:05:28.270> it<00:05:28.419> I'll

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
tape because he is that here is it I'll

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.029 
tape because he is that here is it I'll
tape<00:05:28.720> together<00:05:28.870> we<00:05:29.560> don't<00:05:29.710> want<00:05:29.830> show<00:05:29.889> you<00:05:29.979> the

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
tape together we don't want show you the

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.710 
tape together we don't want show you the
process<00:05:30.370> could<00:05:30.490> it's<00:05:30.639> obvious<00:05:31.030> that<00:05:31.060> we<00:05:31.510> taped

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
process could it's obvious that we taped

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.710 
process could it's obvious that we taped
it<00:05:31.780> together<00:05:36.389> disclaimer

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
it together disclaimer

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.960 
it together disclaimer
so<00:05:38.870> we<00:05:39.410> found<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.770> lot<00:05:39.920> of<00:05:39.950> octagon<00:05:40.550> old<00:05:40.760> types

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
so we found a lot of octagon old types

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.660 
so we found a lot of octagon old types
of<00:05:41.180> parachutes<00:05:41.960> online<00:05:42.500> so<00:05:42.860> that's<00:05:43.250> where<00:05:43.520> we

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
of parachutes online so that's where we

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.120 
of parachutes online so that's where we
got<00:05:44.030> our<00:05:44.060> idea<00:05:44.510> from<00:05:44.750> garbage<00:05:45.530> bags<00:05:45.740> just<00:05:46.040> a

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
got our idea from garbage bags just a

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.920 
got our idea from garbage bags just a
very<00:05:46.340> great<00:05:46.640> alternative<00:05:47.180> towards<00:05:47.480> that<00:05:47.660> and

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
very great alternative towards that and

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.390 
very great alternative towards that and
we<00:05:48.080> use<00:05:48.200> eight<00:05:48.380> inches<00:05:48.650> for<00:05:48.830> each<00:05:48.890> side<00:05:49.160> just

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
we use eight inches for each side just

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.540 
we use eight inches for each side just
because<00:05:49.820> we<00:05:50.240> saw<00:05:50.450> resources<00:05:51.440> around<00:05:51.800> 7<00:05:52.130> &amp;<00:05:52.250> 6<00:05:52.370> so

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
because we saw resources around 7 &amp; 6 so

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.880 
because we saw resources around 7 &amp; 6 so
we<00:05:52.640> just<00:05:52.820> made<00:05:52.970> an<00:05:53.060> 8<00:05:53.240> um<00:05:53.510> here's<00:05:54.410> the<00:05:54.500> picture

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
we just made an 8 um here's the picture

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.040 
we just made an 8 um here's the picture
and<00:05:55.070> we<00:05:55.610> use<00:05:55.850> a<00:05:56.150> needle<00:05:56.300> to<00:05:56.450> come<00:05:56.750> through<00:05:56.960> a

and we use a needle to come through a
hole<00:05:57.290> so<00:05:57.500> we<00:05:57.590> can<00:05:57.620> put<00:05:57.920> our<00:05:58.100> string<00:05:58.610> through<00:05:58.940> it

we for the most chance may not use a
rocket<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.910> mean<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.240> parachute<00:06:02.960> because<00:06:03.290> it
