00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.039
 babies I already bring you a new gameplay 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.869
 commented with the necromancer in this 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.849
 I have chosen a forest of life 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.039
 so you can see what this map consists of 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.770
 and in what differs from the previous 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.720
 battle of kilo I anticipate that I will 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.400
 record a bit late and the video starts 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.710
 with my arrival at the central base that 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.259
 keep flame and the cakes that are generated 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.239
 this scanner gameplay I like for that 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.830
 because it's a very intense game in the 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.830
 that you will see, I do not stop for a second 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.210
 hit me to run here and there 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.219
 Well, if I stop, I stop when I 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.469
 they send for the other way around but come on 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.079
 very entertaining so we go for the 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.170
 topic here I'm getting to the base 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.300
 central this is the most strategic point 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.550
 of this game everyone tries to come from 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.199
 first here to try to capture it 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.600
 because in this way you can go 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.370
 moving to both ends and is the most 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.160
 easy here they are giving them as 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.350
 we therefore I spend the stick 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.469
 I start throwing all the areas with 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.240
 slow down 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.829
 damage damage damage and as you see here over 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.990
 I have a little ball that I will explain later 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.509
 what it is seems that we make them regular 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.000
 a little shot forward under the 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.030
 stairs I think there is a guardian a 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.969
 warrior a necromancer the guardian 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.709
 surely you will feel the last and the 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.110
 last is that a book was taken by the uncle 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.659
 puts to read and goes up all the life in the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.759
 radio to your allies up to 5 I think it's 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.270
 then it is important here for example 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.459
 so put a cut or fear a 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.599
 knock down or whatever at this moment you see 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.549
 it's when he 's throwing it 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.770
 then he brings life to all 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.659
 comrades is the book mante also 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.069
 I get in the ass road to endure 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.619
 that little bit more when there's a lot 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.219
 So much trouble is for me or the one who 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.989
 It does a lot of damage and good, well, you see 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.810
 how micro lovers are a little bit 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:02.349
 blanditos and we must always try to 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.840
 do a push sun pool try that 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.209
 press when when you have all the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.429
 damage or regeneration or damage 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.380
 cures of life and such and when you see that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.660
 is wrong to back here makes me a 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.270
 charge with to bring down the warrior always 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.310
 the same to pull as more billet than 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.530
 the truth that bursts mogollón but 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.910
 to throw it completely you have to 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.680
 be still then what I do 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.870
 It is always getting into the road and avoided 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.790
 let me kill myself in three seconds or 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.650
 that makes me do all the damage that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.880
 here I return to regular I'm going towards 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:37.540
 back I go back to throw the cure comes 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.820
 comes a l I think it is and nothing has 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.910
 lying down or I keep going forward I'm going 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.130
 towards my companions I recharge my life 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.580
 force with the cane areas I get 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.890
 on the road and as you see then trying 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.310
 play like that come in get out of rice cure 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.530
 the spectral to increase the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.840
 protection since you are holding here 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.220
 die and because I fail to throw me the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.080
 cure and I will take to explain 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.820
 the skills when you die the 1st you go 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.440
 you for your life the 2 you hurt the 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.450
 enemies and slows them down this is 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.280
 an ugly and the picture you ask your help 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.810
 allies to be healed 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.000
 here is something inside out I'm heading towards 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.700
 towards the side towards one of the boxes 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.950
 this game has two voices in the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.989
 side and what it is about is that 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.880
 every time you kill them you get 40 points 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.489
 So here, as you see, we are both 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.020
 we like them try 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.360
 trying to kill him to get those 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.760
 points since as you can see is a mini 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.400
 pretty tight we're going 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.050
 practically the same points and nothing 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.370
 more here where I killed him before 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.080
 account points as you can see they are not 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.180
 added to us and automatically we 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.730
 they raise another 40 points more that wants 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.170
 say that on the other side my classmates 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.230
 of equipment have also killed the other you 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.030
 and these two balls that are placed on top 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.310
 of the character as I told you before a 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.970
 blue and one green is that when you kill 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.459
 each voice gives you gives you a buff or puts you 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.650
 50 to all the states then like 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.959
 we have killed the two as they are both 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.650
 balls and the total is 100 in all 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.390
 stats here are a couple of warriors there 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.489
 we have managed to increase to one now 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.260
 we are there trying to kill the other and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.340
 in the end we do not kill 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.709
 You see I'm a little bit soft but if 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.350
 You're pulling a little bit because it heals 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.919
 spectral you are generating the iphone if 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.960
 you're entering and exiting atrocious and 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.870
 you try to get the fear also 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.430
 you have quite enough survival and 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.470
 nothing because that the difference of the bat 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.120
 kilo to this is that it's about capturing 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.949
 bases that is the same one and catapults 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.780
 but there are voices here I return to the base 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.639
 central because they have taken us away we are 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.840
 there super super tight then what 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.570
 what it's about is getting 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.630
 capture them and keep them always 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.729
 as far as possible and good here I 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.380
 he used the last the leeds that in the 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.449
 previous video I was told now to see 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.630
 if you use that stability and such 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.310
 look here you have it then the one the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.840
 cloths mogollón because mind much damage 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.630
 then you see the little bugs that are 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.560
 around me are the five puppies 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.080
 that go out there all crazy on 5 what 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.229
 shot right now that is kind of like 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.630
 to clean all the allies and 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.460
 then you take all the bulls out 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.210
 the enemies 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.910
 in 30 seconds that this skill lasts and 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.139
 you have to get the most out of it 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.060
 here we keep fighting in the end we have 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.240
 managed to capture we carry a small 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.430
 difference of points and nothing we get 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.900
 it is to regulate them a little me 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.880
 I go to the next base but I give myself 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.069
 mind that my colleagues leave but 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.900
 there are still really people here and 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.419
 are trying to capture it so I 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.150
 I 'm getting the arrow increase from I start to 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.949
 it's for pissing the 1 the 4 for example that 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.740
 there are many times that I forget 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.440
 throw it is okay to throw it away when 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.660
 you have many enemies around because 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.060
 you see them like now that I'm pulling 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.699
 because the range is quite broad as 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.820
 you see me of enough hosts and in addition 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.280
 This is like sucking chup so you do 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.229
 to fill in the life force then 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.530
 you can keep a little more time 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.900
 in on the road here we continue fighting in 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.750
 the center and there are times since I come back 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.480
 crazy that I do not even know what I see if they are 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.330
 mine if they are yours 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.580
 and well, as you can see, it's a game 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.910
 pretty crazy pretty intense all the 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.640
 not standing still and then here that entered and 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.530
 I go go in and out and going and going 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.960
 going in and out of this position 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.390
 aguantáis they go well so I will see 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.700
 very useful to this position and I 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.960
 I like to take her and empower her in 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:45.840
 those in the trades nothing seems that 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.330
 Come on, let's win, I put the marks, veis 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.100
 many times I put them in places because 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.440
 side of the stairs because I know that if 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.330
 they regulate or they go like that right now 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.560
 what's going on above I know he's going 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.570
 to go out there is going to go over 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.490
 then always try to expose a 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.320
 little out there we just got out the 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.000
 little sign like we have won but not 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.950
 you trust because then there is always 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.660
 a few seconds that you can keep hitting 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.030
 you and giving you of hosts here fixes me a 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.830
 killer I automatically get into the 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.080
 arrows because I have stability and I know that 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.900
 so I can escape from him and nothing looks at me 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.570
 we ended up killing him he threw his hands 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.640
 above but the marks when the enemy 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.140
 is fallen as you see they do not affect it for 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.030
 nothing and good up here the gameplay 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.289
 I hope you liked and contributed 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.569
 something new 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:29.430
 like you that the game comes out soon 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:32.689
 trying to make the wait more bearable 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.689
 we wait for you in the channel
