00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:24.860
 Hello ages today 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.119
 Tendeyo learn about the arch position on the opposite flank to remember 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:34.010
 The arch stance is often the way I put my back on my ass. 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.890
 Diagnose if there are obstacles to the movement of the spine in roasting work 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.510
 It's easy to do and it's great to reinforce it. 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:46.250
 Ordinary turtle neck shoulder and upper body back due to sitting position, legs or legs 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.770
 I am not accustomed to not being back, but the heat is just the right posture. 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.670
 You can catch 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.680
 It is time to give an advisory opinion before going into the main text . 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.270
 How much is not the first book to bang up during the day, 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:07.430
 Is the second movement evenly balanced? 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:10.070
 The reason for this is that these lifestyle habits will continue to affect your body 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.950
 It breaks the balance . 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:20.539
 The arch position is mobility training, that is , it has a flaw in flexibility 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:25.240
 When you raise your spine, you do not lift the floor 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.240
 It is going up by itself with the power of muscle. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:35.770
 Arch starting position is always prone state is the start of the arch position 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.480
 At first, I concentrate on lifting my legs. 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.340
 Give strength to your toes 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:46.990
 I like it if your arms can be tilted slowly on the floor and your upper body can be pushed back 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:52.030
 Arch stance. If you have a few important points , collect the first wing bone. 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:56.380
 You should make it hard to have two shoulders. Not only the upper part of the waist, but also the torso 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:01.210
 I flipped the spine to the top of the back must be contained and portable, you 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:05.590
 The legs give the strength of the buttocks and lift them until they fall from the thighs. 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.770
 Both legs should be attached to each other , 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.700
 Movement range depends on individual 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.910
 But if you get to the minimum range, the wound will be bright , 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.230
 The lower body should not touch the ground with the thighs. 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.330
 The problem is that secondary sexual characteristics are adolescents or adults over posture, as if only to continue 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.620
 It will not be improved 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.040
 If your posture does not look like the video , 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.040
 Tell me please
