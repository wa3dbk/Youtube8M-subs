00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:11.669
 So you 're making this video to be able to 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:16.960
 show a problem that is serious does not itch 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:20.650
 problem is the following is what started 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.610
 was the gap can see that the march of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.060
 silly he is top notch and presents 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.370
 this slack name all the marches - the aft 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.129
 but the meeting counts because it 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:38.469
 it gets stuck that in that part of the grid 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.149
 here it is unique but I think it is 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:46.510
 ugly but has been walking with the 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.969
 car is like this and now has a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.829
 enormous difficulty in shaping the 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.539
 marches are mainly first and foremost 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.819
 secondly linked with great difficulty but 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.710
 it is impossible to walk to the car this 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:05.219
 shape when I swing that watch the slack 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.670
 I do not know if you'll see here. 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:13.270
 here where is my finger here and here 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.189
 the two sides have two 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.140
 plastic that when I move it appears that 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.380
 is to jump out which image have the two 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.740
 that he had already stolen and he will have to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.490
 exchange the two and a lot of people talk about this 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.609
 this going here or man you right 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.380
 visually she does not look late 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.750
 spoiled 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:45.280
 but a lot of people say that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.460
 influence on this thing here I 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.380
 I still did not want to dismount here. 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.149
 because really here I do not know what it's like 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.369
 that works 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.350
 four screws here and has a screw 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.420
 here probably had its own for 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.490
 dismantle and take a note off 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.490
 if it is the case of changing this bushing here 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.429
 Let's go there ahead of the car.
