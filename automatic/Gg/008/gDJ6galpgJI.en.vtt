00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
and Josh both flathead v8 piston showing

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.440 
and Josh both flathead v8 piston showing
off<00:00:09.080> with<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> rod<00:00:10.849> Josh<00:00:11.849> gonna<00:00:12.059> take<00:00:12.269> his

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
off with the rod Josh gonna take his

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.520 
off with the rod Josh gonna take his
home<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.780> don't<00:00:12.929> know<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.139> he's<00:00:13.230> gonna<00:00:13.410> make

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
home I don't know what he's gonna make

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.020 
home I don't know what he's gonna make
out<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.830> his<00:00:13.980> I'm<00:00:14.219> thinking<00:00:14.519> about<00:00:14.639> swapping

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
out of his I'm thinking about swapping

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.990 
out of his I'm thinking about swapping
me<00:00:15.740> I've<00:00:16.740> got<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> piston<00:00:17.480> shifter<00:00:18.480> over<00:00:19.170> here

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
me I've got a piston shifter over here

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.380 
me I've got a piston shifter over here
which<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.029> made<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:21.539> an<00:00:21.689> old<00:00:22.820> air<00:00:23.820> compressor

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
which is made out an old air compressor

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.790 
which is made out an old air compressor
piston<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:24.930> thinking<00:00:25.260> wouldn't<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
piston but I'm thinking wouldn't it be a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.240 
piston but I'm thinking wouldn't it be a
lot<00:00:25.949> cooler<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:27.769> flathead<00:00:28.769> Ford<00:00:28.980> v8

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
lot cooler to have a flathead Ford v8

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.679 
lot cooler to have a flathead Ford v8
piston<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:30.000> instead<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.480> air

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
piston there instead of that air

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.389 
piston there instead of that air
compressor<00:00:30.840> piston<00:00:31.560> especially<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.219> got

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
compressor piston especially if I got

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.760 
compressor piston especially if I got
the<00:00:32.550> connecting<00:00:33.000> rod<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.600> could<00:00:34.350> connect<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the connecting rod I could connect the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.530 
the connecting rod I could connect the
connecting<00:00:35.280> rod<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:35.730> along<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.329> here

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
connecting rod right along up in here

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.020 
connecting rod right along up in here
with<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.930> oh<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:38.250> would<00:00:38.370> make<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.879> much

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
with it oh that would make it so much

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.950 
with it oh that would make it so much
better

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
better

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
better
plus<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.250> Bicknell<00:00:41.670> brought<00:00:41.940> from

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
plus it's the one Bicknell brought from

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.880 
plus it's the one Bicknell brought from
George's<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.719> part<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.320> he<00:00:43.469> meant<00:00:43.770> all

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
George's so part of what he meant all

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.319 
George's so part of what he meant all
that<00:00:44.100> trouble<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.460> bring<00:00:44.610> me<00:00:44.670> would<00:00:44.969> wind<00:00:45.180> up

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that trouble to bring me would wind up

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.779 
that trouble to bring me would wind up
on<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> hot<00:00:45.780> rod<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.980> would<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.280> wicked

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
on the hot rod which would be wicked

00:00:47.789 --> 00:01:17.539 
on the hot rod which would be wicked
wicked<00:00:47.940> cool<00:00:48.800> so<00:01:15.920> we<00:01:16.920> got<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> make<00:01:17.220> sure<00:01:17.280> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
wicked cool so we got to make sure it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.170 
wicked cool so we got to make sure it's
