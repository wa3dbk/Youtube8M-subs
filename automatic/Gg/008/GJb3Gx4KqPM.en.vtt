00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.020 

muscle<00:04:30.600> right<00:04:30.750> here<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:31.860> those<00:04:32.100> arms<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.730> both

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
muscle right here in those arms and both

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.600 
muscle right here in those arms and both
arms<00:04:33.420> do<00:04:33.750> come<00:04:34.140> off<00:04:35.120> but<00:04:36.120> they<00:04:36.480> are<00:04:37.610> pretty

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
arms do come off but they are pretty

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.600 
arms do come off but they are pretty
hard<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:38.940> put<00:04:39.240> back<00:04:39.419> on<00:04:39.690> they<00:04:40.560> put<00:04:40.800> back<00:04:40.980> on<00:04:41.250> but

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
hard to put back on they put back on but

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.500 
hard to put back on they put back on but
they're<00:04:41.820> just<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.180> little<00:04:42.240> bit<00:04:42.450> hard

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
they're just a little bit hard

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.600 
they're just a little bit hard
there<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:45.630> go<00:04:45.750> bulls<00:04:46.080> hands<00:04:46.380> do<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.250> mean

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
there you go bulls hands do this I mean

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.830 
there you go bulls hands do this I mean
I<00:04:47.640> both<00:04:47.940> I<00:04:48.330> guess

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
I both I guess

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.110 
I both I guess
arms<00:04:49.290> do<00:04:49.650> this<00:04:49.830> but<00:04:50.520> yeah<00:04:50.730> they're<00:04:50.910> really

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
arms do this but yeah they're really

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.330 
arms do this but yeah they're really
hard<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:51.570> come<00:04:51.750> off<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.220> because

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
hard to come off and I like it because

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.740 
hard to come off and I like it because
then<00:04:53.640> you<00:04:53.730> can<00:04:53.910> pose<00:04:54.180> them<00:04:55.010> like<00:04:56.010> this<00:04:56.310> and

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
then you can pose them like this and

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.000 
then you can pose them like this and
then<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:57.960> can<00:04:58.110> go<00:04:58.260> like<00:04:58.410> this<00:04:58.440> like<00:04:58.620> he's

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
then you can go like this like he's

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.420 
then you can go like this like he's
powering<00:04:59.430> up<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:01.440> yeah<00:05:01.590> that's<00:05:01.800> pretty<00:05:02.040> cool

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
powering up so yeah that's pretty cool

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.840 
powering up so yeah that's pretty cool
that<00:05:02.760> would<00:05:02.910> work<00:05:04.010> pretty<00:05:05.010> decently<00:05:05.550> for

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
that would work pretty decently for
