00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.000
 a girl in this attic a new 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.970
 tutorial and today we are going to do something very 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.460
 very very basic I bought a glaze 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.100
 cracked as you can see and I'm going to 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.500
 explain how it gets and see the effect 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.740
 ok then we will not use brushes 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.720
 no sponges, none of this is going to use a 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.350
 base enamel that I used this that is 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.130
 bright blue 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.280
 one is more of character like this one is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.289
 from the tico brand 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.420
 and a transparent enamel 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.090
 The first thing we are going to do is paint 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.969
 the nail of the enamel that you have of color 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.010
 base the color you want and now we go 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.110
 to apply the enamel that you think there is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.430
 to apply I repeat it because it dries 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.970
 right away 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.970
 so 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.230
 we look for enamel 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 and apply on the nail 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.990
 I in this case after all go through and 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.610
 these 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.610
 but you have to pass it quickly 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.360
 and nothing is already 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 this little bit is going to be like 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.690
 you will see 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.340
 what 'crack' does as you want it to 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.090
 we can 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 know where you're going to create voucher and you 're 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 starting I know 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.530
 and when I finish, I'm going to pass a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 transparent passage because this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.230
 enamel is a little dull and there I 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.800
 I like it to shine quite then 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.360
 nothing else finished we will pass transparent 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.500
 and we will have a design that remains 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.270
 original post 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.970
 originating depends on the colors that 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.370
 you use and good super easy easier not 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.650
 it can be good since it has been almost 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.720
 everything that has to be left 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.720
 and now I 'm going to pass the transparent 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.490
 we make the transparent and you're 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.640
 finished design I hope you have 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.640
 liked
