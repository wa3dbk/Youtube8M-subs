out she got so excited and she was
wearing<00:00:51.030> me<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> decided<00:00:51.930> I'll<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.500> go

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
wearing me out so I decided I'll just go

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
wearing me out so I decided I'll just go
back<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> ventilator<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.610> now<00:00:54.360> we're

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
back to the ventilator and now we're

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
back to the ventilator and now we're
back<00:00:54.660> down<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> our<00:00:55.079> normal<00:00:55.320> eight<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.219> nine

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
back down to our normal eight or nine

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
back down to our normal eight or nine
times<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.760> week<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.270> gives<00:00:57.510> me<00:00:57.690> more<00:00:57.840> time<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
out the handlebars stock handlebars were

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
out the handlebars stock handlebars were
a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.119> bit<00:01:42.329> too<00:01:42.540> low<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.020> too<00:01:43.049> far<00:01:43.320> forward

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
a little bit too low and too far forward

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.310 
a little bit too low and too far forward
for<00:01:43.979> me<00:01:44.329> looked<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> drag<00:01:45.720> bar<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.259> I

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
for me looked at the drag bar but I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.259 
pegs went to tribal and I added in a
chin<00:03:51.620> spoiler<00:03:52.069> which<00:03:52.549> I<00:03:52.699> think<00:03:52.940> makes<00:03:53.180> the

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
chin spoiler which I think makes the

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.330 
chin spoiler which I think makes the
bike<00:03:53.449> look<00:03:53.629> a<00:03:53.720> little<00:03:53.840> bit<00:03:54.019> lower<00:03:54.229> and<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:55.190> kind

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
bike look a little bit lower and it kind

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.839 
bike look a little bit lower and it kind
of<00:03:55.400> cleans<00:03:55.579> out<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.790> front<00:03:56.060> end<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.269> little<00:03:56.359> bit

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
of cleans out the front end a little bit

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.490 
of cleans out the front end a little bit
overall<00:03:58.849> my<00:03:59.030> goal<00:03:59.269> was<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.540> to<00:04:00.049> have<00:04:00.199> a<00:04:00.229> low

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
overall my goal was to to have a low

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.580 
overall my goal was to to have a low
bike<00:04:01.150> with<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> little<00:04:02.419> bit<00:04:02.510> of<00:04:02.629> style<00:04:02.900> that's

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
bike with a little bit of style that's

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.809 
bike with a little bit of style that's
comfortable<00:04:03.949> to<00:04:04.159> ride<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.959> I<00:04:06.500> think<00:04:06.769> I<00:04:07.040> was

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
comfortable to ride and I think I was

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.539 
comfortable to ride and I think I was
able<00:04:07.939> to<00:04:08.090> do<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.359> to<00:04:08.510> my<00:04:08.659> satisfaction

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
able to do that to my satisfaction
