00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
a lot of old footage but the last 10

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.290 
a lot of old footage but the last 10
seconds<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:42.720> so<00:00:43.190> includes<00:00:44.190> entirely<00:00:44.969> new

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
seconds or so includes entirely new

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
seconds or so includes entirely new
scenes<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.260> seen<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.739> any

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
scenes that we have not seen in any

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.779 
scenes that we have not seen in any
other<00:00:46.980> promo<00:00:47.370> before<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.660> look<00:00:48.899> intense

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
other promo before and they look intense

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.889 
other promo before and they look intense
it<00:00:50.789> looks<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.210> mostly<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> be

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
it looks like it's mostly going to be

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.790 
it looks like it's mostly going to be
proceeding<00:00:52.410> season<00:00:52.800> finale<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.770> could<00:00:55.770> be

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
proceeding season finale but I could be

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.369 
proceeding season finale but I could be
wrong<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.750> none<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:57.960> clips<00:00:58.260> were

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
wrong because none of these clips were

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.119 
wrong because none of these clips were
seen<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.829> any<00:00:59.640> promos<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.649> tonight's<00:01:01.649> episode

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
seen in any promos for tonight's episode

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.790 
seen in any promos for tonight's episode
so<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.449> probably<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.899> season<00:01:04.229> finale<00:01:04.500> stuff

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
so it's probably all season finale stuff

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.850 
so it's probably all season finale stuff
but<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.090> looks<00:01:06.330> pretty<00:01:06.420> sick<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.229> let<00:01:07.470> me<00:01:07.649> show

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
but it looks pretty sick so let me show

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.040 
but it looks pretty sick so let me show
you<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.340> clip<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:09.990> I'll

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
you the little clip that I have and I'll

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.570 
you the little clip that I have and I'll
break<00:01:10.259> it<00:01:10.289> down<00:01:10.470> afterwards<00:01:11.070> something<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
break it down afterwards something to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.380 
break it down afterwards something to

here<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.860> Rick<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.459> looks<00:02:32.489> like<00:02:32.849> he<00:02:33.000> just

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
here of Rick it looks like he just

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.630 
here of Rick it looks like he just
messed<00:02:33.780> somebody<00:02:34.349> up<00:02:34.560> pretty<00:02:34.950> badly<00:02:35.220> he<00:02:35.430> just

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
fight through full of walkers something

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.470 
fight through full of walkers something
like<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.910> because<00:02:42.000> he<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.299> covered<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.810> blood

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
like that because he is covered in blood

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.509 
like that because he is covered in blood
he's<00:02:45.480> sitting<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.170> something<00:02:47.040> or<00:02:47.190> leaning

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
he's sitting in something or leaning

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.850 
he's sitting in something or leaning
against<00:02:47.790> something<00:02:48.140> originally<00:02:49.140> at<00:02:49.500> first

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
against something originally at first

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.170 
against something originally at first
glance<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.310> was<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.489> oh<00:02:50.610> he's<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:50.879> back<00:02:51.060> of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
glance I was like oh he's in the back of

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.809 
glance I was like oh he's in the back of
Abraham's<00:02:51.599> truck<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.530> Abraham's<00:02:53.370> truck<00:02:53.639> was

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
Abraham's truck but Abraham's truck was

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.640 
Abraham's truck but Abraham's truck was
broke<00:02:54.329> down<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.019> don't<00:02:55.200> really<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.440> that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
broke down so I don't really see that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.270 
broke down so I don't really see that
happening<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:58.410> something<00:02:58.739> bad<00:02:58.950> just<00:02:58.980> happened

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
happening so something bad just happened

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.390 
happening so something bad just happened
there<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.630> he's<00:03:00.870> obviously<00:03:01.440> alive<00:03:01.950> right

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
there but he's obviously alive right

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.729 
there but he's obviously alive right
here<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:02.910> that's<00:03:03.420> cool<00:03:04.250> next<00:03:05.250> shaft<00:03:06.200> oh<00:03:07.200> well

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
here so that's cool next shaft oh well

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.009 
here so that's cool next shaft oh well

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.740 
think happened here I think maybe like I
said<00:03:13.590> maybe<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.790> brutality<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.540> we

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
said maybe this is the brutality that we

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.420 
said maybe this is the brutality that we
hear<00:03:15.930> about<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.380> maybe<00:03:16.500> he<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:16.739> goes<00:03:17.099> off<00:03:17.400> on

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
hear about and maybe he just goes off on

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.159 
hear about and maybe he just goes off on
Joe's<00:03:18.030> group<00:03:18.419> or<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:21.530> possible<00:03:22.530> cannibals<00:03:23.310> in

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
Joe's group or the possible cannibals in

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.970 
Joe's group or the possible cannibals in
terminus<00:03:25.169> we're<00:03:25.319> not<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.530> not<00:03:25.650> confirmed

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
terminus we're not it's not confirmed

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.460 
terminus we're not it's not confirmed
yet<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.400> we<00:03:26.489> don't<00:03:26.519> really<00:03:26.700> know<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.169> um<00:03:28.169> I

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
yet so we don't really know but um I

of concerning unless just Rick just gave

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.210 
of concerning unless just Rick just gave
it<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.019> him<00:03:43.169> /<00:03:43.319> protection<00:03:43.799> something<00:03:44.069> like

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
it to him / protection something like

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.620 
it to him / protection something like
that<00:03:44.400> too<00:03:44.579> maybe<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.790> Carl<00:03:45.030> was<00:03:45.150> out<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.299> ammo

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
that too maybe it Carl was out of ammo

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.199 
that too maybe it Carl was out of ammo
in<00:03:45.810> his<00:03:46.650> pistol<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.250> Rick<00:03:47.790> still<00:03:48.000> has<00:03:48.090> his

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
in his pistol is Rick still has his

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.830 
in his pistol is Rick still has his
Python<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.380> he's<00:03:50.130> running<00:03:50.340> away<00:03:50.430> from<00:03:50.810> four<00:03:51.810> or

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
Python so he's running away from four or

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.940 
Python so he's running away from four or
five<00:03:52.049> zombies<00:03:52.410> there<00:03:52.859> so<00:03:53.819> that's<00:03:54.090> cool<00:03:54.950> next

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
five zombies there so that's cool next

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.179 
five zombies there so that's cool next
shot<00:03:56.190> here<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.639> of<00:03:56.880> Daryl<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.629> he<00:03:58.469> does<00:03:58.650> have<00:03:58.920> a

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
shot here is of Daryl and he does have a

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.459 
shot here is of Daryl and he does have a
black<00:03:59.670> eye<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.090> he<00:04:00.870> looks<00:04:01.079> like<00:04:01.200> he<00:04:01.319> took<00:04:01.349> a

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:01.469 
black eye and he looks like he took a

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.059 
black eye and he looks like he took a
beating<00:04:01.860> he's<00:04:02.040> got

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
beating he's got

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.420 
beating he's got
flip<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:04.150> left<00:04:04.780> eyebrow<00:04:05.019> got<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.040> cut<00:04:06.219> on<00:04:06.249> it

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
flip is a left eyebrow got a cut on it

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.449 
flip is a left eyebrow got a cut on it
so<00:04:07.290> I'm<00:04:08.290> betting<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.739> he<00:04:08.920> took<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.189> beating

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
so I'm betting that he took a beating

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.220 
so I'm betting that he took a beating
