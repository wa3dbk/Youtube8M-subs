leading edge which makes sense so at
three<00:03:36.209> inches<00:03:36.360> right<00:03:36.780> now<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.019> am<00:03:37.410> slightly

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
three inches right now I am slightly

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.259 
three inches right now I am slightly
heavy<00:03:38.310> heavy<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:40.040> manageable

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
heavy heavy is is manageable

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.910 
heavy heavy is is manageable
tail-heavy<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.320> deadly<00:03:43.920> one<00:03:44.370> flight<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.530> I'm

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
tail-heavy is deadly one flight so I'm

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.780 
tail-heavy is deadly one flight so I'm
going<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.519> give<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> quick<00:03:48.690> walk<00:03:48.900> around<00:03:49.320> I

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
going to give you a quick walk around I

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.640 
going to give you a quick walk around I
changed<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.940> motor<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.239> loader<00:03:51.930> mount<00:03:52.260> as<00:03:52.470> it

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
changed the motor a loader mount as it

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.970 
changed the motor a loader mount as it
was<00:03:52.769> had<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> huge<00:03:54.709> huge<00:03:55.709> wrong<00:03:56.130> angle<00:03:57.800> so<00:03:58.800> what

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
was had a huge huge wrong angle so what

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.710 
was had a huge huge wrong angle so what
I've<00:03:59.100> done<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.459> I've<00:03:59.640> corrected<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.360> angle

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
I've done is I've corrected the angle

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.229 
I've done is I've corrected the angle
back<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.470> left<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:02.040> was<00:04:02.340> pointing<00:04:03.060> off<00:04:03.209> to

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
back to the left it was pointing off to

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.020 
back to the left it was pointing off to
the<00:04:03.540> right<00:04:03.780> severely<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.760> angle<00:04:06.180> up<00:04:06.390> for

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
the right severely the angle up for

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.759 
the right severely the angle up for
point<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> nose<00:04:09.330> down<00:04:09.690> point<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.410> nose<00:04:10.620> of

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
point the nose down point the nose of

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.130 
point the nose down point the nose of
the<00:04:10.860> motor<00:04:11.070> down<00:04:11.400> angle<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:12.150> good<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.660> my

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
the motor down angle is good in my

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.770 
the motor down angle is good in my
opinion<00:04:13.260> it's<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.310> good<00:04:14.340> start<00:04:14.760> point<00:04:14.940> anyway

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
opinion it's a good start point anyway

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.020 
opinion it's a good start point anyway
you<00:04:16.049> see<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.350> angle<00:04:16.680> up<00:04:16.880> maybe<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.910> little

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you see the angle up maybe a little

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.010 
you see the angle up maybe a little
might<00:04:18.780> be<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.959> little<00:04:19.109> extreme<00:04:19.560> we'll<00:04:19.799> find<00:04:20.040> out

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
might be a little extreme we'll find out

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.420 
might be a little extreme we'll find out
so<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.049> didn't<00:04:22.289> change<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.800> what<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.340> did

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
so I didn't change that what I did

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.980 
so I didn't change that what I did
change<00:04:23.850> was

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
change was

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.159 
change was
the<00:04:25.860> motor<00:04:26.069> block<00:04:26.310> was<00:04:26.669> facing<00:04:27.210> off<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:28.050> the

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
the motor block was facing off to the

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.210 
the motor block was facing off to the
right<00:04:28.380> or<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:29.550> burden<00:04:29.759> left<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.770> corrected

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
right or the burden left and I corrected

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.800 
right or the burden left and I corrected
it<00:04:32.340> back<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> little<00:04:32.880> bit<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.860> its<00:04:34.860> right<00:04:35.370> to

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
it back a little bit to its right to

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.990 
it back a little bit to its right to
push<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.990> nose<00:04:37.199> to<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.800> right<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:41.000> the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
push the nose to the right so the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.820 
push the nose to the right so the
tailplane<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.780> fixed<00:04:43.259> in<00:04:43.349> place<00:04:43.530> glued<00:04:44.039> and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
tailplane I fixed in place glued and

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.059 
tailplane I fixed in place glued and
standard<00:04:46.830> servos<00:04:48.110> arrangement<00:04:49.110> let<00:04:49.919> it

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
standard servos arrangement let it

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.080 
standard servos arrangement let it
underneath<00:04:50.550> there<00:04:52.039> other<00:04:53.039> than<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:53.460> it's

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
underneath there other than that it's

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.820 
underneath there other than that it's
pretty<00:04:55.130> it's<00:04:56.130> pretty<00:04:56.280> stock<00:04:57.259> okay<00:04:58.259> so<00:04:58.410> let's

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
pretty it's pretty stock okay so let's

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.120 
pretty it's pretty stock okay so let's
do<00:04:58.949> a<00:04:59.009> little<00:04:59.070> taxing<00:04:59.759> and<00:04:59.940> I'll<00:05:00.620> I'll<00:05:01.620> tune<00:05:01.949> up

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
do a little taxing and I'll I'll tune up

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.510 
do a little taxing and I'll I'll tune up
the<00:05:03.199> I'll<00:05:04.199> turn<00:05:04.410> up<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.620> flight<00:05:04.830> surfaces<00:05:05.130> I

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
the I'll turn up the flight surfaces I

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.360 
the I'll turn up the flight surfaces I
haven't<00:05:05.910> done<00:05:06.030> any<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:06.660> rate<00:05:07.410> adjustment

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
haven't done any of that rate adjustment

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.260 
haven't done any of that rate adjustment
yet<00:05:08.550> so

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
yet so

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.560 
yet so
sambaiah<00:05:09.960> will<00:05:10.169> be<00:05:10.259> right<00:05:10.410> back
