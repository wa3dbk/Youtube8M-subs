00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.500
 good morning everyone today we are with a 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.990
 new video about music in minecraft and 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.029
 Well I've been looking for how to do 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.039
 Super Mario Bros song and when 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.890
 I got it I say with what has 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.810
 cost to me let's help others 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.570
 okay and here I have the first piece 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.570
 of the song, it's pretty long 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.120
 pretty long 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.359
 and that is the first piece of the song 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.760
 and I've put all the notes worth 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.100
 the safest if you ask me if you like the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.079
 video because it is safest to go 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.060
 going up in parts for requests worth 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 there are nine parts this is the first 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.010
 and well let's try it 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.620
 then I will pass slowly so you can see 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.620
 the notes 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.220
 and it's pretty short, it's worth 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.540
 first part think that there are nine what 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.030
 I will do on request is as I have already 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.000
 saying 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.860
 I will pass to show you the notes and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.860
 that you can copy it in your world 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.920
 I'm going to take my hand off this 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.869
 and there it is 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.659
 I'm sorry for the micro but it's a bit 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.070
 fucked up okay it's got his good years I'm going 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.070
 to pass like this directly 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.930
 here are three attentive worth 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.930
 Yes better 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.540
 and good 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.580
 It seems to me a foolish thing that takes 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.370
 to do something like that the truth you say 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.340
 it's nothing in twenty special seconds 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.760
 the song 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.910
 but he's thinking that I've taken a 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.290
 piano score is worth and that are two notes 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.530
 for every time 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.150
 not minimum but two notes per time 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.760
 It means that it is not the same as 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.349
 there they dropped a note every time and it was 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.989
 a flute score is much more 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.220
 simple that of pirates of the Caribbean that 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.240
 is 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.420
 and well you will have noticed that there are shades that 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.850
 does not reach the right point what has 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.880
 past here and now there is another and this what 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.790
 What has happened to me is that the song is worth 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.310
 to do it correctly 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.450
 I needed 25 clicks in one in two or three 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.370
 of the blocks and they only have 24 so 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.940
 I had to lower the whole scale a 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.490
 number is worth all the notes are a 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.910
 number of downloads I have corrected all 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.770
 the posters and less this this is the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.930
 original part 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.430
 this part is not changed at all the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.430
 rest is worked a number is worth 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.950
 You see to go you have noticed 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.400
 and here again it's worth these are the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.430
 places where I've had them 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.780
 to settle because it does not finish arriving the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.150
 notes 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.640
 and well I ask again that if someone 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.209
 he knows how to make the white notes that 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.990
 Say it and good for a tutorial on how 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.150
 do it that I passed the same tutorial 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:53.480
 because it's good to know it's worth I leave it 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.480
 Here I hope you liked it and goodbye
