on other servers and let's face it face

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
on other servers and let's face it face
it<00:01:07.409> these<00:01:07.530> maps<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.549> server<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:09.060> very

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it these maps on this server are very

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
it these maps on this server are very
good<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.490> i'm

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
good so it's not like it's not like i'm

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080 
good so it's not like it's not like i'm
changing<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> worse<00:01:13.320> server<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.100> think

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
changing to to a worse server I think

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.320 
changing to to a worse server I think
it's<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.299> great<00:01:15.330> server<00:01:15.930> no<00:01:16.350> leg<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.729> games<00:01:17.970> run

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it's a great server no leg the games run

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.440 
it's a great server no leg the games run
very<00:01:18.659> smoothly<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:20.369> wouldn't<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.090> any
