00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 and know the conditions on our map 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.879
 and is a low pressure system the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.529
 southeast of cabo san lucas eye on that 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.420
 moment already has 70 percent of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.340
 possibility of cyclonic development the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.840
 good news is that it is far from 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.639
 national territory of course you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.410
 We will be reporting any change 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.820
 that could occur there is a large area 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.699
 instability that is affecting the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.020
 north of the country will be just 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.970
 associated with a low pressure channel 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.279
 causing heavy rains and storms 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.740
 in that area and also eye because we have 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.810
 the tropical wave the number 15 goes to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.940
 extend from puebla to guerrero 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.399
 causing rains in much of the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.899
 east and west of the country and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.450
 I can also comment on it talking about 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 south that tropical wave number 16 goes to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.290
 get to the yucatan peninsula going to 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.850
 move towards the west reinforcing the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.219
 potential for heavy rains in the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.539

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.489

 well we have a day with average cloudiness 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.500
 because it makes the night of possibility of

 rain of new account the maximum will fly 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.640
