 no arm needed 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.300
 stop deflecting and immediately 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.550
 hard capture is important

 after protection against impact there is only one 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.139
 moment to neutralize 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.539

 weapons in the arsenal of self-defense techniques 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.039
 which is always necessary to apply 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:49.840
 better than real danger being on

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.960
 along the wall 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.669

 hitters gives very little chance of 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.150
 the rescue 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.409
 try to escape immediately 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.409
 as soon as the real one appeared 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.529
 weapons in the hands of criminals are very 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.009
 big threat therefore protection against 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:36.210
 he should always try out 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.220
 own jacket can be thrown on 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.600
 face attacker and immediately apply 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.759
 hard knee kick 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.919
 this may allow to take away 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.020
 criminal weapons and defend more 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.860
 effectively really need to remember 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.050
 limits of necessary self-defense 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.599
 if managed to seize the weapon strikes 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.550
 better to put hand and foot 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:58.550
 attackers can be used from such 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.760
 peace anyway task avoid 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.830
 danger they fight criminals 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.060
 so run away as soon as 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.060
 it appeared possible
