00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.140
 hey dear colleagues today I am 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.649
 me by a small lake and harsh 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.920
 to catch 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.080
 the weather is nice the conditions 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.470
 are actually pretty good 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.780
 me here at the small spout always 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.680
 Fresh water comes in pretty good 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.500
 Actually industry will act 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.930
 I use the new driver power today 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.430
 stand the fish catch 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.300
 testing is really very grateful 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:37.470
 occupied very nice device two in front of me 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.750
 meter 1 long mainly carbon lies 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:48.150
 only 120 grams weight 5 to 15 kilos 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.730
 more efficient at 5 to 14 grams 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.230
 Small Maps 1 will be the first bait 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.970
 be good cut 2000 with mono you 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.630
 you can see the fishing rod again 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.600
 a very nice piece then we look 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:09.229
 if it also brings nice fish so up 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.229
 caught for the first fish 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 hello dear colleague first first little 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.700
 bar 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.159
 worked well maybe a minute 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:25.240
 Again, it would be like this 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.440
 nice fish after the first fish 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.880
 I unfortunately had the job 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.619
 change because just too many 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.640
 people were not just not 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.509
 I got in now I have a 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.930
 new position 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:43.650
 You see, here are forbidden and me 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.650
 try my luck here so colleagues 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.750
 The first fishing trip is over with the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.399
 new fishing rod i didn't have long 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.820
 kept half an hour did not have 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.049
 a lot of time is determined more often 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.789
 enter this route 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.119
 next time probably also before 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.600
 all received a beautiful warsaw 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.579
 a nicer still lost router 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.239
 I like it so far very well to a 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.340
 tip action the role I took 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.840
 the 2000 maybe you're big for 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.470
 the model may become open 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 Change thousands and until the next 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.590
 video series we get going again 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.910
 Fishing was with us for the second time 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.269
 This time a little rubber fish is out 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.549
 cologne is back on ba we'll see 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:37.040
 what we had from beautiful fishermen 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:40.700
 The lake is the same and me 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.280
 I'll be back soon, I hope 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.349
 we caught the first little bosch 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.430
 the beginning is done 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.960
 until the next here is the same 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:59.240
 next bar 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:01.070
 a bit nicer runs do well 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.350
 normal kick out to the ground like 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.860
 you quickly see it loose and then you moved 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.830
 I leave a two times three then again 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.850
 well, this is just one again I can 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.280
 bad now because I'm with one 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.170
 hand must have and then moved again 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.370
 a little further and leave a second 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.530
 rest in between 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.130
 Currently , most of the time the bait 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.570
 attacks quite simply because I only briefly 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.620
 show up with other colleagues today 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.590
 Panic for trout with the diver 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.890
 the third test of this route is the bait 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.540
 will be 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:43.880
 whoops from the rapala 8 cm long spinner 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.430
 normal from dreyer size maps to 1 to 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.440
 size maps smaller wobblers of rapallo 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.290
 Always run well and fish the fish 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.460
 are often underestimated 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.020
 especially with trout fishing energy 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.370
 rent but you catch a lot 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.110
 Well 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.330
 i hope we catch something i was 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.650
 not yet on the water 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.790
 I hope the water the water level 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.090
 not so high until the same 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.000
 another colleague katrin göbel her 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.870
 can see 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.870
 he is not very sure 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.560
 a beautiful 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.780
 To land, the cameramen must 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.450
 turn off 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.110
 but I need both hands for that 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.110
 is not completely broken 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.919
 Well cordially the camera away there is the 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:57.580
 first fish very nice chub was there 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.849
 showed what she could so 40 werte 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.509
 have considered that I do I have well the 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.509
 do me around the fish 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:12.360
 Now we come to the end of the fishing day 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.360
 was fished with good 56 hours 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.530
 Tögel brought out a trout I 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.120
 still lost 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.449
 you could do very well with the double 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.330
 show that the 3w power mesh too 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.220
 can conquer larger fish easily 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.069
 So I had no problems with the dowel 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.360
 to make pressure 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.759
 Töpel had so two kilos 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.580
 that means also the biggest trout or 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.430
 though a pike should go 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.469
 you should be able to defeat 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.469
 overall conclusion about the route she has 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:47.490
 I really liked it 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:50.740
 She is very well processed very easily 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.909
 simply tip-top for bosch and trout 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.990
 I can not complain or 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.270
 give suggestions for improvement 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.500
 i would like her now i have one with me 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.770
 2000 roll 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.900
 He's fishing with a fishing was thousands 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.099
 It is very easy and extremely easy 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.909
 you also need an extremely light one 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:11.979
 I think that's what it was from me 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:15.819
 I hope the video has fallen over you 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:19.750
 the 3w power nash could me 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:22.199
 Subscribe if you want and see you soon 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.199
 next time
