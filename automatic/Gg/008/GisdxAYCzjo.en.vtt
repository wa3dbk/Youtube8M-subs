00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.440
 [Music] 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.780
 one 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.710
 to 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.840
 Achilles but this new video for 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.300
 tell them it's the snow breathe from the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 Yesterday I believe and yesterday the law is 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 jailbreak 6.1 to my iphone 4 device 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.450
 and with this program and that's why 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.020
 we come to bring because I was 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.980
 talking about how he worked 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.280
 and since I can not recommend them anymore and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.410
 good what we are going to occupy in the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.170
 description of the video page 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.859
 from this 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.960
 of these programmers and also soil 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.839
 leave in an alternative link so that 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.790
 they remain more direct than is rising 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.980
 a megas 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.980
 and well this is talking key 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:22.890
 for all who serve next 26.122 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.860
 firmware 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.860
 and here we are going to select our 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 device 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.930
 and the version of them that we are going to occupy 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.770
 just as there may be here is already 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.789
 downloading here I already believe is this 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.560
 but since I already have it downloaded by 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.359
 a matter of time and that I'm already if I 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.359
 my device can not cancel 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.230
 [Music] 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.280
 ok since we have our robot 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.020
 download the firmware 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.700
 let's go to frost abrous search 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.150
 and we will locate it where 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.990
 we unload 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.990
 and we 're going to mind 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.920
 continuous and here it's going to be very important 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.340
 that the mesa puerto montt 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.069
 in general 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.470
 and we can activate the little arrow 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.010
 our device that is when not 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.220
 we have the chip the original sim with flower 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.220
 here 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.290
 uncertain 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.160
 and from here we can see some effects 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.160
 that if you feel 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.130
 for your iphone installs in formentera del 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.130
 manager symbol 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.100
 and the psc w 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.820
 and our creation is already 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.820
 that is, web 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.040
 and thus gives winnowed 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.230
 about 15 minutes 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.939
 and it's not going to end here we're going 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.590
 he said that we turned off our device and 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.569
 we are going to put it in df 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.580
 but I'm going to cancel that I did it was 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.650
 substantive we are going to make this end 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.680
 barrier that comes here the truth is that 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.269
 It's very easy to use so it's not 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.280
 because the truth makes me lazy to go back to 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.190
 do the steps with my device and not 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.340
 I have another proof are in cannes the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.290
 bench because I already have it 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.440
 [Music] 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.520
 exist 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.520
 [Music] 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.189
 and with what we do with these stores 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.860
 let's not going to go up wash the base what 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:50.990
 we can activate if necessary 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:57.600
 and I took the one released 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:04:00.150
 device with what it was when I what 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.210
 I always took care not to get on the band 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.360
 base on a bread base equal since we have 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.260
 this where then do is open what 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.260
 what is itunes 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.430
 [Music] 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.919
 what could it be for 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.280
 [Music] 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:27.040
 I what itunes is going to look like 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.040
 we will all feel that this message 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.010
 since itunes has detected an iphone 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.810
 and the powers that nullified it by way 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.350
 previous like this 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.940
 that we were going to say and to restore 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.380
 one click and it will open a window 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.720
 like this one that will be our image 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.220
 I can not stand more 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.820
 but I 'm not going to ask for a lift 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.820
 like this bigger 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.860
 again that we talked 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.080
 and for those who do not know with the key 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.080
 shift work 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.500
 and good they will load what is their 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:33.349
 custom firmware firmware and reason with the 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.569
 that is not going to go up and well then it's going to 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.789
 be all your iphone I'm just going to charge you 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.669
 everything and when it turns on for the first 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:44.630
 time it will appear as a screen that 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:46.080
 says expansion and it takes about 35 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.889
 minutes 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.889
 and be able to use your device 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.780
 good they will be able to use in like as 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.660
 always and will ask them if they want 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.220
 of state a backup or something 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.340
 like that I was reading that 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.919
 They recommended setting it up as a new 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.580
 iphone and I what configure it 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.780
 restore a copy of technl icloud and 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.750
 the truth is that it has not given me problems 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.750
 neither with the battery nor with anything but good 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.039
 I'm going to make a video for you 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.100
 tell them with a mestalla not me with this 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:29.789
 new the tests the cons and everything 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.370
 what I've seen but good all the video 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.810
 and we are already letting you snow in 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.410
 the distribution of the video like that but they 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.199
 they serve and if they do not leave the questions 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.320
 have a comment on the video and with 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:47.180
 I will answer you with pleasure 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.180
