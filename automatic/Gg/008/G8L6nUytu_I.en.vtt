00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello hello girls welcome in this 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.640
 I am going to share with you one 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.440
 decoration for the nails of the feet 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.379
 for beginners stay to see this 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.329
 video give us home I will use this 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.940
 little pink color to apply it in 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.440
 each of my lines once I already 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.109
 we paint our nails we will stay 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.109
 this way now I'm going to use this 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.410
 black color and I will use a pointer 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.330
 of these little ones to do this 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 decoration let's make points the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.080
 first point I'll put it in corner 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.400
 then in the center after his own 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.400
 corner and so on 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.370
 right away I will use a brush 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.890
 thin like this we will take paint 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.170
 black and we will be joining lines to the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.690
 points this way 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 let's analyze the brush in the form of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 curve doing like a worm 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.050
 in this way we will continue to unite 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.820
 all the world points to another so 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.350
 easy so simple let's go 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.350
 filling all those empty spaces 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.060
 we will add one more point that is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.260
 necessary to fill that free space 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 and so follow the sequence 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.450
 This is one more idea to decorate 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.480
 our nails in an easy and 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.480
 fast 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.910
 As you can see it is easy to handle the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.560
 brushes in this way only 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.530
 we let slip smoothly and ready 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.540
 and finally we review once again the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.210
 paint so that this is a bit more 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.250
 marked 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.510
 right away I'm going to use pebbles 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.740
 decorative in pink 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.670
 let's go putting the pebbles in 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.830
 each of the points we made 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.500
 with this detail of the pebbles until 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.080
 that this decoration looks 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.210
 how can you see this hard decoration 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.440
 a long time to be done so it's super 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.440
 fast and easy 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.170
 this is how we end up 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.509
 this decoration has been everything for today 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.069
 girls these are the final results of 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.900
 our decoration where the first one 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.700
 is the one that looks in this decoration if still 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.420
