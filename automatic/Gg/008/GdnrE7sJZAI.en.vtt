and things like that and given a problem

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.080 
and things like that and given a problem
you<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> tools<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.010> your<00:00:23.070> toolbox<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.670> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
you have the tools in your toolbox to to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.849 
you have the tools in your toolbox to to
try<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.420> able<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.630> solve<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.500> kind<00:00:25.710> of

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
try to be able to solve that kind of

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.820 
try to be able to solve that kind of
problem<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.900> everybody<00:00:27.900> knows<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
problem but everybody knows that in the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.790 
problem but everybody knows that in the
real<00:00:29.519> world<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.179> also<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.810> your<00:00:30.929> test<00:00:31.260> you're

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
real world and also in your test you're

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.020 
real world and also in your test you're
going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.099> given<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> certain<00:00:32.610> kind<00:00:32.910> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
going to be given a certain kind of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.780 
going to be given a certain kind of
problem<00:00:33.410> called<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> word<00:00:34.739> problem<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
problem called the word problem and that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.119 
problem called the word problem and that
makes<00:00:36.030> people<00:00:36.840> sometimes<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> hard<00:00:37.950> time

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
makes people sometimes have a hard time

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.369 
makes people sometimes have a hard time
and<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.760> reason<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.260> know

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and the reason is because you you know

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
and the reason is because you you know
your<00:00:40.530> problem<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:40.980> given<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
your problem is not given to you in a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.240 
your problem is not given to you in a
nice<00:00:42.360> one-line<00:00:43.020> fashion<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> doesn't<00:00:44.070> just

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
nice one-line fashion it doesn't just

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.340 
nice one-line fashion it doesn't just
say<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.969> doesn't<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.420> say<00:00:45.570> solve<00:00:46.200> this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
say it doesn't just say solve this

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470 
say it doesn't just say solve this
equation<00:00:46.950> or<00:00:47.160> manipulate<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.270> expression

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
equation or manipulate this expression

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.189 
equation or manipulate this expression
the<00:00:49.260> word<00:00:49.469> problem<00:00:50.039> has<00:00:50.460> has<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> challenge<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the word problem has has a challenge to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.750 
the word problem has has a challenge to
it<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> bunch<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.129> words<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it because it's a bunch of words and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
it because it's a bunch of words and
there's<00:00:54.239> numbers<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.350> Sally<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
there's numbers in there and Sally and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.099 
there's numbers in there and Sally and
James<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.940> different<00:00:57.210> people's<00:00:57.480> names<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
James and different people's names and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
James and different people's names and
so<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.370> challenge<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.180> with

so on and and your challenge really with

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.760 
so on and and your challenge really with
those<00:01:00.449> kinds<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.780> problems<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.530> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
those kinds of problems that you have to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.560 
those kinds of problems that you have to
to<00:01:02.219> take<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> information<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
too hot fix it okay so what we're gonna

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
too hot fix it okay so what we're gonna
do<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.369> course<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.659> course<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
do in this course is that this course is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
do in this course is that this course is
going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.290> 100%<00:01:47.009> word<00:01:47.340> problems<00:01:47.759> that's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
going to be 100% word problems that's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.899 
going to be 100% word problems that's
all<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.079> actual<00:01:49.500> math<00:01:49.950> behind<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
all it is the actual math behind it the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
all it is the actual math behind it the
actual<00:01:51.270> solving<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> equations<00:01:52.439> isn't<00:01:52.979> going

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
actual solving the equations isn't going

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
actual solving the equations isn't going
to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.460> hard<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.390> did<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> on

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to be that hard and I did that on

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.499 
to be that hard and I did that on
purpose<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.619> challenge<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.460> taking<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.329> word

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
purpose the challenge is taking the word

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.600 
purpose the challenge is taking the word
problems<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.229> taking<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.979> information<00:01:59.130> out

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
problems and taking that information out

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.969 
problems and taking that information out
and<00:01:59.820> putting<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.540> problem<00:02:00.840> form<00:02:01.409> so

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and putting it into a problem form so

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.850 
and putting it into a problem form so
you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.280> solve<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:03.149> what<00:02:03.329> we're<00:02:03.450> gonna

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
you can solve it that's what we're gonna

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.240 
you can solve it that's what we're gonna
do<00:02:04.860> today

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
do today

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.619 
do today
so<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.899> first<00:02:07.140> section<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:08.450> algebra<00:02:09.450> word

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
so the first section is algebra word

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.380 
so the first section is algebra word
problems<00:02:10.080> involving<00:02:10.229> numbers

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
problems involving numbers

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.440 
problems involving numbers
okay<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:12.710> know<00:02:12.800> uh<00:02:13.330> basically<00:02:14.330> these

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
okay you know uh basically these

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.610 
okay you know uh basically these
problems<00:02:14.810> are<00:02:14.870> going<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.080> have<00:02:15.200> one<00:02:15.470> number

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
problems are going to have one number

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.920 
problems are going to have one number
relating<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.340> another<00:02:16.610> number<00:02:16.850> sometimes<00:02:17.600> its

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
relating to another number sometimes its

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.680 
relating to another number sometimes its
age<00:02:18.200> sometimes<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.280> distance<00:02:19.790> things<00:02:20.480> like

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
age sometimes it's distance things like

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.080 
age sometimes it's distance things like
that<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.380> think<00:02:21.440> word<00:02:22.310> problems<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:22.970> like

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
that and I think word problems just like

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.670 
that and I think word problems just like
anything<00:02:23.330> else<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.750> life<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.110> easiest<00:02:24.440> way<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
anything else in life the easiest way to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.949 
anything else in life the easiest way to
learn<00:02:25.010> how<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.400> do<00:02:25.700> them<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.810> see

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
learn how to do them is just to to see

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.870 
learn how to do them is just to to see
some<00:02:27.140> examples<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.740> let's<00:02:27.770> go<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.280> find

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
some examples so let's go in and find

let's<00:03:22.430> read<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.640> one<00:03:22.790> more<00:03:22.940> time<00:03:23.680> four<00:03:24.680> times<00:03:25.160> a

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
let's read it one more time four times a

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.410 
let's read it one more time four times a
number<00:03:25.959> increased<00:03:26.959> by<00:03:27.079> two<00:03:27.310> okay<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.790> equal<00:03:29.090> to

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
number increased by two okay is equal to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.720 
number increased by two okay is equal to
30<00:03:29.810> what<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.920> number<00:03:31.130> okay

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
30 what is that number okay

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.850 
30 what is that number okay
so<00:03:32.360> we<00:03:32.480> have<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.630> number<00:03:32.870> that's<00:03:33.530> what<00:03:33.739> we're

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
so we have a number that's what we're

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.130 
so we have a number that's what we're
trying<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.130> find<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.610> we<00:03:35.420> multiply<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.900> times

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
trying to find and we multiply it times

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.590 
trying to find and we multiply it times
four<00:03:36.590> okay<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.610> then<00:03:37.820> we<00:03:37.910> take<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.150> thing

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
four okay and then we take that thing

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.039 
four okay and then we take that thing
and<00:03:38.810> then<00:03:39.079> we<00:03:39.170> add<00:03:39.350> 2<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.579> and<00:03:40.880> then<00:03:41.570> the

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
and then we add 2 to it and then the

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.870 
and then we add 2 to it and then the
resulting<00:03:42.530> answer<00:03:42.829> should<00:03:42.980> be<00:03:43.130> equal<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.549> 30

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
resulting answer should be equal to 30

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.430 
resulting answer should be equal to 30
and<00:03:44.209> what<00:03:44.660> we're<00:03:44.780> trying<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.019> do<00:03:45.110> is<00:03:45.170> trying<00:03:45.380> to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
and what we're trying to do is trying to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.120 
and what we're trying to do is trying to
find<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.829> number<00:03:46.100> okay<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.180> we're<00:03:47.450> gonna<00:03:47.540> do

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
find that number okay so we're gonna do

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.130 
find that number okay so we're gonna do
because<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.910> know<00:03:50.000> we<00:03:50.120> have<00:03:50.269> an<00:03:50.360> unknown<00:03:50.780> here

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
because you know we have an unknown here

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.840 
because you know we have an unknown here
we<00:03:51.350> have<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.500> number<00:03:51.799> okay

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
we have a number okay

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.240 
we have a number okay
we're<00:03:53.150> gonna<00:03:53.269> say<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.870> variable<00:03:54.320> X<00:03:54.590> is

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
we're gonna say that the variable X is

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.300 
we're gonna say that the variable X is
equal<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.579> the<00:03:55.790> number<00:03:56.590> okay<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.950> reason<00:03:58.100> I'm

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
equal to the number okay the reason I'm

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.039 
equal to the number okay the reason I'm
doing<00:03:58.459> this<00:03:58.640> is<00:03:58.790> because<00:03:58.940> I<00:03:59.450> really<00:03:59.840> don't

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
doing this is because I really don't

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.440 
doing this is because I really don't
know<00:04:00.320> what<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.040> number<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.310> okay<00:04:02.150> that's<00:04:02.329> the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
know what the number is okay that's the

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.580 
know what the number is okay that's the
whole<00:04:02.570> point<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.900> don't<00:04:02.959> know<00:04:03.079> what<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.350> number

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
whole point I don't know what the number

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.800 
whole point I don't know what the number
is<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.340> I'm<00:04:04.430> gonna<00:04:04.579> assign<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.090> variable<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.720> it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
is so I'm gonna assign a variable to it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.479 
is so I'm gonna assign a variable to it
and<00:04:05.989> remember<00:04:06.560> way<00:04:06.860> back<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:07.220> beginning

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
and remember way back to beginning

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.069 
and remember way back to beginning
algebra<00:04:07.609> that's<00:04:08.299> what<00:04:08.480> you're<00:04:08.630> doing<00:04:08.750> here

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
algebra that's what you're doing here

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.050 
algebra that's what you're doing here
you<00:04:09.290> don't<00:04:09.500> know<00:04:09.799> what<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:10.700> it's<00:04:10.970> a

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
you don't know what it is so it's a

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.000 
you don't know what it is so it's a
variable<00:04:11.450> it's<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.810> unknown<00:04:11.989> so<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.650> sign<00:04:12.890> it

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
variable it's the unknown so you sign it

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.000 
variable it's the unknown so you sign it
to<00:04:13.100> be<00:04:13.250> X<00:04:13.400> okay<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.480> what<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.590> want<00:04:15.769> to<00:04:15.799> do<00:04:15.920> is

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
to be X okay so what you want to do is

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.250 
to be X okay so what you want to do is
you<00:04:16.070> want<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.250> translate<00:04:16.880> this<00:04:17.150> problem<00:04:17.630> into

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
you want to translate this problem into

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.860 
you want to translate this problem into
an<00:04:19.039> equation<00:04:19.669> or<00:04:19.970> something<00:04:20.330> you<00:04:20.419> can<00:04:20.570> solve

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
an equation or something you can solve

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.760 
an equation or something you can solve
so<00:04:21.830> four<00:04:22.310> times<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.880> number<00:04:23.060> increased<00:04:23.810> by<00:04:23.900> two

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
so four times a number increased by two

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.439 
so four times a number increased by two
okay<00:04:24.979> well<00:04:25.400> if<00:04:25.550> my<00:04:25.729> number<00:04:26.090> is<00:04:26.210> what<00:04:26.330> I'm

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
okay well if my number is what I'm

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.629 
okay well if my number is what I'm
trying<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.690> solve<00:04:26.930> for<00:04:27.050> then<00:04:27.650> four<00:04:28.039> times<00:04:28.370> the

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
trying to solve for then four times the

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.189 
trying to solve for then four times the
number<00:04:28.789> must<00:04:29.449> be<00:04:30.039> 4x<00:04:31.509> 4<00:04:32.509> times<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.960> number

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
number must be 4x 4 times the number

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.159 
number must be 4x 4 times the number
okay

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
okay

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.950 
okay
increased<00:04:36.169> by<00:04:36.379> 2<00:04:37.150> means<00:04:38.150> I'm<00:04:38.240> going<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.419> add<00:04:38.599> 2

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
increased by 2 means I'm going to add 2

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.149 
increased by 2 means I'm going to add 2
to<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.470> it's<00:04:40.159> got<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.580> be<00:04:40.639> equal<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.090> 30<00:04:42.159> okay

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
to it it's got to be equal to 30 okay

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.100 
to it it's got to be equal to 30 okay

for x the number increased by 2 is equal

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.149 
for x the number increased by 2 is equal
to<00:04:50.090> 30<00:04:50.449> and<00:04:50.750> now<00:04:50.990> we<00:04:51.050> have<00:04:51.379> to<00:04:51.500> do<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.740> solve<00:04:52.009> for

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
to 30 and now we have to do is solve for

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.050 
to 30 and now we have to do is solve for
our<00:04:52.879> unknown<00:04:53.389> so<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.229> do<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.879> going<00:04:55.879> back<00:04:56.000> to

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
our unknown so to do that going back to

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.939 
our unknown so to do that going back to
your<00:04:56.300> basic<00:04:56.659> algebra<00:04:57.080> will<00:04:57.289> subtract<00:04:57.680> 2<00:04:57.919> from

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
your basic algebra will subtract 2 from

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.980 
your basic algebra will subtract 2 from
both<00:04:58.340> sides<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:58.849> this<00:04:59.150> 2<00:04:59.360> will<00:04:59.539> go<00:04:59.659> away<00:04:59.780> 2

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
both sides so this 2 will go away 2

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.529 
both sides so this 2 will go away 2
minus<00:05:00.470> 2<00:05:00.620> is<00:05:00.770> 0<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.880> on<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.090> right<00:05:02.240> hand<00:05:02.479> side

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
minus 2 is 0 and on the right hand side

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.659 
minus 2 is 0 and on the right hand side
we'll<00:05:02.780> have<00:05:02.900> 30<00:05:03.789> minus<00:05:04.789> 2<00:05:05.319> okay<00:05:06.319> so<00:05:06.650> all<00:05:07.580> I've

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
we'll have 30 minus 2 okay so all I've

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.520 
we'll have 30 minus 2 okay so all I've
done<00:05:07.819> is<00:05:07.880> subtract<00:05:08.360> 2<00:05:08.509> from<00:05:08.539> the<00:05:08.840> left<00:05:09.020> gets

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
done is subtract 2 from the left gets

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.620 
done is subtract 2 from the left gets
rid<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.740> that<00:05:09.800> 2<00:05:10.099> and<00:05:10.370> 2<00:05:10.520> from<00:05:10.639> the<00:05:10.819> right<00:05:11.000> and

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
rid of that 2 and 2 from the right and

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.540 
rid of that 2 and 2 from the right and
actually<00:05:12.020> haven't<00:05:12.229> done<00:05:12.349> any<00:05:12.530> math<00:05:12.680> yet<00:05:12.919> so

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
actually haven't done any math yet so

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.020 
actually haven't done any math yet so
for<00:05:13.880> X<00:05:14.180> is<00:05:14.780> equal<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:15.259> 28<00:05:15.849> okay

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
for X is equal to 28 okay

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.050 
for X is equal to 28 okay
and<00:05:17.930> then<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.349> solve<00:05:18.680> for<00:05:18.800> X<00:05:19.039> you<00:05:19.610> divide<00:05:19.880> both

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
and then to solve for X you divide both

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.320 
and then to solve for X you divide both
sides<00:05:20.360> by<00:05:20.449> 4<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.560> X<00:05:21.889> is<00:05:22.130> going<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.340> equal<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:23.000> 28

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
sides by 4 so X is going to equal to 28

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.320 
sides by 4 so X is going to equal to 28
divided<00:05:24.080> by<00:05:24.229> 4<00:05:24.530> so<00:05:25.039> on<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.310> left<00:05:25.550> for<00:05:26.150> X

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
divided by 4 so on the left for X

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330 
divided by 4 so on the left for X
divided<00:05:26.780> by<00:05:26.810> 4<00:05:26.870> gives<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.379> 1<00:05:27.680> so<00:05:28.039> that's<00:05:28.219> why

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
divided by 4 gives you 1 so that's why

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.940 
divided by 4 gives you 1 so that's why
you<00:05:28.400> have<00:05:28.520> it'll<00:05:28.759> do
