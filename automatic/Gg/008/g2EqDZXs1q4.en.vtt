00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.080

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.830
 is using it and that you want to 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.290
 curls 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.540
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.130
 video answering a request from you I 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.650
 I came to bring a little more of my 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.810
 experience of the little that I know of 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.020
 who is using poison moment 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.650
 want to get out of this situation and go to 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.480
 curls 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.130
 First I want to make clear that the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.039
 intent of the video ever and do 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.810
 apology to the use of eln and / or who does 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.570
 use of enem is the owner of their 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.739
 choices but the video directed to 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.399
 You who need a 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.520
 orientation is to take some questions 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.920
 You leave the world, and you 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.590
 go to the use and bar you have your 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.570
 curly hair be it natural 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.600
 clinically treatable 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.700
 good the enem and by the little that I know he is 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.430
 a plant product even though it has 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.879
 some assets that help in the process of 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.030
 smoothing that is gradual and also 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.350
 colony the same time in general he is 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.389
 In the black color 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.609
 but nowadays have other colors too 

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:13.600
 for those who generally need a 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:16.689
 made but is more perfect judgment oil 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.329
 or even a color you do not 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.429
 generally achieves this result in the 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.590
 first day of application as is 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.479
 gradually you need to at 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.950
 least once a week or every 15 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.380
 days 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.529
 make use of enem generally from the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.889
 20th application of the 23rd this is very 

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:37.719
 variable is that you get the result 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:40.509
 more than a piece of equipment 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:43.689
 perfect coloring in the 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.299
 my opinion that it is not indicated 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.489
 for those who have frizzy and afro hair 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.069
 depending on the credit level because 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:52.779
 He does not have a straightening so let's say 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.950
 so it does not have a process of 

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:59.009
 penetration into the cortex of the cuticle 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.689
 strong tone hair with 12 drops of the other 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.860
 I'm going to talk about in the future 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.469
 this for you 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.719
 then it is usually the person who has 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.340
 afro day care with 11 does not stay 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.349
 satisfied with the result 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.080
 Good, how do I go out? 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.260
 first the length of staff 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.530
 hair saturated by chemistry 1 that I 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.160
 There's no way you 're reviewing it. 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.599
 this is necessary to cut who makes use of 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.849
 energy mainly needs to be 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.640
 waiting for the average time to start 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.250
 another chemistry or for you to start 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.549
 see the result of your natural hair on 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.950
 minimum of six months to one year, 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.440
 length that is with it leaving the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.180
 hair grow naturally this is the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.360
 which is called the transition period 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.420
 during the transition you can do 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.440
 and if you bother about the appearance 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.349
 of your hair 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.269
 you may be doing illegal logging 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.670
 beautiful cut is the technique of visagism 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.130
 that will enhance the beauty of your taste 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.620
 You may be making braids. 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.989
 be it the go in the hair root or 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.389
 loose braids because back there is also 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.459
 a stimulus to hair growth 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.680
 you can is also making use of mega 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.380
 I particularly do not think it's cool 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.630
 Mega is because it some cases it tends 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.239
 to break your hair but if you are 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.239
 willing to face its transition into a 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.639
 good with natural hair and get the tips 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.970
 that of the constants and hydrates 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:29.700
 afro curly crÃ¨che needs 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.400
 moisturizing otherwise you will have cool hair 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.010
 if you do not treat your hair then 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.079
 stay there three times a week is 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.079
 alternating between the hydrates actions 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.870
 water- based nutrition 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.389
 the reconstructions in my opinion is the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.680
 fourth element that are the replacements of 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.430
 capillary mass 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.590
 so you need to be there 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.599
 use three times a week to wash your 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.689
 with a specific product for 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.909
 cases dealing with it so that it grows 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.260
 strong and healthy with the clusters defined 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.959
 and beautiful 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.090
 Another suggestion is that you can 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.650
 make use of some tricks that 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.469
 example here 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.420
 I guide you as you say take root 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.459
 of your hair without having to use 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.699
 chemical and you are 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.739
 taking advantage of this moment too 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.660
 increasing your little visual 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.419
 earrings accessories making a 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.639
 Nice makeup using accessories to 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.500
 the hair because it tends to value this 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.020
 there I like people and we do not have 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.000
 much as suggesting it 's cool the staff and 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.970
 I know the video was fast the idea is 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.520
 This is the one that speaks quickly to you. 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.320
 some alert experience is 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.139
 returning with other videos later 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.000
 I hope you have enjoyed it since 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.289
 Hearts of yours, God bless you, bye. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.289
 Goodbye until the next to come.
