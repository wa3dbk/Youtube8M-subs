just<00:01:37.340> run<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:39.140> your<00:01:39.320> IRAs<00:01:39.710> going<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:42.759> you

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
just run to your IRAs going just you

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.359 
just run to your IRAs going just you
know<00:01:43.939> a<00:01:44.180> half<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.630> day<00:01:44.810> on<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.110> workbench<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:47.350> a

know a half a day on the workbench and a
guy's<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:49.610> can<00:01:49.790> build<00:01:50.000> these<00:01:51.280> just<00:01:52.509> just<00:01:53.509> give

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
guy's you can build these just just give

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.929 
guy's you can build these just just give
it<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:54.020> little<00:01:54.590> bit<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:54.979> fault<00:01:55.630> as<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.960> function

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
it a little bit of fault as the function

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:06.010 
it a little bit of fault as the function
and<00:01:58.939> now<00:02:01.780> build<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.930> all<00:02:03.079> these<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:05.840> will

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
and now build you all these you will

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.770 
and now build you all these you will
have<00:02:06.259> some<00:02:06.409> fun<00:02:06.649> with<00:02:06.890> it

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
have some fun with it

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.620

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
and I hope you enjoy seeing this engine

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.670 
and I hope you enjoy seeing this engine
it's<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:17.040> an<00:02:17.640> ability<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.860> meal<00:02:20.000> type

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it's a it's an ability on a meal type

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.080 
it's a it's an ability on a meal type
configuration<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.580> could<00:02:23.790> build<00:02:23.910> it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
configuration you could build it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.730 
configuration you could build it
horizontal<00:02:24.750> vertical<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.410> build<00:02:25.650> them

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
horizontal vertical you build them

horizontal vertical you build them
upside<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:27.060> does<00:02:27.630> not<00:02:27.810> matter<00:02:30.020> that

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
upside down it does not matter that

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.300 
upside down it does not matter that
they'll<00:02:31.800> run<00:02:32.070> in<00:02:32.250> sideways<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.920> does<00:02:35.130> not

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
they'll run in sideways it just does not

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.370 
they'll run in sideways it just does not
matter<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:37.470> theory<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:38.700> would<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.090> been

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
matter in theory this would have been

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.260 
matter in theory this would have been
what<00:02:40.380> they<00:02:40.650> might<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:41.010> referred<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.580> as<00:02:42.000> a

what they might have referred to as a

three inch stroke if it would have been

on a steam engine this kind of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
on a steam engine this kind of
configuration<00:02:56.930> would<00:02:57.930> probably<00:02:58.350> bet<00:02:58.470> how<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
configuration would probably bet how to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.370 
configuration would probably bet how to
cross<00:02:58.950> head<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.460> a<00:03:00.300> cross<00:03:01.020> slide<00:03:02.150> but<00:03:03.150> with<00:03:03.330> a
