00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.410
 Nutmeg a spice within reach 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.440
 from anyone present in many homes 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.510
 and whose price is not very high without 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.910
 But for many centuries it was one of 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.670
 the most expensive and exclusive products of 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.190
 the time being as quoted as the 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.770
 Saffron black truffle or javillar of 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.310
 beluga of our days 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.010
 welcome to the reef 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.779
 it is curious that a product goes from being 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.689
 so exclusive that it's only within reach 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.480
 of the most powerful to happen to be so 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.610
 popular that ends up being an ingredient of 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.410
 one of the most famous drinks of 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.970
 our days 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 effectively we refer to the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.430
 cocacola since this drink takes between 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.020
 its ingredients a derivative of the walnut 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 nutmeg 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
 and is that lately who else is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.180
 fixing on this species is the industry 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.120
 being used its essential oils 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.060
 both in cosmetics dentrÃ­ficos or 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.080
 even some cough syrups 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.460
 another part its medicinal properties 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.770
 little by little they have been abandoned 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.260
 but here the fall is due 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.060
 misfortune of this species 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.240
 Well simply because of its toxicity 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.800
 so much so that all the trials 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.350
 related to nutmeg are 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 intended to study the use of this 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.049
 spice as an industrial insecticide 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.149
 being very advanced some that the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.270
 they relate as very effective for 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.520
 certain grain pests 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.710
 Nutmeg counts among its 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.369
 ingredients with a dangerous agent 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.310
 chemist the minister this is psychotropic 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.189
 act on the neurological system 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.500
 functioning as neurotoxic it is 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.630
 so a dose of only 10 grams 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.909
 of not ambush would work as a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.829
 hallucinogen with very bad consequences 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.810
 since its action would last more than 24 hours 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.080
 the discovery of these neurotoxins 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.860
 they have made the nutmeg 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.780
 moving to the background for both 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.079
 Now that you know when you go to 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.420
 prepare and special your dishes try 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.010
 Do not let your hand go with the nut 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.500
 nutmeg 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.689
 I hope this work is yours 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.909
 utility and I encourage you to subscribe 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.909
 here to the reef
