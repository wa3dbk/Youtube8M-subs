00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
on this video and that it looks amazing

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.880 
on this video and that it looks amazing
this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:14.820> sister's<00:00:15.210> new<00:00:15.450> car<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:16.590> taking

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
this is my sister's new car we're taking

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.349 
this is my sister's new car we're taking
it<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> car<00:00:17.609> wash<00:00:17.820> today<00:00:18.000> that's<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
it up for a car wash today that's the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.880 
it up for a car wash today that's the
reason<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.720> started<00:00:18.990> vlogging<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.740> just

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
reason I started vlogging it and I just

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.070 
reason I started vlogging it and I just
can<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.670> needs<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.119> wash<00:00:21.330> because<00:00:21.570> she

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
can see it needs a wash because she

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.980 
can see it needs a wash because she
barely<00:00:22.439> uses<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.460> yeah<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.810> might

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
barely uses it and yeah I think we might

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.540 
barely uses it and yeah I think we might
have<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.350> move<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.769> range<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> way

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
have to move the range up the way

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.950 
have to move the range up the way
actually<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.300> might<00:00:27.330> fit<00:00:27.720> through

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
actually I think I might fit through

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
actually I think I might fit through
that<00:00:27.990> gap<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.529> yeah<00:00:28.650> I'm<00:00:28.710> really<00:00:28.800> bad<00:00:29.250> she's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that gap but yeah I'm really bad she's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.830 
that gap but yeah I'm really bad she's
just<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> come<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.210> now<00:00:30.390> she's<00:00:30.599> getting

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
just going to come out now she's getting

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.229 
just going to come out now she's getting
ready<00:00:31.130> I'm<00:00:32.130> gonna<00:00:32.399> switch<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:32.940> I'm<00:00:33.120> going

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
ready I'm gonna switch it on I'm going

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.370 
ready I'm gonna switch it on I'm going
to<00:00:33.300> show<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.840> well<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
to show you that as well because it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.709 
to show you that as well because it
makes<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.710> massive<00:00:35.040> noise<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.940> obviously<00:00:36.600> as

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
makes a massive noise and obviously as

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.060 
makes a massive noise and obviously as
soon<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.020> switch<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.559> want<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.829> go

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
soon as we switch on we want to go

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
soon as we switch on we want to go
because<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.239> want<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> stick<00:00:39.570> around

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
