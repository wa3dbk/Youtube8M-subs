finishing the game from beginning to end

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.250 
finishing the game from beginning to end
I<00:00:23.880> was<00:00:24.000> completely<00:00:24.449> obsessed<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
I was completely obsessed with it and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.859 
I was completely obsessed with it and
then<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:25.890> soon<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.279> finished<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.480> dead

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
then as soon as I finished it I was dead

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
then as soon as I finished it I was dead
tired<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.439> was<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.920> next<00:00:29.099> morning<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
tired it was the next morning and I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.870 
tired it was the next morning and I
started<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> again<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.439> mean<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.070> taken

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
started it again I mean I was that taken

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.180 
started it again I mean I was that taken
by<00:00:33.120> by<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.660> universe<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.620> lot<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
by by the universe and I think a lot of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.319 
by by the universe and I think a lot of
that<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.510> epic<00:00:36.960> sci-fi<00:00:37.910> nature<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that is just the epic sci-fi nature of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.900 
that is just the epic sci-fi nature of
the<00:00:39.660> Halo<00:00:39.960> universe<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.670> time

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
the Halo universe and the first time

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.380 
the Halo universe and the first time
they<00:00:42.120> actually<00:00:42.629> set<00:00:43.440> foot<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.789> Halo<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
they actually set foot on the Halo and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.410 
they actually set foot on the Halo and
just<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.170> size<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.190> scale<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
just the size and scale of it all and it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
just the size and scale of it all and it
just<00:00:48.450> felt<00:00:48.870> bigger<00:00:49.530> than<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.920> could<00:00:50.129> possibly

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
just felt bigger than I could possibly

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.430 
just felt bigger than I could possibly
hold<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.600> head<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> game

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
hold and in my head and as a game

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160 
hold and in my head and as a game
designer<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:53.640> experiencing<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
designer really experiencing the the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
designer really experiencing the the
kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> sandbox<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.160> stomach<00:00:56.430> nature<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
kind of sandbox to stomach nature of the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.979 
kind of sandbox to stomach nature of the
gameplay<00:00:58.050> approach<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.149> inspiring<00:01:00.629> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
gameplay approach was really inspiring I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.049 
gameplay approach was really inspiring I
could<00:01:01.289> sort<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.770> deconstruct<00:01:02.640> all<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
could sort of deconstruct all the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
could sort of deconstruct all the
different<00:01:03.359> systems<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> way<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.530> Bungie

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
different systems in the way that Bungie

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.850 
different systems in the way that Bungie
had<00:01:05.430> crafted<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.330> experience<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.590> so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
had crafted that experience and and so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
had crafted that experience and and so
as<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> game<00:01:08.189> designer<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.330> really

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
as a game designer it was really really

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.280 
as a game designer it was really really
inspiring<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.740> me<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> came<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.080> three

one of the greatest series of games that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670 
one of the greatest series of games that

ambitious<00:02:05.130> than<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.630> was

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
ambitious than that and and that was

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.749 
ambitious than that and and that was
really<00:02:07.110> motivating<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.039> when<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:08.580> about

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
really motivating so when I think about

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.969 
really motivating so when I think about
Halo<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.690> things<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.080> really<00:02:10.379> stand<00:02:10.830> out<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
Halo the things that really stand out to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.040 
Halo the things that really stand out to
me<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.310> being<00:02:11.340> core<00:02:12.180> tenant<00:02:12.690> so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
me as being core tenant so

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.980 
me as being core tenant so
of<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:14.010> franchise<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> universe<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990

heroism

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.840 
heroism
I<00:02:19.080> think<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.410> Master<00:02:19.740> Chief<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.310> perfect

I think the Master Chief is a perfect
embodiment<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.290> concept<00:02:22.980> of

embodiment of that of that concept of
heroism<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.880> think<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.570> sense<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.380> wonder<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
heroism I think the sense of wonder the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.150 
heroism I think the sense of wonder the
sense<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.670> mystery<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.480> there's<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:28.160> massive

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
sense of mystery that there's a massive

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.400 
sense of mystery that there's a massive

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
things that are beyond our comprehension

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.710 
things that are beyond our comprehension
things<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:36.030> could<00:02:36.150> only<00:02:36.300> hope

another<00:03:21.989> part<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.440> Halo<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.160> always<00:03:23.730> talk

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
another part of Halo that I always talk

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.640 
another part of Halo that I always talk
about<00:03:24.480> which<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.830> there's<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.920> belief<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
about which is there's a belief in the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.460 
about which is there's a belief in the
potential<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:29.010> humanity<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.900> think<00:03:31.350> this

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
potential of humanity and I think this

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.560 
potential of humanity and I think this
is<00:03:31.620> kind<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.890> really<00:03:32.190> important<00:03:32.610> because<00:03:32.730> halo

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
is kind of really important because halo

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.830 
is kind of really important because halo
has<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> kind<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.560> hopeful<00:03:35.040> feel<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.750> I

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
has a kind of a hopeful feel to it and I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.970 
has a kind of a hopeful feel to it and I
think<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:37.110> could<00:03:37.290> tell<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> lot<00:03:37.770> of<00:03:37.890> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
think you could tell a lot of the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.470 
think you could tell a lot of the
stories<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.520> take<00:03:38.640> place<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> Halo

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
stories that take place in the Halo

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.050 
stories that take place in the Halo
universe<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.110> tell<00:03:40.290> them<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.550> more<00:03:41.760> cynical

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
universe and tell them in a more cynical

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.160 
universe and tell them in a more cynical
light<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.600> would<00:03:42.720> feel<00:03:42.870> completely

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
light and it would feel completely

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.560 
light and it would feel completely
different<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.010> part<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.030> hopefulness

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
different and part of that hopefulness

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.590 
different and part of that hopefulness
is<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.110> belief<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.709> humanity<00:03:47.280> is

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
is this belief that humanity is

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.420 
is this belief that humanity is
predestined<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.870> achieve<00:03:49.500> something<00:03:49.860> greater

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
predestined to achieve something greater

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.430 
predestined to achieve something greater
and<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.270> humanity<00:03:51.750> something<00:03:52.170> worth

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and and that humanity something worth

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.770 
and and that humanity something worth
fighting<00:03:52.890> for<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:54.120> those<00:03:54.300> are<00:03:54.330> all<00:03:54.450> kind

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
fighting for and so those are all kind

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.910 
fighting for and so those are all kind
of<00:03:54.810> things<00:03:55.080> that<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.260> think<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.620> are<00:03:55.739> really

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
of things that I think that are really

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.410 
of things that I think that are really
key<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.870> halo<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.290> things<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:59.420> we

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
key to halo and things that that we

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.810 
key to halo and things that that we
absolutely<00:04:00.959> need<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.770> preserve<00:04:01.980> when<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.700> came

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
absolutely need to preserve when I came

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.790 
absolutely need to preserve when I came
to<00:04:02.970> 343<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.810> we<00:04:04.110> were<00:04:04.200> assembling<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.770> team

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
to 343 and we were assembling the team

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.710 
to 343 and we were assembling the team
here<00:04:05.250> one<00:04:05.520> of<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.700> biggest<00:04:05.910> challenges<00:04:06.660> that

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
here one of the biggest challenges that

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.460 
here one of the biggest challenges that
we<00:04:07.290> faced<00:04:07.650> was<00:04:08.180> trying<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.420> find<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.230> balance

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
we faced was trying to find the balance

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.150 
we faced was trying to find the balance
between<00:04:11.180> our<00:04:12.180> reverence<00:04:13.110> for<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.920> Halo

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
between our reverence for the Halo

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.220 
between our reverence for the Halo
universe<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.239> work<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.720> had<00:04:15.870> been<00:04:15.900> done

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
universe and the work that had been done

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:16.699 
universe and the work that had been done
there

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
there

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.930 
there
and<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:18.320> desire<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.590> kind<00:04:19.769> of<00:04:19.859> live<00:04:20.400> up<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.580> all

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
and the desire to kind of live up to all

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.240 
and the desire to kind of live up to all
of<00:04:21.150> these<00:04:21.299> expectations<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.770> community

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
of these expectations that the community

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.070 
of these expectations that the community
of<00:04:23.490> gamers<00:04:24.090> might<00:04:24.479> have<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:25.050> us<00:04:25.080> and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
of gamers might have for us and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.159 
of gamers might have for us and
our<00:04:26.139> desire<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.530> take<00:04:27.490> risks<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.539> change

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
our desire to take risks and and change

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.159 
our desire to take risks and and change
things<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:29.770> drive<00:04:29.979> things<00:04:30.220> forward<00:04:30.370> and

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
things and drive things forward and

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.969 
things and drive things forward and
ultimately<00:04:32.169> we<00:04:32.379> had<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.680> give<00:04:32.860> ourselves

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
ultimately we had to give ourselves

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.820 
ultimately we had to give ourselves
permission<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:34.150> take<00:04:34.719> those<00:04:34.960> risks<00:04:35.259> so<00:04:35.800> I

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
permission to take those risks so I

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.649 
permission to take those risks so I
think<00:04:35.919> one<00:04:36.219> of<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.400> areas<00:04:36.520> with<00:04:36.969> Halo<00:04:37.180> 4<00:04:37.479> that

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
think one of the areas with Halo 4 that

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.260 
think one of the areas with Halo 4 that
we're<00:04:37.780> really<00:04:37.960> trying<00:04:38.319> to<00:04:38.520> push<00:04:39.520> beyond<00:04:39.969> where

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
we're really trying to push beyond where

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.629 
we're really trying to push beyond where
halo<00:04:40.539> has<00:04:40.629> been<00:04:40.780> in<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:40.990> past<00:04:41.229> is<00:04:41.740> where<00:04:42.370> we

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
halo has been in the past is where we

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.020 
halo has been in the past is where we
have<00:04:42.759> a<00:04:42.789> much<00:04:43.379> clearer<00:04:44.379> focus<00:04:44.620> in<00:04:45.009> terms<00:04:45.759> of

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
have a much clearer focus in terms of

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.689 
have a much clearer focus in terms of
storytelling<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:47.740> character<00:04:48.009> development

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
storytelling and character development

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.510 
storytelling and character development
and<00:04:49.270> if<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:50.050> look<00:04:50.259> at<00:04:50.439> you<00:04:50.860> know<00:04:50.889> past<00:04:51.250> Halo

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
and if you look at you know past Halo

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.119 
and if you look at you know past Halo
games<00:04:51.819> I<00:04:51.969> think<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.840> Master<00:04:53.229> Chief<00:04:53.469> has<00:04:53.740> has

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 
games I think the Master Chief has has

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.270 
games I think the Master Chief has has
been<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.639> some<00:04:54.879> ways<00:04:55.289> he's<00:04:56.289> an<00:04:56.620> amazing<00:04:57.099> hero

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
been in some ways he's an amazing hero

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.969 
been in some ways he's an amazing hero
but<00:04:57.639> he<00:04:57.879> has<00:04:58.090> been<00:04:58.330> treated<00:04:58.539> almost<00:04:59.379> as<00:04:59.560> a

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
but he has been treated almost as a

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.770 
but he has been treated almost as a
vessel<00:05:00.310> for<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.729> player<00:05:00.969> to<00:05:01.210> sort<00:05:01.509> of<00:05:01.569> pour

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
vessel for the player to sort of pour

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.529 
vessel for the player to sort of pour
themselves<00:05:01.990> into<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.969> when<00:05:03.969> you<00:05:04.060> look<00:05:04.240> at<00:05:04.389> a

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
themselves into and when you look at a

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.360 
themselves into and when you look at a
lot<00:05:04.780> of<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.379> surrounding<00:05:05.889> fiction

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
lot of the the surrounding fiction

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.270 
lot of the the surrounding fiction
that's<00:05:07.240> been<00:05:07.509> written<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:08.740> Master<00:05:09.069> Chief

John<00:05:10.030> has<00:05:10.300> been<00:05:10.479> explored<00:05:10.990> in<00:05:11.139> much<00:05:11.889> more

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
John has been explored in much more

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.379 
John has been explored in much more
detail<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:12.759> and<00:05:12.969> that's<00:05:13.090> something<00:05:13.150> that

detail and and that's something that

are<00:05:32.349> maybe<00:05:33.159> pushing<00:05:33.550> him<00:05:33.909> to<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.270> edge<00:05:34.419> of<00:05:34.750> his

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
are maybe pushing him to the edge of his

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.050 
are maybe pushing him to the edge of his
capabilities<00:05:35.979> in<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.400> way<00:05:36.520> that<00:05:36.669> he's<00:05:36.819> never

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
capabilities in a way that he's never

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.480 
capabilities in a way that he's never
been<00:05:37.180> pushed<00:05:37.569> before<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:38.289> through<00:05:39.279> that

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
been pushed before and through that

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.079 
been pushed before and through that
process<00:05:40.169> kind<00:05:41.169> of<00:05:41.289> redefined<00:05:41.919> who<00:05:42.129> he<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.339> as<00:05:42.729> a

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.089 
process kind of redefined who he is as a

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.329 
process kind of redefined who he is as a
human<00:05:43.509> being<00:05:43.719> and<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:43.990> hero<00:05:44.229> and<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:45.099> so

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:45.339 
human being and a hero and and so

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.730 
human being and a hero and and so
there's<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.580> lot<00:05:45.759> of<00:05:45.940> focus<00:05:46.180> from<00:05:46.629> our<00:05:46.810> team<00:05:47.080> in

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
there's a lot of focus from our team in

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.260 
there's a lot of focus from our team in
the<00:05:47.949> story<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.490> we<00:05:48.580> want<00:05:48.789> to<00:05:48.849> tell<00:05:49.060> and

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
the story that we want to tell and

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.200 
the story that we want to tell and
telling<00:05:49.599> that<00:05:49.750> in<00:05:49.990> a<00:05:50.110> deeper<00:05:51.210> more

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
telling that in a deeper more

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.700 
telling that in a deeper more
character-driven<00:05:52.719> manner<00:05:53.589> and<00:05:54.520> so<00:05:54.759> for<00:05:55.240> me

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
character-driven manner and so for me

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.990 
character-driven manner and so for me
players<00:05:56.710> that<00:05:56.979> play<00:05:57.159> through<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:57.639> campaign

players that play through the campaign
of<00:05:58.180> Halo<00:05:58.360> 4<00:05:58.690> my<00:05:59.139> hope<00:05:59.349> is<00:05:59.529> that<00:05:59.560> they<00:05:59.889> they<00:06:00.250> come

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
emotional impact as a result of that
