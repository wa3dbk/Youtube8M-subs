00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
oh hey welcome to this tutorial for how

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.740 
oh hey welcome to this tutorial for how
to<00:00:04.230> draw<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:06.230> dolphin<00:00:07.259> these<00:00:08.010> are<00:00:08.460> lines

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
to draw a dolphin these are lines

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.220 
to draw a dolphin these are lines
represent<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.050> waves<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.550> sea<00:00:12.230> konstanz

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
represent the waves of the sea konstanz

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.820 
represent the waves of the sea konstanz
like<00:00:13.700> talking<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.790> dolphins<00:00:15.420> under<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> first

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
like talking to dolphins under the first

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.120 
like talking to dolphins under the first
of<00:00:16.980> all<00:00:17.130> start<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.060> flipper<00:00:18.359> balls<00:00:19.130> you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
of all start with the flipper balls you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.279 
of all start with the flipper balls you
can<00:00:20.310> see<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:20.699> drawing<00:00:21.000> these<00:00:21.390> lines<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
can see I'm drawing these lines on the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.220 
can see I'm drawing these lines on the
flipper<00:00:22.560> balls<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.880> show<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.510> they

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
flipper balls that is to show that they

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.429 
flipper balls that is to show that they
are<00:00:25.260> more<00:00:25.710> spherical<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:27.449> nature

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
are more spherical in nature

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.690 
are more spherical in nature
this<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.369> like<00:00:29.670> an<00:00:29.970> advanced

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
this is like an advanced

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.310 
this is like an advanced
three-dimensional<00:00:32.700> technique<00:00:33.480> next<00:00:34.140> up

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
three-dimensional technique next up

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
three-dimensional technique next up
you're<00:00:34.500> gonna<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> draw<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.700> the
