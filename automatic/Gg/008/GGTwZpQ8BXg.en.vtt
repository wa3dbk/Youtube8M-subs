rate<00:05:10.290> it<00:05:10.740> leans<00:05:11.190> towards<00:05:11.730> that<00:05:11.970> that

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
rate it leans towards that that

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.890 
rate it leans towards that that
Christmas<00:05:12.960> fudge<00:05:13.230> that<00:05:13.260> you<00:05:13.680> make<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:15.630> just

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
Christmas fudge that you make it it just

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.790 
Christmas fudge that you make it it just
has<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.110> bitter<00:05:16.560> hint<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.730> it<00:05:17.910> it's<00:05:18.420> not<00:05:18.660> bad<00:05:19.160> but

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
has a bitter hint to it it's not bad but

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.100 
has a bitter hint to it it's not bad but
definitely<00:05:22.800> for<00:05:23.580> this<00:05:23.790> review<00:05:24.420> for<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.870> two

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
definitely for this review for the two

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.240 
definitely for this review for the two
that<00:05:25.440> we<00:05:25.590> paired<00:05:25.950> up<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:27.750> raspberry<00:05:28.080> just<00:05:29.040> I

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
that we paired up that raspberry just I

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.380 
that we paired up that raspberry just I
don't<00:05:29.550> know<00:05:29.760> that<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.060> would<00:05:30.240> buy<00:05:30.360> that

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
don't know that I would buy that

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.730 
don't know that I would buy that
chocolate<00:05:30.930> anyway<00:05:31.110> because<00:05:31.290> it<00:05:31.470> does<00:05:31.620> have

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
chocolate anyway because it does have

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.470 
chocolate anyway because it does have
the<00:05:31.860> bitter<00:05:32.040> flavor<00:05:32.250> I<00:05:32.490> do<00:05:32.760> not<00:05:32.880> like<00:05:33.180> bitter

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
the bitter flavor I do not like bitter

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.360 
the bitter flavor I do not like bitter
of<00:05:33.600> chocolate<00:05:34.020> yeah<00:05:34.260> we<00:05:34.590> probably<00:05:34.890> won't<00:05:35.130> buy

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
of chocolate yeah we probably won't buy

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.820 
of chocolate yeah we probably won't buy
that<00:05:35.550> one<00:05:35.760> again<00:05:36.030> but<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.840> raspberry<00:05:37.440> yeah

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
that one again but the raspberry yeah

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.920 
that one again but the raspberry yeah
how<00:05:38.460> about<00:05:38.790> whole<00:05:39.000> box<00:05:39.210> of<00:05:39.330> those<00:05:39.510> in<00:05:39.660> eat<00:05:39.750> them

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
how about whole box of those in eat them

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.030 
how about whole box of those in eat them
I<00:05:40.020> think<00:05:40.230> I've<00:05:40.320> said<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:40.500> about<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.770> few<00:05:41.010> of

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
I think I've said that about a few of

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.350 
I think I've said that about a few of
the<00:05:41.280> other<00:05:41.430> ones<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.700> think<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.000> strawberry

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
the other ones I think the strawberry

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.880 
the other ones I think the strawberry
cheesecake<00:05:42.600> I<00:05:42.900> think<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:43.170> said<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.440> same<00:05:43.590> thing

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
cheesecake I think I said the same thing

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.490 
cheesecake I think I said the same thing
I<00:05:44.730> would<00:05:45.480> buy<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.660> whole<00:05:45.780> bar<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.230> would<00:05:46.410> buy

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
I would buy the whole bar I would buy

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.830 
I would buy the whole bar I would buy
boxes<00:05:46.920> even<00:05:47.010> eat<00:05:47.220> these<00:05:47.400> in<00:05:47.670> the<00:05:47.760> morning<00:05:48.090> I

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
boxes even eat these in the morning I

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.380 
boxes even eat these in the morning I
would<00:05:49.650> interchange<00:05:50.280> this<00:05:50.550> with<00:05:50.610> my<00:05:50.910> peanut<00:05:51.120> by

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390

because<00:05:58.200> they're<00:05:58.770> cheaper<00:05:59.510> they<00:06:00.510> might<00:06:00.690> be

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
because they're cheaper they might be

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.140 
because they're cheaper they might be
cheaper<00:06:01.050> but<00:06:01.350> these<00:06:01.530> are<00:06:01.710> so<00:06:01.980> much<00:06:02.190> denser<00:06:02.880> I'm

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
cheaper but these are so much denser I'm

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.650 
cheaper but these are so much denser I'm
telling<00:06:03.450> you<00:06:03.920> these<00:06:04.920> are<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:06.030> memories<00:06:06.630> are

about<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.380> same<00:06:09.740> them<00:06:16.040> but<00:06:17.040> you<00:06:17.370> can't<00:06:17.610> beat

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
about the same them but you can't beat

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.150 
about the same them but you can't beat
that<00:06:17.850> if<00:06:18.360> you<00:06:18.570> ate<00:06:18.840> that<00:06:19.110> for<00:06:19.650> breakfast

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
that if you ate that for breakfast

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.070 
that if you ate that for breakfast
you're<00:06:20.670> not<00:06:20.880> gonna<00:06:21.060> be<00:06:21.240> hungry<00:06:21.390> until<00:06:21.750> lunch

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
you're not gonna be hungry until lunch

they would be that their freshest per

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.410 
they would be that their freshest per
bar<00:06:37.650> per<00:06:38.280> bar<00:06:38.490> and<00:06:38.790> see<00:06:38.940> I'm<00:06:39.060> paying<00:06:40.850> 264<00:06:41.850> boxes

a<00:07:16.520> jello<00:07:16.970> Cup<00:07:17.270> or<00:07:17.510> something<00:07:17.720> like<00:07:17.810> that<00:07:17.870> and

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.290 
a jello Cup or something like that and

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.320 
a jello Cup or something like that and
then<00:07:18.889> I<00:07:19.400> would<00:07:19.820> probably<00:07:19.970> want<00:07:20.240> a<00:07:20.300> little

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
then I would probably want a little

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.180 
then I would probably want a little
snack<00:07:20.750> at<00:07:21.139> 3<00:07:21.350> o'clock<00:07:21.380> which<00:07:21.889> you<00:07:21.979> could<00:07:22.100> have

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190 
snack at 3 o'clock which you could have

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.320 
snack at 3 o'clock which you could have
won<00:07:22.340> another<00:07:22.550> one<00:07:22.699> of<00:07:22.790> these<00:07:22.850> if<00:07:23.060> you<00:07:23.150> wanted

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
won another one of these if you wanted

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.020 
won another one of these if you wanted
to<00:07:23.449> because<00:07:23.630> you<00:07:23.720> got<00:07:23.870> eaten<00:07:24.169> a<00:07:24.229> whole<00:07:24.440> lot

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030

to because you got eaten a whole lot
yeah<00:07:26.030> I<00:07:26.060> could<00:07:26.300> see<00:07:26.449> where<00:07:26.630> this<00:07:26.720> could<00:07:26.900> be<00:07:27.020> a

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
yeah I could see where this could be a

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.990 
yeah I could see where this could be a
whole<00:07:27.229> meal<00:07:27.440> replacement<00:07:28.070> I<00:07:28.250> don't<00:07:28.699> even<00:07:28.790> have

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 
whole meal replacement I don't even have

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.210
