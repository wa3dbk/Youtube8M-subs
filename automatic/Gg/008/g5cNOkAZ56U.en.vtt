another Godzilla and it is Godzilla 2000
or<00:00:16.160> until<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> 90<00:00:17.940> 99<00:00:18.180> millennium<00:00:19.109> whatever<00:00:19.970> so

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
or until a 90 99 millennium whatever so

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.480 
or until a 90 99 millennium whatever so
uh<00:00:21.000> until<00:00:21.810> 2000<00:00:22.410> we'll<00:00:23.160> start<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.430> with

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
uh until 2000 we'll start off with

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.150 
uh until 2000 we'll start off with
articulation<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.449> time<00:00:24.660> arms<00:00:25.500> can't<00:00:25.890> go<00:00:25.980> 360

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
articulation this time arms can't go 360

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.780 
articulation this time arms can't go 360
obviously<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> body<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.789> spins

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
obviously this is a body and the spins

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.530 
obviously this is a body and the spins
legs<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.950> think<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.040> ability<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.579> 360<00:00:35.850> if

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
legs I think your ability to go 360 if

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.310 
legs I think your ability to go 360 if
you<00:00:37.050> move<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> arms<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.129> kind<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.340> force<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
you move the arms and kind of force it

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.869 
you move the arms and kind of force it
but<00:00:40.320> uh<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.739> wouldn't<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.700> if<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
but uh I wouldn't really do it if you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
but uh I wouldn't really do it if you
don't<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:42.120> thanks<00:00:42.809> goes<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.200> think<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.440> might

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
don't want thanks goes I think you might

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.810 
don't want thanks goes I think you might
be<00:00:43.680> able<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:43.980> someone<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.280> toe<00:00:44.579> there

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.240 

spines<00:02:16.140> are<00:02:16.350> pretty<00:02:16.560> cool<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:16.980> get<00:02:17.130> this

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
spines are pretty cool they get this

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.820 
spines are pretty cool they get this
dark<00:02:17.640> glistening<00:02:18.390> purple<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.200> its<00:02:19.500> really

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
dark glistening purple and its really

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.820 
dark glistening purple and its really
really<00:02:20.820> awesome<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:22.910> it's<00:02:23.910> not<00:02:24.180> really

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
really awesome and it's not really

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.820 
really awesome and it's not really
spray-painted<00:02:25.830> on<00:02:25.950> like<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.090> others<00:02:27.830> because

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
spray-painted on like the others because

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.530 
spray-painted on like the others because
you<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.130> there's<00:02:29.310> no<00:02:29.490> purple<00:02:29.940> down<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.360> there

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
you see there's no purple down in there

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.410 
you see there's no purple down in there
between<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.050> spikes<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> that's<00:02:32.880> pretty<00:02:33.180> good

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
between the spikes so that's pretty good

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.130 
between the spikes so that's pretty good
I<00:02:33.690> think

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
I think

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.840 
I think
if<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.440> were<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> spray<00:02:34.920> painted<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.370> that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
if they were to spray painted it that

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.460 
if they were to spray painted it that
would<00:02:35.940> have<00:02:36.000> been<00:02:36.120> horrible<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:37.080> would<00:02:37.200> just

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
would have been horrible it would just

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.430 
would have been horrible it would just
look<00:02:37.530> plain<00:02:37.830> dumb<00:02:38.780> but<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.230> how<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
look plain dumb but I like how the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.740 
look plain dumb but I like how the
purple<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.610> dark<00:02:41.910> unlike<00:02:42.360> some<00:02:42.600> other

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
purple was really dark unlike some other

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960 
purple was really dark unlike some other
Godzilla<00:02:43.370> Millennium<00:02:44.370> figures<00:02:44.640> where<00:02:44.850> it's

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
Godzilla Millennium figures where it's

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.360 
Godzilla Millennium figures where it's
brighter<00:02:45.470> just<00:02:46.470> yeah

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
brighter just yeah

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.480 
brighter just yeah

overall<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:01.230> details<00:03:01.620> pretty<00:03:02.310> cool<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.540> it

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
overall is details pretty cool I like it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.830 
overall is details pretty cool I like it
now<00:03:05.670> uh<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:06.210> how<00:03:07.170> busy<00:03:07.560> some<00:03:07.800> scaling<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.810> uh

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
now uh now how busy some scaling so uh

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.050 
now uh now how busy some scaling so uh
I'm<00:03:10.800> gonna<00:03:10.920> scale<00:03:11.190> my<00:03:11.310> some<00:03:11.460> other<00:03:11.580> kaiju

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
I'm gonna scale my some other kaiju

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.720 
I'm gonna scale my some other kaiju
the<00:03:12.450> first<00:03:12.720> one<00:03:12.990> is<00:03:13.530> Miki<00:03:14.100> Godzilla<00:03:14.490> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
the first one is Miki Godzilla the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.400 
the first one is Miki Godzilla the
original<00:03:15.060> oh<00:03:17.360> that's<00:03:18.360> it's<00:03:18.870> actually<00:03:19.170> better

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
original oh that's it's actually better

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.890 
original oh that's it's actually better
than<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.770> thought<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.040> would<00:03:20.280> be<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.700> mean<00:03:21.660> I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
than I thought it would be I mean I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.150 
than I thought it would be I mean I
guess<00:03:22.200> those<00:03:22.350> body<00:03:23.210> might<00:03:24.210> be<00:03:24.240> a<00:03:24.420> little<00:03:24.570> small

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
guess those body might be a little small

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.940 
guess those body might be a little small
but<00:03:26.160> uh<00:03:26.690> here's<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:28.020> another<00:03:28.260> design<00:03:28.770> of

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
but uh here's for another design of

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.630 
but uh here's for another design of
Godzilla

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
Godzilla

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.940 
Godzilla
so<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.690> good<00:03:30.810> Zilla<00:03:31.020> is<00:03:31.050> bigger<00:03:31.470> but<00:03:31.830> it's

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
so this good Zilla is bigger but it's

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.750 
so this good Zilla is bigger but it's
not<00:03:32.100> taller<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.630> can<00:03:33.750> see<00:03:33.960> a<00:03:34.490> mecha<00:03:35.490> GE

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
not taller so you can see a mecha GE

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.870 
not taller so you can see a mecha GE
here<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:37.190> actually<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.250> good<00:03:38.370> bit<00:03:38.430> taller<00:03:38.760> than

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
here is actually a good bit taller than

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.700 
here is actually a good bit taller than
Godzilla<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.590> uh<00:03:41.510> it's<00:03:42.510> okay<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.350> if<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.560> want

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
Godzilla so uh it's okay but if you want

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.210 
Godzilla so uh it's okay but if you want
to<00:03:43.770> make<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.920> movie<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.550> might<00:03:45.360> want<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.570> use<00:03:45.750> a

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
to make a movie you might want to use a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.770 
to make a movie you might want to use a
different<00:03:47.220> match<00:03:47.670> up<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> different

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
different match up like a different

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.960 
different match up like a different
Mechagodzilla

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
Mechagodzilla

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.140 
Mechagodzilla
