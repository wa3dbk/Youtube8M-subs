00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.420
 the producers decided to change the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.780

 box office the project that led to 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.539

 book for 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.810
 to the trolls in the forest the runes that 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.490
 appear in the book are the same 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.650
 Scandinavian runes that inspired 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.780
 tolkien when creating the writing of the

 in fact the animators claim that the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.810
 map that falls out of the book is similar to 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.390

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.720
 he looked too foolish to scare and 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.700
 they decided to model it differently 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.670
 number 11 for elsa hair 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.709

 400,000 hairs at the same time putting 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.970
