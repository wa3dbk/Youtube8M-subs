00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.540

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.440

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.719

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.670

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.680
 after his first participation 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.480
 excellent participation and another with 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.399
 miguel pupo that ended the day of 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.420
 dispute two Brazilians here on pipe 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.460
 line 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.080
 the first day of the march father began with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.550
 high waves soon on the first day of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.100
 window 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.440
 the Brazilians had a great day 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.960
 first Brazilian performance in the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.910
 water today was alejo muniz and he made a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 impeccable battery went very well 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.270
 get a high score 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.479
 and it was only by exchanging the notes you had in your 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.729
 the best 9 33 on the shark in the backdoor is 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.590
 so father pilar face is a bit difficult 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.960
 to train yesterday and tried to stay the maximum 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.210
 possible time in the water but it ends 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.729
 You never catch a wave that you want, right? 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.159
 last year was my first but 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.930
 also because it would not have been hurt and 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.329
 if it enters the water completely 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.750
 lost because he did not have the star then 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.280
 I did not know where to sit and this whole year. 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.649
 since it entered the street trying to catch a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.479
 reference point and has a point of 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.040
 reference that was what I was left with 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.939
 I think a lot of people even know this. 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.619
 and point're just nervous while 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.140
 one so perfect that I wanted to get 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.430
 nothing that came before me and committed 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.950
 some errors besides some waves 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.619
 closing the day at school to break this 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.720
 Practice is good, but it's a face for me. 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.970
 here is one is a dream that becomes 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.709
 reality does not know that I have 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.380
 priority that the next one that came to me 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.440
 independent if great small good 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.769
 I can pick up so I'm happy with 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.290
 This here for me is a dream and to get a 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.360
 tube here in this place that is so 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.760
 cade this great prestige in the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.510
 the surfing world for me is the one who is 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.060
 championship is the logo following the people 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.799
 Raoni arrived on the 6th battery that 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.310
 ended up not giving much luck it's over 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.890
 losing to local beneficiaries but already 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.109
 is guaranteed in the elite next year and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.519
 then we had jadson andré who 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.689
 is already guaranteed by the elite in 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.420
 2014 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.459
 after his victory in portugal and had 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.159
 an excellent debut battery is over 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.420
 advancing to the second and last round 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.609
 to enter the water in the first 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.220
 round was ricardinho did not give the gift 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.579
 A lot of luck did not find the waves and it ended 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.180
 losing his second round battery 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.209
 already started with a lucky show too 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.419
 in the first battery felipe toledo finished 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.310
 committing an interference that ended 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.560
 compromising his battery that was 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.689
 very well achieved a high note 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.950
 got two very good grades but 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.780
 ended up losing because of 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.879
 interference he committed 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.430
 still in the first 20 minutes 20 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:33.449
 minutes of the battery when the battery 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.340
 had priority on battery number 2 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.629
 We had gabriel medina who gave a 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.489
 surf show 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.590
 I think the best battery of today 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.090
 and it was also interesting because 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.760
 Most waves were ridden by 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.239
 beck gabriel show three waves much 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.829
 good for pipeline started with pipe 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.150
 long that he sent a very high air 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.739
 but did not complete 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.440
 soon in the sequence took a tube 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.409
 and opened her arms inside the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.379
 tube and got a note almost 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.840
 perfect and even changed his second 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.790
 better than 18 points per a note 9 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.569
 a mean wave he got it all 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.949
 deep in ahero a fake épo script 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.470
 very high an amazing note and also 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:19.470
 still in round 2 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.810
 we'll see you and jadson andré is over 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.930
 saying goodbye to the competition did not find much 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.590
 the waves there in his last battery and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.570
 the last in the battery of number 10 between 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.680
 the Brazilians in the 100% Brazilian duel 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.419
 enter miguel pupo and alejo muniz the wind 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.620
 ended up disturbing a little sea wind 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.090
 entered the middle 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.480
 actually at the beginning 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.669
 the battery and Miguel had a lot of 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.230
 patience chose very well he is 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.400
 need the result to keep 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.050
 in the elite 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.889
 At the end of the battery I got a 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.590
 by beck that yielded a note 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.620
 almost 98 loudly and made him 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.389
 advance the third round and continue 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.540
 firm and strong in the fight to keep 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:06.350
 in the elite in 2014 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.729
 the basis is difficult to know what it is to be 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.290
 practically a wave in the battery because 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.990
 invent very bad now and I do not know 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.060
 I used brother patience in good 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.150
 then over the bad week gave me the 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.340
 priority so I prefer warranty 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.030
 battery than trying to add another 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.460
 So I do not know, I think I'm right now. 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.300
 It's kind of sad to have done it with him and 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.250
 very close friend but it's time it was me 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.440
 so I do not know how to pass the battery 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.710
 also requalify and thanks god gave 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.690
 all right and the forecast is that the sea 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.600
 continue with good waves tomorrow for what 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.220
 I saw it looks like the championship 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.650
 there is the possibility of the championship 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.360
 finish in the first three days of the window 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.610
 already has another good and 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.380
 excellent game approaching but the 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.139
 principle tomorrow 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.880
 the next call 76 with large 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.099
 possibility of remaining there with the 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.750
 third stage of the competition 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.639
 that's it guys we finish 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.789

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.099
