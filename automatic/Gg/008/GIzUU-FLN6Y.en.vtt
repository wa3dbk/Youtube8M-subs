damage now I have noticed that in some
cases<00:02:56.960> especially<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.650> lower<00:02:57.800> levels<00:02:58.250> it

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
cases especially in the lower levels it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.130 
cases especially in the lower levels it
will<00:02:58.550> do<00:02:58.670> enough<00:02:58.910> residual<00:02:59.480> damage<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.930> kill

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140
