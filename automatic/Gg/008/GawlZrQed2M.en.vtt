whatever<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:21.540> gonna<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.900> mixed

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
whatever you like that's gonna get mixed

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.210 
whatever you like that's gonna get mixed
right<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> cream<00:01:23.190> cheese

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
right in there with the cream cheese

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
right in there with the cream cheese
mixture<00:01:26.690> then<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.899> add<00:01:28.020> some<00:01:28.200> fresh

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
mixture then you can add some fresh

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.420 

so<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> reason<00:01:34.740> why<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.920> didn't<00:01:35.220> use<00:01:35.399> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so the reason why I didn't use that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
so the reason why I didn't use that
sprouted<00:01:36.180> grain<00:01:36.360> tortilla<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> roll

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
sprouted grain tortilla is when you roll

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.810 
sprouted grain tortilla is when you roll
it<00:01:37.590> up<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.009> kind<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.280> cracks

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
it up it kind of cracks

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.639 
it up it kind of cracks
so<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.240> these<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.899> think<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.440> best

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
so for these I don't think it's the best

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.889 
so for these I don't think it's the best
choice<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.280> whole-wheat<00:01:42.000> ones<00:01:42.330> roll<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:42.659> just

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
choice the whole-wheat ones roll it just

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
choice the whole-wheat ones roll it just
fine<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.560> anyway<00:01:43.920> you're<00:01:44.009> gonna<00:01:44.130> mix<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.700> all

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
fine so anyway you're gonna mix that all

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.100 
fine so anyway you're gonna mix that all
together<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.450> bowls<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:45.990> gonna

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
together in the bowls and you're gonna

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.680 
together in the bowls and you're gonna
