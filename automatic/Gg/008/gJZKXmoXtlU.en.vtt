00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.940 

hi<00:00:04.569> the<00:00:05.169> next<00:00:05.410> thing<00:00:05.560> that<00:00:05.589> we're<00:00:05.770> going<00:00:05.890> to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
hi the next thing that we're going to

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.630 
hi the next thing that we're going to
consider<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:08.200> the<00:00:08.410> cerebral<00:00:08.890> hemispheres<00:00:08.920> are

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:09.640 
consider in the cerebral hemispheres are

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.570 
consider in the cerebral hemispheres are
the<00:00:10.000> basal<00:00:10.540> ganglia<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:12.010> first<00:00:12.280> thing<00:00:12.430> we<00:00:12.490> will

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
the basal ganglia so first thing we will

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.990 
the basal ganglia so first thing we will
need<00:00:12.640> to<00:00:12.820> know<00:00:12.940> that<00:00:13.060> as<00:00:13.270> we<00:00:13.570> gangrene<00:00:13.960> is<00:00:14.200> its

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
need to know that as we gangrene is its

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.890 
need to know that as we gangrene is its
destruction<00:00:16.170> within<00:00:17.170> destruction<00:00:17.860> the<00:00:18.900> we're

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
destruction within destruction the we're

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.510 
destruction within destruction the we're
not<00:00:19.930> gonna<00:00:20.140> can<00:00:20.350> we're<00:00:20.770> gonna<00:00:20.830> consider<00:00:21.250> the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
not gonna can we're gonna consider the

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.220 
not gonna can we're gonna consider the
structure<00:00:21.970> of<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.240> individual<00:00:22.660> components

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
structure of the individual components

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.080 
structure of the individual components
separately<00:00:23.410> but<00:00:23.920> overall<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.670> basal<00:00:25.060> ganglia

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
separately but overall the basal ganglia

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.660 
separately but overall the basal ganglia
consists<00:00:25.869> of<00:00:25.930> a<00:00:26.020> number<00:00:26.320> of<00:00:26.380> parts<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:27.640> first

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
consists of a number of parts the first

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.140 
consists of a number of parts the first
part<00:00:28.060> is<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.810> caudate<00:00:29.289> nucleus<00:00:29.920> of<00:00:30.279> which<00:00:30.970> we

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
part is the caudate nucleus of which we

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.339 
part is the caudate nucleus of which we

would be the position the basal ganglia
and<00:01:18.250> what<00:01:18.520> we're<00:01:18.700> gonna<00:01:18.820> do<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.149> we're<00:01:19.299> gonna

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.450 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
consider<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.109> positions<00:01:20.619> of<00:01:21.009> each<00:01:21.189> of<00:01:21.369> the

the foramen of Monro which we'll be

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.680 
the foramen of Monro which we'll be

talking about with the ventricular

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.230 
talking about with the ventricular
system<00:02:47.380> later<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.730> no<00:02:48.730> need<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.060> worry<00:02:49.180> too

system later on no need to worry too

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.530 
system later on no need to worry too
much<00:02:49.420> about<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.900> now<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.550> other<00:02:52.210> thing<00:02:52.510> to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
much about it now the other thing to

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.480 
much about it now the other thing to
note<00:02:52.810> if<00:02:53.020> we<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.410> coronal<00:02:54.010> section<00:02:54.400> is

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
note if we have a coronal section is

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.070 
note if we have a coronal section is
that<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.850> head<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.300> caudate<00:02:55.510> nucleus

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
that the head of the caudate nucleus

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.850 
that the head of the caudate nucleus
actually<00:02:56.590> forms<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.220> majority<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.860> it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
actually forms a majority of the it

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.390 
actually forms a majority of the it
forms<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.700> lateral<00:03:01.090> wall<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:02.680> anterior

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
forms the lateral wall of the anterior

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.220 
forms the lateral wall of the anterior
horn<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.030> lateral<00:03:04.390> ventricle<00:03:04.600> which

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
horn of the lateral ventricle which

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.920 
horn of the lateral ventricle which
projects<00:03:05.770> into<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.430> frontal<00:03:06.850> lobe<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.840> you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
projects into the frontal lobe so you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.540 
projects into the frontal lobe so you
can<00:03:08.080> say<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.470> there<00:03:08.650> that's<00:03:08.800> anterior<00:03:09.310> horn

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
can say that there that's anterior horn

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.740 
can say that there that's anterior horn
of<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.670> lateral<00:03:09.850> ventricle<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.540> caudate

lobe<00:03:10.900> lies<00:03:11.320> in<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.650> lateral<00:03:12.010> wall<00:03:12.220> or<00:03:12.580> floor

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
lobe lies in the lateral wall or floor

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.910 
lobe lies in the lateral wall or floor
the<00:03:14.950> next<00:03:15.660> part<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.930> caudate<00:03:17.110> nucleus<00:03:17.709> is

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
the next part of the caudate nucleus is

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.880 
the next part of the caudate nucleus is
the<00:03:17.950> body<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.670> on<00:03:19.350> coronal<00:03:20.350> section<00:03:20.709> once

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
the body and on coronal section once

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.540 
the body and on coronal section once
again<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.459> say<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:21.940> lies<00:03:23.550> in

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
again you can say that it lies in

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.460 
again you can say that it lies in
contact<00:03:25.150> with<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.510> lateral<00:03:25.959> part<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.410> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
upper surface of the talus so that's

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.470 
upper surface of the talus so that's
this<00:03:28.690> entire<00:03:29.170> area<00:03:29.530> here<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.239> thalamus

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
this entire area here is the thalamus

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.260 
this entire area here is the thalamus
and<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.500> body<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.250> caudate<00:03:33.520> nucleus<00:03:34.030> lies

upper surface another view of this can
be<00:03:39.100> seen<00:03:39.340> here<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:40.270> once<00:03:40.540> again<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:40.959> save

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
be seen here so once again you can save

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.199 
be seen here so once again you can save
your<00:03:41.440> body<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.920> caudate<00:03:42.130> nucleus<00:03:42.760> lying

temporal lobe known as the hippocampus

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
temporal lobe known as the hippocampus
can<00:04:23.890> be<00:04:24.010> cat<00:04:24.220> hippocampus<00:04:24.940> so<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:27.550> final

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
can be cat hippocampus so the final

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.130 
can be cat hippocampus so the final

normally inhibition of motor control so

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.470 
normally inhibition of motor control so
you<00:06:46.700> get<00:06:46.970> ballistic<00:06:47.630> kind<00:06:47.900> of<00:06:48.050> movements<00:06:48.620> from
