instead<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.739> really<00:02:21.069> don't<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.340> this

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
instead and I really don't like this

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.850 
instead and I really don't like this
because<00:02:22.209> when<00:02:22.569> enemies<00:02:22.930> jump<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.560> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
because when enemies jump at you the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.350 
because when enemies jump at you the
Batarang<00:02:24.280> doesn't<00:02:24.670> have<00:02:24.790> enough<00:02:25.030> force<00:02:25.239> to

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
Batarang doesn't have enough force to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.330 
Batarang doesn't have enough force to
knock<00:02:25.480> them<00:02:25.870> away<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.709> you're<00:02:26.860> constantly

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
knock them away so you're constantly

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.130 
knock them away so you're constantly
getting<00:02:27.610> hurt<00:02:27.970> over<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.660> over

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
getting hurt over and over

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.199 
getting hurt over and over
the<00:02:29.410> only<00:02:29.560> other<00:02:29.799> move<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.459> in<00:02:30.670> these<00:02:30.790> 2d

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
the only other move you have in these 2d

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.030 
the only other move you have in these 2d
levels<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.900> grappling<00:02:32.349> hook<00:02:32.410> which<00:02:32.830> can

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
levels is the grappling hook which can

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.250 
levels is the grappling hook which can
be<00:02:33.160> pretty<00:02:33.340> awkward<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.569> hardest<00:02:34.989> part

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
be pretty awkward but the hardest part

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.229 
be pretty awkward but the hardest part
of<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.440> game<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.099> boss<00:02:36.280> battles<00:02:36.790> they

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
of the game is the boss battles they

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.880 
of the game is the boss battles they
start<00:02:37.540> out<00:02:37.630> pretty<00:02:37.780> easy<00:02:38.110> especially<00:02:38.349> when

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
start out pretty easy especially when

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.229 
start out pretty easy especially when
you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.160> move<00:02:39.340> around<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.730> punch<00:02:40.030> like

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
you can move around and punch like

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.360 
you can move around and punch like
normal<00:02:40.690> but<00:02:41.349> once<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.739> get<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.130> hard

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
normal but once you get to the hard

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.069
