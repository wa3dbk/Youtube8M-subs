00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 blow everybody is welcome on my 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.790
 string then a little tutorial very fast 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.840
 to show my new routine of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.700
 eyebrows then to achieve this you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.740
 need a brown pencil this one 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.920
 and costs less than two euros and I 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.470
 buy it at mg 1 so that's the color 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.350
 09 hip hop in six colors 092 schema 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.720
 then I need a mascara of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.800
 Brown color 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.480
 of course you do not need 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.369
 to buy a yves saint mascara 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 laurent this one it's just because 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.530
 that I was wrong about the reference 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.989
 of the product and I took a mascara 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.649
 brown instead of a black mascara all 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.219
 simply 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.079
 so that's this color so who 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.719
 match not only my skin tone 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.570
 and also to the natural color of my 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.680
 eyebrows or so my hair does 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.469
 pay attention to that especially not a mascara 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.510
 black 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.989

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:07.020
 redis still young and I also need 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:10.409

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.790
