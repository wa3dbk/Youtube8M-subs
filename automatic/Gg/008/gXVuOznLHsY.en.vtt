gonna show the best of the best best way
to<00:02:31.909> see<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.299> negatives<00:02:32.719> and<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.930> glitches

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
to see the negatives and the glitches

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.629 
to see the negatives and the glitches
and<00:02:33.469> things<00:02:33.709> like<00:02:33.859> that<00:02:33.920> cuz<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.280> know<00:02:34.459> when

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
and things like that cuz you know when

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:35.890 
and things like that cuz you know when
it<00:02:34.700> comes<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:34.969> physics<00:02:35.329> and<00:02:35.389> systems<00:02:35.810> like

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
it comes to physics and systems like

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.559 
it comes to physics and systems like
that<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.290> get<00:02:36.469> glitches<00:02:37.030> come<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:38.180> now<00:02:38.329> let's

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
that you get glitches come on now let's

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.209 
that you get glitches come on now let's
let's<00:02:38.989> look<00:02:39.109> at<00:02:39.200> Matt<00:02:39.439> had<00:02:39.680> outwards<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.159> they

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:40.219 
let's look at Matt had outwards and they

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.649 
let's look at Matt had outwards and they
came<00:02:40.340> out<00:02:40.459> with<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.639> little<00:02:40.760> infinity<00:02:41.359> engine

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
came out with a little infinity engine

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.140 
came out with a little infinity engine
but<00:02:41.840> anyways<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.739> new<00:02:42.859> shot<00:02:43.220> system<00:02:43.730> total

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
but anyways the new shot system total

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.610 
but anyways the new shot system total
control<00:02:44.480> we<00:02:44.599> could<00:02:44.780> release<00:02:44.959> at<00:02:45.139> any<00:02:45.379> point<00:02:45.560> of

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
control we could release at any point of

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.050 
control we could release at any point of
time<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.950> want<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.159> quick<00:02:46.489> release<00:02:46.760> short

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
time you want to quick release short

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.089 
time you want to quick release short
release<00:02:47.269> long<00:02:47.450> release<00:02:47.720> however<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.709> avoid

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
release long release however to avoid

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.770 
release long release however to avoid
getting<00:02:49.250> blocked<00:02:49.639> you<00:02:50.150> know<00:02:50.329> try<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.510> beat<00:02:50.689> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
getting blocked you know try to beat the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.629 
getting blocked you know try to beat the
buzzer<00:02:50.989> all<00:02:51.379> things<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.980> man<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.400> guess

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
buzzer all things like that man I guess

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.520 
buzzer all things like that man I guess
if<00:02:53.209> something<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.659> a<00:02:53.689> perfect<00:02:54.079> release<00:02:54.230> where

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
if something is a perfect release where

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.679 
if something is a perfect release where
this<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.099> your<00:02:55.189> highest<00:02:55.370> percentage<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.239> no

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
this is your highest percentage of no

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.839 
this is your highest percentage of no
chances<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.169> will<00:02:57.200> make<00:02:57.409> that<00:02:57.560> shot<00:02:57.829> but<00:02:58.069> let

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
chances you will make that shot but let

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.280 
chances you will make that shot but let
me<00:02:58.939> know<00:02:59.090> down<00:02:59.239> in<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.389> comments<00:02:59.780> do<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.049> guys
