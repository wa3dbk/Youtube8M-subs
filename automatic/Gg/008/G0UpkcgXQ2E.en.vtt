00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.110 

so<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.390> shows<00:00:50.390> I'm<00:00:50.600> logged<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:51.879> it's<00:00:52.879> going<00:00:53.030> to

so it shows I'm logged in it's going to

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.850 
so it shows I'm logged in it's going to
take<00:00:53.300> forever<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.930> load<00:00:54.110> these<00:00:54.470> feature

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
take forever to load these feature

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.390 
take forever to load these feature
programs<00:00:56.080> and<00:00:57.080> it<00:00:57.199> won't<00:00:57.410> load<00:00:57.650> any<00:00:58.129> of<00:00:58.190> the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
programs and it won't load any of the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.950 
programs and it won't load any of the
menu<00:00:58.850> options<00:00:59.270> that<00:00:59.449> should<00:00:59.629> be<00:00:59.720> on<00:00:59.870> the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
bottom so we get the reflection picture

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.810 
bottom so we get the reflection picture
below<00:01:08.630> but<00:01:09.009> still<00:01:10.009> trying<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.340> load<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.640> main

pictures take forever to load and load

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.080 
pictures take forever to load and load
and<00:01:22.100> consistently

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.820 

you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.690> cut<00:01:30.840> through<00:01:31.020> some<00:01:31.230> of<00:01:31.290> these<00:01:33.830> but

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
you can cut through some of these but

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.610 
you can cut through some of these but
that's<00:01:35.160> all<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.370> get<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.760> can't<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.120> down<00:01:36.620> to

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
that's all I get I can't go down to

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.110 
that's all I get I can't go down to
anything<00:01:38.010> options<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.640> should<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.940> below

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
anything options that should be below

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.860 
anything options that should be below
there<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:43.940> know<00:01:44.940> where<00:01:45.120> this<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.690> it's

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.590 

come<00:02:17.310> back<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.790> looks<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.300> not<00:02:18.420> gonna

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
come back it looks like it's not gonna

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.740 
come back it looks like it's not gonna
work<00:02:18.750> again<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.760> if<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.940> give<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.420> little

bit option on the bottom usually show up
there<00:02:27.060> there<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.620> now<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:29.310> search<00:02:30.140> or<00:02:31.140> go<00:02:31.770> to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
there there so now I can search or go to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.370 
there there so now I can search or go to
my<00:02:32.040> profile

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
my profile

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.680 
my profile
all<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.770> which<00:02:34.950> will<00:02:35.550> take<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:36.060> long<00:02:36.239> time<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
all of which will take a long time to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.370 
all of which will take a long time to
load<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.200> will<00:02:37.350> work<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.840> then<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:40.170> watch

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
load but will work and then I can watch

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.240 
load but will work and then I can watch
stuff<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:43.110> well<00:02:43.290> we'll<00:02:43.620> go<00:02:43.739> through<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.040> few

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
stuff but well we'll go through a few

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.580 
stuff but well we'll go through a few
things<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.540> see<00:02:45.840> how<00:02:46.020> slow<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:51.590> don't

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
things and see how slow it is I don't

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.990 
things and see how slow it is I don't
think<00:02:52.709> there's<00:02:53.010> anything<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.640> be<00:02:53.730> here

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
think there's anything going to be here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.449 
think there's anything going to be here
that<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.750> still<00:02:55.019> takes<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.620> while<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.950> find<00:02:56.340> it

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
that it still takes a while to find it

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.050 
that it still takes a while to find it
there<00:02:56.610> something<00:02:57.230> go<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.290> my<00:02:58.530> subscriptions

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
see the thumbnails take a long time to

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:12.880 
see the thumbnails take a long time to
load

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890
