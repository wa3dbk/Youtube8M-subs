00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 now 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.810
 very very very 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.589
 hello very good sure dark 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.000
 yes os 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.249
 agreed the last video 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.729
 by the way it has been said that we are going to start with the different modes 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.870
 percent and they have the cameras 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.120
 reflex 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.790
 because then I realized 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.020
 that is nonsense 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.070
 if we still do not know 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.300
 efe the adjustments and the values ​​and 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 because we can not 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.840
 understand what the votes do 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.020
 we have to use some words 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.260
 let's start 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.250
 to understand now 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.980
 the first thing is 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.829
 the iso 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.690
 what was done 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.989
 this is there in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.820
 in compact cameras 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 and also in reflex cameras 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 then what was done 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 you remember these tickets 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.010
 Well clear team at 200 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.100
 he assured that the same highway nac 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.950
 consuelo soto the way 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.159
 with another SLR 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.720
 to hospital 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.370
 nacho two teams 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.870
 200 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.500
 this character 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.820
 he did 200 what does this mean 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.540
 it indicates that sensitivity 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.540
 of the movie 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.890
 by a certain value he wanted 200 the minimum value 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.730
 which is usually used to three floors one hundred 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.010
 and the cadets as much as much much much and gaza 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.980
 although there are two best 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.570
 publicis then very much 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.910
 percent 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.790
 that he has his crib pictures because he wanted it to leave who he was made 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.259
 He did what you do in communes and their sensitivity 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.989
 of the movie 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.209
 the enap how quickly the movie 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.069
 ee for catching the light 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.819
 i and have a picture speak 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.229
 and what does that have to do with digital cameras 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.049
 poster the sensors 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.969
 they are also have a certain sensitivity 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.489
 but that sensitivity in the digital camera sensors can be judged 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.269
 and why are not we going to bet 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.989
 kelly to see that it's 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:35.879
 the 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.689
 at maximum sensitivity 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.689
 and that she always good pictures 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.179
 The truth is, no 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.829
 why 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.019
 the best pictures 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.569
 with that lower 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.569
 yes you if you take a picture with your seat 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.549
 I wolf a picture with my little 1600 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.269
 well in the photo and social 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.180
 you will see the colors n the contrast everything very well 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:07.529
 i 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.409
 in the photo of him that has been made with 10 thousand 600 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.089
 pastore 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:14.100
 percent 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.209
 it's called your noise 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.869
 they are dots 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.869
 that more than anything are noticed in compact cameras 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:27.909
 when for example we put it in to be able to get the pole oo mode stabilizer 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.129
 of image 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.789
 that this is nonsense 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.009
 because what he does is simply upload he did 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:37.249
 in the photos josé terán blurred and as if they are not created by the bishops 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.109
 Orozco explained 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.299
 after his arrest that with 1600 a high iso 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.799
 I know that to the photo 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.399
 but so many do not remain blurred 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.909
 but with a lot of noise 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.909
 because because the sensitivity is higher 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.019
 the camera and they cite less time to take the photo 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.859
 and in less time then the movement that can occur 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.939
 a person for example like this 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.229
 when making the photo in less time 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.130
 the zero moment that shines 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.709
 and not that it was the blurred photo 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.209
 you made the noise 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.479
 on the other hand because I do not know many things then I understood social 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.549
 because they come out of very good quality 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.519
 but as soon as something moves 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.409
 or siew abertzale fuzzy 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.860
 and that will not do it 1 because I recommend 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.850
 6 when it is possible then in 13 wells on floor 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.229
 200 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.569
 why then because not so social is not the most the TV the amp the best 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:36.199
 quality 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.099
 and the one made it lower 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.490
 so you're not going to see the blurry photos 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.279
 but 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.639
 8 the sun 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.330
 it is the perfect point 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.580
 of balance between good quality 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.580
 I'm sure the blurred photo will not come out 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.559
 in the modern reflex cameras I read his arrival even in my camera 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.449
 It is up to 6400 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:01.430
 and it's possible 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.069
 n answer up to 12 thousand 400 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.020
 and in the 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.069
 5 of the marq 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.419
 2 I do not know what 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.419
 percent up to 112 when you look 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.080
 hence he did 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.659
 or is that a barbarity 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:17.900
 but that what he does is 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.210
 percent the camera processor 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.819
 percent the grapo for this duel 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.099
 sariñana that reduces noise and image stabilizer that exist 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.880
 many cameras what it does simply upload 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.580
 he did it and that's why they are not blurred 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.580
 it is not really weak and healthy 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.580
 I just passed the photo faster but then you have noticed 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.580
 that remain broad leg a total quality 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.130
 doubt because my understanding there is nothing because it is not worth anything is little 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.020
 i more than anything if you want to make more good photos with a good answer not 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.499
 can you afford 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:58.330
 it happened to me but step by step because it was the first time it is that I had 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.490
 low quality r 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.090
 and yes it would be a lot of noise I read every photo I will not have to be in the 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.779
 region 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.779
 i but without it the noise level 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.009
 In summary 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.449
 what was done 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.529
 is the sensitivity of the sensor 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.289
 and it is 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.919
 the lowest iso 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.680
 it is less sensitive 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.039
 but the photos come out of better quality 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.469
 and if it was used it did not make it higher it's more sensitive 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:31.370
 you can take photos faster but the quality is lower 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.469
 you're going to see in what cases we're going to quote him later 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.800
 and why not just leave it on 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.960
 did automatic 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.960
 he also insists extortion can also be 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.950
 percent let's see it 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.809
 how to use the floor settings 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:53.089
 in combination 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:55.440
 with the other costs we are going to talk about 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.659
 in the following days 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:59.270
 I'm a culé marino 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.550
 so i would like to 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.050
 we have seen I hope you liked it and that I was surprised by the goal 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.159
 blas 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.930
 very very very 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:15.460
 neither
