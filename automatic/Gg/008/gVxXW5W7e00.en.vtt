Texas<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.760> best<00:00:03.000> way<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> put<00:00:03.360> it<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.600> stuff

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
Texas the best way to put it is stuff

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.690 
Texas the best way to put it is stuff
happens<00:00:04.710> quickly<00:00:04.980> around<00:00:05.310> here<00:00:05.490> obviously

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
happens quickly around here obviously

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.670 
happens quickly around here obviously
because<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.270> speeds<00:00:06.569> we're<00:00:06.779> traveling<00:00:07.230> it

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
because the speeds we're traveling it

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.290 
because the speeds we're traveling it
provides<00:00:08.040> good<00:00:08.250> racing<00:00:08.639> because<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:09.030> the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
provides good racing because of the

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.540 
provides good racing because of the
banking<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.650> if<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.130> miss<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
banking and so if you miss on the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.339 
banking and so if you miss on the
balance<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.940> little<00:00:11.969> bit<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.870> banking

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
balance a little bit the banking

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.600 
balance a little bit the banking
actually<00:00:13.620> makes<00:00:13.830> up<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.190> some<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.490> that

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
actually makes up for some of that

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.330 
actually makes up for some of that
that's<00:00:14.790> why<00:00:15.030> we're<00:00:15.450> all<00:00:15.570> closer<00:00:15.839> together

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
that's why we're all closer together

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.800 
that's why we're all closer together
who's<00:00:17.340> easier<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> deal<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.029> after<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.630> race

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
who's easier to deal with after the race

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.080 
who's easier to deal with after the race
and<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.410> involves<00:00:19.770> your<00:00:20.039> father<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.850> car

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090

and this involves your father the car
owner<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> father<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.590> think<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> worked

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
owner or the father I think it worked

how to each of you drivers how do y'all
motivate<00:01:52.290> each<00:01:52.320> other<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.950> think<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.310> motivate

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
motivate each other I think we motivate

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.969 
motivate each other I think we motivate
each<00:01:53.820> other<00:01:54.119> by<00:01:54.420> beating<00:01:54.810> each<00:01:54.930> other<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
each other by beating each other and I

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.630 
each other by beating each other and I
think<00:01:56.009> that's<00:01:56.600> simply<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.630> has<00:01:58.020> up

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
think that's simply what has up

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.050 
think that's simply what has up
for<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.120> game<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.390> particular<00:02:01.080> because<00:02:02.060> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
for a game in particular because you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.969 
for a game in particular because you
know<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.510> go<00:02:03.690> out<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.960> beat<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.350> they're

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
know if I go out and beat them they're

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.649 
know if I go out and beat them they're
figuring<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.400> how<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.550> try<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> beat<00:02:06.150> me<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
figuring out how to try to beat me and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.510 
figuring out how to try to beat me and
and<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.440> way<00:02:07.620> we're<00:02:07.830> up<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.130> each<00:02:08.220> other's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
and the way we're up in each other's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.059 
and the way we're up in each other's
game<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> point<00:02:10.800> where<00:02:10.890> we're

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
game we have it to a point where we're

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.410 
game we have it to a point where we're
almost<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.700> racing<00:02:12.150> each<00:02:12.240> other

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
ideal situation and we can separate

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.430 
ideal situation and we can separate
ourselves<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.140> bigger<00:02:19.350> picture

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
ourselves we see the bigger picture

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.620 
ourselves we see the bigger picture
after<00:02:20.010> struggling<00:02:20.459> much<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.880> last<00:02:20.970> season<00:02:21.480> how
