00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.460
 I'm Captain America. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.640
 Maybe 5 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.450
 Quinn jet it is 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.040
 Rov, not Bob 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 If you are interested in character or animation, 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.750
 Give that shield's private p behavior from the telly carrier . Your fighter. 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.770
 Should I 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.380
 I do not think so . 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.390

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:54.070
 Ah in our s on 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.070
 I'm kind of wondering if I'm over it. 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.100
 Actually, it's not like Pat Americas is driving a plane directly. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.960
 So how do you align all the rooms are fitted so that Captain America or 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.960
 The worst mistake is forgotten 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:18.770
 Another part of the gas is let's have more doctors moju believe what

 There's nothing so incredible to run 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.979
 If you jiggle the back side in more detail 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.070
 There are more appearances on the same flight as Queen Jett. 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.280
 This movie 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.280
 The movie from Kete Mariscal was very interesting. 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.820
 The old term is a little too childish. 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.670
 It's America . 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:51.970
 But it was a very faithful Schnarrio and Story. 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.410
 Even if it's not a scattered Cats America Feng 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.410

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:00.250

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.260

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.739
 I do not have nationality. I do not like it or I do not have any parts. 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:21.200
 Maybe I bought the army again 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.200

 Tires and 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.160
 I showed you the last one 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.710
 Nover Spider-Man said the tape was a little weird, 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.490
 Perhaps 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.490
 Looks like he took it. Tiger. 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:58.430
 Hadeoraguyo but one I bought this little document I have in front of school stationery 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.270
 If the front is going to also have deseo also a bit like the big temples goods Mart 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.990
 I sell it and sell it for March goods. 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:10.160
 As far as I can tell, you have 2000 won at the stationery store . 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:13.270
 I'm sure that life primarily Bart products for selling in 1600 won to go 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.159
 That one and this is 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:20.400
 This set should be tracked 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:25.919

 It's cheap. 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.410
 Instead, the stationery 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:42.870
 Itneyo example, once sold there is also something smaller less eunikka 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:47.669
 Oh, if you have knowledge of him now you're monitoring Mart 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.639
 I saw that there was no io product and there was only one box. 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:56.629

 Spider-Man on the last piece 

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:08.989
 The bike has something to do without the tires . 

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:13.639
 It gives me the time Captain America 18, the atmosphere over the water 

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:19.459
 The way Captain America looks is the same as the last time we saw it . 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:23.709
 For what quality color printing status also seems more jotahjin shield
