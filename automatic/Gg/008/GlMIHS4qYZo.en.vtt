well let's get you started right now as
you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> former

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
you can see this is one of the former

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.220 
you can see this is one of the former

Soviet Union Red Army specials this is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.190 
Soviet Union Red Army specials this is
actually<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> Red<00:00:43.860> Army<00:00:44.840> 1003<00:00:45.840> breathe<00:00:46.050> like

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
actually a Red Army 1003 breathe like

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.779 
actually a Red Army 1003 breathe like
1000<00:00:47.660> is<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.140> trick<00:00:49.379> six<00:00:49.710> well<00:00:50.280> no<00:00:50.610> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
1000 is this is a trick six well no it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.970 
1000 is this is a trick six well no it
was<00:00:50.940> originally<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> 1000<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> after<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
was originally a 1000 and after the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.459 
was originally a 1000 and after the
first<00:00:53.219> death<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.910> needed<00:00:54.239> 999<00:00:54.989> you're<00:00:55.289> just

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
first death they needed 999 you're just

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.439 
first death they needed 999 you're just
looking<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.949> upside<00:00:56.100> oh<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:57.390> we

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
looking at it upside oh we see it now we

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.029 
looking at it upside oh we see it now we
gotta<00:00:57.660> look<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.989> way<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> number<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.800> my

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
gotta look at this way to number it my

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.459 
gotta look at this way to number it my
lovers<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> says<00:01:00.059> yeah<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:01.289> my

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
lovers are right here it says yeah my my

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.060 
lovers are right here it says yeah my my
my<00:01:01.500> yeah<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.789> knew<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:02.969> yep<00:01:03.449> okay<00:01:04.320> just

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
my yeah we knew that yep okay just

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.190 
my yeah we knew that yep okay just
testing<00:01:05.400> him<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:06.270> how<00:01:06.930> does<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.140> thing

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
testing him do how does this thing

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.260 
testing him do how does this thing
operate<00:01:07.770> well<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> an<00:01:08.520> interesting<00:01:08.580> unit

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
operate well this is an interesting unit

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.570 
operate well this is an interesting unit
because<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.530> basically<00:01:10.770> doesn't<00:01:11.310> use<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
because it basically doesn't use a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
because it basically doesn't use a
scrubber<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.390> normal<00:01:12.810> sense<00:01:13.020> there's<00:01:13.350> no

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
scrubber in the normal sense there's no

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.550 
scrubber in the normal sense there's no
soft<00:01:14.070> line<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.729> co2<00:01:15.090> scrubber<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.470> we

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
soft line or co2 scrubber this what we

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.920 
soft line or co2 scrubber this what we
have<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.920> here<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.280> flux<00:01:17.640> capacitor<00:01:17.930> that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
have in here is a flux capacitor that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.020 
have in here is a flux capacitor that
actually<00:01:19.229> does<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> filtering<00:01:20.340> removes

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
actually does all the filtering removes

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.999 
actually does all the filtering removes
all<00:01:21.210> co2<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.770> breathe

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
all co2 and then you can just breathe

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.890 
all co2 and then you can just breathe
the<00:01:23.130> gas<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.580> back<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.030> again<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.689> it's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the gas right back in again well it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
the gas right back in again well it's
taking<00:01:25.710> enormous<00:01:25.950> amount<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> energy<00:01:26.490> oh

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
taking enormous amount of energy oh

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.940 
taking enormous amount of energy oh
absolutely<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
absolutely and what we have here is this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
absolutely and what we have here is this
is<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> power<00:01:29.430> supply<00:01:29.759> sort<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.720> flux<00:01:30.930> gates

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
is the power supply sort of flux gates

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.490 
is the power supply sort of flux gates
the<00:01:31.380> capacitor<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> chair<00:01:32.790> noble<00:01:33.500> 1.3

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the capacitor this is a chair noble 1.3

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890 
the capacitor this is a chair noble 1.3
giga<00:01:34.920> watt<00:01:35.189> power<00:01:35.490> supply<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.240> mean<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.630> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
giga watt power supply I mean if this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
giga watt power supply I mean if this
will<00:01:37.079> power<00:01:37.259> unit<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.950> probably<00:01:38.790> two<00:01:38.939> or

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
will power unit for probably two or

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600 
will power unit for probably two or
three<00:01:39.090> years<00:01:39.770> they<00:01:40.770> got<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.100> careful<00:01:41.250> Louis

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
three years they got to be careful Louis

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
three years they got to be careful Louis
you<00:01:41.759> don't<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> short<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> out

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you don't want to short this out

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
you don't want to short this out
underwater<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.710> short<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.369> underwater

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
underwater you short this out underwater

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.670 
underwater you short this out underwater
everything<00:01:45.479> wins<00:01:45.659> three<00:01:45.990> miles<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.560> did<00:01:47.340> wow

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
everything wins three miles you did wow

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.190 
everything wins three miles you did wow
that<00:01:49.680> sounds<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:50.280> state-of-the-art

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
that sounds like state-of-the-art

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.330 
that sounds like state-of-the-art
equipment<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:53.030> absolutely<00:01:55.040> well<00:01:56.040> let's<00:01:56.189> get

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
equipment here absolutely well let's get

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249 
equipment here absolutely well let's get
you<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> yeah<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.030> there's<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.780> least<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.200> get
