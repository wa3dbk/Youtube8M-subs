shock mount as well you can get all

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.479 
shock mount as well you can get all
these<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.030> Amazon<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.920> need<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.160> tweak<00:01:02.399> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
these on Amazon you do need to tweak it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.399 
these on Amazon you do need to tweak it
a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.449> pop<00:01:03.899> filter<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
a little bit to get this pop filter to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.560 
a little bit to get this pop filter to
fit<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.450> they

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
fit on there because you know they

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
fit on there because you know they
should<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.229> set<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.830> bit

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
should have set it up a little bit

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.300 
should have set it up a little bit
different<00:01:09.110> for<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> mic<00:01:10.380> itself<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
different for the mic itself because it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.859 
different for the mic itself because it
comes<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> stand<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.330> sort<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> stuff

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
comes on a stand and all sort of stuff

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
comes on a stand and all sort of stuff
and<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> takes<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.369> tweaking<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and it takes a little bit tweaking and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.280 
and it takes a little bit tweaking and
then<00:01:15.119> once<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.450> figure<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.140> can

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
then once you figure out you can

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.200 
then once you figure out you can
actually<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.159> know<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.729> people<00:01:17.790> drill

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
actually do it I know some people drill

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.090 
actually do it I know some people drill
holes<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.290> their<00:01:19.560> mic<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.009> stuff

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
holes in there and their mic and stuff

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.310 
holes in there and their mic and stuff
like<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.939> work<00:01:21.119> which<00:01:21.390> would

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
like that to get it to work which would

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.190 
like that to get it to work which would
probably<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.020> most

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
probably be the I don't know the most

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.530 
probably be the I don't know the most
secure<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.430> works<00:01:26.670> fine<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
secure way but this works fine so and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.429 
secure way but this works fine so and
then<00:01:27.990> again<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> road<00:01:30.350> what<00:01:31.350> is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
I don't drill any holes or anything I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280 
I don't drill any holes or anything I
just<00:01:47.250> use<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.909> little<00:01:48.750> clamp<00:01:49.049> thing

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
just use that little little clamp thing

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.499 
just use that little little clamp thing
that's<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> back<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that's on the back of here and and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.730 
that's on the back of here and and
that's<00:01:51.659> pretty<00:01:51.780> much<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.560> just

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
that's pretty much it and then you just

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
that's pretty much it and then you just
you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.220> hook<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.729> your<00:01:53.850> wires<00:01:54.060> right<00:01:54.360> here

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you know hook up your wires right here

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.230 
you know hook up your wires right here
your<00:01:54.899> wire<00:01:55.049> goes<00:01:55.290> across<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> then

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
your wire goes across like that and then

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.209 
your wire goes across like that and then
so<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.689> got<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> shock<00:01:58.290> mount<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.130> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
so you got the shock mount here so you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.520 
so you got the shock mount here so you
just<00:01:59.460> hook<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> shock<00:02:00.030> mount<00:02:00.360> shock<00:02:01.290> mount

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
just hook the shock mount shock mount

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.730 
just hook the shock mount shock mount
onto<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.340> onto<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> microphone<00:02:04.469> so

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
onto the onto the to the microphone so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.370 
onto the onto the to the microphone so
that's<00:02:04.950> pretty<00:02:05.189> self-explanatory<00:02:06.320> now<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that's pretty self-explanatory now the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.380 
that's pretty self-explanatory now the
one<00:02:07.619> thing<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.459> pop<00:02:08.970> filter

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
one thing I do with this pop filter

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.440 
one thing I do with this pop filter
though<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.129> actually<00:02:11.129> run<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.840> through

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
though is I actually run it through

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.570 
though is I actually run it through
through<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.900> action<00:02:14.349> so<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.530> take<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.980> this

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
through the action so I take this this

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.150 
through the action so I take this this
part<00:02:15.879> right<00:02:16.000> here<00:02:16.060> right<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:16.989> this<00:02:17.860> part<00:02:18.129> right

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
part right here right so this part right

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.610 
part right here right so this part right
here<00:02:18.480> which<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.780> bottom<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.410> shock

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
here which is the bottom of the shock

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.259 
here which is the bottom of the shock
mount<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.340> then<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:21.849> little

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
mount and then you have this little

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.330 
mount and then you have this little
screw<00:02:22.690> thing<00:02:22.900> here<00:02:23.140> too<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:24.040> then<00:02:24.099> there's

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
screw thing here too and then there's

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.530 
screw thing here too and then there's
like<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.489> little<00:02:24.670> thread<00:02:25.030> right<00:02:25.180> there<00:02:25.420> or

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
like a little thread right there or

like a little thread right there or
something<00:02:25.870> from<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.610> then<00:02:27.849> I've<00:02:28.239> got

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540

then just screw this puppy in like this
that's<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.319> so<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:02.680> actually<00:03:02.829> just<00:03:03.220> mounted

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
that's it so it's actually just mounted

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.940 
that's it so it's actually just mounted
onto<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> bottom<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.709> right

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
onto the to the bottom of this right

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.130 
onto the to the bottom of this right
here<00:03:07.470> that's<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.700> pretty<00:03:10.569> simple<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.989> do

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
here that's it so pretty simple to do

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.470 
here that's it so pretty simple to do
and<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.310> you're<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.519> going<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.760> run<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.180> so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
and so you're just going to run this so

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.569 
and so you're just going to run this so
obviously<00:03:13.989> before<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.440> hook<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.799> up<00:03:14.860> you're

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
obviously before you hook this up you're

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.059 
obviously before you hook this up you're
gonna<00:03:15.670> take<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.299> this<00:03:17.290> thing<00:03:17.829> right<00:03:17.950> here

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
gonna take this this thing right here

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.920 
gonna take this this thing right here
and<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.850> don't<00:03:19.299> even<00:03:19.420> know<00:03:19.510> what<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.690> hell<00:03:19.810> they

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.390 
and I don't even know what the hell they
call<00:03:20.079> is<00:03:20.200> goosenecks<00:03:20.709> whatever<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.310> you're

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
call is goosenecks whatever and you're

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.640 
call is goosenecks whatever and you're
going<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.579> run<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.850> through<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:23.440> right

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
going to run it through this this right

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.400 
going to run it through this this right
here<00:03:23.920> pull<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.549> through<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.090> then<00:03:25.810> attach<00:03:26.200> it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
here pull it through and then attach it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.860 
here pull it through and then attach it
here<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:27.160> then<00:03:27.519> just<00:03:27.700> screw<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.239> stuff<00:03:28.720> in

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
there and attach it here so that's

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.640 
there and attach it here so that's
pretty<00:03:31.600> much<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.780> then<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.319> bend<00:03:32.560> it

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
pretty much it then you can bend it

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.920 
pretty much it then you can bend it
whatever<00:03:32.950> way<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.220> want<00:03:33.519> like<00:03:33.700> this<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.810> that

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
whatever way you want like this so that

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.259 
whatever way you want like this so that
way<00:03:35.049> it's<00:03:35.139> just<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.380> couple<00:03:35.700> inches<00:03:36.700> away<00:03:37.000> like

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
way it's just a couple inches away like

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.240 
way it's just a couple inches away like
that

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.059 
that
simple<00:03:39.250> as<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:41.019> yeah<00:03:41.739> really

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
simple as that so yeah really

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.830 
simple as that so yeah really
self-explanatory<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:43.209> mean<00:03:43.359> just<00:03:43.569> take<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.750> look

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
self-explanatory I mean just take a look

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.259 
self-explanatory I mean just take a look
at<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.440> figure<00:03:45.400> out<00:03:45.459> how<00:03:45.639> I<00:03:45.700> hooked<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.120> up

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
at it and figure out how I hooked it up

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.009 
at it and figure out how I hooked it up
and<00:03:47.970> then<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> cool<00:03:49.209> thing<00:03:49.420> is<00:03:49.540> when<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.780> sit

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
and then the cool thing is when you sit

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.229 
and then the cool thing is when you sit
down<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.500> know<00:03:50.590> then<00:03:50.829> you<00:03:50.950> can<00:03:51.100> just<00:03:51.280> grab<00:03:51.970> it

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
down you know then you can just grab it

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.050 
down you know then you can just grab it
anywhere<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:52.870> pull<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.560> forward<00:03:54.060> pull

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
anywhere and just pull it forward pull

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.509 
anywhere and just pull it forward pull
it<00:03:55.180> back<00:03:55.359> so<00:03:56.319> usually<00:03:56.799> I<00:03:56.859> just<00:03:57.069> keep<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.400> up

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
it back so usually I just keep it up

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.000 
it back so usually I just keep it up
like<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.880> out<00:03:58.180> of<00:03:58.269> my<00:03:58.389> way

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
like this out of my way

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.680 
like this out of my way

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
too and the great thing is if there's

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.529 
too and the great thing is if there's
noise<00:04:15.489> from<00:04:15.880> behind<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:18.150> won't<00:04:19.150> really<00:04:19.299> get

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
on a wire running from all the way up

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.890 
on a wire running from all the way up
there<00:05:35.009> from<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.639> Bose<00:05:35.789> earphones<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.449> then

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
there from the Bose earphones and then

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.249 
there from the Bose earphones and then
as<00:05:37.020> far<00:05:37.169> as<00:05:37.229> settings<00:05:37.740> go<00:05:38.599> the<00:05:39.599> settings<00:05:39.960> I<00:05:40.080> use

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
as far as settings go the settings I use

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.930 
as far as settings go the settings I use
on<00:05:40.409> the<00:05:40.440> back<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.860> microphone<00:05:41.219> it's

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
on the back of the microphone it's

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.540 
on the back of the microphone it's
actually<00:05:42.240> upside<00:05:42.599> down<00:05:42.810> but<00:05:43.620> you<00:05:44.099> can<00:05:44.219> kind<00:05:44.490> of

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
actually upside down but you can kind of

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.310 
actually upside down but you can kind of
get<00:05:44.669> a<00:05:44.699> sense<00:05:44.940> for<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.270> so<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:45.810> use<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:45.990> little

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
get a sense for it so I use that little

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.920 
get a sense for it so I use that little
heart-shaped<00:05:46.759> one<00:05:47.759> right<00:05:48.000> there<00:05:48.270> it's<00:05:48.810> a

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
heart-shaped one right there it's a

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.689 
heart-shaped one right there it's a
little<00:05:49.590> heart-shaped<00:05:49.800> thing<00:05:50.280> right<00:05:50.460> there

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
little heart-shaped thing right there

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.939 
little heart-shaped thing right there
and<00:05:50.870> then<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:51.990> just<00:05:52.139> play<00:05:52.289> around<00:05:52.469> the<00:05:52.770> game

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
and then you just play around the game

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.800 
and then you just play around the game
so<00:05:53.219> the<00:05:53.310> heart-shaped<00:05:53.550> one<00:05:53.969> is<00:05:54.180> bass<00:05:54.389> I<00:05:54.659> don't

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
so the heart-shaped one is bass I don't

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.749 
so the heart-shaped one is bass I don't
know<00:05:54.990> what<00:05:55.469> it's<00:05:55.620> called<00:05:55.860> but<00:05:56.219> it<00:05:56.639> just

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
know what it's called but it just

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.100 
know what it's called but it just
basically<00:05:56.969> means<00:05:57.270> that<00:05:57.569> you're<00:05:57.750> trying<00:05:58.020> to

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
basically means that you're trying to

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.170 
basically means that you're trying to
get<00:05:58.620> rid<00:05:58.740> of<00:05:58.830> all<00:05:58.979> the<00:05:59.130> noise<00:05:59.250> from<00:05:59.580> behind<00:05:59.639> in

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
get rid of all the noise from behind in

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.550 
get rid of all the noise from behind in
the<00:06:00.240> side<00:06:00.479> and<00:06:00.690> everything<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.169> you<00:06:01.259> just

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
the side and everything and you just

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.360 
the side and everything and you just
want<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:02.870> audio<00:06:03.870> coming<00:06:04.289> from<00:06:04.319> to<00:06:05.009> record

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
want the audio coming from to record

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.670 
want the audio coming from to record
from<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:05.699> front<00:06:06.030> so<00:06:06.569> that's<00:06:06.930> pretty<00:06:07.229> much<00:06:07.380> it

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
from the front so that's pretty much it

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.559 
from the front so that's pretty much it
and<00:06:08.009> again<00:06:08.370> this<00:06:08.490> mic<00:06:08.729> you<00:06:08.880> can't<00:06:09.090> talk<00:06:09.300> at<00:06:09.479> the

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
and again this mic you can't talk at the
