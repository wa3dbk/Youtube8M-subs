00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:09.810
 and there I will teach people to do make 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.810
 a movie the death of diego 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:22.859
 first will cover will need 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:22.859
 of a ruler of a chronic hepatitis ti 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:31.210
 and trash there you 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:38.080
 the first will measure the size you 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:42.090
 want my case I'll leave it a bit 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.090
 little drive about eight centimeters 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 length 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:57.220
 sometimes break and go-go stockon like 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:02.470
 if it were scissors as if you were 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:06.539
 cutting into a deck format for him 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:11.259
 Come back soon, people finish here. 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:16.869
 to cut it there after I cut it 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:20.039
 Today I read ching the lygia that yes and 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.039
 this result was 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:39.540
 that's it you get put fire place 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.299
 kind of requirement that the fire be that the lg 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.000
 is there is something else 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.360
 this record is because I do not have the trash 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.720
 I got home country even garbage 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.880
 another thing when it will cut lishan 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:05.810
 leaves to cut neat connected when 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:08.340
 be twisted with the 12 and the name fla 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.619
 You're not going to cut it, then you 're going to cut it. 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.450
 I suggest to make the cut in logo 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.239
 then leave it ready for after 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.030
 cut and paste sandpaper 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:21.480
 When I'm going to put fire, 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.330
 Look, here, I got the fire and leave it like this. 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.720
 space and put so is putting 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.739
 so I do not think of the 20 minute that the son 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:37.019
 had to erase because as very bad 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:42.359
 out of harm's way put it and peg 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:46.049
 pays and goes to become so in the meantime 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.269
 that will happen I will interpret that 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:03:03.299
 I'll be back 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:03:13.260
 I'm here I'm going here for what I 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:18.350
 move places here places very close with 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.350
 We already told you ah 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:55.659
 The mother is here for him. 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.659
 try the other part now 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.530
 so it does not leave me much technical signal 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.099
 begins to create problems 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.240
 stayed like this 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.020
 now how it was here 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:28.830
 then one look should fall on another 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.830
 Chinese wall the last weak finish 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.059
 I 'll fight with the last step of the sandpaper 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.029
 and I'll be right back 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:56.419
 Okay, we'll finish it now. 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:06:01.839
 to be marketed here like this is 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:05.960
 pretty cool for who for whom 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:09.050
 fingerboard this is the four here 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:14.899
 holes 8 actually four here four 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:18.830
 here will only come with a drill bit 1.8 

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:25.449
 because I do not have the same myself 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:28.909
 I saw this thing for me, it's going to end for me. 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:36.589
 And in my case, I do not have just 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:38.830
 to place here 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.830
 on here 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:50.919
 presse paid staff likes to enjoy 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:55.189
 life commentary right 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:58.159
 this helps a lot on the channel that goes 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:07:02.389
 to happen now, wait if you could 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:04.959
 perform the way you's it worth 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.959
