00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
and I first heard about GG 6 I thought

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.730 
and I first heard about GG 6 I thought
you<00:00:05.819> know<00:00:05.940> what<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.180> great<00:00:06.420> opportunity

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.530 

normally<00:00:10.740> on<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> production<00:00:11.160> car<00:00:11.730> or<00:00:12.000> even<00:00:12.059> on

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
normally on a production car or even on

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.610 
normally on a production car or even on
a<00:00:12.570> show<00:00:12.809> car<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> lot<00:00:13.590> of

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
a show car you have a lot of

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.860 
a show car you have a lot of
restrictions<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> first<00:00:15.299> time<00:00:15.660> we

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
restrictions so for the first time we

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.359 
restrictions so for the first time we
didn't<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.500> know<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.800> typical

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
didn't have you know the typical

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.500 
didn't have you know the typical
boundaries<00:00:18.800> we<00:00:19.800> had<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> mix<00:00:20.340> between<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.090> very

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
boundaries we had a mix between a very

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.769 
boundaries we had a mix between a very
far<00:00:21.810> away<00:00:21.960> show<00:00:22.830> car<00:00:23.130> design<00:00:23.490> free<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.359> pure

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
far away show car design free and pure

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.279 
far away show car design free and pure
emotion<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:26.400> still<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.359> should<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.960> car

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
emotion and still it should be a car

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.040 
emotion and still it should be a car
that<00:00:28.590> reacts<00:00:29.160> realistically<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.300> group

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.740 

I'm<00:00:37.050> frame<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.620> very<00:00:37.860> short<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.600> we

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I'm frame was very short so you know we

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
I'm frame was very short so you know we
had<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.290> speed<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
had to really speed it up all the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.389 
had to really speed it up all the
designers<00:00:41.910> started<00:00:42.899> sketching<00:00:43.399> some

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
designers started sketching some

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.580 
designers started sketching some
proposals<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.210> great<00:00:45.660> opportunity<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
proposals a great opportunity that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
proposals a great opportunity that
computer<00:00:47.039> games<00:00:47.219> give<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.090> doing

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
computer games give you is like doing

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.750 
computer games give you is like doing
stuff<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.140> ever<00:00:49.320> dreamed<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.890 

while<00:00:54.760> sketching<00:00:55.270> you<00:00:55.360> have<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.600> excite

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
while sketching you have to excite

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.780 
while sketching you have to excite
yourself<00:00:56.050> with<00:00:56.710> every<00:00:57.040> line<00:00:57.220> with<00:00:57.520> every

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
yourself with every line with every

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.700 
yourself with every line with every
every<00:00:58.150> design<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:58.660> do<00:00:58.810> have<00:00:59.080> to<00:00:59.170> excite<00:00:59.500> all

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
every design you do have to excite all

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.640 
every design you do have to excite all
the<00:00:59.860> others<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:01.180> get<00:01:01.360> chosen<00:01:01.780> by<00:01:02.140> by<00:01:02.470> them

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
the others and to get chosen by by them

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.840 
the others and to get chosen by by them
because<00:01:02.860> they<00:01:03.130> think<00:01:03.430> that's<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.700> most

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
because they think that's the most

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.410 
because they think that's the most
promising<00:01:04.330> one

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
promising one

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.649 
promising one
the<00:01:07.020> most<00:01:07.320> stunning<00:01:08.040> aspect<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.330> count

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the most stunning aspect of this count

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.950 
the most stunning aspect of this count
is<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.409> proportion<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.939> low<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.479> wide

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
is the proportion it is so low so wide

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.630 
is the proportion it is so low so wide
and<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.369> fast<00:01:14.729> looking<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.909> incredible

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
and so fast looking that it's incredible

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.240 
and so fast looking that it's incredible
we<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.000> small<00:01:21.619> cabin<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:23.130> have

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
we have a really small cabin we have

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
we have a really small cabin we have
this<00:01:23.369> attached<00:01:23.850> really<00:01:24.479> big<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:25.049> steering

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this attached really big I'm steering

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
this attached really big I'm steering
wheels<00:01:25.920> which<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> smooth<00:01:27.570> blend<00:01:27.930> into

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
wheels which have a smooth blend into

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.950 
wheels which have a smooth blend into
all<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> other<00:01:28.799> big<00:01:29.100> geometric<00:01:30.030> volumes<00:01:30.450> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
all the other big geometric volumes so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.410 
all the other big geometric volumes so
after<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> 3d<00:01:31.799> data<00:01:32.009> was<00:01:32.250> generated<00:01:32.420> we

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
after the 3d data was generated we

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
after the 3d data was generated we
looked<00:01:33.600> at<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.409> reviewed<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> we

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
looked at it and we reviewed it and we

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.249 
looked at it and we reviewed it and we
got<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> stage<00:01:36.390> where<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.080> car

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
got to a stage where we like the car

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:49.640 
got to a stage where we like the car
that's<00:01:37.560> when<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> real<00:01:38.130> work<00:01:38.189> begins

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.070 

we<00:01:50.190> start<00:01:50.580> out<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.700> an<00:01:50.910> armature<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.780> still

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
we start out with an armature so still

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.990 
we start out with an armature so still
frame<00:01:52.350> basically<00:01:52.800> it's<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.010> box<00:01:53.220> frame<00:01:53.640> on

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
frame basically it's a box frame on

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.390 
frame basically it's a box frame on
which<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.540> welded<00:01:54.900> together<00:01:55.050> then<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.130> put

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
which we welded together then we put

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.820 
which we welded together then we put
foam<00:01:56.850> underneath<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> whole<00:01:58.200> car

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
foam underneath because the whole car

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.220 
foam underneath because the whole car
doesn't<00:01:59.130> need<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.490> clay

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
doesn't need to be clay

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.960 
doesn't need to be clay
if<00:02:01.620> one<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> biggest<00:02:02.130> things<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.550> need<00:02:02.730> is

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
if one of the biggest things in need is

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.480 
if one of the biggest things in need is
just<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.840> personal<00:02:04.800> desire<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.400> to

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
these cars and if it's not something

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.220 
these cars and if it's not something
that<00:02:08.520> you're<00:02:08.610> passionate<00:02:08.670> about<00:02:09.120> it's<00:02:10.110> going

to be really difficult to that do the
kind<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.480> level<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.170> detail<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.590> finance<00:02:14.070> that

kind of level of detail and finance that
you<00:02:14.340> need<00:02:14.550> we<00:02:14.940> started<00:02:15.300> working<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:16.050> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
you need we started working on the

you need we started working on the
surfaces<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.220> refined<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> car<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:18.720> look<00:02:18.900> at

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
surfaces we refined the car we look at
