00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.220
 Hello, people , welcome to another video of 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.110
 android 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.260
 today at the request of a colleague 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:31.790
 we are going to show here how to hide the e 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.840
 Neon Calling Some Devices 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.530
 huh 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.500
 I'm here right now with the galaxy 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:43.720
 s 4 I'll show you how it works on the bike ge 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:48.590
 also on the galaxy trend then aquino s4 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.620
 Are you going to go in settings? 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.230
 then you see in the middle of the device is 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.420
 in any of the three devices is it 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.050
 will be in the settings of 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.870
 advanced settings. 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.390
 What changes is that Mary of settings 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.680
 for calls vary from 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.040
 appliance apparatus 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.810
 so in the case of s 4 you open here my 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.750
 device and goes on calls and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.360
 calls you locate settings 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:30.369
 additional tap option 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:33.259
 and here you choose the and call 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.159
 here you have three options you can put 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:40.100
 the network default or hide number and 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.860
 displayed number the default network already displays 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.350
 the number usually i did not show a 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.399
 number will probably do the same 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.500
 thing here 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.329
 here is a comment would be interesting 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.759
 if it put display number only 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.509
 to my contacts or maybe this is 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.210
 the function here then I'll test and speak 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.490
 For you, but in case you want 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.070
 hide the number or for any reason 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.799
 You do not want your cgi number 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.369
 revealed to another person who is 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:15.200
 receiving the link you can then here 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:19.970
 hide your e-mail address 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:24.080
 called né that would be abbreviated to id 1 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.300
 Cancel I'll get the galaxy now 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.870
 trend to show where 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.140
 this option is 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.000
 well let's go then with her 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.860
 holds on to settings 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.150
 if you search here in settings 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.830
 on this unit 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:52.310
 you will not find the option called 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.720
 right then you will need to use 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.750
 another feature coming here on the phone 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.600
 and even the phone open let's play here 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.500
 in the menu and inside that - we have some 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.450
 options we'll use 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.240
 calls 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.850
 here already falls into the settings of 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.410
 similar to that of galaxy s 4 and 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.300
 here we have the advanced settings 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.300
 within advanced settings we have 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.060
 here the leader of the call the identifier 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.430
 of call options here are the same right 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.230
 so if you do not want to disclose your 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:38.300
 number you go there and put hide and 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.440
 it's also done in motogp now let's 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.150
 do the same 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.150
 the same operation on the bike g1 motors and he 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:59.300
 it also has the option né 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:01.790
 we will also configure in the case of 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.980
 motor way as it is one of the ao chip and 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.700
 also does not bring it also does not bring 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.310
 option but we have the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.100
 Sorry, your entry can not be deleted right now. 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.760
 the sim cards inside the sim cards 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.850
 but we have the connection configuration 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.960
 ok inside connection setup 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.960
 we have several options 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.310
 we have to enter the first one 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.160
 so you do not configure settings 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.270
 sim delegation 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.449
 and here we have configurations 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.120
 additional 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:48.379
 who does that verification as all 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:52.789
 others and the first option and the 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:56.479
 call it the same thing are not the 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:05:00.710
 same default network options hide 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:03.080
 number and show number let's bring 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.229
 Closer here for you to see is that 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.319
 the focus is a little bad 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:14.740
 then that's it 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:17.599
 I hope it helped you there. 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.710

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:25.009
