00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.030
 Edin Dzeko now rehearses the red light 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.740
 and let's go 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.369
 who wins this acceleration duel 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.630
 he and his team are a tricky combination of turns 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.400
 the prospect has been put 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 4 Andy Meklau 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.399
 and Andi Meklau pushed past him like clown Lindholm intel-werk 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.360
 just do not believe it 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.360
 this is an indication 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.860
 in a promising position 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.120
 and according to Dr 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 They think they can overcome all the problems 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 the windjammers have the clear ones 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.630
 in the last part of the course they pulled along 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.850
 Right turn I can see from here in about that's right 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.620
 dark Berlin 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.200
 and then come along with run 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.940
 1 36 3 the first round two for me thinks that it would have been two with him 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.580
 Modes normal software brings 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.560
 it's the last lap 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.540
 a bit of Garrison's drawbacks because oldest looking back on a tire 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.340
 drove 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.730
 Reason for the slight so clearly under the years marriage should be against 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.430
 only 3 4 and hold 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.620
 Please log in 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.300
 recognized within the open eyes 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 Minister Lindemann has once again on the ground 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.740
 who will come up with the last one? 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.690
 we do not actually have 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 controlled or unintentional 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.590
 this is not a second more 1a in our Quarterly 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 up again 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.910
 those on the squares 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.910
 because maybe meters will compete again I do not think so 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.029
 as a sovereign idea 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:14.469
 the Swede wins this second 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.469
 what the value is loud 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.679
 he has afforded that 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.679
 the abbreviation becomes third or Marc Pircher 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.779
 he stands by will to better the winner of this race of Gefen YouTube 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:36.159
 United Nations cool three fires 12 cool driven Ammann jumped brick wall 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 yes that was pretty hairy post 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.209
 that is the award ceremony crystalline should 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.149
 from the tires 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:47.939
 give the gala to the old station wagon and who does not get the punch 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.039
 the 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.159
 the services or market 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.350
 now all triggered 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.350
 he moved 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.459
 Meklau or LED lights 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.469
 similar pictures and it looks like the marks 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.259
 in time they see so it is so I do not think so this was the second one 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.979
 round 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:10.989
 the better team come 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.090
 he has everything implemented since then like Bielefeld 7 that will definitely percent 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.999
 insane annoyed but not come anymore 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.969
 Boehner is now also admire everything so stay under the stock market » 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.969
 tiller 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:27.859
 Background are 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.639
 as one of his roommates 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.419
 between 10 and 20 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.519
 The man with the 13 Benecke Andreas Meklau demands this 50 meters 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.720
 Stebner wanted to be like Japan 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.019
 Rotraud Wieland 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.019
 at the fourth start in Zweibrücken at the second race 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.289
 we enjoy 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:46.389
 in the second game 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.629
 Both Intel's minimized benefits as well when it comes with the sheet 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.959
 in the worst case 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.209
 but still the danger is a frame to lose 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.869
 until then, the man with the particular is now 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.229
 that he actually passed him I do not know if she 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.919
 see 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.159
 to become a company memorial 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.619
 with loud 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:07.779
 Domian 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.219
 without data to euphoric read nothing 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.729
 Watch out at 38's 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.019
 there threatens village Kellenberger 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.180
 OTZ CLS as well or market 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.230
 now threatens she paints like the three there on the start-target-straight EBIT 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.409
 Welded together visibility 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.409
 Neat UBS also rose to talk 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.900
 but then there is violence learned from run 1 as art 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.020
 concentrated, that was frankly admitted 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 she works the line found again and has boiled says 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:44.069
 a zoom differences in the last three games between meters 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.870
 there of course 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.520
 the great ones on the Yamaha Benzema name others 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.699
 the technologies 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:54.999
 here is higher 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:58.490
 Schwadron difference at the top 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.520
 Concepts taken care of and we do not have all that at this point 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.779
 Banking values ​​would have worked out once in each case, he especially in the 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:08.479
 Rampage 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.499
 This time Martin Winterkorn is busy but still open 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:16.899
 Bissendorf because we but also the second rank suddenly chosen 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.860
 been 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.860
 So within two three 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.809
 I suppose I'll attack the shop here 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:36.809
 Troche actually and passes epd 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.749
 Place of the kaufDA there has been aborted a bit 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.529
 So the St 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.589
 so many spectators can be there 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:54.079
 Protest now repaired says Gerhard Ertl Ewert Barnetta he wants to stay 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:57.789

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.789
 Lauren Cheney the Essen exhibition halls Vidal m 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.119
 Vargas II 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.199
 that does not look right 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.309
 on the roadway BC 12 meters wide, this is the foldable sport spirit 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:37.430
 that's enough 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.430
 so I'm clear 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.900
 Korbach 8 km before the end 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.529
 who drive in the first race win 97 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:55.529
 there is even a job that is now pissing off state aid 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.249
 Dr 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:03.930
 it was the right one

 clear on the way out 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.430
 now he attacks

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.930
 both were not going to be easy kicking off 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.589
 how the new one wanted some companies at the moment 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:32.889
 here again the slow motion, I'm almost dismounted 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.770
 one rarely 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:44.009
 They escalated old winners are the three championship favorites after the 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:45.219
 Half of the season clear 

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:48.740
 all no but I also think he had a problem in the second run 

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:52.369
 Wanted he was actually super too strong he did it and 

00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:56.610
 has fallen back so little you have to wait and see what happens 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.710
 to say about it 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.129
 and the countries 

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:02.129
 for the winner 

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.589
 The Austrian has burst 

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:07.899
 a pull this one
