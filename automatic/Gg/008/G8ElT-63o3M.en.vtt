holding the violin for a beginner is one

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.850 
holding the violin for a beginner is one
of<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.120> most<00:00:09.300> important<00:00:10.170> things<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.710> learn

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
of the most important things to learn

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.799 
of the most important things to learn
when<00:00:11.309> you're<00:00:11.490> first<00:00:11.730> learning<00:00:12.000> how<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.450> play

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
when you're first learning how to play

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.730 
when you're first learning how to play
and<00:00:13.429> I<00:00:14.429> feel<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> mistakes<00:00:16.529> that

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
and I feel it's one of the mistakes that

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.010 
and I feel it's one of the mistakes that
is<00:00:17.100> made<00:00:18.410> sometimes<00:00:19.410> where<00:00:20.480> children<00:00:21.480> learn

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
is made sometimes where children learn

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.820 
is made sometimes where children learn
to<00:00:22.050> hold<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.650> violin<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.820> their<00:00:24.090> hand

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
to hold the violin with their hand

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.900 
to hold the violin with their hand
really<00:00:25.830> they<00:00:26.039> should<00:00:26.220> be<00:00:26.340> learning<00:00:26.760> how<00:00:26.880> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
really they should be learning how to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.169 
really they should be learning how to
hold<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.390> violin<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:28.080> their<00:00:28.289> chin<00:00:28.680> only<00:00:29.460> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
hold the violin with their chin only so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
hold the violin with their chin only so

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
here's a demonstration of what should be

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.520 
here's a demonstration of what should be
