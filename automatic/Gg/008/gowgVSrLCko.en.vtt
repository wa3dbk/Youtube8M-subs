00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
me too all right so I think we should

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.650 
me too all right so I think we should
just<00:01:53.000> take<00:01:53.300> this<00:01:53.450> opportunity<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:55.480> kill<00:01:56.480> the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
just take this opportunity to kill the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.060 
just take this opportunity to kill the
slime<00:01:57.160> yeah<00:01:58.160> well<00:01:58.550> get<00:01:58.880> rid<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.120> it<00:01:59.330> not<00:01:59.800> no<00:02:00.800> but

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
slime yeah well get rid of it not no but

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.640 
slime yeah well get rid of it not no but
we<00:02:01.160> should<00:02:01.190> just<00:02:01.550> use<00:02:01.729> our<00:02:01.820> land<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.330> think

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.500 

you<00:02:06.160> have<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.460> kill<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.700> slam<00:02:06.880> at<00:02:07.030> some<00:02:07.180> points

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
you have to kill the slam at some points

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.650 
you have to kill the slam at some points
I<00:02:07.600> meant<00:02:07.780> old<00:02:07.930> question<00:02:08.440> our<00:02:08.590> lands<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.390> find

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
I meant old question our lands so find

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.600 
I meant old question our lands so find
reasons<00:02:11.140> kill<00:02:11.380> your<00:02:11.530> Lance<00:02:11.770> deck<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.310> what<00:02:12.490> we

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
reasons kill your Lance deck is what we

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
that's two reassembling skeletons is a

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.670 
that's two reassembling skeletons is a
must<00:03:57.349> much<00:03:57.739> better<00:03:58.189> clock<00:03:58.579> than<00:03:58.879> just<00:03:59.390> one<00:03:59.680> so

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
must much better clock than just one so

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.839 
must much better clock than just one so
should<00:04:00.799> we<00:04:00.829> play<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.159> read<00:04:01.280> assuming<00:04:01.579> skills

should we play the read assuming skills
oh<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:02.359> he's<00:04:02.599> just<00:04:02.629> doing<00:04:03.079> that<00:04:03.109> yes<00:04:03.709> we<00:04:03.920> will

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
oh so he's just doing that yes we will

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.250 
oh so he's just doing that yes we will
definitely<00:04:04.450> play<00:04:05.450> but<00:04:05.719> then<00:04:05.810> we<00:04:05.870> can't<00:04:06.079> do<00:04:06.200> it

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
definitely play but then we can't do it

with<00:04:06.439> the<00:04:06.530> ax<00:04:06.560> Strickland<00:04:07.719> that's<00:04:08.719> fine<00:04:08.930> I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
with the ax Strickland that's fine I

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.020 
with the ax Strickland that's fine I
think<00:04:09.799> it's<00:04:09.890> better<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.250> just<00:04:10.370> get<00:04:10.579> them<00:04:10.760> some

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
think it's better to just get them some

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.800 
think it's better to just get them some
beaters<00:04:12.159> do<00:04:13.159> you<00:04:13.480> whatever<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.569> think<00:04:14.599> it's

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
beaters do you whatever you think it's

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.840 
beaters do you whatever you think it's
best<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.200> mean<00:04:15.349> I<00:04:15.439> think<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.890> goes<00:04:16.039> away<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:16.370> I

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
best I mean I think it goes away so I

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.310 
best I mean I think it goes away so I
mean<00:04:17.389> getting<00:04:17.539> a<00:04:17.660> beater<00:04:17.810> downs<00:04:17.989> pretty

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
mean getting a beater downs pretty

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.979 
mean getting a beater downs pretty
probably<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.769> best<00:04:18.799> idea<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.759> is<00:04:19.940> true<00:04:20.449> we

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
probably the best idea that is true we

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.450 
probably the best idea that is true we
can<00:04:21.169> just<00:04:21.320> bring<00:04:21.530> back<00:04:21.739> this<00:04:21.919> guy<00:04:22.160> at<00:04:22.310> any

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
can just bring back this guy at any

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.010 
can just bring back this guy at any
