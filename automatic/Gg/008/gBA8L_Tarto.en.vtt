00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.519
 we are doing today that is for sure 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.990
 flirtatious has but not with the chains 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.460
 We know because we do it all 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 other little shit in there as 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.380
 Potatoes Need Potatoes 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.930
 We need blood free now 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.250
 breadcrumbs bacon info keeps 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.230
 bit of vegetables 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.700
 why I am still if I do that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 We are really nice about the leadership of this 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.590
 that's why we have to be creamy 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:43.530
 ingredients first really nice and small 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.180
 cut the breadcrumbs this means yes 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.250
 but he is free 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.719
 yes i live well now yes time for 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.890
 a little history lesson people 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.300
 have already asked what the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.300
 steak is going on with my eyes 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.989
 So I can say I sleep enough 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.550
 is I do not do the few months is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.570
 otherwise is red represent round eyes 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.649
 and of course I have 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.390
 no idea what that is and am to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.700
 Doctor left after a few months 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.460
 wait times because doctors and the doctor 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.810
 were as good as I like cortisone around the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.159
 Eyes lubricated an internal job 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.659
 away but came second place 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.340
 So again I want to go to the doctor 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.720
 and he was so good at these and more 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.220
 So he said that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 is probably neurodermatitis and im 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.470
 I then read the euro internet 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.869
 It will be gone by an allergy 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.100
 triggered and cortisone does it all 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.720
 Not that bad in any case 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.759
 doctor not because he should follow the principle 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.159
 you're home and now at the back 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.750
 better off so stands up to the doctor 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.970
 bandage but goes home 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.530
 and right doctor like me 8 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.119
 that does not bring anything normal 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.320
 you still have to be tapped 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.640
 now get rid of the monkeys or 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.900
 teach that he does not 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.670
 and then you can 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.619
 transformation thing is just neurodermatitis 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.970
 can be triggered by anything 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.770
 So I'll be mine first 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.090
 started and watch on what I was 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 I'm allergic and there it is 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.820
 exposed that the highest 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.189
 likelihood of wheat 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.840
 or gluten what is important 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.040
 but I made fun of it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 if wanted without allergy 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.409
 meanwhile , the allergy seems to be that way 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.150
 become strong that if I have something 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.970
 wrong it really has to the whole 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.560
 eyes from report what is really cool if 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.179
 you stand in front of the camera as much as I do 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.760
 could make quite cool idea and indeed 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.040
 We're just after this here 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.550

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.200

 Something can be advised

 The packaging is only to be filled 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.070
 Take a look here and the ice bath we did 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.570
 already prepared says yes that would have 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.620
 did not think that's what we looked like 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.820
 to prepare 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.920
 yes, and then it comes in the 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.210
 fridge but did not grab this immediately 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.080
 in the fridge the fridge 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.790
 broken here is the fridge 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.930
 two hours ok then it goes on 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.360
 As you can see, that's just right 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.870
 become firm and we get now 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.870
 out here 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.770
 if not like the press but 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:30.509
 yes you can do it then it can come 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.090

 work out 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:43.259
 I am not gone that is the reason 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.569
 Why do not I have gone now 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:49.020
 is because bigg's sensitive eyes 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.400
 could stop every moment in the air 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.229
 then go on that hot falls then 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.789
 sensitive and therefore do 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:06:01.580
 It's always like that 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.580
 you little babies only bathe in hot oil 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:11.330
 so the last pore is ready and now 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:14.550

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.990
 here feel compelled here 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.389
 here are the green stuff with her now 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.710
 and ketchup can be done and now 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.759
 they are already eaten something 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.779
 cooled which is very good 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:27.050
 So she probably can with the 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:27.050
 hand is in and I know in 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:44.310

 rushing solid people comes after when 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.539
 you thought that we fried 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.279
