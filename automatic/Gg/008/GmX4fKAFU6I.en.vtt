00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
80 degrees could the way to be added to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.120 
80 degrees could the way to be added to
our<00:01:17.240> mixture<00:01:17.360> if<00:01:18.050> it's<00:01:18.260> gonna<00:01:18.380> be<00:01:18.560> too<00:01:18.590> hot<00:01:18.890> and

custard<00:01:26.740> we<00:01:27.740> turn<00:01:27.920> off<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.040> fire<00:01:30.280> we<00:01:31.280> start

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
custard we turn off the fire we start

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
custard we turn off the fire we start
adding<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:35.690> milk<00:01:35.720> let's<00:01:36.590> say<00:01:36.710> step<00:01:37.040> by<00:01:37.160> step

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.900 

in<00:01:40.600> order<00:01:40.870> not<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:41.080> overheat<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.100> mixture<00:01:42.700> and

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
in order not to overheat the mixture and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.970 
in order not to overheat the mixture and
so<00:01:43.660> one<00:01:43.870> suffer<00:01:44.260> for<00:01:44.440> what<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.710> mentioned

this space

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.370 
this space
we<00:02:09.000> keep<00:02:09.150> whisking<00:02:09.390> together

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.060 

this<00:02:13.980> point<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.400> complete<00:02:14.820> with<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:16.070> with

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
and what we have to do is simply put it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.020 
and what we have to do is simply put it
over<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.410> fire<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.890> reheat<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.490> in<00:02:38.640> order<00:02:38.880> to

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
over the fire and reheat it in order to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.910 
over the fire and reheat it in order to
pasteurize<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.870> mixer<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.380> won't<00:02:40.560> contain

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
pasteurize the mixer so won't contain

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.370 
pasteurize the mixer so won't contain
any<00:02:41.130> bacteria<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> move<00:02:42.270> again<00:02:42.390> onto<00:02:43.260> the

any bacteria on the move again onto the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.130 
any bacteria on the move again onto the
fire

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.630 

what<00:02:46.680> we<00:02:46.800> have<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> do<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.250> try<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.860> bring<00:02:49.860> our

what we have to do is try to bring our
nature<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.990> reach<00:02:53.060> 85<00:02:54.060> degrees

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
nature to reach 85 degrees

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.430 
nature to reach 85 degrees
for<00:02:55.490> about<00:02:55.970> one<00:02:56.390> minute<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.750> half<00:02:56.870> minutes

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
for about one minute and a half minutes

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.060 
for about one minute and a half minutes
and<00:02:58.590> after<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.800> do<00:03:01.920> it's

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and after this that we have to do it's

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.660 
and after this that we have to do it's
like<00:03:02.130> chili<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.510> mixture

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.400 

in<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.180> case<00:03:09.420> nothing<00:03:09.720> wrong<00:03:09.960> with<00:03:10.140> our<00:03:10.260> ice

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
in this case nothing wrong with our ice

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.770 
in this case nothing wrong with our ice
cream<00:03:10.680> but<00:03:11.160> sometimes<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.670> might<00:03:11.820> have<00:03:12.480> some

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
cream but sometimes you might have some

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.050 
cream but sometimes you might have some
lumps<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.740> mixture<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.760> order<00:03:14.880> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
lumps in the mixture so in order to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.940 
lumps in the mixture so in order to
avoid<00:03:15.270> all<00:03:15.480> those<00:03:15.630> lumps<00:03:15.870> for<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.590> real<00:03:16.770> ice

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
avoid all those lumps for the real ice

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.040 
avoid all those lumps for the real ice
cream<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:18.470> strain<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.620> for<00:03:19.920> safe

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.970 

so<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:24.770> prefer<00:03:24.950> an<00:03:25.370> ice<00:03:26.180> Emory

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.110 

in<00:03:29.430> order<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.580 

make<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.840> faster

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.440 

so<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.400> point<00:03:38.550> where<00:03:38.700> we<00:03:38.730> bring<00:03:39.270> down

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
so this is the point where we bring down

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.550 
so this is the point where we bring down
the<00:03:39.630> temperature<00:03:40.110> on<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.830> mixture<00:03:42.260> as<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.319> told

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the temperature on the mixture as I told

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.210 
the temperature on the mixture as I told
before<00:03:43.620> should<00:03:44.069> be<00:03:44.160> kept<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.610> fridge<00:03:44.819> for

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
before should be kept in the fridge for

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.040 
before should be kept in the fridge for
48<00:03:47.220> hours<00:03:47.550> but<00:03:48.120> at<00:03:48.270> this<00:03:48.360> point<00:03:48.569> we<00:03:48.840> cannot

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
48 hours but at this point we cannot

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.110 
48 hours but at this point we cannot
store<00:03:49.650> our<00:03:49.920> ice<00:03:50.130> cream<00:03:50.310> inside<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.910> fridge

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
store our ice cream inside the fridge

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.880 
store our ice cream inside the fridge
for<00:03:51.860> let's<00:03:52.860> say<00:03:52.980> 10<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.400> 12<00:03:53.610> hours

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.740 

this<00:03:57.460> point<00:03:57.700> just<00:03:57.970> place<00:03:58.240> your<00:03:58.390> mixture

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
this point just place your mixture

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.500 
this point just place your mixture
inside<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.140> freezer<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.740> let's<00:04:00.280> say<00:04:00.510> every

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
inside the freezer and let's say every

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.640 
inside the freezer and let's say every
hour<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:03.040> give<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.880> a<00:04:03.970> stare<00:04:04.270> like<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:04.690> take

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
hour you give it a stare like this take

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.500 
hour you give it a stare like this take
it<00:04:05.770> out<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.040> freezer<00:04:06.250> in<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.819> spirit<00:04:07.209> and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
it out of the freezer in the spirit and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.590 
it out of the freezer in the spirit and
then<00:04:08.290> put<00:04:08.830> it<00:04:08.950> back<00:04:08.980> into<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.490> freezer<00:04:09.700> until

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
then put it back into the freezer until

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.720 
then put it back into the freezer until
it's<00:04:10.930> completely<00:04:11.319> frozen<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.010> while<00:04:12.520> getting

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
it's completely frozen and while getting

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.760 
it's completely frozen and while getting
colder<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.300> colder<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:14.140> consistence<00:04:14.680> would

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
colder and colder the consistence would

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.800 
colder and colder the consistence would
be<00:04:14.920> thicker<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.550> we'll<00:04:15.670> be<00:04:15.850> able<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.120> let's

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
be thicker and we'll be able to let's

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.310 
be thicker and we'll be able to let's
say<00:04:16.959> get<00:04:17.650> some<00:04:17.919> air<00:04:18.160> inside<00:04:19.090> your<00:04:19.269> mission<00:04:19.690> so

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
say get some air inside your mission so

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.530 
say get some air inside your mission so
one<00:04:20.500> hour<00:04:20.650> you<00:04:21.220> make<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.400> steal<00:04:21.700> one<00:04:22.030> hour<00:04:22.180> and

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
one hour you make a steal one hour and

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.080 
one hour you make a steal one hour and
again<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.440> again<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:24.190> closer<00:04:24.669> you<00:04:24.850> get<00:04:25.030> to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
again and again the closer you get to

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.810 
again and again the closer you get to
the<00:04:25.270> right<00:04:26.200> point<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:27.160> more<00:04:27.310> often<00:04:27.550> you

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
the right point the more often you

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.900 
the right point the more often you
better<00:04:28.150> give<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.990> waste<00:04:29.460> after<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.760> whole

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
better give it to waste after the whole

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.510 
better give it to waste after the whole
process<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.870> is<00:04:32.110> sort<00:04:32.350> of<00:04:32.380> product<00:04:32.800> you're

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
process this is sort of product you're

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.600 
process this is sort of product you're
supposed<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:36.310> sort<00:04:36.580> of

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
supposed to have this sort of

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.689 
supposed to have this sort of
consistency

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.240 

this<00:04:40.120> is<00:04:40.270> simple<00:04:40.659> chocolate<00:04:40.870> crumble<00:04:41.319> so<00:04:42.159> you

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
this is simple chocolate crumble so you

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.659 
this is simple chocolate crumble so you
can<00:04:42.550> buy<00:04:42.729> chocolate<00:04:43.659> biscuits<00:04:44.250> just<00:04:45.250> break<00:04:45.490> it

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
can buy chocolate biscuits just break it

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.059 
can buy chocolate biscuits just break it
and<00:04:45.879> so<00:04:46.419> can<00:04:46.449> be<00:04:46.629> sort<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:46.930> power<00:04:47.199> that<00:04:47.530> will<00:04:47.949> be

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
and so can be sort of power that will be

00:04:48.069 --> 00:05:00.029 
and so can be sort of power that will be
very<00:04:48.280> easy<00:04:56.879> and<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.930> trick<00:04:59.139> is<00:04:59.169> done<00:04:59.289> you<00:04:59.860> ask

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
very easy and the trick is done you ask

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.789 
very easy and the trick is done you ask
him<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.580> ready
