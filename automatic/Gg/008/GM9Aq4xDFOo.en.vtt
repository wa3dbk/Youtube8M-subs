aspect<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.250> an

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
aspect as you can see here is you use an

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.150 
aspect as you can see here is you use an
advanced<00:00:45.090> builder<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.570> build<00:00:46.160> places

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
advanced builder you can build places

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.000 
advanced builder you can build places
from<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.879> players<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.329> spawn

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
from which the players will spawn

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.549 
from which the players will spawn
defenses<00:00:50.840> upgrades<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.199> stuff<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
defenses upgrades and stuff like that

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.720 
defenses upgrades and stuff like that
you<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.710> two<00:00:55.980> sides<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.579> humans<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.239> aliens

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
you have two sides the humans and aliens

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.310 
you have two sides the humans and aliens
like<00:00:59.730> both<00:01:00.329> sides<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.840> something<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
like both sides have something to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.780 
like both sides have something to
protect<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.879> humans<00:01:03.300> must<00:01:03.840> protect<00:01:04.790> this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
protect the humans must protect this

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.100 
protect the humans must protect this
generator<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.220> they<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.430> base<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
generator here and they can base it and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.270 
generator here and they can base it and
that<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> aliens<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> same<00:01:10.979> book<00:01:11.130> will

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that the aliens have the same book will

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.179 
that the aliens have the same book will
decks<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.729> later

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
decks that later

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
decks that later
basically<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> server<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
basically the if it's on a server that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.330 
basically the if it's on a server that
would<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> lot<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> people<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.159> game

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
would just a lot of people then the game

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.899 
would just a lot of people then the game
then<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> fighting<00:01:21.180> game<00:01:21.330> plate<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.909> very

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
then the fighting game plate is a very

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.550 
then the fighting game plate is a very
hard<00:01:24.390> very<00:01:24.689> big<00:01:25.380> fast<00:01:26.280> paced<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.259> basic<00:01:28.259> human

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
hard very big fast paced the basic human

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.609 
hard very big fast paced the basic human
building<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.970> tellin<00:01:30.240> own<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:31.380> which

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
building is the tellin own with which

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.999 
building is the tellin own with which
they<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.100> teleport<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.030> 115<00:01:33.899> others<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
they can teleport from 115 others and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.440 
they can teleport from 115 others and
they<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.399> to<00:01:35.580> require<00:01:35.939> their<00:01:36.270> equipment

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
they have to require their equipment

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.070 
they have to require their equipment
again<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.750> basically<00:01:40.619> only<00:01:41.340> plan<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:42.689> use<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
again I basically only plan just use the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.630 
again I basically only plan just use the
flame<00:01:43.320> from<00:01:43.530> work<00:01:45.710> it's<00:01:46.710> partially<00:01:47.159> fun<00:01:47.399> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
flame from work it's partially fun but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.020 
flame from work it's partially fun but
the<00:01:47.670> bad<00:01:48.060> thing<00:01:48.300> about<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.810> game<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.140> that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
the bad thing about this game is that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.680 
the bad thing about this game is that
you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.179> basically<00:01:51.360> hurt<00:01:51.990> hurt<00:01:52.830> you're<00:01:53.340> hurt

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690

it's<00:02:03.560> very<00:02:04.280> calm<00:02:04.759> very<00:02:05.240> hard<00:02:06.020> not<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.530> miss

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
it's very calm very hard not to miss

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.729 
it's very calm very hard not to miss
your<00:02:07.579> allies<00:02:07.970> when<00:02:08.599> Iron<00:02:08.869> with<00:02:09.319> the

get up battle suit and which in the
weapon<00:02:23.239> which<00:02:23.660> i<00:02:23.900> think<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.319> very<00:02:24.620> well<00:02:25.130> were

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
weapon which i think is very well were

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.360 
weapon which i think is very well were
powered<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.910> not<00:02:26.090> balanced

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
powered and not balanced

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:38.309 
powered and not balanced
those<00:02:27.909> for<00:02:28.360> Canada

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.910 

now<00:02:39.319> humans<00:02:40.209> can<00:02:41.209> build<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.900> can<00:02:45.109> it's<00:02:45.769> very

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
now humans can build you can it's very

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.399 
now humans can build you can it's very
important<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.489> in<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.879> game<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:48.049> build<00:02:48.290> a

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
important that in the game you build a

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.369 
important that in the game you build a
forward<00:02:48.769> base<00:02:49.420> but<00:02:50.420> both<00:02:50.659> sides<00:02:50.689> are<00:02:51.139> very

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
forward base but both sides are very

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.039 
forward base but both sides are very
vulnerable<00:02:52.219> in<00:02:52.909> this<00:02:53.060> stage<00:02:53.299> but<00:02:53.629> they're<00:02:53.840> not

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
vulnerable in this stage but they're not

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.309 
vulnerable in this stage but they're not
then<00:02:54.500> they<00:02:54.920> don't<00:02:55.129> have<00:02:55.310> cover<00:02:56.139> where<00:02:57.139> are

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
then they don't have cover where are

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.690 
then they don't have cover where are
some<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:58.250> protect

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.490 

now<00:03:03.700> basically<00:03:04.330> humans<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:07.120> they<00:03:07.690> can<00:03:07.930> have

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
now basically humans can they can have

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.620 
now basically humans can they can have
jet<00:03:09.220> acts<00:03:09.490> but<00:03:10.150> they<00:03:10.390> can<00:03:10.660> be<00:03:10.810> counted<00:03:11.260> by

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
jet acts but they can be counted by

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.420 
jet acts but they can be counted by

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
lot of well that's it for now however

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.350 
lot of well that's it for now however
might<00:04:43.930> absorb<00:04:44.930> about<00:04:45.169> that<00:04:45.550> well<00:04:46.550> it's<00:04:47.030> pretty

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
might absorb about that well it's pretty

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.629 
might absorb about that well it's pretty
much<00:04:47.570> over<00:04:47.780> now<00:04:48.199> I<00:04:48.560> want<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.160> show<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.400> and

much over now I want to show you and
plus<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:50.570> wanted<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.139> show<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:51.440> the

plus I wanted to show you the
capabilities<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.590> really<00:04:54.590> think<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.860> the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
capabilities I really think that the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.200 
capabilities I really think that the
nature<00:04:55.940> game<00:04:56.150> community<00:04:56.419> could<00:04:56.960> really<00:04:57.500> make

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
nature game community could really make

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.110 
nature game community could really make
somewhat<00:04:59.210> of<00:04:59.389> a<00:04:59.539> sci-fi<00:04:59.930> mood<00:05:00.410> movie<00:05:01.120> instead

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
somewhat of a sci-fi mood movie instead

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.240 
somewhat of a sci-fi mood movie instead
with<00:05:02.479> this<00:05:02.630> game's<00:05:03.020> engine<00:05:03.320> or<00:05:04.120> in-game<00:05:06.250> well

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
with this game's engine or in-game well

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.420 
with this game's engine or in-game well
that's<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.699> for<00:05:07.940> only<00:05:08.180> for<00:05:09.110> now<00:05:09.260> I'll<00:05:10.070> see

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
that's it for only for now I'll see

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.370 
that's it for only for now I'll see
