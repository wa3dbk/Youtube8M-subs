00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello everyone today I bring you a small 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.870
 comment of the new directed film 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.540
 by javier fesser this new adaptation 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.610
 to the big screen of the comics of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.889
 mortadelo and filemón de ibáñez titled a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.400
 mortadelo and filemón against jimmy el 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.400
 horny 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.699
 good javier fesser this filmmaker who is 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.349
 known for movies as I walk like 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.419
 the miracle of p.tinto like the great 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.689
 adventure of mortadelo and filemón in this 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:35.469
 year 2014 has preferred to bring to death 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.449
 and filemón then to the world of the animation 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:41.269
 with a movie that does not adapt any 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.269
 of ballet comics 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.860
 I think the comic about this movie 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.260
 against jimmy the horny has appeared 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 after the movie was created 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.410
 and well what I say is to bring a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.210
 little to these characters to the world of 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.519
 animation something that you see today 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.500
 enough with movies from the studios 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.460
 Disney Dreamworks 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.830
 all these sagas of rec 'toy story' and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.860
 of bach not so here javier fesser has 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.750
 resorted to a Spanish study and Lyon 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.080
 studies that already took care of the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.380
 Planet 51 movie to convert 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.470
 to the characters of ibáñez in characters 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.840
 good, the truth is that I do not 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.600
 I'm a fan of mortadelo and filemón yo 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.120
 since boys always, I felt 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.710
 predilection for super lopez before 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.350
 for mortadelo and filemón I liked more 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.330
 their stories I did not have the super 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.860
 humor those of mortadelo and filemón and 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.790
 the truth is that they were very 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.100
 short cuts that almost always had the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.510
 structure did not have a very structure 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.540
 Similary 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.480
 and good even though the ife died 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.460
 they contain their own long adventures 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.560
 me well with the super humor that was what 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.680
 that in those years I bought in the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.470
 80 and so I hooked myself more to super 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.990
 good lopez the case is that I mention this 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.450
 since I consider that this movie is a 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.510
 gift for all fan it seems to me that this 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.750
 Once it has gotten to the express of a 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.200
 product at the height of those characters 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.940
 and that I think he 'll fall in love with any 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.070
 fan of vallés comics 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.100
 has a superb animation to 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.380
 charge of these studies ilion that no 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.620
 have nothing to envy to studies like 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.690
 disney dreamworks and others despite being 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.660
 a very small study based on the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.200
 rozas en madrid I think they have done 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.000
 an absolutely incredible job this 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.310
 movie can be viewed several times 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.260
 and you'll see things that maybe in the first 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.850
 viewed once appreciated and in a 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.110
 second and third added you are going to 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.390
 capture 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.430
 every plane every second has then 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.280
 small gifts for the amateur of 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.160
 the comics in small details even 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.560
 on posters that look in the distance 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.170
 humorous funny details that make 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.940
 reference to the world in which we live 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.760
 here in Spain not like the English court 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.460
 no and things like that 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.290
 TV series or not 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.690
 has a visual richness this movie 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.370
 that I think will be appreciated so much by the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.200
 fans of portable comics and 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.530
 fairmount as by any lover of 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.840
 cinema in general terms the history 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.610
 tells us like jimmy the horny the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.620
 video of the tape takes over a box 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.600
 strong that contains some ultra files 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.760
 secrets of the aunt's agency 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.890
 commanded by the super and then then 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.200
 you have no one to call dead 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.540
 and filemón so that they try to recover 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.310
 those files at the same time filemón will have 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.500
 to face a dangerous 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.760
 delinquent to a strongman who has left 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.100
 from prison and who wants revenge 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.250
 because apparently he got him then between 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.220
 bars with false evidence and good because the 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.160
 movie is a real nonsense 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.980
 has a devilish rhythm is a non stop 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.960
 maybe many viewers or many 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.330
 children go crazy after seeing this 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.250
 movie because it's leading to the great 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.450
 screen what are mortal comics 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.930
 and filemón but in a very 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.270
 unbridled we do not have blows we have 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.250
 explosive chases explosions 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.049
 good if you have seen the comics of 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.450
 mortadelo and filemón multiply that 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.650
 by a hundred or a thousand and you will have what 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.630
 what do I say in a very movie 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.280
 rampant very crazy but also 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.810
 very funny 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.550
 I would have preferred it had 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.490
 lowered a little the tone no 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.790
 we would have had a somewhat more rhythm 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.220
 quieter because sometimes you can 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.920
 get a little out of the movie or you can 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.720
 get mad but I think that for 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.270
 any lover of movies or 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.830
 sorry for the mortadelo comics and 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.720
 filemón 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.430
 this is a true gift 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.350
 and that they had been waiting for 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.810
 many years in view of the other 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.850
 two films of 2003 and 2008 with 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.520
 and flesh and blood characters did not arrive 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.880
 to be all the good that an amateur 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.410
 to the ballet comics I would wait and good 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.740
 Well what to say is a movie that I 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.200
 would give a 7 denotes this tape for a fan 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.970
 deported and filemón is outstanding I 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.980
 I would give a 10 but yes that as 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.560
 viewer not fond of mortadelo and 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.600
 filemón perhaps it lowered a little the note 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.060
 by that overly devilish rhythm and 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.740
 crazy but good I say it 's a 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.420
 very recommendable movie that you can 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.730
 see endless times since it has 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.040
 details that can be reviewed 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.500
 a thousand times here we also have the 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.570
 appearance of characters seen in the 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.030
 comics and not just carrier Bainet 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.310
 filemón we will see others that already you will see by 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.040
 yourselves I do not want to say who is 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.540
 that character and nothing this is all that 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.280
 I have to say mortadelo and filemón 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.090
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.090
 see you in the next 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.789
 and 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.430
 or not
