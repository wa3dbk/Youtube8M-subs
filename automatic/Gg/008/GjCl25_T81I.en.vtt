00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.970 
locate everything on the painting and
then<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.350> use<00:00:16.529> cobalt<00:00:17.039> cobalt<00:00:17.580> blue<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.980> a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.269 
the sky from the top which is dark blue
then<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.910> keep<00:00:27.119> adding<00:00:27.570> white<00:00:28.070> toward<00:00:29.070> the

and I put the yellow in the middle and
paint<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> yellow<00:00:51.210> first<00:00:51.680> then<00:00:52.680> put<00:00:53.930> darker

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I put the light orange around as I move

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.770

away<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.140> center<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.939> I<00:01:08.939> keep<00:01:09.150> blending

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
away from the center and I keep blending

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
away from the center and I keep blending
the<00:01:10.170> colors<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.510> paint<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.150 

then<00:01:28.620> I<00:01:28.770> paint<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.190> reflection<00:01:29.760> of<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.500> Sun

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.980 
then I paint the reflection of the Sun
from<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.850> war<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:35.210> for<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.570> start<00:01:36.900> with

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
from the war and for that I start with

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.990 
from the war and for that I start with
the<00:01:37.260> same<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.160> yellow<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.630> then

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the same thing with the yellow and then

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.600 
the same thing with the yellow and then
darker<00:01:42.000> yellow<00:01:42.230> then<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.440> light<00:01:43.680> orange<00:01:44.190> on

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.930 

and<00:01:52.330> then<00:01:52.480> I<00:01:52.510> use<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.870> light<00:01:53.830> magenta<00:01:54.100> which

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
and then I use a light magenta which

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.550 
and then I use a light magenta which
intermixed<00:01:55.660> good<00:01:55.840> white<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.380> edge

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
intermixed good white and then the edge

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.220 
intermixed good white and then the edge
of<00:01:59.860> sunlight<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.840> make<00:02:02.200> some<00:02:03.010> clouds

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
of sunlight and make some clouds

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.050 
of sunlight and make some clouds
surrounding<00:02:05.230> that<00:02:05.290> area<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.700> use<00:02:07.030> a

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.680 
surrounding that area then I use a
darker<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:09.960> darker<00:02:10.960> purple<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:12.220> do<00:02:12.400> clouds<00:02:13.270> at

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:23.430 
darker a darker purple to do clouds at
our<00:02:14.430> higher<00:02:15.990> bigger<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.380> closer

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.760 

and<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.730> darkest<00:02:25.180> clouds<00:02:25.750> are<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.380> top<00:02:28.770> and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.370 
and the darkest clouds are on top and
for<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.220> use<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.580> dark<00:02:30.880> purple<00:02:31.390> color<00:02:34.380> then

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
I use a light purple on top of the year

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.730 
I use a light purple on top of the year

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.660 
of the war to make three poems and then
I<00:02:44.920> yeah<00:02:45.510> after<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.660> clouds<00:02:46.900> try<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.680> use<00:02:48.370> white

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
I yeah after the clouds try I use white

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.610 
I yeah after the clouds try I use white
first<00:02:49.740> on<00:02:50.740> top<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.310> clouds<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.570> then<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.110> paint

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
first on top of clouds and then I paint

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.590 
first on top of clouds and then I paint
orange<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.580> red<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:56.530> top<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.160> white<00:02:57.600> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
orange and red on top of the white to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.530 
orange and red on top of the white to
paint<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.290> sunlight<00:03:00.010> reflections<00:03:00.640> on<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
paint the sunlight reflections on the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.250 
paint the sunlight reflections on the
clouds<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:04.120> reason<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.840> white<00:03:05.020> is

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
clouds the reason for the white is

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.660 
clouds the reason for the white is
because<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.570> want<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.720> colors<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.080> come<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.950> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
because I want the colors to come to the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.200 
because I want the colors to come to the
right<00:03:11.220> then<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.250> use<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.580> blue<00:03:13.800> light<00:03:14.800> blue<00:03:15.210> to

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
right then I use a blue light blue to

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.900 
right then I use a blue light blue to
the<00:03:16.540> waves<00:03:16.960> ripples<00:03:17.800> on<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.130> bar<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.640> then<00:03:21.760> I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
the waves ripples on the bar and then I

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.740 
the waves ripples on the bar and then I
start<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.420> painting<00:03:22.780> waves<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:25.330> big<00:03:25.510> way

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
start the painting waves in the big way

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.600 
start the painting waves in the big way
closer<00:03:29.100> then<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.310> make<00:03:31.209> transition<00:03:31.900> between

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
closer then I make transition between

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.940 
closer then I make transition between
sunlight<00:03:33.610> reflections<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:35.350> waves<00:03:35.590> with

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
sunlight reflections and the waves with

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.170 
sunlight reflections and the waves with
some<00:03:36.610> purple<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:38.370> then<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.400> start<00:03:39.790> doing<00:03:39.910> the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
some purple and then I start doing the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.960 
some purple and then I start doing the
big<00:03:40.650> point<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:43.800> translucent<00:03:44.800> part<00:03:45.070> with

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
big point and translucent part with

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:55.940 
big point and translucent part with
yellow<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.900> light<00:03:47.140> blue<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.880> blend<00:03:48.880> them

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.760 

and<00:03:56.490> then<00:03:56.700> there<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.780> wave<00:03:57.990> gets<00:03:58.290> darker

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
and then there the wave gets darker

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.650 
and then there the wave gets darker
toward<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.340> bottom<00:04:00.380> liar<00:04:01.380> up<00:04:02.300> then<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.330> make

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
toward the bottom liar up then I make

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:22.270 
toward the bottom liar up then I make
the<00:04:03.870> ripples<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:05.959> peg<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.140> are

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.340
