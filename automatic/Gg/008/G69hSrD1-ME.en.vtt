give<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.200> little<00:00:13.349> break<00:00:13.980> down<00:00:14.190> what<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.460> is

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
give you a little break down what it is

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.189 
give you a little break down what it is
basically<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.089> baseline<00:00:15.509> he's<00:00:15.719> playing<00:00:15.990> just

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
basically the baseline he's playing just

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.599 
basically the baseline he's playing just
an<00:00:16.289> octave<00:00:16.560> higher<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:17.310> he<00:00:17.369> adds<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
an octave higher and then he adds a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.189 
an octave higher and then he adds a
little<00:00:17.699> harmony<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.390> goes<00:00:18.840> something<00:00:19.170> like

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
little harmony so goes something like

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:38.660 
little harmony so goes something like
this<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> let's<00:00:37.800> break<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.010> down<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.550> only

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this so let's break that down it's only

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.139 
this so let's break that down it's only
two<00:00:39.059> different<00:00:39.450> parts<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.340> super<00:00:42.120> easy

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
two different parts and it's super easy

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.779 
two different parts and it's super easy
the<00:00:42.719> rhythms<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.350> little<00:00:43.559> hard<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.399> what

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the rhythms a little hard so is what

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.680 
the rhythms a little hard so is what
we're<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.360> we're<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.570> break

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
we're going to do is we're going break

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.270 
we're going to do is we're going break
it<00:00:45.870> down<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.230> note<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.559> note<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.129> we're

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it down a note for note so we're

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.060 
it down a note for note so we're
starting<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.260> D<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
starting right here on it's a D on the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.650 
starting right here on it's a D on the
5th<00:00:50.280> fret<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> string<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.390> we're<00:00:51.539> going

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
to hit that three times so one in em and

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.130 
to hit that three times so one in em and
then<00:00:58.320> we'll<00:00:58.500> hit<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> e<00:00:58.800> twice<00:00:59.730> which<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.660> 7th

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
then we'll hit the e twice which is 7th

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.149 
then we'll hit the e twice which is 7th
fret<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:04.700> that's<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> rhythm<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.630> two<00:01:07.350> three
