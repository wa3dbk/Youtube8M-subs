00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
we asked all of our climbing ambassadors

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.730 
we asked all of our climbing ambassadors
you<00:00:11.570> know<00:00:11.690> sort<00:00:11.960> of<00:00:12.019> what<00:00:12.200> is<00:00:12.320> that<00:00:12.440> piece<00:00:12.679> that

you know sort of what is that piece that
you<00:00:13.040> can't<00:00:13.460> do<00:00:13.670> without<00:00:14.110> don't<00:00:15.110> think<00:00:15.380> about

you can't do without don't think about
what<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.250> mass<00:00:16.430> market<00:00:16.939> wants<00:00:17.300> think<00:00:17.869> about

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
what you as a high-end climber

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.300 
what you as a high-end climber
wants<00:00:21.200> and<00:00:21.349> needs<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:21.860> one<00:00:22.009> of<00:00:22.130> the

wants and needs and one of the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.490 
wants and needs and one of the
consistent<00:00:23.119> things<00:00:23.419> that<00:00:23.720> we<00:00:23.869> saw<00:00:24.079> throughout

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
consistent things that we saw throughout

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.720 
consistent things that we saw throughout
pretty<00:00:24.890> much<00:00:25.009> everybody

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
pretty much everybody

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:34.880 
pretty much everybody
designed<00:00:26.660> a<00:00:27.910> lightweight<00:00:28.910> anorak

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.170 

packing<00:00:35.890> light<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.370> dressing<00:00:36.789> light<00:00:36.969> is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
packing light and dressing light is

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.389 
packing light and dressing light is
essential<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:38.050> alpine<00:00:38.620> climbing<00:00:38.920> because<00:00:39.190> you

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
essential to alpine climbing because you

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.250 
essential to alpine climbing because you
have<00:00:39.519> to<00:00:39.640> move<00:00:39.760> fast<00:00:40.089> through<00:00:40.809> complex

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
have to move fast through complex

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.139 
have to move fast through complex
terrain<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:42.309> you<00:00:42.399> have<00:00:42.519> to<00:00:42.640> be<00:00:42.760> as<00:00:42.909> light

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
terrain and so you have to be as light

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.610 
terrain and so you have to be as light
as<00:00:43.180> possible<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.079> you<00:00:44.170> have<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.409> dress

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
as possible and you have to dress

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.740 
as possible and you have to dress
appropriately<00:00:45.370> for<00:00:45.489> that<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:46.210> have<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.570> be

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
appropriately for that you have to be

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.270 
appropriately for that you have to be
able<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.050> stay<00:00:47.260> warm<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.800> dry<00:00:47.949> through<00:00:48.250> a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
able to stay warm and dry through a

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.130 
able to stay warm and dry through a
whole<00:00:48.610> range<00:00:48.879> of<00:00:49.059> conditions<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:49.719> that<00:00:49.870> sort

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
whole range of conditions and that sort

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.850 
whole range of conditions and that sort
of<00:00:50.199> climbing

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
of climbing

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.490 
of climbing
you<00:00:51.339> know<00:00:51.430> alpine<00:00:51.879> climbing<00:00:52.180> it's<00:00:52.690> kind<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.379> a

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
you know alpine climbing it's kind of a

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.850 
you know alpine climbing it's kind of a
it's<00:00:54.190> often<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.549> cyclic<00:00:55.119> sort<00:00:55.479> of<00:00:55.860> activity

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
it's often a cyclic sort of activity

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's often a cyclic sort of activity
level<00:00:57.129> like<00:00:57.250> sometimes<00:00:57.820> I<00:00:57.879> go<00:00:58.000> real<00:00:58.269> fast<00:00:58.629> if

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
level like sometimes I go real fast if

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:00.299 
level like sometimes I go real fast if
you're<00:00:59.019> trying<00:00:59.229> to<00:00:59.289> motor<00:00:59.559> through<00:00:59.890> moderate

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
you're trying to motor through moderate

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.969 
you're trying to motor through moderate
rain<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:01.329> then<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:01.570> stop<00:01:01.899> but<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.199> belay<00:01:02.589> and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
rain and then you stop but a belay and

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.340 
rain and then you stop but a belay and
you<00:01:03.519> cool<00:01:03.820> down<00:01:03.969> a<00:01:04.000> little<00:01:04.360> bit<00:01:04.569> you<00:01:05.229> know

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
you cool down a little bit you know

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.990 
you cool down a little bit you know
you're<00:01:05.560> exerting<00:01:06.039> when<00:01:06.369> you're<00:01:06.490> leading<00:01:06.700> and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
you're exerting when you're leading and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.190 
you're exerting when you're leading and
you<00:01:07.060> get<00:01:07.210> real<00:01:07.390> hot<00:01:07.569> sometimes<00:01:07.929> you're

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
you get real hot sometimes you're

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.450 
you get real hot sometimes you're
sweating<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.649> then<00:01:08.740> when<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:08.950> stop<00:01:09.220> at<00:01:09.429> the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
sweating and then when you stop at the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.700 
sweating and then when you stop at the
belay<00:01:09.789> jacket<00:01:10.149> has<00:01:10.899> to<00:01:11.020> breathe<00:01:11.259> well<00:01:11.500> enough

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
belay jacket has to breathe well enough

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.910 
belay jacket has to breathe well enough
to<00:01:11.920> actually<00:01:12.280> draw<00:01:13.140> death<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> mountaineer

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
to actually draw death to a mountaineer

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.180 
to actually draw death to a mountaineer
is<00:01:15.100> really<00:01:15.429> being<00:01:15.759> up<00:01:16.630> high<00:01:17.080> being<00:01:17.890> wet<00:01:18.159> and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
is really being up high being wet and

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.100 
is really being up high being wet and
staying<00:01:18.640> wet<00:01:18.970> especially<00:01:19.179> in<00:01:19.630> super<00:01:19.929> cold

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
staying wet especially in super cold

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.540 
staying wet especially in super cold
temperatures<00:01:20.649> so<00:01:20.830> we<00:01:20.950> want<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.190> get<00:01:21.280> them<00:01:21.399> as

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
temperatures so we want to get them as

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:33.620 
temperatures so we want to get them as
as<00:01:21.909> dry<00:01:22.300> and<00:01:22.360> as<00:01:22.600> warm<00:01:22.810> as<00:01:22.960> possible

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.260 

historically<00:01:34.470> we've<00:01:34.710> had<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.490> hard<00:01:36.060> shell

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
historically we've had a hard shell

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.330 
historically we've had a hard shell
jacket<00:01:36.510> that<00:01:37.050> worked<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.800> good<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.130> rain

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
jacket that worked really good as rain

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.510 
jacket that worked really good as rain
gear<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.020> there's<00:01:40.020> been<00:01:40.200> softshell<00:01:41.100> jackets

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
gear and there's been softshell jackets

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.469 
gear and there's been softshell jackets
which<00:01:41.640> were<00:01:41.820> traditionally<00:01:41.970> really

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
which were traditionally really

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.900 
which were traditionally really
lightweight<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.280> basically<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> windbreaker

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
lightweight and basically a windbreaker

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.090 
lightweight and basically a windbreaker
and<00:01:45.150> what<00:01:45.900> we<00:01:46.020> were<00:01:46.170> always<00:01:46.350> missing<00:01:46.860> was

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and what we were always missing was

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.250 
and what we were always missing was
something<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.240> between<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.080> kind<00:01:49.229> of

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
something in between so it's kind of

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.870 
something in between so it's kind of
like<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.530> sweet<00:01:49.890> spot<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> middle<00:01:50.610> where

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
like that sweet spot in the middle where

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.310 
like that sweet spot in the middle where
you<00:01:51.060> want<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> hard<00:01:51.540> shell<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.869> breathes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
you want a hard shell that breathes

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
you want a hard shell that breathes
better<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.550> a<00:01:53.610> soft<00:01:53.880> shell<00:01:54.119> that's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
better but you want a soft shell that's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
better but you want a soft shell that's
more<00:01:54.600> weatherproof<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.430> what

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
more weatherproof and that that's what

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.140 
more weatherproof and that that's what
I've<00:01:56.790> been<00:01:56.910> looking<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:58.670> what<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> came<00:01:59.940> down

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
I've been looking for what it came down

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.320 
I've been looking for what it came down
to<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.550> they<00:02:02.550> wanted<00:02:03.000> real

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
to really is that they wanted real

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.930 
to really is that they wanted real
simple<00:02:03.930> pieces<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.590> didn't<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.190> anything

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
simple pieces that didn't have anything

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.990 
simple pieces that didn't have anything
that<00:02:06.630> wasn't<00:02:07.020> needed<00:02:07.289> on<00:02:07.619> them<00:02:07.770> when<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.880> were

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
that wasn't needed on them when we were

combined with the chemistry that they

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.030 
combined with the chemistry that they

were using for the durable water
repellency<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:38.150> provide<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.410> best<00:03:39.620> extreme

wet weather protection that we can have

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.590 
wet weather protection that we can have
so<00:03:42.650> we've<00:03:42.830> got<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.040> good<00:03:43.700> balance<00:03:43.970> with<00:03:44.420> the
