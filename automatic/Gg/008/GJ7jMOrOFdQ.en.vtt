00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this is a little different than what

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.070 
this is a little different than what
they<00:01:07.979> usually<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.390> they<00:01:09.510> usually<00:01:09.630> sound

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
they usually do but they usually sound

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
they usually do but they usually sound
like<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.500> previous<00:01:10.920> albums<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.360> my

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
like on previous albums but this in my

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
like on previous albums but this in my
opinion<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> great<00:01:13.890> step<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> right

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
opinion is a great step in the right

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.899 
opinion is a great step in the right
direction<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.810> feel<00:01:16.680> about<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.400> when
