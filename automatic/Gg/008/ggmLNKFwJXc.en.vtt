00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
is what it should look like and the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.760 
is what it should look like and the
majority<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> my<00:00:18.840> city<00:00:19.080> actually<00:00:19.500> looked<00:00:19.710> like

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
this when they were done and in some

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.630 
this when they were done and in some
cases<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.080> was<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.289> lot<00:00:22.680> worse<00:00:22.980> than<00:00:23.010> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
cases it was a lot worse than that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
these two sections my downtown section

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080 
these two sections my downtown section
and<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.950> other<00:00:38.160> section<00:00:38.430> here<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:38.969> of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and this other section here and of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
and this other section here and of
course<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.450> trains<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.260> my<00:00:40.860> pier<00:00:41.160> are

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
course my trains and my my pier are

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.100 
course my trains and my my pier are
already<00:00:41.550> done<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.090> those<00:00:42.360> are<00:00:42.510> nice<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.930> clean

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
already done so those are nice and clean

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.490 
already done so those are nice and clean
and<00:00:43.140> ready<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.989> obviously<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.230> clean

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and ready to go so obviously as I clean

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.900 
and ready to go so obviously as I clean
I<00:00:46.530> did<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.860> put<00:00:47.070> him<00:00:47.160> back<00:00:47.250> together<00:00:47.460> that's

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
I did not put him back together that's

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.389 
I did not put him back together that's
why<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.989> horrendous<00:00:49.559> mess<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.010> looks<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
why is a horrendous mess it looks like a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
why is a horrendous mess it looks like a
tornado<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.629> ripping<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.199> through<00:00:52.500> here

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
tornado when ripping right through here

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
tornado when ripping right through here
some<00:00:53.309> areas<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.670> did<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.120> apart<00:00:54.449> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
some areas I did have to take apart a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
some areas I did have to take apart a
little<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:55.020> more<00:00:55.320> than<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.739> I'd<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.039> for

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
little bit more than what I'd like for

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.099 
little bit more than what I'd like for
example<00:00:57.059> these<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.420> train<00:00:57.660> stations

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
example these little train stations

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.810 
example these little train stations
there<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.530> hard-to-reach<00:00:58.949> spaces<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
there was some hard-to-reach spaces so I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
there was some hard-to-reach spaces so I
took<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.600> apart<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.320> those<00:01:01.469> areas<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
took them apart to get to those areas I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
took them apart to get to those areas I
did<00:01:02.399> use<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> Swiffer<00:01:02.850> duster<00:01:03.270> handheld<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
did use a Swiffer duster handheld to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.390 
did use a Swiffer duster handheld to
help<00:01:04.199> me<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.409> those<00:01:04.530> other<00:01:04.739> areas<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.250> were

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
help me with those other areas that were

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.560

just<00:01:05.430> impossible<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.450> reach<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.650> my<00:01:08.220> vacuum

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
just impossible to reach for my vacuum

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
on the other end here I wanted to point

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.280

something<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.930> cleaning

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
something out that in the cleaning

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
something out that in the cleaning
process<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:14.070> was<00:01:14.280> an<00:01:14.460> unfortunate

shmoo Tower which is this red building
here<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.150> white<00:01:21.150> s<00:01:21.390> on

here this is the one with the white s on

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.010 
here this is the one with the white s on
the<00:01:21.780> front<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.610> took<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.729> spill<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.479> there

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the front of it took a spill and there

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.480 
the front of it took a spill and there
is<00:01:25.259> what's<00:01:25.530> left<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> very<00:01:26.310> bottom

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
is what's left of it at the very bottom

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
is what's left of it at the very bottom
I'm<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.180> sure<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.479> gonna<00:01:27.570> rebuild<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
I'm not sure I'm gonna rebuild that I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
I'm not sure I'm gonna rebuild that I
think<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.009> might<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.659> rebuild<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
think I might just rebuild it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.149 
think I might just rebuild it
differently<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.229> take<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:31.560> apart<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
differently just take it all apart and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.510 
differently just take it all apart and
try<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> little<00:01:33.030> different<00:01:33.479> approach<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
try a little different approach to it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.880 
try a little different approach to it
all<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.509> test<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.409> test<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
all right so now is the test the test of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
all right so now is the test the test of
my<00:01:38.009> ability<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> put<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.210> together

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450

me I am definitely not as young as I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.790 
me I am definitely not as young as I
used<00:03:48.460> to<00:03:48.700> be<00:03:48.820> but<00:03:49.510> it's<00:03:49.750> all<00:03:49.960> clean<00:03:50.290> this

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
used to be but it's all clean this

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.410 
used to be but it's all clean this

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
section right here I'll put back

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.880 
section right here I'll put back
together<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.780> think<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.020> did<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.200> pretty<00:03:53.260> good<00:03:53.830> job

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
together I think I did a pretty good job

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.400 
together I think I did a pretty good job
of<00:03:54.280> finding<00:03:54.820> where<00:03:54.940> everything<00:03:55.210> went<00:03:55.450> after

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
of finding where everything went after

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.700 
of finding where everything went after
it<00:03:56.530> was<00:03:56.680> completely<00:03:57.220> torn<00:03:57.550> apart<00:03:58.710> there's

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
it was completely torn apart there's

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.840 
it was completely torn apart there's
some<00:03:59.920> things<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.160> are<00:04:00.310> probably<00:04:00.490> a<00:04:00.640> little

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
some things that are probably a little

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.580 
some things that are probably a little
bit<00:04:01.120> different<00:04:01.540> but<00:04:01.720> for<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.050> most<00:04:02.170> part<00:04:02.440> it's

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
bit different but for the most part it's

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.250 
bit different but for the most part it's
back<00:04:02.770> together<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.790> took<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.000> while<00:04:04.270> I'd<00:04:04.600> say<00:04:04.960> I

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
back together it took a while I'd say I

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.960 
back together it took a while I'd say I
don't<00:04:05.680> know<00:04:05.770> I<00:04:05.800> did<00:04:05.980> I<00:04:06.010> didn't<00:04:06.310> keep<00:04:06.460> track<00:04:06.790> of

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
don't know I did I didn't keep track of

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.480 
don't know I did I didn't keep track of
the<00:04:07.030> time<00:04:07.270> but<00:04:07.570> I'd<00:04:08.470> say<00:04:08.740> maybe<00:04:09.070> an<00:04:09.190> hour<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.430> a

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
the time but I'd say maybe an hour and a

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.250 
the time but I'd say maybe an hour and a
half<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:10.690> get<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.900> all<00:04:11.020> back<00:04:11.200> together

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
half to get it all back together

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.750 
half to get it all back together
all<00:04:14.260> nice<00:04:14.740> and<00:04:14.770> clean<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.280> people<00:04:15.520> are<00:04:15.610> nice

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.000 
Monza Italy Grand Prix and I'm thinking
about<00:04:54.190> doing<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.730> new<00:04:54.880> configuration<00:04:56.010> maybe

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
about doing a new configuration maybe

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.800 
about doing a new configuration maybe
just<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.280> custom<00:04:57.610> configuration<00:04:58.330> try<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.630> get

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
just a custom configuration try to get

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.520 
just a custom configuration try to get
some<00:04:58.960> space<00:04:59.320> more<00:04:59.710> space<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.280> build<00:05:00.430> back<00:05:00.730> here

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
some space more space to build back here

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.480 
some space more space to build back here
I'm<00:05:02.530> not<00:05:02.680> gonna<00:05:02.800> I'm<00:05:03.070> not<00:05:03.190> sure<00:05:03.280> we're<00:05:03.370> going

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
I'm not gonna I'm not sure we're going

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.159 
I'm not gonna I'm not sure we're going
to<00:05:03.550> do<00:05:03.640> with<00:05:03.760> this<00:05:03.910> parking<00:05:04.600> garage<00:05:04.660> it's<00:05:05.110> a

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
to do with this parking garage it's a

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.980 
to do with this parking garage it's a
beast<00:05:05.490> but<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:06.820> think<00:05:07.390> I<00:05:07.450> can<00:05:07.630> probably<00:05:07.780> do

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990
