00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
little painful but you can really really

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.100 
little painful but you can really really
tell<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.489> difference<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:08.540> actually<00:03:08.959> just

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
tell the difference it actually just

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.470 
tell the difference it actually just
pushes<00:03:09.709> off<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.220> smosh's<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.060> little<00:03:11.239> bit

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
to make it a little bit blacker so then

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.320 
to make it a little bit blacker so then
