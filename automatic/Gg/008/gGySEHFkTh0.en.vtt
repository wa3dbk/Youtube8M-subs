00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.940 

I<00:00:04.210> suppose<00:00:05.210> the<00:00:05.630> first<00:00:05.840> seminar<00:00:06.200> I<00:00:06.470> did<00:00:06.740> in

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
I suppose the first seminar I did in

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.570 
I suppose the first seminar I did in
back<00:00:07.670> in<00:00:07.819> 2008<00:00:08.510> that<00:00:09.070> was<00:00:10.070> probably<00:00:10.309> one<00:00:10.550> of

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
back in 2008 that was probably one of

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.980 
back in 2008 that was probably one of
the<00:00:10.730> best<00:00:10.910> I<00:00:11.030> mean<00:00:11.060> apart<00:00:11.420> from<00:00:11.540> you<00:00:11.870> know

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
the best I mean apart from you know

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.080 
the best I mean apart from you know
getting<00:00:12.500> married<00:00:12.980> having<00:00:13.130> children<00:00:13.250> you<00:00:13.970> know

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
getting married having children you know

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.119 
getting married having children you know
those<00:00:14.480> things<00:00:14.750> but<00:00:15.620> I<00:00:15.710> think<00:00:15.920> that<00:00:16.039> was

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
those things but I think that was

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.470 
those things but I think that was
probably<00:00:16.400> one<00:00:16.609> of<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:16.760> best<00:00:16.939> weekend's<00:00:17.330> I've

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
probably one of the best weekend's I've

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.240 
probably one of the best weekend's I've
ever<00:00:17.630> had<00:00:17.810> that<00:00:18.050> says<00:00:18.650> a<00:00:18.680> lot<00:00:18.770> cuz<00:00:19.039> I've<00:00:19.130> had

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
ever had that says a lot cuz I've had

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.010 
ever had that says a lot cuz I've had
some<00:00:19.400> good<00:00:19.520> weekends<00:00:19.940> but<00:00:20.539> you're<00:00:20.660> able<00:00:20.750> to

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
some good weekends but you're able to

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.710 
some good weekends but you're able to
walk<00:00:21.680> away<00:00:21.830> pretty<00:00:22.490> much<00:00:22.610> immediately<00:00:23.270> you

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
walk away pretty much immediately you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.200 
walk away pretty much immediately you
know<00:00:23.840> with<00:00:24.080> what<00:00:24.289> you<00:00:24.470> learn<00:00:24.680> if<00:00:25.130> you're<00:00:26.090> not

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
know with what you learn if you're not

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.420

doing something correctly you know

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.689 
doing something correctly you know
you're<00:00:29.119> shown<00:00:29.390> pretty<00:00:29.869> quickly<00:00:30.520> what<00:00:31.520> you're

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
you're shown pretty quickly what you're

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.549 
you're shown pretty quickly what you're
doing<00:00:31.939> wrong<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.359> you<00:00:32.870> know<00:00:32.989> that<00:00:33.260> when<00:00:33.469> you

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
doing wrong so you know that when you

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.590 
doing wrong so you know that when you
leave<00:00:33.770> that<00:00:34.190> by<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.729> time<00:00:34.969> you<00:00:35.089> get<00:00:35.210> home<00:00:35.390> you

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
leave that by the time you get home you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.020 
leave that by the time you get home you
know<00:00:35.629> what<00:00:35.839> you're<00:00:35.989> doing<00:00:36.519> now<00:00:37.519> for<00:00:37.550> me<00:00:37.850> the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
know what you're doing now for me the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.419 
know what you're doing now for me the
second<00:00:38.359> level<00:00:38.629> was<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.469> big<00:00:39.710> might<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:40.129> was<00:00:40.399> a

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:40.429 
second level was a big might I was a

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.520 
second level was a big might I was a
life-changing<00:00:41.300> thing<00:00:41.359> for<00:00:41.659> me<00:00:41.749> and<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.469> don't

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
life-changing thing for me and I don't

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.899 
life-changing thing for me and I don't
say<00:00:42.859> that<00:00:43.010> lightly<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.489> reason<00:00:43.729> it<00:00:43.819> was

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
say that lightly the reason it was

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.209 
say that lightly the reason it was
life-changing<00:00:44.120> was<00:00:44.600> because<00:00:44.929> I<00:00:46.149> could<00:00:47.170> do

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
life-changing was because I could do

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.259 
life-changing was because I could do
after<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.309> course<00:00:49.549> I<00:00:49.760> could<00:00:49.909> do<00:00:49.999> a<00:00:50.030> long

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
after the course I could do a long

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.629 
after the course I could do a long
distance<00:00:50.479> healing<00:00:50.899> on<00:00:51.319> say<00:00:51.589> friends<00:00:52.519> and

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
distance healing on say friends and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.559 
distance healing on say friends and
family<00:00:52.999> who<00:00:53.569> would<00:00:53.749> live<00:00:54.219> you<00:00:55.219> know<00:00:55.569> hundreds

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
family who would live you know hundreds

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.039 
family who would live you know hundreds
of<00:00:56.600> miles<00:00:56.780> away<00:00:56.959> and<00:00:58.420> not<00:00:59.420> all<00:00:59.569> the<00:00:59.719> time<00:00:59.899> but

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
of miles away and not all the time but

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:01.389 
of miles away and not all the time but
in<00:01:00.170> many<00:01:00.319> instances<00:01:00.889> they<00:01:01.100> could<00:01:01.249> actually

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
in many instances they could actually

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.090 
in many instances they could actually
feel<00:01:01.819> what<00:01:01.969> I<00:01:02.030> was<00:01:02.239> doing<00:01:02.569> and<00:01:02.749> all<00:01:03.709> of<00:01:03.920> them

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
feel what I was doing and all of them

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.420 
feel what I was doing and all of them
and<00:01:05.200> after<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.290> four<00:01:06.470> days<00:01:06.680> would<00:01:07.130> note<00:01:07.310> an

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
and after the four days would note an

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.570 
and after the four days would note an
improvement<00:01:08.440> that<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.650> me<00:01:09.800> was<00:01:09.980> extraordinary

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
improvement that to me was extraordinary

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.450 
improvement that to me was extraordinary
because<00:01:11.120> it<00:01:11.530> kind<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.590> demonstrated<00:01:13.160> for<00:01:13.310> me

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
because it kind of demonstrated for me

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.820 
because it kind of demonstrated for me
that<00:01:13.730> were<00:01:13.850> more<00:01:14.060> than<00:01:14.180> just<00:01:14.680> you<00:01:15.680> know<00:01:15.710> a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
that were more than just you know a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.550 
that were more than just you know a
physical<00:01:16.390> flesh<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.570> bone<00:01:17.690> but<00:01:17.900> there's<00:01:18.320> more

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
physical flesh and bone but there's more

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.520 
physical flesh and bone but there's more
to<00:01:18.770> life<00:01:18.920> than<00:01:19.190> that<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:21.110> changed

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
to life than that and that that changed

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.470 
to life than that and that that changed
the<00:01:21.620> way<00:01:21.740> I<00:01:21.770> view<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.130> world<00:01:22.310> if<00:01:22.700> if<00:01:23.120> we're<00:01:23.360> not

just flesh and bone if there's something
more<00:01:27.200> if<00:01:27.470> there's<00:01:28.250> something<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:28.550> exists
