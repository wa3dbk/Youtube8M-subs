00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
so it's a matter so we have a we have a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.759 
so it's a matter so we have a we have a
program<00:03:24.970> it's<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.630> system<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:28.620> balancing<00:03:29.620> out

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
program it's a system of balancing out

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.440 
program it's a system of balancing out
those<00:03:29.920> hormones<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.580> replenishing<00:03:31.300> those

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
those hormones and replenishing those

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.330

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
your point is to treat the cause if what

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.080 
your point is to treat the cause if what
happened<00:04:30.590> was<00:04:30.710> your<00:04:30.830> hormones<00:04:31.250> changed

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
whether it's higher or lower then you

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.189 
whether it's higher or lower then you
