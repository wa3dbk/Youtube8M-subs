 I heard about the turn you are 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.609
 extending across the northern land 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.710
 do you really think it is magical in nature 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.899

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.600

 one of the most talented sorceresses 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.430
 of the region 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.619

 escorted by a prince it is true good 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.570
 we'd better get going 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.880
 according to our sources the plague has 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.590
 originated in the northern region 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:29.000
 we have to check the villages along 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:31.519
 king's road looks like the land around 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.780
 the barn is dying 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.840
 it may be that even the grain is 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.190
 affected by the plague we create no on 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.319
 these cases stamped the seal 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.720
 regional of andora the center of 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.400
 distribution for the northern lands 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.290
 if this grain can spread the plague 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.799
 there is no way of knowing how many i are 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.799
 affected villages 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.360
 we were discovered escaped brothers and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.519
 complete the mission 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.530
 I would like to stay and do four 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.530
 talk but duty calls me 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.670
 that creature looks like the union of several 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.120
 bodies we examine after having it 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:18.400
 killed 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:21.000
 okay for my father the king seems 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.000
 to interest 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.290
 taste my wrath 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.590
 very beautiful destroy the warehouse now 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.590
 great 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.810
 for my father the king 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.920
 feels small 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:13.370
 certainly what was and who was that 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.250
 magician dressed in black 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.109
 I think it was a necromancer it is 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.120
 It is obvious that he is behind the plague 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.160
 he has his lackeys I bet he will 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.910
 we will find ambon al 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.910
 answers we are looking for 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.880
 look at those types that they accompanied 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.350
 the necromancer what are they doing at 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.780
 mine 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.780
 we'll find out later we attack them 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.380
 damn intruders must not interfere 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:49.790
 with the master's plans we camp here 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.530
 with all these cultists around 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.460
 I prefer to wait for reinforcements before 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.510
 continue 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.510
 could not agree more 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:19.570
 hi again, only cult dolls used 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:22.570
 it is a warning for you to go away 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.840
 curiosity will lead you to death is you 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:29.830
 the head of the plague in the controls 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.870
 I have already created this cult and your work 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.420
 the cult of the damned to spread the 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.890
 plague through the wheat but that's not all 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.140
 thanks to me 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.100
 what do you mean I'm just a servant of 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.590
 manga nice 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.690
 the lord of darkness and commands him 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.670
 the scourge that will clean this land 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.910
 stable in a paradise of darkness 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:53.380
 eternal thing should free us from this 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.480
 scourge to the living obviously the plan 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.000
 is already in action 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.480
 go to strà tom if you need to 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.480
 other tests 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:11.790
 6 incorrigible for my father the king 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:20.840
 for the honor our gold mine is 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.840
 the king collapsed for my father 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:37.150
 excellent plan for my talks about the king ie 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:41.890
 he forlì my death won't do any 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:45.180
 long term difference because now the 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.180
 scourge of this land
