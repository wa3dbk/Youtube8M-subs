type<00:01:52.290> 1<00:01:52.500> gauntlets<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> probably<00:01:53.640> got

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
type 1 gauntlets that I probably got

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.569 
type 1 gauntlets that I probably got
from<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> package<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.560> helmets<00:01:55.950> i<00:01:56.130> did<00:01:56.399> get

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
from a package and for helmets i did get

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
from a package and for helmets i did get
another<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> crota's<00:01:57.719> Andrade

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
another one of the crota's Andrade

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
another one of the crota's Andrade
helmets<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.399> has<00:01:59.549> discipline

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
helmets and this one has discipline

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
helmets and this one has discipline
instead<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.689> strength<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.380> had<00:02:01.530> before

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
instead of strength which I had before

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
instead of strength which I had before
so<00:02:02.100> i'll<00:02:02.520> likely<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.880> breaking<00:02:03.329> down<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.689> one

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
so i'll likely be breaking down this one

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.690 
so i'll likely be breaking down this one
that<00:02:04.020> has<00:02:04.110> strength<00:02:04.530> maybe<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.250> though<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that has strength maybe not though and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
that has strength maybe not though and
as<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.360> already<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> got

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
as you can already see the one I got

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.229 
as you can already see the one I got
that<00:02:07.770> as<00:02:07.890> discipline<00:02:08.369> I've<00:02:08.550> already<00:02:08.819> fully

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
