00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
and everything worked out fine I don't
know<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.440> something<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.829> i<00:00:49.950> would

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
know if that's something that i would

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
know if that's something that i would
recommend<00:00:50.670> i'm<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.059> saying<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.390> that's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
recommend i'm just saying that that's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
recommend i'm just saying that that's
something<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.170> did<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.980> still<00:00:53.250> came

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
something that I did and I still came

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.630 
something that I did and I still came
down<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> pound<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> half<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.640> that's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
down like a pound and a half so that's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
down like a pound and a half so that's
something<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> probably<00:00:57.629> consider

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
something that you can probably consider

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
something that you can probably consider
when<00:00:58.620> some<00:00:58.859> days<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.280> did<00:00:59.820> say<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
when some days they did say on the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.020 
when some days they did say on the
internet<00:01:00.690> somewhere<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.550> course<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
internet somewhere that of course the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.140 
internet somewhere that of course the
less<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.420> drink<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:05.159> more<00:01:05.460> weight<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.939> lose

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
less you drink the more weight you lose

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.240 
less you drink the more weight you lose
so<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.010> into<00:01:08.220> consideration

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
so you can take that into consideration

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370 
so you can take that into consideration
if<00:01:08.909> you're<00:01:09.030> trying<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> gain<00:01:09.540> weight<00:01:09.570> drink

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
if you're trying to gain weight drink

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
if you're trying to gain weight drink
more<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> course<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> serve<00:01:11.909> has<00:01:12.180> tons

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
more because of course to serve has tons

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.920 
more because of course to serve has tons
of<00:01:12.659> calories<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.100> again<00:01:14.970> day<00:01:15.180> 5<00:01:15.509> i'm

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
of calories in it so again day 5 i'm

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.249 
of calories in it so again day 5 i'm
feeling<00:01:16.350> good<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.970> only<00:01:18.330> difference<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
feeling good the only difference is that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.380 
feeling good the only difference is that
again<00:01:19.950> i<00:01:19.979> can't<00:01:20.400> reiterate<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.060> enough

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
again i can't reiterate on this enough

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.230 
again i can't reiterate on this enough
