on the dirt problem distances rate times
time<00:00:07.330> distance<00:00:08.330> equals<00:00:08.690> rate<00:00:08.780> times<00:00:08.900> time<00:00:09.230> but

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
time distance equals rate times time but

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.259 
time distance equals rate times time but
in<00:00:09.980> this<00:00:10.099> case<00:00:10.340> we're<00:00:10.580> not<00:00:10.700> traveling<00:00:10.969> a

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
in this case we're not traveling a

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.759 
in this case we're not traveling a
distance<00:00:11.299> and<00:00:11.870> our<00:00:11.960> rate<00:00:12.170> is<00:00:12.200> in<00:00:12.469> a<00:00:12.530> rate<00:00:12.740> of

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
distance and our rate is in a rate of

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.770 
distance and our rate is in a rate of
moving<00:00:13.339> it's<00:00:13.790> a<00:00:13.910> rate<00:00:14.089> of<00:00:14.120> emptying<00:00:14.570> or

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
moving it's a rate of emptying or

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.750 
moving it's a rate of emptying or
filling<00:00:15.139> a<00:00:15.230> tank<00:00:15.500> and<00:00:15.889> we<00:00:16.010> want<00:00:16.189> to<00:00:16.309> fill<00:00:16.550> that

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
filling a tank and we want to fill that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.029 
filling a tank and we want to fill that
whole<00:00:17.029> tank<00:00:17.359> so<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:17.990> firm<00:00:18.289> that<00:00:18.500> we<00:00:18.650> use<00:00:18.859> is

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
whole tank so the firm that we use is

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.120 
whole tank so the firm that we use is
filling<00:00:19.519> the<00:00:19.640> tank<00:00:19.880> or<00:00:20.119> emptying<00:00:20.570> it<00:00:20.779> one<00:00:21.130> for

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
filling the tank or emptying it one for

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.890 
filling the tank or emptying it one for
filling<00:00:22.519> equals<00:00:23.000> rate<00:00:23.240> divided<00:00:23.599> at<00:00:23.869> times

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
filling equals rate divided at times

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.740 
filling equals rate divided at times
time<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:24.769> I<00:00:25.160> say<00:00:25.490> one<00:00:25.730> because<00:00:26.090> normally<00:00:26.480> to

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
time and I say one because normally to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.980 
time and I say one because normally to
fill<00:00:26.960> a<00:00:26.990> taken<00:00:27.410> when<00:00:27.560> I<00:00:27.590> get<00:00:27.830> it<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:28.789> 100%<00:00:29.420> or

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
fill a taken when I get it to 100% or

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.590 
fill a taken when I get it to 100% or
usually<00:00:30.410> expresses<00:00:30.830> one<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.000> if<00:00:32.240> you<00:00:32.300> want<00:00:32.420> to

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
usually expresses one so if you want to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.080 
usually expresses one so if you want to
find<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:32.930> time<00:00:33.200> to<00:00:33.440> fill<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.710> tank<00:00:33.890> it's<00:00:34.730> time

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
find the time to fill the tank it's time

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.050 
find the time to fill the tank it's time
equals<00:00:35.590> filming<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:36.680> which<00:00:37.070> again<00:00:37.250> we<00:00:37.760> want<00:00:37.970> to

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
equals filming it which again we want to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.040 
equals filming it which again we want to
get<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.420> one<00:00:38.690> 100%<00:00:39.680> divided<00:00:40.010> by<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.310> rate<00:00:41.050> well

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
get to one 100% divided by the rate well

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.490 
get to one 100% divided by the rate well
we<00:00:42.560> have<00:00:42.770> three<00:00:43.580> pipes<00:00:43.990> kind<00:00:44.990> of<00:00:45.110> working

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
we have three pipes kind of working

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.390 
we have three pipes kind of working
against<00:00:45.890> each<00:00:46.010> other

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
against each other

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.120 
against each other
any<00:00:46.820> fills<00:00:47.360> this<00:00:47.960> tank<00:00:48.350> in<00:00:48.650> five<00:00:48.920> hours

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
any fills this tank in five hours

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.550 
any fills this tank in five hours
therefore<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:49.850> every<00:00:50.120> hour<00:00:50.270> a<00:00:50.690> fills

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
therefore in every hour a fills

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.000 
therefore in every hour a fills
one-fifth<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.460> tank<00:00:52.700> 1/5<00:00:53.570> times<00:00:53.900> 5<00:00:54.320> will

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
one-fifth of the tank 1/5 times 5 will

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.530 
one-fifth of the tank 1/5 times 5 will
be<00:00:55.570> 100%<00:00:56.570> full<00:00:57.310> B<00:00:58.310> fills<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.880> tank<00:00:59.060> in<00:00:59.270> six

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
be 100% full B fills the tank in six

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.950 
be 100% full B fills the tank in six
hours

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
hours

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.800 
hours
so<00:01:00.410> therefore<00:01:00.590> per<00:01:01.070> hour<00:01:01.280> fills<00:01:01.880> 1/6<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.720> the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
so therefore per hour fills 1/6 of the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.670 
so therefore per hour fills 1/6 of the
tank<00:01:03.380> and<00:01:03.650> C<00:01:04.400> empties<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.540> tank<00:01:05.810> in<00:01:06.080> 12<00:01:06.350> hours

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
tank and C empties the tank in 12 hours

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.010 
tank and C empties the tank in 12 hours
therefore<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.520> if<00:01:07.670> these<00:01:07.790> 1/12<00:01:08.510> of<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.660> tank

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
therefore and if these 1/12 of the tank

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.060 
therefore and if these 1/12 of the tank
per<00:01:09.500> hour

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
per hour

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.220 
per hour
so<00:01:10.520> then<00:01:10.700> we<00:01:10.850> set<00:01:11.030> up<00:01:11.060> our<00:01:11.330> formula<00:01:11.750> we<00:01:11.930> want<00:01:12.050> to

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
so then we set up our formula we want to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.500 
so then we set up our formula we want to
get<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.500> whole<00:01:12.650> tank<00:01:12.980> full<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:13.760> one<00:01:14.030> we<00:01:14.330> went

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
get the whole tank full so one we went

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.170 
get the whole tank full so one we went
up<00:01:14.630> one<00:01:14.780> hundred<00:01:15.140> percent<00:01:15.290> full<00:01:16.030> divided<00:01:17.030> by

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
up one hundred percent full divided by

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.750 
up one hundred percent full divided by
the<00:01:17.240> rate<00:01:17.600> well<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:18.110> rate<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.620> a<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.490> B<00:01:19.610> are

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
the rate well the rate is a and B are

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.850 
the rate well the rate is a and B are
working<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.300> fill<00:01:20.510> it<00:01:20.690> so<00:01:20.720> it's<00:01:21.020> 1/5<00:01:22.060> plus<00:01:23.060> 1/6

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
working to fill it so it's 1/5 plus 1/6

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.010 
working to fill it so it's 1/5 plus 1/6
but<00:01:24.860> seeing<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.460> working<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.030> empty<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:26.840> we

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
but seeing is working to empty it so we

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.310 
but seeing is working to empty it so we
subtract<00:01:27.560> what<00:01:28.370> C<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.700> doing<00:01:29.030> -<00:01:29.270> 1/12<00:01:30.170> and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
subtract what C is doing - 1/12 and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.410 
subtract what C is doing - 1/12 and
that's<00:01:30.830> going<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.100> give<00:01:31.400> us<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.730> time<00:01:32.030> in

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
that's going to give us the time in

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.590 
that's going to give us the time in
hours<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:34.040> fill<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:34.490> tank<00:01:34.850> because<00:01:35.300> they

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
hours to fill this tank because they

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.270 
hours to fill this tank because they
need<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.750> be<00:01:35.900> working<00:01:36.110> together<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:36.890> can<00:01:37.070> see

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
need to be working together you can see

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.730 
need to be working together you can see
since<00:01:37.520> their<00:01:37.790> fractions<00:01:38.330> represent<00:01:38.960> actually

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
since their fractions represent actually

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.980 
since their fractions represent actually
larger<00:01:40.190> numbers<00:01:40.550> per<00:01:40.790> hour<00:01:40.940> they're<00:01:41.540> filling

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
larger numbers per hour they're filling

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.290 
larger numbers per hour they're filling
that<00:01:42.140> tank<00:01:42.470> faster<00:01:43.250> than<00:01:43.400> C<00:01:43.640> can<00:01:43.850> empty<00:01:44.120> that

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
that tank faster than C can empty that

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.640 
that tank faster than C can empty that
take<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.290> let's<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:45.740> do<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.010> math<00:01:46.220> it's<00:01:46.850> 1

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
take so let's just do the math it's 1

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.870 
take so let's just do the math it's 1
divided<00:01:48.650> by<00:01:48.680> moving<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.280> least<00:01:49.520> common

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
divided by moving the least common

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.180 
divided by moving the least common
denominator<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:50.720> will<00:01:50.870> use<00:01:53.350> 65<00:01:54.350> goes<00:01:54.590> into<00:01:54.800> 60

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
denominator we will use 65 goes into 60
