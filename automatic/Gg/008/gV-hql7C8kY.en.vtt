something<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.399> think<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.230> able<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.680> this

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
something I think to be able to get this

something I think to be able to get this
thing<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:39.350> 210<00:00:40.350> frames<00:00:40.710> per<00:00:40.980> second<00:00:41.370> which<00:00:41.730> we

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
thing at 210 frames per second which we

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.900 
thing at 210 frames per second which we
hope<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.210> able<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.480> utilize<00:00:43.100> by<00:00:44.100> using<00:00:44.640> some

so<00:00:49.170> anyway<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> wanted<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> quick<00:00:50.730> film<00:00:51.149> of

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so anyway I wanted to do a quick film of

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.069 
so anyway I wanted to do a quick film of
the<00:00:52.250> unboxing<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.670> were<00:00:53.820> how<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.600> purchased

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the unboxing as it were how we purchased

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.510 
the unboxing as it were how we purchased

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.689 
the xlm exc r100 from Casio
we<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> tabletop<00:01:00.949> tripod<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> course

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
we got a tabletop tripod and of course

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.759 
we got a tabletop tripod and of course
the<00:01:02.910> video<00:01:03.420> not<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> video<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.260> SD<00:01:04.589> card

never<00:01:12.220> actually<00:01:12.430> recorded<00:01:13.000> unboxing<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:13.720> I'm

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
never actually recorded unboxing so I'm

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.780 
never actually recorded unboxing so I'm
not<00:01:13.960> sure<00:01:14.140> exactly<00:01:14.440> what<00:01:14.800> if<00:01:15.430> there<00:01:15.640> is<00:01:15.760> a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
not sure exactly what if there is a

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.550 
not sure exactly what if there is a
protocol<00:01:16.300> for<00:01:16.360> such<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.750> thing<00:01:17.080> but<00:01:17.200> we<00:01:17.320> got<00:01:17.440> the

it's got a special end on it we'll find

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.960 
it's got a special end on it we'll find

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
out if we like that or not one can't

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.730 
out if we like that or not one can't
people<00:01:43.119> standardize<00:01:43.810> that's<00:01:44.170> what<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.380> want<00:01:44.649> to

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
people standardize that's what I want to

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.639 
people standardize that's what I want to
know<00:01:45.060> power<00:01:46.060> cord<00:01:46.420> this<00:01:46.570> thing<00:01:46.780> does<00:01:46.990> have<00:01:47.259> a

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
know power cord this thing does have a

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.340 
know power cord this thing does have a
lithium-ion<00:01:48.369> battery<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.420> we'll<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:50.050> charging

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
lithium-ion battery so we'll be charging

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.520 
lithium-ion battery so we'll be charging
it<00:01:50.649> regularly<00:01:51.280> we<00:01:52.210> may<00:01:52.509> end<00:01:52.720> up<00:01:52.840> purchasing<00:01:53.380> an

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
it regularly we may end up purchasing an

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.260 
it regularly we may end up purchasing an
additional<00:01:53.979> battery<00:01:54.190> if<00:01:54.550> we<00:01:54.729> find<00:01:54.970> out<00:01:55.119> that

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
additional battery if we find out that

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.650 
additional battery if we find out that
we<00:01:55.420> need<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:56.009> alright

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
we need it alright

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:06.230 
we need it alright
and<00:01:58.660> there's<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.020> camera

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.710 

alright<00:02:07.240> here<00:02:07.450> we<00:02:07.480> go

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
alright here we go

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.780 
alright here we go
we<00:02:07.930> got<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.229> camera<00:02:08.470> which<00:02:08.890> as<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.400> can<00:02:09.550> see

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
we got the camera which as you can see

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.380 
we got the camera which as you can see
from<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.119> tech<00:02:10.890> 360-degree<00:02:11.890> slide<00:02:12.700> panorama

from the tech 360-degree slide panorama

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.280 
from the tech 360-degree slide panorama
we<00:02:13.690> can<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:14.340> 12.1<00:02:15.340> megapixels<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.870> actually

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
we can do 12.1 megapixels it actually

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.270 
we can do 12.1 megapixels it actually
has<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.580> 12.5<00:02:18.580> optical<00:02:19.120> zoom<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.930> can<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.290> up<00:02:20.980> to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
has a 12.5 optical zoom you can do up to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.400 
has a 12.5 optical zoom you can do up to
we've<00:02:21.910> got<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> 24<00:02:22.510> millimeter<00:02:22.660> wide<00:02:23.080> angle

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
we've got a 24 millimeter wide angle

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.620 
we've got a 24 millimeter wide angle
lens<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.360> 3-inch<00:02:25.360> LCD<00:02:26.010> screen<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.480> back
