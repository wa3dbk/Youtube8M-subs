lot of these have to do with inspections
now<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.460> replacing<00:01:39.000> filters<00:01:39.290> everything

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
now and replacing filters everything

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
now and replacing filters everything
from<00:01:40.590> replacing<00:01:41.280> belts<00:01:41.850> before<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.329> say<00:01:42.570> oh

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
from replacing belts before they say oh

know much about cars that's a cabin
filter<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.390> good<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:45.750> not<00:01:46.259> good

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
filter that's not good that's not good

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.330

yeah<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.189> air<00:01:47.759> filters<00:01:48.360> obviously<00:01:48.899> uh

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
yeah and air filters obviously uh

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.230 
yeah and air filters obviously uh
replacing<00:01:50.340> these<00:01:50.490> things<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.060> things

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
replacing these things can do things

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.060 
replacing these things can do things
such<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.540> an<00:01:51.720> air<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> dirty<00:01:52.320> air<00:01:52.409> filter<00:01:52.560> number

one Rob's your car fuel mileage but

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.959 
one Rob's your car fuel mileage but
number<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.890> gets<00:01:56.100> small<00:01:56.340> tears<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
number two it gets small tears and it

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.609 
number two it gets small tears and it
allows<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> contaminants<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.110> engine

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
allows that contaminants in the engine

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.590 
allows that contaminants in the engine
which<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.670> putting<00:02:00.060> sand<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
which can be like putting sand in a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.690 
which can be like putting sand in a
motor<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.860> where<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> internal

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
motor so it will where the internal

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.980 
motor so it will where the internal
parts<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> motor<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:03.689> why<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
parts of the motor that's why it's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.209 
parts of the motor that's why it's
important<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.500> stay<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.829> top<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.040> these

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
important to stay on top of these

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.969 
important to stay on top of these

for<00:02:24.129> some<00:02:24.280> specific<00:02:24.790> reason<00:02:25.000> there<00:02:25.120> are

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
for some specific reason there are

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.509 
for some specific reason there are
certain<00:02:25.720> cases<00:02:25.930> such<00:02:26.620> as<00:02:26.799> with<00:02:26.950> transmission

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
certain cases such as with transmission

certain cases such as with transmission
services<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.150> we<00:02:28.269> recommend<00:02:28.690> them<00:02:28.810> earlier

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
services that we recommend them earlier

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.990 
services that we recommend them earlier
the<00:02:29.530> reason<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.920> do<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.129> is<00:02:30.430> we<00:02:30.549> know<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.849> will

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
the reason we do that is we know it will

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.940 
the reason we do that is we know it will
extend<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.569> life<00:02:31.599> of<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.019> transmission<00:02:32.680> it's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
extend the life of the transmission it's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.680 
extend the life of the transmission it's
the<00:02:33.040> only<00:02:33.159> thing<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.370> do<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.239> if<00:02:34.510> they

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the only thing you do to it so if they

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.240 
the only thing you do to it so if they
had<00:02:34.930> there's<00:02:35.140> good<00:02:35.379> reasoning<00:02:35.829> behind<00:02:35.980> that

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
had there's good reasoning behind that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.309 
had there's good reasoning behind that
there<00:02:36.459> are<00:02:36.579> some<00:02:36.879> reasons<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.390> not<00:02:37.720> follow<00:02:38.049> or

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
there are some reasons to not follow or

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.309 
there are some reasons to not follow or
do<00:02:38.530> things<00:02:38.709> earlier<00:02:39.220> but<00:02:39.730> other<00:02:39.879> than<00:02:40.090> that

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
do things earlier but other than that

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.330 
do things earlier but other than that
regular<00:02:41.319> service<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.859> maintenance<00:02:42.129> such<00:02:42.310> as
