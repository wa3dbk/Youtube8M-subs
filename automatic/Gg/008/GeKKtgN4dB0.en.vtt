00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.240 

impossible<00:00:32.520> yet<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:34.320> far<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.739> deity

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
impossible yet but as far as a deity

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.729 
impossible yet but as far as a deity
like<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.540> taught<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.840> school<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.230> find<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
like I was taught in school I find it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.619 
like I was taught in school I find it
virtually<00:00:38.129> impossible<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.820> believe<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.390> it's

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
virtually impossible to believe and it's

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.090 
virtually impossible to believe and it's
it's<00:00:39.809> harder<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.230> than<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.559> last<00:00:40.890> year

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
it's harder now than it was last year

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.560 
it's harder now than it was last year
and<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.430> sure<00:00:41.579> it'll<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.790> harder<00:00:42.180> next<00:00:42.450> year

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and I'm sure it'll be harder next year

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.690 
and I'm sure it'll be harder next year
you<00:00:42.780> know<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.649> thing<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.040> you're<00:00:44.520> hitting

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

here<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.559> happy<00:00:46.829> when<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.160> finally

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
here that I was so happy when I finally

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.500 
here that I was so happy when I finally
read<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:49.160> article<00:00:50.160> by<00:00:50.430> Hitchens<00:00:50.910> which

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
read an article by Hitchens which

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.910 
read an article by Hitchens which
actually<00:00:51.989> addresses<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:52.860> I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
actually addresses this because I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.600 
actually addresses this because I
thought<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.370> alone<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:54.079> my<00:00:55.079> mom<00:00:55.320> became<00:00:56.010> an

there well the reason I do we're not
even<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.080> belief<00:03:39.410> anymore<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.890> reason<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.190> now

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
even the belief anymore the reason I now

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.940 
even the belief anymore the reason I now
I<00:03:40.430> hope<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.880> somehow<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.420> know<00:03:41.950> quantum

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
I hope that somehow is you know quantum

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.890 
I hope that somehow is you know quantum
physics<00:03:43.400> figures<00:03:43.760> out<00:03:43.970> how<00:03:44.150> we<00:03:44.209> continue<00:03:44.810> to

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
physics figures out how we continue to

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.050 
physics figures out how we continue to
exist<00:03:45.230> I'm<00:03:45.380> hoping<00:03:45.860> that's<00:03:46.400> all<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.850> comes

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
exist I'm hoping that's all it comes

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.449 
exist I'm hoping that's all it comes
down<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.780> just<00:03:48.200> don't<00:03:48.410> want<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.620> not<00:03:48.799> exist

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
down to I just don't want to not exist

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.170 
down to I just don't want to not exist
I<00:03:49.489> like<00:03:50.120> existing<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.890> I'm<00:03:52.280> afraid<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:53.030> that

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
I like existing and I'm afraid of that

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.940 
I like existing and I'm afraid of that
ending<00:03:53.810> even<00:03:54.200> though<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.470> don't<00:03:54.590> know<00:03:54.769> what's

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
ending even though you don't know what's

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.470 
ending even though you don't know what's
ending<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.820> intellectually

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480
