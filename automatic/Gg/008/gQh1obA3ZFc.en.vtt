the no-huddle maybe he saw something not
in<00:04:38.640> C<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:39.810> is<00:04:39.960> gonna<00:04:40.080> be<00:04:40.260> one<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.500> those

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
in C and this is gonna be one of those

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.190 
in C and this is gonna be one of those
plays<00:04:40.950> where<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.310> receiver<00:04:41.760> really<00:04:42.570> bails

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
plays where the receiver really bails

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.050 
plays where the receiver really bails
them<00:04:43.380> out<00:04:43.590> they<00:04:44.130> don't<00:04:44.310> get<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.580> first<00:04:44.790> here

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
them out they don't get the first here

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.760 
them out they don't get the first here
but<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.360> puts<00:04:45.750> him<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.050> field<00:04:46.410> goal<00:04:46.620> position

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
but it puts him in field goal position

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.730 
but it puts him in field goal position
so<00:04:47.160> they<00:04:47.280> don't<00:04:47.430> go<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.760> half<00:04:47.910> with<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.180> 24<00:04:48.810> 0

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
so they don't go to the half with a 24 0

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.220 
so they don't go to the half with a 24 0
lead<00:04:50.480> little<00:04:51.480> bit<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.660> precision<00:04:52.080> passing

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
lead little bit of precision passing

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.080

of<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.370> game<00:05:14.520> this<00:05:14.700> would<00:05:14.880> be<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.060> third

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
of the game this would be the third

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.330 
of the game this would be the third
quarter<00:05:15.870> going<00:05:16.560> with<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.770> screen<00:05:17.070> right<00:05:17.310> here

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
quarter going with the screen right here

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.770

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
down the sideline look like he probably

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.010

third<00:05:41.160> quarter<00:05:41.640> I<00:05:41.850> mean<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.930> don't<00:05:43.290> know<00:05:43.470> how

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
third quarter I mean I don't know how

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.870

this<00:05:43.680> team<00:05:43.890> made<00:05:44.100> it<00:05:44.190> to<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.400> second<00:05:44.700> round

but<00:05:45.090> it's<00:05:45.330> pretty<00:05:45.600> safe<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:45.840> say<00:05:46.110> they<00:05:46.230> won't

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
but it's pretty safe to say they won't

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.710 
but it's pretty safe to say they won't
make<00:05:46.650> it<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.890> the<00:05:46.980> third<00:05:47.220> round<00:05:47.420> not<00:05:48.420> running
