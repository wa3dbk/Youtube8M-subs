price<00:02:18.210> point<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.900> believe<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.770> dose<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.100> color

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
price point I believe the dose of color

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.500 
price point I believe the dose of color
one<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.760> $18<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.990> was<00:02:22.410> under<00:02:22.770> $5<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.760> to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
one is $18 and this was under $5 and to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.440 
one is $18 and this was under $5 and to
me<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> great<00:02:25.290> Dube<00:02:25.850> yes<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.150> may<00:02:27.270> be<00:02:27.330> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
me it is a great Dube yes it may be a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.060 
me it is a great Dube yes it may be a
little<00:02:27.600> bit<00:02:27.810> drawing<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.440> don't<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:28.860> know

little bit drawing I don't really know

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.830 
little bit drawing I don't really know
what<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> consistency<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.450> dose<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
what the consistency of the dose of

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.890 
what the consistency of the dose of
color<00:02:31.050> one<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.880> but<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.030> believe<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.570> this<00:02:33.690> is

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
color one is but I believe that this is
