00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
it and I recorded this last night I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.840 
it and I recorded this last night I
honestly<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.170> recorded<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.770> 15<00:00:20.220> hours<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
honestly I recorded like 15 hours of the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.290 
honestly I recorded like 15 hours of the
first<00:00:21.090> 15<00:00:21.480> hours<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.080> decided<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.300> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
first 15 hours and then decided that the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.359 
first 15 hours and then decided that the
game<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:24.660> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.050> very<00:00:25.289> very<00:00:25.619> long<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
game was going to be very very long and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.820 
game was going to be very very long and
probably<00:00:27.230> nothing<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.439> game<00:00:28.650> you're

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
probably nothing in this game you're

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.080 
probably nothing in this game you're
gonna<00:00:28.949> want<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> see<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.730> if<00:00:29.820> there<00:00:30.000> is

content from that i don't think it's a
very<00:02:41.490> long<00:02:41.790> campaign<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.320> i'm
