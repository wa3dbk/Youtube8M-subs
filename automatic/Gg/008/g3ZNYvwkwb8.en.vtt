00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
but they needed to be brought to their

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.940 
but they needed to be brought to their
attention<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:25.920> responsibility

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
attention so it's your responsibility

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.929 
attention so it's your responsibility
really<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.869> parent<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> can

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
really as the parent to do what you can

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.210 
really as the parent to do what you can
to<00:01:29.970> try<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.360> resolve<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> school

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
to try and resolve it with the school

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
to try and resolve it with the school
and<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:32.579> instinct<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.720> there

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and the first instinct is to go in there

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
and the first instinct is to go in there
and<00:01:34.020> sort<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:35.040> them<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.119> that's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and sort out for them but that's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.630 
and sort out for them but that's
actually<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:37.049> always<00:01:37.500> helpful<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.400> very

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
actually not always helpful if it's very

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.510 
actually not always helpful if it's very
serious<00:01:39.090> yes<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.340> if

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
serious yes you have to do that but if

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
serious yes you have to do that but if
it's<00:01:41.729> less<00:01:42.240> serious<00:01:42.840> try<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> child

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it's less serious try to get the child

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.600 
it's less serious try to get the child
to<00:01:44.070> sort<00:01:44.369> out<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> failed<00:01:49.100> we<00:01:50.100> would<00:01:50.250> advise

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to sort out and failed we would advise

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.499 
to sort out and failed we would advise
