inversion 0.25 yes the new version is
out<00:00:08.570> with<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.719> new<00:00:09.840> space<00:00:10.110> plane<00:00:10.410> parts<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.040> I

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
out with the new space plane parts and I

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.660 
out with the new space plane parts and I
love<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.740> I've<00:00:13.740> been<00:00:13.980> waiting<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:14.490> new

love it I've been waiting for some new
parts<00:00:14.940> place<00:00:15.330> planes<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.929> these<00:00:16.109> are

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
parts place planes and these are

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.189 
parts place planes and these are
gorgeous<00:00:17.960> really<00:00:18.960> not<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.500> nice<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> I

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
gorgeous really not really nice so I

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.710 
gorgeous really not really nice so I
build<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.560> VTOL<00:00:26.220> plane<00:00:26.490> using<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.630> new

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
build a little VTOL plane using the new

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.749 
build a little VTOL plane using the new
parts<00:00:28.109> using<00:00:28.500> new<00:00:28.890> cargo<00:00:29.670> bay<00:00:29.970> doors<00:00:31.759> which

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
parts using new cargo bay doors which

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.900 
parts using new cargo bay doors which
I'll<00:00:32.940> sweet<00:00:33.300> embrace<00:00:36.290> let's<00:00:37.290> try<00:00:37.530> them<00:00:37.770> out

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.500 

turn<00:00:41.910> off<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.059> brakes<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:43.789> bound<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.030> cart<00:00:45.420> away

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
turn off the brakes I bound to cart away

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.479 
turn off the brakes I bound to cart away
doors<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.140> same<00:00:46.350> button<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.980> star<00:00:47.280> see

doors to the same button with star see

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
doors to the same button with star see
details<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.140> turning<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> vehicle<00:00:49.530> engine

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
details and turning the vehicle engine

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.330 
details and turning the vehicle engine
on<00:00:50.000> over<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> cargo<00:00:51.449> bay<00:00:51.480> doors<00:00:52.250> turning<00:00:53.250> them

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
on over to cargo bay doors turning them

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
on over to cargo bay doors turning them
off<00:00:53.520> clothes<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:55.500> easy<00:00:55.800> very

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
off clothes and get really easy very

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.149 
off clothes and get really easy very
nice<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> troubled<00:00:59.750> gears<00:01:00.750> up

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.190 

the<00:01:05.159> new<00:01:05.309> carpet<00:01:06.090> doesn't<00:01:06.300> have<00:01:06.600> landing<00:01:06.990> here

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the new carpet doesn't have landing here

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.030 
the new carpet doesn't have landing here
I<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.380> kept<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.159> there<00:01:09.320> usually<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.240 

take<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.690> Forgotten<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.290> clipped<00:01:17.010> in

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
take all the Forgotten I I clipped in

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
take all the Forgotten I I clipped in
there<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:24.420> plane<00:01:24.659> has<00:01:24.930> handles<00:01:25.590> pretty<00:01:25.770> well

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
there that plane has handles pretty well

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.899 
there that plane has handles pretty well
the<00:01:26.970> new<00:01:27.119> parts<00:01:27.479> are<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:29.729> can

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the new parts are pretty good you can

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.120 
the new parts are pretty good you can
gain<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.149> pretty<00:01:30.899> high<00:01:31.050> speeds<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> very<00:01:31.950> low

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
gain a pretty high speeds at a very low

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.540 
gain a pretty high speeds at a very low
altitude<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.479> much<00:01:33.780> faster<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.680> with

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
altitude you can go much faster and with

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.880 
altitude you can go much faster and with
the<00:01:35.789> old<00:01:35.880> parts<00:01:36.300> so<00:01:37.050> i<00:01:37.369> really<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.789> i

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
the old parts so i really like that i

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.499 
the old parts so i really like that i
can<00:01:40.890> make<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> plane<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.640> gets<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.300> Mach

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
can make a plane that gets the Mach

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.660 
can make a plane that gets the Mach
effect<00:01:42.539> at<00:01:43.170> about<00:01:43.550> 100<00:01:44.550> meters<00:01:46.640> which<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
effect at about 100 meters which is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.450 
effect at about 100 meters which is
ridiculous<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:49.020> also<00:01:49.649> cool<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.190> should<00:01:53.340> be

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
ridiculous but also cool so we should be

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.770 
ridiculous but also cool so we should be
able<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.090> make<00:01:54.210> something<00:01:54.660> so<00:01:55.110> sweet<00:01:55.429> SSTL

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
able to make something so sweet SSTL

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.540 
able to make something so sweet SSTL
which<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.050> go<00:01:58.229> into<00:01:58.410> orbit<00:01:59.060> very<00:02:00.060> easily

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
which you can go into orbit very easily

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.050 
which you can go into orbit very easily
let's<00:02:02.550> see<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.880> i<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.179> get<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.390> food<00:02:04.140> gates

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
let's see if i can get this food gates

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.589 
let's see if i can get this food gates
but<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:06.810> first<00:02:07.049> ride<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:08.119> really<00:02:09.119> wrecked

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
but my first ride is I really wrecked

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.940 
but my first ride is I really wrecked
the<00:02:09.720> plane<00:02:09.959> once<00:02:10.520> very<00:02:11.520> nice<00:02:12.860> tight<00:02:13.860> fit<00:02:15.950> well

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the plane once very nice tight fit well

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.970 
the plane once very nice tight fit well
let's<00:02:17.160> go<00:02:17.310> horizontality<00:02:18.090> Hephaestus<00:02:18.900> big

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.010 

let's<00:02:22.980> meet<00:02:23.360> tonight's<00:02:24.360> little<00:02:24.800> engine

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.150 

so<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.290> see<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:33.080> know<00:02:34.080> about<00:02:34.500> field

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
so as you can see I know about field

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.860 
so as you can see I know about field
meters<00:02:35.640> four<00:02:35.940> meters<00:02:36.470> maybe<00:02:37.470> bitty<00:02:38.870> 500

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
meters four meters maybe bitty 500

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.590 
meters four meters maybe bitty 500
meters<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.410> we<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.650> reach<00:02:40.800> about<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.600> don't

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
meters and we can reach about I don't

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.590 
meters and we can reach about I don't
know<00:02:42.720> 200

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:58.000 

30<00:02:46.290> meters<00:02:46.950> per<00:02:47.070> second<00:02:47.630> it's<00:02:48.680> pretty<00:02:49.680> fast

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.050 

if<00:02:58.099> you<00:02:58.220> go<00:02:58.580> up

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.720 

all<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.780> difference

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:15.410 

we'll<00:03:07.909> pretty<00:03:08.330> fast

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.809 

this<00:03:15.990> plane<00:03:16.230> doesn't<00:03:16.470> need<00:03:16.770> as<00:03:17.010> he<00:03:17.250> has<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.520> fly

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
this plane doesn't need as he has to fly

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:26.039 
this plane doesn't need as he has to fly
but<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.450> easy<00:03:19.340> simple<00:03:20.340> stable<00:03:21.000> flight

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.430 

well<00:03:27.049> about<00:03:27.349> 7,000<00:03:28.310> meters<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.090> few

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
well about 7,000 meters and a few

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.650 
well about 7,000 meters and a few
seconds

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.130 

did<00:03:33.500> griffis

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.649 

see<00:03:37.010> if<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.490> do<00:03:37.700> know<00:03:37.880> how<00:03:38.510> fast<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:38.960> go

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:49.330 

thousands<00:03:43.980> ten<00:03:44.980> thousands<00:03:45.430> risk

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.440 

almost<00:03:51.470> 500

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
almost 500

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.730 
almost 500

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
capable very low to the ground which I

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.680 
capable very low to the ground which I
think<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.140> looks<00:04:27.320> nicely<00:04:27.590> which<00:04:28.070> is<00:04:28.220> cool<00:04:28.690> if
