 it turned out 3 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.739
 from tomasse 4 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.239

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.990
 esper 5 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.720
 and the two main options 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.169
 are horses at 5 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.650
 still at 3 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.390
 I just won the triumph 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.409
 and completing development 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.409
 same as years ago 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.649

 roque just lost set 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.070
 then the 2 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 white prepared from 3 to 4 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.170
 Bishop the 6th 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.180
 on day 4 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.150
 It is risky if they played with the bis supporters will resume 3 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.650
 horse I took 4 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.900
 due to risk 3 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.870
 and the king 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 gets stuck in the center of the girl and 7 two days without a corregedor 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.920
 6 5 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.210
 this b5 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.820
 I solved the rock 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.880
 but after lane on day 7 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640
 however on day 7 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.130
 horses to 5 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.640
 so where 5 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.510
 ps3 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.590
 kavala 6 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.050
 we dispute c5 the advantage bollinger bands 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.159
 but at the start and qualified at the start I thought he was 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 in 2005 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 ended up in part 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.650
 in the fall of Catholics 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 in 2008 in Germany after discussing three 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.280
 biz plate 5 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.290
 nailing horse 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 and preparing the 5 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.450
 White plays 5 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.889
 avoiding the American threat cavallo of 5k back on day 5 if everything works out 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.500
 also at 3 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.060
 chronicle and who had previously played sphinx 6 counted ball today 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.559
 here followed 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.869
 torri is the 8 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.159
 horse 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.829
 in another heading 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.549
 I'm glad 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.549
 I promised player his eighth tie 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.259
 I am 47 years old 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.629
 here civilians 16 seen on day 6 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.359
 taking the path is also a possibility 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:35.129
 since the uk has problems but what I say those get weak 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.319
 omar toral we watched 16 minutes 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.199
 cavo of 3 016 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.729
 horse taking 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.029

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.299
 b3 duarte gomes 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.589
 two days and eight bishops 3 we'll have three two days your name 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.239
 a promoter at e3 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.939
 it's totally sad 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.260
 the end is a little better with the white bishop's well 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.529
 because my performances superior to the rival - by his disposed call of mol 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.649
 the chain of poach marked marked central strikes 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.299
 it gets very active after day 6 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.259
 this 16 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.299
 25 I practice to the king 16 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.369
 h3c stf 2016 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.239
 to have two English clubs 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.139
 I lie down 5 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.139
 in desperation passed the ball more active home 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.329
 d4 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.569
 two c4 two-tone and 4 c4 defeats 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.049
 white can try 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.049
 win by 32 which is a recommendation 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.419
 the types 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.019
 but playing because its use 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.019
 after twisting the 8 g4 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.269
 watch 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.829

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.959
 c3 supporters day 7 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.339
 when there is any chance of victory they are bernardo 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.659
 for example quoted and c4 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.789
 had three sectors then four 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.229
 two of c3 pluriel 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.639
 two of these seven 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.639
 Day 8 Twisted 8 It's seven 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.169
 these two 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.389
 tourism to 4 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.959

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.689
 doherty the manager 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.169
 made 16 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.529
 2008 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.870
 in the end try to value 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.300
 the top 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.249
 after the break 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.379
 Tokyo 16 but the complicated planet 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.909
 no return is guaranteed 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.569
 the previous year and 3 which should particularly after falling to 11 5 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.649
 we disputed c5 tourer toulouse and 108 to 103 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.279
 two promoters will remember part 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.509
