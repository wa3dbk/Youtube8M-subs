village in this video clip we will be

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.820 
village in this video clip we will be
attaching<00:00:09.650> the<00:00:10.490> chain<00:00:10.820> on<00:00:11.260> the<00:00:12.260> original

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
attaching the chain on the original

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.670 
attaching the chain on the original
drawing<00:00:13.250> for<00:00:13.850> this<00:00:14.030> project<00:00:14.330> that<00:00:14.930> we<00:00:15.199> modeled

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
drawing for this project that we modeled

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.120 
drawing for this project that we modeled
it<00:00:15.830> after<00:00:15.980> we<00:00:16.910> have<00:00:17.150> this<00:00:17.420> cross<00:00:18.050> brace<00:00:18.560> piece

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
it after we have this cross brace piece

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.870 
it after we have this cross brace piece
that<00:00:20.000> helps<00:00:20.300> keep<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.259> from<00:00:21.529> opening<00:00:22.099> up<00:00:22.669> too

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
that helps keep it from opening up too

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.540 
that helps keep it from opening up too
far<00:00:23.179> and<00:00:23.390> just<00:00:23.449> falling<00:00:23.990> flat<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.220> what<00:00:25.400> we're

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
far and just falling flat so what we're

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.890 
far and just falling flat so what we're
going<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:25.699> do<00:00:25.910> is<00:00:26.089> we're<00:00:26.269> actually<00:00:26.419> going<00:00:26.779> to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
going to do is we're actually going to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.630 
going to do is we're actually going to
install<00:00:27.439> a<00:00:27.499> chain<00:00:28.189> that<00:00:28.820> goes<00:00:29.089> across<00:00:29.269> here<00:00:29.929> I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
install a chain that goes across here I

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.750 
install a chain that goes across here I
purchased<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.880> packaged<00:00:32.480> chain<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.440> 10<00:00:34.310> feet<00:00:34.610> in

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
purchased a packaged chain of 10 feet in

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.970 
purchased a packaged chain of 10 feet in
length<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.420> what<00:00:36.079> I'm<00:00:36.170> going<00:00:36.289> to<00:00:36.410> do<00:00:36.559> is<00:00:36.770> just

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
length and what I'm going to do is just

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.670 
length and what I'm going to do is just
cut<00:00:37.280> this<00:00:37.489> down<00:00:37.789> and<00:00:38.149> having<00:00:39.079> that<00:00:39.170> silver

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
cut this down and having that silver

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.040 
cut this down and having that silver
chain<00:00:40.010> will<00:00:40.699> help<00:00:41.030> keep<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:41.539> from<00:00:41.719> sliding

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
chain will help keep it from sliding

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.760 
chain will help keep it from sliding
apart<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:42.829> it'll<00:00:43.399> match<00:00:43.579> those<00:00:43.910> hinges<00:00:44.770> going

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
apart and it'll match those hinges going

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.979 
apart and it'll match those hinges going
back<00:00:45.949> to<00:00:46.190> our<00:00:46.309> drawing<00:00:46.520> we<00:00:47.090> want<00:00:47.329> our<00:00:47.539> open

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
back to our drawing we want our open

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.849 
back to our drawing we want our open
size<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.890> be<00:00:49.010> 29<00:00:49.670> inches<00:00:50.120> I<00:00:50.590> went<00:00:51.590> ahead<00:00:51.649> and

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
size to be 29 inches I went ahead and

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.049 
size to be 29 inches I went ahead and
laid<00:00:52.460> my<00:00:52.789> easel<00:00:53.329> on<00:00:53.570> its<00:00:54.140> side<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:54.940> open<00:00:55.940> up

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
laid my easel on its side and open up

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.240 
laid my easel on its side and open up
the<00:00:56.239> legs<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:57.440> 29<00:00:58.399> inches<00:00:59.679> I'm<00:01:00.679> gonna<00:01:00.890> have<00:01:01.100> my

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
the legs to 29 inches I'm gonna have my

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.180 
the legs to 29 inches I'm gonna have my
chain<00:01:01.609> located<00:01:02.420> right<00:01:03.350> about<00:01:03.710> where<00:01:03.980> those

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
chain located right about where those

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.690 
chain located right about where those
cross<00:01:04.640> braces<00:01:05.360> are<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.990> backside<00:01:06.610> so<00:01:07.610> I'm

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
cross braces are on the backside so I'm

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.000 
cross braces are on the backside so I'm
going<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.910> go<00:01:08.060> ahead<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.570> measure<00:01:09.010> the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
going to go ahead and measure the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.430 
going to go ahead and measure the
distance<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.730> that<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.440> that<00:01:12.440> is<00:01:12.650> 19<00:01:13.340> inches

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
distance of that and that is 19 inches

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.660 
distance of that and that is 19 inches
so<00:01:15.440> I'm<00:01:15.530> going<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.710> go<00:01:15.860> ahead<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.220> cut<00:01:16.490> off

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
so I'm going to go ahead and cut off

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.040 
so I'm going to go ahead and cut off
about<00:01:17.480> 19<00:01:18.140> inches<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.920> chain<00:01:22.300> I'm<00:01:23.300> going<00:01:23.840> to

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
about 19 inches of chain I'm going to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.700 
about 19 inches of chain I'm going to
use<00:01:24.320> my<00:01:24.650> new<00:01:25.360> cut<00:01:26.360> piece<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.810> chain<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.470> measure

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
use my new cut piece of chain to measure

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.220 
use my new cut piece of chain to measure
a<00:01:27.860> second<00:01:28.460> piece<00:01:28.730> of<00:01:28.910> chain<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.870> have<00:01:30.110> the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
a second piece of chain so I have the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:37.360 
a second piece of chain so I have the
same<00:01:30.530> number<00:01:30.980> of<00:01:31.010> links<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:35.710> install<00:01:36.710> my<00:01:37.010> chain

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
same number of links to install my chain

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.890 
same number of links to install my chain
I'm<00:01:37.670> going<00:01:37.730> to<00:01:38.000> go<00:01:38.120> ahead<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.510> drill<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.810> pilot

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
I'm going to go ahead and drill a pilot

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.630 
I'm going to go ahead and drill a pilot
hole<00:01:39.350> in<00:01:39.770> my<00:01:40.550> desired<00:01:41.000> location

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.450 

and<00:01:47.200> then<00:01:48.200> using<00:01:48.650> a<00:01:49.090> thin<00:01:50.090> screw<00:01:50.830> I'm<00:01:51.830> going<00:01:52.400> to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
and then using a thin screw I'm going to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.160 
and then using a thin screw I'm going to
go<00:01:52.550> ahead<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.850> screw<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.450> through<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
go ahead and screw that through the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:12.370 
go ahead and screw that through the
chain<00:02:10.150> but<00:02:11.150> I'm<00:02:11.270> not<00:02:11.420> going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.720> screw<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.170> in

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
chain but I'm not going to screw that in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.110 
chain but I'm not going to screw that in
all<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.860> way<00:02:12.980> because<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.640> still<00:02:13.880> need<00:02:14.090> that

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
all the way because I still need that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.070 
all the way because I still need that
chain<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.630> rotate<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> little<00:02:15.380> bit<00:02:17.050> go<00:02:18.050> ahead

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
chain to rotate a little bit go ahead

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.740 
chain to rotate a little bit go ahead
and<00:02:18.440> continue<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:18.980> same<00:02:19.340> procedure<00:02:19.880> for<00:02:20.300> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and continue that same procedure for the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.850 
and continue that same procedure for the
other<00:02:20.959> side<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.850> then<00:02:22.850> when<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.239> test<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.660> out

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
other side and then when you test it out

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.350 
other side and then when you test it out
when<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:24.980> reach<00:02:25.250> your<00:02:25.280> twenty<00:02:25.910> nine<00:02:26.090> inch

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
when you reach your twenty nine inch

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.030 
when you reach your twenty nine inch
opening<00:02:26.900> your<00:02:27.260> chain<00:02:27.620> should<00:02:28.160> be<00:02:28.220> pretty<00:02:28.670> firm
