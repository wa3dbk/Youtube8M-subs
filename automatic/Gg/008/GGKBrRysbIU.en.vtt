00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really interesting actually though they

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
really interesting actually though they
appear<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.610> screen<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.240> start<00:02:00.540> floating

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
appear on screen and start floating

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.010 
appear on screen and start floating
around<00:02:00.990> sort<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.619> randomly<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.360> oh<00:02:03.360> isn't<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
around sort of randomly and oh isn't a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.459 
around sort of randomly and oh isn't a
sister<00:02:04.290> okay<00:02:04.469> hang<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:05.509> yeah<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
sister okay hang on yeah that's the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.970 
sister okay hang on yeah that's the
advance<00:02:08.039> wars

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.380 

so<00:02:12.980> smash<00:02:13.430> balls<00:02:13.670> basically<00:02:14.060> appear<00:02:14.300> on

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
so smash balls basically appear on

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.580 
so smash balls basically appear on
screen<00:02:14.510> hopefully<00:02:14.990> they'll<00:02:15.110> be<00:02:15.200> one<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.440> here

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.820 
a lot of buttons and the Wii Remote
really<00:03:38.750> really<00:03:38.930> simplifies<00:03:39.380> things<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
really really simplifies things and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.320 
really really simplifies things and
actually<00:03:40.100> in<00:03:40.220> my<00:03:40.340> mind<00:03:40.519> is<00:03:40.610> sort<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.090> takes

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
actually in my mind is sort of it takes

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.270 
actually in my mind is sort of it takes
me<00:03:41.450> back<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.660> NES<00:03:42.440> days<00:03:42.650> because<00:03:42.950> you're<00:03:43.070> doing

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
me back to NES days because you're doing

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.460 
me back to NES days because you're doing
a<00:03:43.370> lot<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.640> similar<00:03:43.850> movements<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:45.320> move

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
a lot of the similar movements you move

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.400 
a lot of the similar movements you move
around<00:03:45.590> with<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.370> d-pad<00:03:46.930> double<00:03:47.930> tap<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.110> dash

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
around with the d-pad double tap to dash

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.500 
around with the d-pad double tap to dash
so<00:03:48.920> again<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:49.820> sort<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.060> similar<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.390> old

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
so again it's sort of similar to old

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.979 
so again it's sort of similar to old
school<00:03:50.780> fighters<00:03:51.280> attack<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.459> to<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.989> special

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
school fighters attack is to a special

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.660 
school fighters attack is to a special
attack<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.470> one<00:03:54.709> your<00:03:55.160> shield<00:03:55.400> button<00:03:55.610> is

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
attack is one your shield button is

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.610 
attack is one your shield button is
actually<00:03:55.970> under<00:03:56.060> here<00:03:56.330> so<00:03:57.200> that's<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.410> thing

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
actually under here so that's the thing

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.380 
actually under here so that's the thing
that's<00:03:57.709> going<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:57.950> take<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.970> most<00:03:59.120> getting

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
that's going to take the most getting

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.520 
that's going to take the most getting
