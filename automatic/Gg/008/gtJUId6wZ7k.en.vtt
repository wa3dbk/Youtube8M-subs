definition of three that you gave was

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.310 
definition of three that you gave was
probably<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.100> most<00:02:02.280> out<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.450> waved<00:02:04.140> your

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
supernatural I hate to say it but I

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.180 
supernatural I hate to say it but I
might<00:03:36.600> actually<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:37.380> more<00:03:37.620> objective<00:03:37.799> than

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
might actually be more objective than

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.759
