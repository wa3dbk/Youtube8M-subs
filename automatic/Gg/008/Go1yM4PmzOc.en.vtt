00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
for the touchpad here in the corner so

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.510 
for the touchpad here in the corner so
kind<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.559> depending<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:46.920> how<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.160> use<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
kind of depending on how you use the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.850 
kind of depending on how you use the
computer<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.120> may<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> best<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.680> you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
computer it may not be the best as you

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
computer it may not be the best as you
may<00:00:50.070> accidentally<00:00:50.550> turn<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> off<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
may accidentally turn it on and off and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660 
may accidentally turn it on and off and
this<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.410> kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> user<00:00:52.980> preference<00:00:53.460> type

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this is kind of a user preference type

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.260 
this is kind of a user preference type
thing<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> overall<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> build<00:00:56.699> quality<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
thing so overall the build quality and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.610 
thing so overall the build quality and
just<00:00:57.329> general<00:00:57.870> feel<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> computer<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
just general feel of the computer is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
just general feel of the computer is
pretty<00:00:58.920> good<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.420> nothing<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> rave<00:01:00.629> about

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
pretty good it's nothing to rave about

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.650 
pretty good it's nothing to rave about
I'd<00:01:01.230> say<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.710> both<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> Z<00:01:02.940> book<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> pro

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
I'd say the both of Z book and the pro

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.060 
I'd say the both of Z book and the pro
book<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.280> much<00:01:05.280> better<00:01:05.519> builds<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
book have much better builds the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.260 
book have much better builds the
chameleon<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.610> comes<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> fact

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
chameleon just comes down to the fact

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
chameleon just comes down to the fact
that<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.200> bottom<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.650> solid<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.640> bottom

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that the bottom is solid on the bottom

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.219 
that the bottom is solid on the bottom
on<00:01:11.939> these<00:01:12.119> two<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.170> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
on these two and here it's kind of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
on these two and here it's kind of
divided<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.250> grid<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.000> few

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
divided into this grid of a few

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.200 
divided into this grid of a few
different<00:01:15.720> pieces<00:01:16.759> other<00:01:17.759> things<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.119> like

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
different pieces other things I do like

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.520 
different pieces other things I do like
about<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.570> computer<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.200> not<00:01:19.320> really

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
about this computer is it's not really

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.080 
about this computer is it's not really
an<00:01:19.680> ultrabook<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.340> doesn't<00:01:20.610> sacrifice

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
an ultrabook so it doesn't sacrifice

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
an ultrabook so it doesn't sacrifice
things<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.689> Ethernet<00:01:22.380> port<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.100> thinness

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
things like Ethernet port for thinness

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
things like Ethernet port for thinness
you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.390> how<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> ethernet<00:01:25.110> port<00:01:25.409> VGA

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you can see how the ethernet port VGA

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.899 
you can see how the ethernet port VGA
display<00:01:26.220> port<00:01:26.729> 3<00:01:27.030> USB<00:01:27.500> but<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.759> it's<00:01:29.759> fairly

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
display port 3 USB but some it's fairly

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.490 
display port 3 USB but some it's fairly
good<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.270> department<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:30.900> exactly

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
good in that department it's not exactly

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.170 
good in that department it's not exactly
too<00:01:31.770> light<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.610> really<00:01:32.790> heavy<00:01:32.970> it's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
too light it's not really heavy it's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.980 
too light it's not really heavy it's
just<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:34.049> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.439> right<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
just just kind of just right so at the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450 
just just kind of just right so at the
moment<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.290> only<00:01:37.380> thing<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
moment the only thing I really have to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.770 
moment the only thing I really have to
say<00:01:38.610> negative<00:01:38.939> about<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.240> computer<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
say negative about this computer is the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
say negative about this computer is the
fact<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.049> we've<00:01:40.470> had<00:01:40.680> quite<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> few<00:01:41.340> I'd<00:01:41.970> say

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
fact that we've had quite a few I'd say

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
fact that we've had quite a few I'd say
5<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:42.780> 6<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> 40<00:01:43.590> motherboards<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> needs

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
5 or 6 out of 40 motherboards it needs

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.999 
5 or 6 out of 40 motherboards it needs
to<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.970> replaced<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.540> also<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> few<00:01:46.470> touch<00:01:46.740> pads

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
to be replaced and also a few touch pads

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
to be replaced and also a few touch pads
so<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> definitely<00:01:48.270> something<00:01:48.659> that's<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
so this is definitely something that's a

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.280 
so this is definitely something that's a
little<00:01:49.229> disconcerting<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> other

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
little disconcerting but on the other

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.319 
little disconcerting but on the other
hand<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.159> warranty<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:54.180> not

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
hand if you do have warranty it's not

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.730 
hand if you do have warranty it's not
too<00:01:54.659> big<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> deal<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> hope<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.619> is

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
too big of a deal and I hope this is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.289 
too big of a deal and I hope this is
something<00:01:55.860> H<00:01:56.219> people<00:01:56.460> kind<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.969> hire<00:01:57.090> now

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
something H people kind of hire now

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.560 
something H people kind of hire now
since<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> pro<00:01:59.189> bugs<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.850> we

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
since with the pro bugs here we we

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.819 
since with the pro bugs here we we
haven't<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:00.960> had<00:02:01.079> many<00:02:01.259> issues<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.710> all

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
haven't really had many issues at all

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.590 
haven't really had many issues at all
and<00:02:02.430> does<00:02:02.850> ebook<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.540> one<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.020> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.749 

so<00:02:07.230> let's<00:02:07.590> say<00:02:08.130> this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:08.490> decent

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
so let's say this is a pretty decent

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.180 
so let's say this is a pretty decent
computer
