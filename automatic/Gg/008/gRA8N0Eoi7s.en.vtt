00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.000
 Good day to all, today I will cook 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.700
 the dish is called pirates or pilaf but in 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.650
 Japanese style respectively for this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.699
 i will use 200 gram rice he 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.730
 I have already washed 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.680
 and 100 grams of bird is also washed 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.720
 we also need the usual 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.640
 used minced meat well you can also 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.079
 use precisely mince and any either 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 how do you like pork meat with 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.590
 beef either chicken this time I'll 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.039
 use shrimp 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.399
 already washed will also need somewhere one 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:56.039
 the third part of the carrot is already chopped two 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.850
 green pepper half finely chopped 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.700
 halves finely chopped onion and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.740
 1 garlic clove finely chopped too 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.619
 so let's get started if you will 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.000
 use meat exactly that meat in 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.360
 unlike shrimp we will need to add 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.580
 later after roasting already curl since 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 shrimp though washed and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.549
 more or less dried still has 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.979
 more more moisture first to 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.740
 exactly get rid of this lag i will 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.740
 add shrimp in a pan 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.280
 so in the pan I pour a little 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:49.399
 olive oil and add shrimp and 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.100
 I can add rare white clams 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:56.420
 a bit more average for stronger 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.909
 we just did not quench and dry out so that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.780
 get rid of the camp if you will 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.470
 use minced meat respectively 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.250
 said first we will first 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.450
 add exactly garlic all ages already 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.620
 quite a bit 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:21.470

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:24.290

 above about 1 spoon a little bit either 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.610
