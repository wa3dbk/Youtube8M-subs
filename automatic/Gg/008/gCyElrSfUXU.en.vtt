00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.970 

you're<00:00:24.880> getting<00:00:25.210> one<00:00:25.390> right<00:00:25.720> now<00:00:25.960> so<00:00:26.320> if

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
you're getting one right now so if

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.049 
you're getting one right now so if
you're<00:00:27.189> not<00:00:27.279> familiar<00:00:27.460> with<00:00:27.759> the<00:00:27.880> following

00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:28.059 
you're not familiar with the following

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:29.909 
you're not familiar with the following
shelves<00:00:28.750> that<00:00:28.840> I<00:00:28.899> previewed<00:00:29.410> in<00:00:29.529> my<00:00:29.649> last

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
shelves that I previewed in my last

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.130 
shelves that I previewed in my last
video<00:00:30.719> this<00:00:31.719> is<00:00:31.960> basically<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.930> its<00:00:35.050> gonna

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
video this is basically what its gonna

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.510 
video this is basically what its gonna
look<00:00:35.260> like<00:00:35.440> when<00:00:35.800> we're<00:00:35.920> done<00:00:36.070> it<00:00:36.250> won't<00:00:36.399> be

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
look like when we're done it won't be

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.299 
look like when we're done it won't be
exactly<00:00:36.940> this<00:00:37.120> because<00:00:37.600> this<00:00:38.440> I<00:00:38.710> already<00:00:39.100> made

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
exactly this because this I already made

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.220 
exactly this because this I already made
and<00:00:39.579> I<00:00:39.640> didn't<00:00:39.910> make<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.239> video<00:00:40.390> beforehand

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
and I didn't make the video beforehand

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.500 
and I didn't make the video beforehand
to<00:00:41.469> understand<00:00:41.770> I<00:00:41.800> mean<00:00:42.010> so<00:00:42.219> when<00:00:42.399> we<00:00:42.520> re

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
to understand I mean so when we re

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.380 
to understand I mean so when we re
simulate<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.230> reactor<00:00:44.800> functions<00:00:45.339> we're<00:00:46.269> not

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
simulate the reactor functions we're not

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.549 
simulate the reactor functions we're not
gonna<00:00:46.510> get<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.809> same<00:00:47.019> thing<00:00:47.289> and<00:00:47.499> the

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
gonna get the same thing and the

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.110 
gonna get the same thing and the
dimensions<00:00:48.070> will<00:00:48.190> be<00:00:48.219> off<00:00:48.399> and<00:00:48.609> whatever<00:00:48.760> but

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
dimensions will be off and whatever but

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.770 
dimensions will be off and whatever but
we'll<00:00:49.239> get<00:00:49.390> something<00:00:49.570> similar<00:00:49.839> to<00:00:50.199> this<00:00:51.780> so

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
we'll get something similar to this so

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.110 
we'll get something similar to this so
we<00:00:52.870> have<00:00:53.050> falling<00:00:54.659> 9-millimeter<00:00:55.659> shells<00:00:57.120> well

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
we have falling 9-millimeter shells well

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.360 
we have falling 9-millimeter shells well
let<00:00:58.269> it<00:00:58.300> play<00:00:58.420> for<00:00:58.719> a<00:00:58.780> little<00:00:58.989> bit<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.690> see<00:01:04.930> a

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
let it play for a little bit you see a

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.870 
let it play for a little bit you see a
particle<00:01:06.370> system<00:01:06.550> I<00:01:07.090> made<00:01:07.270> with<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.479> pea<00:01:07.870> flow

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
particle system I made with a pea flow

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.240 
particle system I made with a pea flow
position<00:01:09.880> object<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:11.229> I<00:01:11.440> just<00:01:11.830> linked<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.220> to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
position object and I just linked it to

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.980 
position object and I just linked it to
one<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.729> our<00:01:12.790> shells<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:16.090> shell<00:01:16.329> I<00:01:16.360> chose<00:01:16.750> to

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
one of our shells the shell I chose to

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.039 
one of our shells the shell I chose to
follow<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.939> again<00:01:19.180> it's<00:01:19.360> just<00:01:19.420> nine<00:01:19.689> melting

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
follow so again it's just nine melting

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.649 
follow so again it's just nine melting
9-millimeter<00:01:20.740> shells<00:01:21.100> if<00:01:21.399> I<00:01:21.460> hit<00:01:21.700> P<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.540> my

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
9-millimeter shells if I hit P on my

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:30.300 
9-millimeter shells if I hit P on my
keyboard<00:01:23.020> for<00:01:23.680> perspective<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:29.189> zoom<00:01:30.189> in

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
keyboard for perspective I can zoom in

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.440 
keyboard for perspective I can zoom in
on<00:01:30.430> this<00:01:30.579> guy<00:01:30.820> here<00:01:32.369> let's<00:01:33.369> see<00:01:33.520> it's<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.820> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.700 

regular<00:01:37.450> 9-millimeter<00:01:38.140> shell<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:40.530> C<00:01:41.530> on<00:01:41.680> my

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
regular 9-millimeter shell and C on my

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.840 
regular 9-millimeter shell and C on my
keyboard<00:01:41.829> for<00:01:42.430> camera<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:48.520> gonna<00:01:48.700> take

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
keyboard for camera so I'm gonna take

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.340 
keyboard for camera so I'm gonna take
you<00:01:48.909> through<00:01:48.969> all<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.299> steps<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.659> creating<00:01:49.930> a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
you through all the steps of creating a

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.550 
you through all the steps of creating a
scene<00:01:50.649> like<00:01:50.799> this<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:52.109> it<00:01:53.109> should<00:01:53.320> be<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.439> lot

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
scene like this and it should be a lot

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.410 
scene like this and it should be a lot
of<00:01:53.590> fun<00:01:53.859> we'll<00:01:54.039> start<00:01:54.310> in<00:01:54.429> Photoshop<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.090> make

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
of fun we'll start in Photoshop to make

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.169 
of fun we'll start in Photoshop to make
a<00:01:55.570> reference<00:01:55.840> panel<00:01:59.670> we'll<00:02:00.670> come<00:02:00.850> back<00:02:01.000> in

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
a reference panel we'll come back in

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.999 
a reference panel we'll come back in
here<00:02:01.390> I'll<00:02:01.570> show<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.810> how<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:02.049> make<00:02:02.320> how<00:02:02.950> to

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
here I'll show you how to make how to

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.649 
here I'll show you how to make how to
use<00:02:03.189> mental<00:02:03.490> ray<00:02:03.789> a<00:02:03.820> little<00:02:04.149> bit<00:02:04.329> we're<00:02:04.570> not

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
use mental ray a little bit we're not

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.020 
use mental ray a little bit we're not
gonna<00:02:04.780> have<00:02:04.960> real<00:02:05.079> in-depth<00:02:05.439> into<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:06.030> but

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
gonna have real in-depth into that but

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.580 
gonna have real in-depth into that but
we'll<00:02:07.149> look<00:02:07.240> about<00:02:07.539> we'll<00:02:08.020> look<00:02:08.140> at<00:02:08.350> how<00:02:08.560> to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
you know put it add the copper shader

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.520 
you know put it add the copper shader
for<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.910> metal<00:02:13.210> shells

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.900 

yeah<00:02:17.530> all<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.130> ways<00:02:18.250> all<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.520> particles

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
yeah all the ways all the particles

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.610 
yeah all the ways all the particles
everything<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.629> should<00:02:19.659> be<00:02:19.930> just<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.290> really

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
everything it should be just a really
