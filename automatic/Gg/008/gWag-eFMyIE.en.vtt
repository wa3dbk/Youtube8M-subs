fish the outlet of Austin lake one thing

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.880 
fish the outlet of Austin lake one thing
with<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.010> technique<00:00:29.599> for<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> trailer<00:00:31.140> I'm

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
with this technique for the trailer I'm

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
with this technique for the trailer I'm
following<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:34.320> flies<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.890> swinging<00:00:35.450> I'm

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
following as the flies are swinging I'm

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.150 
following as the flies are swinging I'm
following<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> swing<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> rod<00:00:40.860> tip

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
following the swing with a rod tip

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.490 
following the swing with a rod tip
meaning<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:43.050> has<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:44.480> line<00:00:45.480> swings<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.289> rod

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
meaning it has the line swings the rod

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.130 
meaning it has the line swings the rod
tip<00:00:46.770> stays<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> flies<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.270> they

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
tip stays right with the flies as they

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.090 
tip stays right with the flies as they
as<00:00:49.379> they're<00:00:49.920> making<00:00:50.340> their<00:00:50.520> their<00:00:51.000> turn<00:00:52.100> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
as they're making their their turn in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.529 
as they're making their their turn in
the<00:00:53.250> current<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.730> they're<00:00:53.910> swinging<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the current as they're swinging with the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.930 
the current as they're swinging with the
current<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.440> rod<00:00:55.620> tip<00:00:55.860> stays<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
current the rod tip stays right with it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.170 
current the rod tip stays right with it
so<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.600> moving<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> rod<00:00:58.289> tip<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> swing

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
so I'm moving the rod tip with the swing

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.200 
so I'm moving the rod tip with the swing
and<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.329> keeps<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> flies<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.059> have

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and that keeps the flies down and I have

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.050 
and that keeps the flies down and I have
a<00:01:03.239> good<00:01:03.449> movement<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.189> when<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
a good movement with them and when a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.899 
a good movement with them and when a
fish<00:01:06.330> takes<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:10.700> then<00:01:13.909> I'm

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.890 
that's another another way to work them
so<00:03:14.890> there's<00:03:15.890> more<00:03:16.490> than<00:03:16.670> one<00:03:16.850> way<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.060> do<00:03:17.720> this

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
so there's more than one way to do this

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.680 
so there's more than one way to do this
and<00:03:18.170> then<00:03:18.830> thing<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.220> stop<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.670> rod<00:03:19.820> high<00:03:20.180> and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
and then thing you stop the rod high and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.670 
and then thing you stop the rod high and
you<00:03:20.780> let<00:03:20.960> those<00:03:21.170> nips<00:03:21.740> drop<00:03:22.040> in<00:03:22.250> first<00:03:26.440> now<00:03:27.440> be

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
you let those nips drop in first now be

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.280 
you let those nips drop in first now be
bouncing

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.220 

and<00:03:32.290> we<00:03:32.560> bound<00:03:32.769> some<00:03:33.010> deep<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:35.110> are

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
and we bound some deep so there are

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.690 
and we bound some deep so there are
different<00:03:35.530> levels<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:36.069> which<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.340> can<00:03:36.519> fish

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
different levels in which you can fish

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:48.420 
different levels in which you can fish
