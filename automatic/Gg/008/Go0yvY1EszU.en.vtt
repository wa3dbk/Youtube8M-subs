at their film he said that sign up their

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.760 
at their film he said that sign up their
offense<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.330> kind<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.660> weak<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.109> especially<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
offense is kind of weak and especially a
