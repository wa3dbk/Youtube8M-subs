00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
iPad so once it's done ready over here

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.170 
iPad so once it's done ready over here
it's<00:00:19.770> best<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.310> go<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.490> landscape<00:00:21.150> mode

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
it's best that you go to landscape mode

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.509 
it's best that you go to landscape mode
so<00:00:21.960> down<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.590> there<00:00:22.769> are<00:00:22.890> few<00:00:23.100> settings<00:00:23.400> you

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so down here there are few settings you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.330 
so down here there are few settings you
can<00:00:23.550> set<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.010> aperture<00:00:26.010> settings

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
can set this is the aperture settings

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.000 
can set this is the aperture settings
the<00:00:26.910> bigger<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.630> aperture<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.199> eye<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the bigger the aperture the eye is the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
the bigger the aperture the eye is the
darker<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.490> will<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.240> let's<00:00:31.199> say<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
darker they will get so let's say I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.870 
darker they will get so let's say I
switch<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> over<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.250> something<00:00:32.610> smaller

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
switch it over to a something smaller

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.930 
switch it over to a something smaller
one<00:00:34.219> you<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> play<00:00:35.579> around<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
one you have to play around with the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
one you have to play around with the
settings<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.680> especially<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> sunny

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
settings are especially at the sunny

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.700 
settings are especially at the sunny
area<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.180> may<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.480> get<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> actual<00:00:39.989> settings

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
area you may not get the actual settings

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.840 
area you may not get the actual settings
proper<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.710> best<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> turn<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.579> live

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
proper so it's best to turn on the live

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.299 
proper so it's best to turn on the live
view<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.360> know<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.809> happening<00:00:46.309> so

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
view so you know what is happening so

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.770 
view so you know what is happening so
when<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.820> put<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> live<00:00:48.270> view<00:00:48.480> you'll<00:00:48.660> be

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
when you put the live view you'll be

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.979 
when you put the live view you'll be
able<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:50.070> what<00:00:50.719> is<00:00:51.719> bringing

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
able to see actually what is bringing

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
able to see actually what is bringing
like<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.770> dark<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.039> because

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
like now you see it's dark right because

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.220 
like now you see it's dark right because
the<00:00:53.579> aperture<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.300> big<00:00:54.510> until<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.020> can't

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the aperture is so big until you can't

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.060 
the aperture is so big until you can't
see<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> thing<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> make<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:59.690> so<00:01:00.710> see<00:01:01.710> even

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070

myself I'm trying to make it this the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.800 
myself I'm trying to make it this the
shutter<00:01:08.549> speed<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.150> won't<00:01:09.299> affect<00:01:09.420> like

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
shutter speed this won't affect like

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
shutter speed this won't affect like
much<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.860> which<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.040> affecting<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
much the one which is affecting is the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.890 
much the one which is affecting is the
ISO<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.060> stuff<00:01:13.790> don't<00:01:14.790> put<00:01:14.939> Ottawa<00:01:15.420> try<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.969 
ISO and stuff don't put Ottawa try to
put<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.320> manual<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.770> possible<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.979> maybe

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
put it as manual as possible so maybe

thing<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.460> new<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> need<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
thing is new now you need to do the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600 
thing is new now you need to do the
intervalometer<00:01:55.229> interval<00:01:56.040> meter<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> one

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
intervalometer interval meter is the one

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.679 
intervalometer interval meter is the one
which<00:01:56.729> automatically<00:01:57.360> take<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> photos<00:01:58.020> so

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
which automatically take the photos so
