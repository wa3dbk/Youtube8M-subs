00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
updating it now you see when you're

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.880

downloading<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.420> app<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.870> in<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.560> middle<00:02:08.770> of

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
downloading it app and in the middle of

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.260 
downloading it app and in the middle of
it<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.190> decide<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:09.670> don't<00:02:09.880> want<00:02:10.030> it

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
it you decide you don't want it

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.660 
it you decide you don't want it
especially<00:02:10.780> when<00:02:11.020> it's<00:02:11.200> over<00:02:11.590> 500<00:02:12.160> megabytes

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
especially when it's over 500 megabytes

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.520 
especially when it's over 500 megabytes
and<00:02:12.940> there's<00:02:13.510> nothing<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:13.960> can<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.290> about<00:02:14.470> it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
and there's nothing you can do about it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.830 
and there's nothing you can do about it
except<00:02:15.040> keep<00:02:15.280> downloading<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.940> app<00:02:16.060> well<00:02:16.630> now

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840

you can just select it and hit that
little<00:02:19.690> X<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:20.500> deleted<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.130> that's<00:02:21.280> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
little X and it's deleted so that's a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.340
