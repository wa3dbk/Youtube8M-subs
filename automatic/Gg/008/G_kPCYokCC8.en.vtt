00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:13.529
 Welcome to We Are Here in Top 5 at the European Poker Stars Point 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.800
 The euro-finance chiefs want Sandra Bullocks next to me 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.939
 the name might not be as well known as the face would be 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:22.739
 notice 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.249
 very up and coming LuMe poker player from Berlin 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:32.700
 Wetzlar has shortened PrÃ¶ll New York's Leading Lady 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.870
 how did that happen 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.249
 Note so I have the EU the pressure but numbers and his Kate w 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:40.820
 Justine Henin 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.880
 Arn 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.350
 The tour takes care of you can imagine a bit like 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 the output of the tens, that is to say, it will be for the best player in the game 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.750
 best player 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.240
 Yukon longest awarded the best shoot shaped excellent 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.800
 and she at the word I 've hoped to keep the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.410
 European Championships 2008 won 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.930
 I think few people can become percent European champions 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.810
 In a nutshell, you are the successor of Katja Thater who is now a very 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 big name already has in the poker scene 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.440
 how Bitzi your future in coconut or what do you think Studen near future 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.510
 think 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.210
 the thesis of course always high and around 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.370
 I think I'm really looking forward to the World Championships now in the summer 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.320
 as a poker player the sun the man mostly alone never exactly where you get in two 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.580
 Years you see each other in five years I hope that they are still one 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.910
 couple from a pipeline and one has to wait 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.550
 What makes the poker game for you why Costanzo had awkward 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.790
 Of course that's the passion 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.950
 in the Middle District Council for himself, so to speak, also very ambitious Fassbind Sport and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.760
 I think I'll always be there and have some variety around Phocus where Grasser 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.700
 Completion and in poker you play fine even his opponents 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.110
 around the board percent the cards situation the position and Hermann has 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.170
 so many tools and a maneuver you can play and that's why it's easy 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.700
 Pure fascination 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.419
 Poker needs to extrovert in the quarterfinals today everywhere 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.999
 I think it's a pity that you did not become a cigar there and 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.909
 also your percent a cowboy hat 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.959
 because percent so you know each other at the table 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.750
 Are you doing because you just love it because it's a hobby for you? 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.519
 Cigar smoking request or is it nowhere like 1 premiums for you 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.549
 a short as well as SPD Schleswig-Holstein 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.549
 So why not in those days as well as ten years, that's the way it is 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.469
 Banks my second passion after poker 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.870
 and I like to be good at both comes together maybe it is 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.539
 at other clubs 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.389
 you come out of which fits your emotions already produces the films 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.669
 because you can see on the homepage too 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.689
 even more impressed me, however, no big topic for 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.899
 the engagement in Namibia and in Cambodia maybe a few words too 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:59.899
 these allegations 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:03.369
 that I can remember a little bit better it is all the more important that you 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.449
 they had more thought that you can not do it anymore it does not go so well 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.819
 In the evening many years ago I took the trophy early in March 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.259
 can projects 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.859
 in Namibia had collected by donations for and now I would like 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.749
 just reuse networkers for the platform and more 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.739
 merge Nana new basin can Bucher 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.419
 he reckons that he is ashamed of his knees 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.859
 organize 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.539
 and Percent and Essar a school an orphanage for 5 9 children 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.579
 and who the book trend support I hope that I succeed more 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.099
 Physicist also on site 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.199
 and already on the 8th 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.599
 and three weeks in Cambodia for a total of two weeks and has more 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.229
 Spread looked at 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.769
 Bentley's percent went ahead was visited by Totti children and 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.190
 Alarming is hosted for me and is a whole new experience 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.059
 but still very short to get 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.799
 Former poker games started thinking I think three years ago 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.399
 Three years ago, the year of the former minimum interest rate was Pucher's business 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.399
 how can you film to the medium 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.930
 Let's go over it a bit too much it was more like music videos in the 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:11.739
 direction 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.180
 also around the Hesse like him then together with a director 

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:17.419
 liberating 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.729
 around 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.069
 also takes percent 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.979
 yes, this cooperation has resulted 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.800
 and then again just for the sake of poker it was really by chance online 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.120
 Acquaintance Poker robbers was already targeted 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.590
 according to his deeds coincidence so one percent 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.720
 and we are so it is for us and we around Thiess people arrive around 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.900
 In percent, Bender requested a poker game 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.199
 and some pressed and Celle thereby remained little 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.010
 Good day I have that for the many thanks for the conversation 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.980
 Uncle good luck still around I hope very soon the first bracelet 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.680
 I had that on him
