00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
and that's like took quite a lot of the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.170

build took like 30 minutes 45 minutes so

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.840 
build took like 30 minutes 45 minutes so
I<00:03:23.209> didn't<00:03:23.540> but<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.750> was<00:03:24.170> pretty<00:03:24.319> cool<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.850> yeah

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
I didn't but it was pretty cool and yeah

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.470 
I didn't but it was pretty cool and yeah
so<00:03:26.329> tornado<00:03:27.170> completely<00:03:27.769> destroyed<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.269> I

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
so tornado completely destroyed it but I

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.129 
so tornado completely destroyed it but I
just<00:03:29.930> let<00:03:30.019> my<00:03:30.109> spawn<00:03:31.299> right<00:03:32.299> here<00:03:32.750> all<00:03:33.079> right

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
just let my spawn right here all right

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.000 
just let my spawn right here all right
so<00:03:34.030> we're<00:03:35.030> gonna<00:03:35.120> spawn<00:03:35.420> enough<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.980> f2<00:03:36.980> I

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
so we're gonna spawn enough to f2 I

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.729 
so we're gonna spawn enough to f2 I
think<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.730> Strongs<00:03:38.510> know<00:03:39.049> we'll<00:03:39.230> do<00:03:39.349> an<00:03:39.470> f1

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
think is the Strongs know we'll do an f1

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.759 
think is the Strongs know we'll do an f1
f1<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:40.880> um<00:03:41.359> day<00:03:42.019> like<00:03:42.260> they're<00:03:42.560> at<00:03:42.650> the

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
f1 this um day like they're at the

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.440 
f1 this um day like they're at the
skinniest<00:03:43.160> but<00:03:43.430> they<00:03:43.549> do<00:03:43.609> quite<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.060> deep

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
skinniest but they do quite a deep

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.220 
skinniest but they do quite a deep
amount<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.930> damage<00:03:45.260> home<00:03:46.040> F<00:03:46.280> -<00:03:47.079> it's<00:03:48.079> only

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
amount of damage home F - it's only

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.099 
amount of damage home F - it's only
requests<00:03:48.769> like<00:03:48.889> f1<00:03:49.069> f2<00:03:49.430> or<00:03:49.700> f3<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.959> then

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
requests like f1 f2 or f3 so in and then

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.599 
requests like f1 f2 or f3 so in and then
f2<00:03:51.849> it's<00:03:53.349> does<00:03:54.349> it's<00:03:54.680> like<00:03:54.829> white<00:03:55.130> it's<00:03:55.549> like

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
f2 it's does it's like white it's like

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.780 
f2 it's does it's like white it's like
an<00:03:55.760> f1<00:03:56.090> end<00:03:56.359> like<00:03:56.950> widened<00:03:57.950> it's<00:03:58.160> really<00:03:58.609> good

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
an f1 end like widened it's really good

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.729 
an f1 end like widened it's really good
so<00:03:58.970> f2<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.540> strongest<00:03:59.959> f3<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.410> second

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
so f2 is the strongest f3 the second

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.059 
so f2 is the strongest f3 the second
strongest<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.250> f1<00:04:01.639> I<00:04:01.819> guess<00:04:02.599> it's<00:04:02.900> us<00:04:03.530> but<00:04:03.859> it

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
strongest and f1 I guess it's us but it

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.650 
strongest and f1 I guess it's us but it
does<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> really<00:04:04.489> deep<00:04:04.730> path<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.239> goes<00:04:05.359> fast

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
does a really deep path and it goes fast

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.030 
does a really deep path and it goes fast
all<00:04:06.230> right<00:04:06.349> so<00:04:06.560> we're<00:04:06.769> gonna<00:04:06.859> make<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.310> rain

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
all right so we're gonna make it to rain

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.970
