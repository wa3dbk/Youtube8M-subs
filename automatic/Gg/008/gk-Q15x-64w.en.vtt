my<00:01:01.109> opinion<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.680> these<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.460> air<00:01:02.730> units<00:01:03.660> are

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
my opinion these these are air units are

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.590 
my opinion these these are air units are
just<00:01:04.050> really<00:01:04.320> powerful<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.210> some<00:01:06.210> people

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
just really powerful up here some people

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660 
just really powerful up here some people
may<00:01:06.750> differ<00:01:07.020> they<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.800> lava<00:01:08.100> hound<00:01:08.430> is

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
may differ they think the lava hound is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.200 
may differ they think the lava hound is
just<00:01:09.290> maybe<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.890> useful<00:01:11.190> as<00:01:11.490> they'd<00:01:11.640> like

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
just maybe not as useful as they'd like

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.190 
just maybe not as useful as they'd like
but<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.260> evidence<00:01:13.620> is<00:01:13.950> right<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
but the evidence is right there for you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.190 
but the evidence is right there for you
these<00:01:16.200> lava<00:01:16.500> hound<00:01:16.740> troops<00:01:17.010> are<00:01:17.190> really<00:01:17.430> good

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
these lava hound troops are really good

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.390 
these lava hound troops are really good

the<00:01:20.520> next<00:01:20.910> battle<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:21.510> it<00:01:21.870> looks<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.200> we're

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the next battle and it looks like we're

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.100 
the next battle and it looks like we're
doing<00:01:22.590> an<00:01:22.680> all<00:01:22.890> dragon<00:01:23.400> raid<00:01:24.110> typical

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
fits usually some of these guys just use

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.800 
fits usually some of these guys just use
their<00:01:29.610> heroes<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.120> out<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> first<00:01:30.570> one

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
and then the second one they'll go in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.870

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.879 

this<00:04:32.159> was<00:04:32.370> quick<00:04:32.610> work<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:34.050> was<00:04:34.320> really<00:04:34.620> fast

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
this was quick work that was really fast

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.649

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
for this 50% the Queen's only hero left

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.050 
for this 50% the Queen's only hero left
though<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:40.169> they<00:04:40.260> still<00:04:40.500> have<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:40.889> a<00:04:41.060> ability

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
though that they still have is a ability

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.909 
though that they still have is a ability
yes<00:04:42.510> he<00:04:42.630> does<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:42.840> he's<00:04:43.110> taking<00:04:43.470> off<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.740> rest

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
yes he does and he's taking off the rest

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.839 
yes he does and he's taking off the rest
of<00:04:44.039> these<00:04:44.099> weapons<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:45.300> clear<00:04:45.599> path<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.849> get

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
of these weapons the clear path and get

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.570 
of these weapons the clear path and get
to<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.090> 50<00:04:48.449> star<00:04:48.750> yes<00:04:49.229> he<00:04:49.409> does<00:04:49.590> have<00:04:49.770> it<00:04:49.979> okay

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
so that was pretty fast man that also

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.640 
so that was pretty fast man that also
could<00:04:53.970> have<00:04:54.090> went<00:04:54.240> either<00:04:54.360> way<00:04:54.539> depending<00:04:55.260> on

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
could have went either way depending on

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.800 
could have went either way depending on
if<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.370> heroes<00:04:56.729> act<00:04:56.970> properly<00:04:57.419> and<00:04:57.539> they<00:04:57.630> go

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
if the heroes act properly and they go

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.540 
if the heroes act properly and they go
into<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.199> direction<00:04:58.740> he<00:04:58.860> wanted<00:04:59.159> which<00:04:59.340> they
