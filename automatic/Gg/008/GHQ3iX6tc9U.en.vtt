shedding so this

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.630 
shedding so this
doesn't<00:04:36.360> shed<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:41.040> would<00:04:41.340> eventually

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
doesn't shed and it it would eventually

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.450 
doesn't shed and it it would eventually
