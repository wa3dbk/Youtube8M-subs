00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.049
 planet red dotcom let's try 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.559
 make a comparison of the time of 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.779
 boot between a terminal let's say 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.890
 the so-called Chinese lenovo brand 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.890
 well-known brand 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.830
 along with the engine or the motorcycle gp a 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.689
 Terminal created by Motorola at the time 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.970
 that was still google 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.670
 now curiously both are from the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.030
 same property of it same 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.160
 brand 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.780
 but the vote g is a terminal that is 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.550
 having some very good reviews in the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 market a best seller and it would be apart from 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.180
 the difference in size between the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.239
 screen resolutions and such see the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.430
 time it takes the lenovo to start and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.589
 the motogp to boot to make a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.360
 comparative between what is the 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.690
 performance that I'll give you one and the other 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.730
 terminal we proceed to it same let's 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.510
 try 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.510
 tear them out 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.370
 we see more or less the time of the afternoon 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.480
 we see that the lenovo has finished 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.520
 start now 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.520
 completely ripped and operational 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.170
 with the different icons that he brings in his 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.140
 desks while the engine or the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.220
 motorbike because not yet 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.870
 it has not been possible to start it 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.090
 So what do you see here? 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.579
 in this case we see that the wolf 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.939
 given at least at boot time 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.939
 better performance than the engine
