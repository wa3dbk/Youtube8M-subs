jump in the car and you and you're a
little<00:00:12.620> bit<00:00:12.710> anxious<00:00:12.890> because<00:00:13.340> I<00:00:13.520> mean<00:00:13.670> it's

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
little bit anxious because I mean it's

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.010 
little bit anxious because I mean it's
ten<00:00:14.030> years<00:00:14.060> since<00:00:14.420> I<00:00:14.570> raced<00:00:14.810> professionally

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
ten years since I raced professionally

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.650 
ten years since I raced professionally
really<00:00:15.710> and<00:00:15.860> anything<00:00:16.760> can<00:00:17.180> you<00:00:17.270> still<00:00:17.449> do<00:00:17.630> it

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
really and anything can you still do it

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.510 
really and anything can you still do it
you<00:00:17.750> have<00:00:18.019> these<00:00:18.199> self<00:00:18.470> self<00:00:18.920> doubts<00:00:19.130> as<00:00:19.340> all

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
you have these self self doubts as all

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.520 
you have these self self doubts as all
sports<00:00:19.820> people<00:00:19.940> do<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.990> you<00:00:21.080> get<00:00:21.230> out<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:21.440> it

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
sports people do and you get out and it

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.930 
sports people do and you get out and it
just<00:00:21.650> feels<00:00:21.830> natural<00:00:22.039> like<00:00:22.340> swimming<00:00:22.850> or

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
just feels natural like swimming or

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.490 
just feels natural like swimming or
riding<00:00:23.270> a<00:00:23.330> bike<00:00:23.510> you<00:00:23.690> just<00:00:23.720> never<00:00:23.990> forget<00:00:24.110> how

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
riding a bike you just never forget how

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.290 
riding a bike you just never forget how
to<00:00:24.560> do<00:00:24.740> it<00:00:24.860> really<00:00:25.039> just<00:00:25.520> I<00:00:25.640> think<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:26.119> lose

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
to do it really just I think you lose

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.170 
to do it really just I think you lose
the<00:00:26.570> need<00:00:26.810> rather<00:00:27.230> than<00:00:27.580> anything<00:00:28.580> else<00:00:28.910> you

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
the need rather than anything else you

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.910 
the need rather than anything else you
don't<00:00:29.330> actually<00:00:29.539> lose<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.140> speed<00:00:30.440> as<00:00:30.619> such<00:00:30.770> as

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
don't actually lose the speed as such as

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.290 
don't actually lose the speed as such as
long<00:00:31.039> as<00:00:31.190> you<00:00:31.310> physically<00:00:31.760> up<00:00:31.850> to<00:00:32.029> and<00:00:32.210> your

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
long as you physically up to and your

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.050 
long as you physically up to and your
eyes<00:00:32.419> are<00:00:32.599> good<00:00:32.689> enough<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.140> we<00:00:34.129> we<00:00:34.789> dropped

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
eyes are good enough so we we dropped

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.690 
eyes are good enough so we we dropped
into<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.570> groove<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.470> we've<00:00:36.920> progressively

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
into the groove and we've progressively

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.210 
into the groove and we've progressively
improved<00:00:37.850> each<00:00:38.300> day<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:38.780> we've<00:00:39.649> made<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.040> car

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
improved each day and we've made the car

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.330 
improved each day and we've made the car
better<00:00:40.399> but<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.420> think<00:00:41.780> I'm<00:00:42.470> certainly<00:00:42.860> driving

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
better but I think I'm certainly driving

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.220 
better but I think I'm certainly driving
you<00:00:43.880> just<00:00:44.300> get<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.450> little<00:00:44.600> bit<00:00:44.690> rusty<00:00:44.840> a<00:00:45.020> bit

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
you just get a little bit rusty a bit

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.810 
you just get a little bit rusty a bit
aggressive<00:00:45.530> with<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.040> brakes<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.640> the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
aggressive with the brakes and the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.790 
aggressive with the brakes and the
steering<00:00:46.880> when<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:47.450> calm<00:00:47.660> down<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.260> let<00:00:48.710> the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
steering when you calm down and let the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.729 
steering when you calm down and let the
car<00:00:48.980> do<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.280> work<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.670> time<00:00:49.850> start<00:00:50.149> coming<00:00:50.390> I

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
car do the work the time start coming I

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.840 
car do the work the time start coming I
think<00:00:51.739> these<00:00:51.860> cars<00:00:52.130> are<00:00:52.280> doing<00:00:52.430> roughly<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
think these cars are doing roughly the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.040 
think these cars are doing roughly the
same<00:00:53.000> time<00:00:53.149> as<00:00:53.270> we<00:00:53.390> used<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.570> do<00:00:53.690> in<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.899> full

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
same time as we used to do in the full

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.660 
same time as we used to do in the full
group<00:00:54.260> see<00:00:54.469> cars<00:00:54.710> around<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.219> tracks<00:00:55.550> in

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
group see cars around the tracks in

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.180 
group see cars around the tracks in
better<00:00:55.820> condition<00:00:56.649> LeMond<00:00:57.649> cars<00:00:57.920> don't<00:00:58.070> have

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
better condition LeMond cars don't have

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.650 
better condition LeMond cars don't have
that<00:00:58.370> much<00:00:58.489> downforce<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.149> certainly<00:00:59.510> the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
that much downforce and certainly the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.420 
that much downforce and certainly the
older<00:01:00.020> ones<00:01:00.200> that<00:01:00.410> I<00:01:00.440> first<00:01:00.680> used<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:00.920> drive<00:01:01.160> in

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
older ones that I first used to drive in

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.719 
older ones that I first used to drive in
the<00:01:01.640> 80s<00:01:02.800> weren't<00:01:03.800> as<00:01:03.920> good<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.100> cars<00:01:04.369> as<00:01:04.549> these

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
the 80s weren't as good a cars as these

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.760 
the 80s weren't as good a cars as these
really<00:01:05.030> I<00:01:05.210> mean<00:01:05.479> tire<00:01:05.930> development<00:01:06.500> brakes

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
really I mean tire development brakes

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.070 
really I mean tire development brakes
aerodynamic<00:01:07.670> understanding<00:01:08.600> has<00:01:08.690> moved<00:01:08.869> on

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
aerodynamic understanding has moved on

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.399 
aerodynamic understanding has moved on
in<00:01:09.290> that<00:01:09.440> time<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.299> no<00:01:11.299> great<00:01:11.780> surprise<00:01:12.170> they

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
in that time so no great surprise they

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.050 
in that time so no great surprise they
often<00:01:13.100> enter<00:01:13.250> feel<00:01:13.400> like<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.549> formal<00:01:13.820> long<00:01:13.909> car

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
often enter feel like a formal long car

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.030 
often enter feel like a formal long car
they<00:01:14.119> don't<00:01:14.270> have<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.450> downforce<00:01:14.930> they<00:01:15.290> and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
they don't have the downforce they and

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.770 
they don't have the downforce they and
they're<00:01:16.190> much<00:01:16.280> heavier<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.630> was

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
they're much heavier but I was

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.270 
they're much heavier but I was
pleasantly<00:01:17.960> surprising<00:01:18.500> I'd<00:01:18.799> read<00:01:19.010> a<00:01:19.040> few

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
pleasantly surprising I'd read a few

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.100 
pleasantly surprising I'd read a few
things<00:01:19.580> about<00:01:19.790> these<00:01:20.150> Daytona<00:01:20.600> prototypes

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
things about these Daytona prototypes

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.410 
things about these Daytona prototypes
that<00:01:21.680> they<00:01:22.189> were<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.340> bit<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.549> bit<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:22.970> handful

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
that they were a bit a bit of a handful

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.539 
that they were a bit a bit of a handful
so<00:01:23.659> my<00:01:24.229> first<00:01:24.470> few<00:01:24.680> laps<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:25.130> was<00:01:25.280> very

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
so my first few laps I was very

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.460 
so my first few laps I was very
pleasantly<00:01:25.729> surprised<00:01:26.210> at<00:01:26.420> how<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:27.229> car

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
pleasantly surprised at how the car

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.770 
pleasantly surprised at how the car
turned<00:01:28.189> in<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:28.820> roughly<00:01:29.360> did<00:01:29.570> what<00:01:29.689> I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
turned in and it roughly did what I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.990 
turned in and it roughly did what I
thought<00:01:29.900> it<00:01:30.020> was<00:01:30.110> gonna<00:01:30.200> do<00:01:30.350> next<00:01:30.470> I<00:01:31.000> think

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
thought it was gonna do next I think

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.760 
thought it was gonna do next I think
there<00:01:32.119> are<00:01:32.150> sixteen<00:01:32.540> or<00:01:32.689> seventeen<00:01:32.770> Daytona

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
there are sixteen or seventeen Daytona

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.660 
there are sixteen or seventeen Daytona
prototypes<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:34.909> I<00:01:35.150> think<00:01:35.960> we'll<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:37.490> should

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
prototypes so I think we'll we should

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.690 
prototypes so I think we'll we should
qualify<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.390> inside<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.869> top<00:01:39.049> ten<00:01:39.320> I'd<00:01:40.189> be

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
qualify just inside the top ten I'd be

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.160 
qualify just inside the top ten I'd be
great<00:01:40.939> if<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.090> could<00:01:41.270> finish<00:01:41.420> inside<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.020> top

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
great if we could finish inside the top

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.359 
great if we could finish inside the top
five<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:42.439> don't<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.950> any<00:01:43.100> greater

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
five I don't have any greater

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.039 
five I don't have any greater
expectations<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.270> that's<00:01:44.390> too<00:01:44.630> much<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.900> ask

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
expectations and that's too much to ask

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.740 
expectations and that's too much to ask
these<00:01:45.320> guys<00:01:45.640> if<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.729> look<00:01:46.880> at<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.090> lineup<00:01:47.450> the

race they know this track so I don't

even the fastest lineup so we've got to
be<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.820> smartest<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.630> we<00:02:05.689> got<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.869> static

be the smartest and we got a static
truck<00:02:06.439> we'll<00:02:06.560> start<00:02:06.770> up<00:02:06.860> it's

and well known throughout the world
Daytona<00:02:17.360> 24<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.819> see<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.090> track<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
Daytona 24 so you see the track for the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.809 
Daytona 24 so you see the track for the
first<00:02:20.540> time<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.230> then<00:02:21.560> understand<00:02:22.040> how<00:02:22.580> big

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
first time you then understand how big

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.430 
first time you then understand how big
the<00:02:22.970> circuit<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.720> understand<00:02:24.110> how<00:02:24.230> big<00:02:24.410> a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the circuit is and understand how big a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.900 
the circuit is and understand how big a
deal<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:24.860> down<00:02:25.099> in<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.370> area

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
deal it is down in this area

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.420 
deal it is down in this area
it<00:02:26.299> certainly<00:02:26.569> dominates<00:02:27.049> there<00:02:27.430> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
it certainly dominates there the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.789 
it certainly dominates there the
landscape<00:02:28.879> that's<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.269> sure<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:29.750> no<00:02:30.530> are

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
landscape that's for sure but no are

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.369 
landscape that's for sure but no are
really<00:02:31.190> really<00:02:31.879> excited<00:02:32.090> can<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.019> got<00:02:33.170> 30

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
really really excited can you got 30

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.930 
really really excited can you got 30
degrees<00:02:33.769> of<00:02:33.920> banking<00:02:34.220> which<00:02:34.370> is<00:02:34.519> more<00:02:34.670> than<00:02:34.819> I

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
degrees of banking which is more than I

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.199 
degrees of banking which is more than I
ever<00:02:34.970> used<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.049> IndyCar<00:02:36.290> race<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:38.150> you

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
ever used in the IndyCar race and so you

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.520 
ever used in the IndyCar race and so you
can<00:02:38.390> pretty<00:02:38.569> much<00:02:38.660> place<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:38.989> car<00:02:39.260> where<00:02:39.440> you

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
can pretty much place a car where you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.440 
can pretty much place a car where you
want<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.459> problem<00:02:40.819> is<00:02:40.940> coming<00:02:41.090> off<00:02:41.299> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
want it the problem is coming off the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.970 
want it the problem is coming off the
banking<00:02:41.780> into<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.140> infield<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.680> for

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
banking into the infield and for

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.009 
banking into the infield and for
instance<00:02:43.280> term<00:02:43.489> one<00:02:43.730> very<00:02:44.360> difficult<00:02:44.750> and

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
instance term one very difficult and

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.860 
instance term one very difficult and
very<00:02:45.200> bland<00:02:45.560> references<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.730> they've<00:02:47.720> got

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
very bland references and they've got

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.420 
very bland references and they've got
the<00:02:48.019> corner<00:02:48.470> called<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.709> bus<00:02:48.890> stop<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.280> is

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the corner called the bus stop this is

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.610 
the corner called the bus stop this is
like<00:02:49.579> a<00:02:49.610> hi<00:02:49.849> speech<00:02:50.150> cane<00:02:50.510> also<00:02:51.410> quite

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
like a hi speech cane also quite

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.920 
like a hi speech cane also quite
difficult<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.190> get<00:02:52.370> some<00:02:52.579> reference<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.720> there

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
difficult to get some reference so there

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.479 
difficult to get some reference so there
so<00:02:54.140> it's<00:02:54.349> been<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> little<00:02:54.650> bit<00:02:54.920> tricky<00:02:55.220> picking

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
so it's been a little bit tricky picking

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.880 
so it's been a little bit tricky picking
it<00:02:55.579> up<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.940> but<00:02:56.599> you<00:02:56.810> know<00:02:56.840> I've<00:02:57.590> been<00:02:57.650> done<00:02:57.860> a

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
it up and but you know I've been done a

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.259 
it up and but you know I've been done a
few<00:02:58.099> laps<00:02:58.280> now<00:02:58.459> around<00:02:58.730> now<00:02:58.849> I'm<00:02:58.910> quite

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
few laps now around now I'm quite

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.449 
few laps now around now I'm quite
comfortable<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.780> we<00:03:00.739> seem<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:00.980> got<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.280> car

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
comfortable and we seem to got the car

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.720 
comfortable and we seem to got the car
working<00:03:01.700> where<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:02.030> want<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.540> promising

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
working where we want it and promising

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.339 
working where we want it and promising
it's<00:03:04.730> easy<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.269> get<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.480> car<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.690> go<00:03:05.959> quick<00:03:06.200> for

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
it's easy to get the car to go quick for

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.410 
it's easy to get the car to go quick for
one<00:03:06.440> lap<00:03:06.650> we<00:03:07.579> got<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.790> make<00:03:07.879> sure<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.239> car

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
one lap we got to make sure the car

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.910 
one lap we got to make sure the car
still<00:03:08.629> good<00:03:08.840> after<00:03:08.959> 30<00:03:09.260> laps<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.709> set<00:03:09.890> of

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
still good after 30 laps and a set of

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.190 
still good after 30 laps and a set of
tires<00:03:10.129> and<00:03:10.579> it's<00:03:10.670> usable<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.569> predictable

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
tires and it's usable and predictable

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.900 
tires and it's usable and predictable
and<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.560> next<00:03:12.799> guy<00:03:12.950> gets<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.579> he<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:13.819> do

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
and the next guy gets in and he can do

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.520 
and the next guy gets in and he can do
the<00:03:14.030> same<00:03:14.209> thing<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.989> we<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.290> something

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
the same thing and we have something

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.370 
the same thing and we have something
that's<00:03:15.799> still<00:03:15.980> there<00:03:16.220> after<00:03:16.370> 23<00:03:16.910> hours<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.420> 59

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
that's still there after 23 hours and 59

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.660 
that's still there after 23 hours and 59
minutes<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.010> we've<00:03:19.100> still<00:03:19.310> got<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.519> same

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
minutes and we've still got the same

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.789 
minutes and we've still got the same
vehicle<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.720> that's<00:03:20.930> really<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.350> basis<00:03:21.680> of

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
vehicle and that's really the basis of

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.620 
vehicle and that's really the basis of
it<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.040> think<00:03:22.100> we're<00:03:22.489> we're<00:03:22.760> finishing<00:03:23.269> at

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
it and I think we're we're finishing at

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.020 
it and I think we're we're finishing at
this<00:03:23.810> point<00:03:24.049> we've<00:03:24.620> pretty<00:03:24.950> much<00:03:25.069> got<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.489> so

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
this point we've pretty much got that so

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.120 
this point we've pretty much got that so
you<00:03:26.359> know<00:03:26.480> race<00:03:27.049> comes<00:03:27.290> along<00:03:27.560> track

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
you know race comes along track

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.620 
you know race comes along track
conditions<00:03:28.549> different<00:03:28.819> wins<00:03:29.150> different

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.390 
conditions different wins different
whole<00:03:29.810> thing<00:03:30.049> may<00:03:30.470> change<00:03:30.739> but<00:03:31.010> where<00:03:31.160> we<00:03:31.280> are

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
whole thing may change but where we are

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.180 
whole thing may change but where we are
now<00:03:31.609> good<00:03:32.200> people<00:03:33.200> were<00:03:33.319> topping<00:03:33.680> out<00:03:33.829> with
