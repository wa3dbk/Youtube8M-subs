in<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.759> container<00:01:52.240> well<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.439> can<00:01:53.649> actually

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
in a container well you can actually

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.429 
in a container well you can actually
line<00:01:54.459> the<00:01:54.850> bottom<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.569> container<00:01:56.049> with

these baby diapers you know why they

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.289 
these baby diapers you know why they
have<00:01:59.200> these<00:01:59.350> little<00:01:59.709> polymers<00:02:00.639> that<00:02:00.670> soak<00:02:01.119> up

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
have these little polymers that soak up

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.429 
have these little polymers that soak up
moisture<00:02:01.539> well<00:02:02.469> if<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:03.459> are<00:02:04.209> familiar<00:02:04.929> with

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
moisture well if you are familiar with

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.559 
moisture well if you are familiar with
something<00:02:05.679> called<00:02:05.979> soil<00:02:06.369> moist<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:07.329> put

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
something called soil moist you put

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.359 
something called soil moist you put
these<00:02:07.689> down<00:02:07.929> for<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> minute<00:02:08.319> these<00:02:09.099> are

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
these down for a minute these are

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.580 
these down for a minute these are
actually<00:02:09.819> little<00:02:10.030> polymers<00:02:10.630> too<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.170> they

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
actually little polymers too and they

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.040 
actually little polymers too and they
soak<00:02:11.920> up<00:02:12.099> water<00:02:12.400> if<00:02:12.819> they<00:02:13.240> get<00:02:13.450> hundreds<00:02:13.930> of

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
soak up water if they get hundreds of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.500 
soak up water if they get hundreds of
times<00:02:14.319> bigger<00:02:14.680> than<00:02:15.040> what<00:02:15.310> they<00:02:15.490> are<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
times bigger than what they are and the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.600 
times bigger than what they are and the
baby<00:02:16.750> diapers<00:02:17.290> are<00:02:17.440> filled<00:02:17.680> with<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:18.490> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
baby diapers are filled with that so you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.390 
baby diapers are filled with that so you
could<00:02:18.940> line<00:02:19.210> your<00:02:19.900> container<00:02:20.440> with<00:02:21.040> baby

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
could line your container with baby

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.970 
could line your container with baby
diapers<00:02:21.940> diapers<00:02:22.300> or<00:02:22.750> put<00:02:23.740> some

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
diapers diapers or put some

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.490 
diapers diapers or put some
soil<00:02:24.220> moist<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.090> by<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.690> way<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.140> little

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
soil moist in and by the way a little

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.199 
soil moist in and by the way a little
goes<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> long<00:02:26.860> way<00:02:27.220> read<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.819> directions

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
goes a long way read the directions

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.119 
goes a long way read the directions
otherwise<00:02:28.930> you're<00:02:29.110> going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.349> exploding

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
otherwise you're going to have exploding

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.789 
otherwise you're going to have exploding
plants<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.849> if<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.569> don't<00:02:31.870> put<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.530> soil

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
plants and if you don't put the soil

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.710 
plants and if you don't put the soil
moist<00:02:33.099> in<00:02:33.400> you're<00:02:33.819> committed<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.390> watering

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
moist in you're committed to watering

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.320 
moist in you're committed to watering
just<00:02:35.110> about<00:02:35.349> every<00:02:35.799> day<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.549> like<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:37.000> mix<00:02:37.150> it

just about every day so I like to mix it

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.640 
just about every day so I like to mix it

the bottom you can see you have to tease

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.789 
the bottom you can see you have to tease
the<00:03:16.540> roots<00:03:16.569> apart<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.260> little<00:03:17.500> bit<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:17.769> how

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
the roots apart a little bit see how

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.400 
the roots apart a little bit see how
they've<00:03:18.069> grown<00:03:18.280> up<00:03:18.430> it's<00:03:18.970> getting<00:03:19.810> root<00:03:20.200> bound

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
they've grown up it's getting root bound

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.680 
they've grown up it's getting root bound
so<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.010> want<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.370> tease<00:03:21.609> those<00:03:21.940> roots<00:03:22.269> apart

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
so you want to tease those roots apart

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.660 
so you want to tease those roots apart
just<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.109> little<00:03:23.379> bit<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:24.250> way<00:03:24.459> they'll

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
just a little bit and that way they'll

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.180 
just a little bit and that way they'll
grow<00:03:24.910> quite<00:03:25.299> nicely<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.319> you<00:03:26.709> want<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.040> put

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
grow quite nicely so you want to put

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.710 
grow quite nicely so you want to put
that<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.549> there<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.940> I'm<00:03:28.030> putting<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.480> mint

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
that in there and I'm putting the mint

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.620 
that in there and I'm putting the mint
in<00:03:28.930> front<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.799> reason<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.910> mint<00:03:31.180> being<00:03:31.450> in

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
in front the reason is the mint being in

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.870 
in front the reason is the mint being in
front<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.139> good<00:03:32.410> because<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.919> will<00:03:33.010> trail<00:03:33.370> over

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
front is good because it will trail over

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.280 
front is good because it will trail over
and<00:03:35.880> remember<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.060> orange<00:03:37.450> thyme<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.780> talked

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
and remember that orange thyme I talked

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.520 
and remember that orange thyme I talked
about<00:03:38.440> earlier<00:03:39.359> well<00:03:40.359> here's<00:03:40.810> another<00:03:40.870> plant

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
about earlier well here's another plant

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.949 
about earlier well here's another plant
again<00:03:42.010> it's<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.669> little<00:03:42.819> bit<00:03:42.940> root<00:03:43.269> bound<00:03:43.480> so

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
again it's a little bit root bound so

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.259 
again it's a little bit root bound so
we're<00:03:44.079> going<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.319> tease<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:45.099> roots<00:03:45.549> apart<00:03:46.180> a

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
we're going to tease the roots apart a

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.569 
we're going to tease the roots apart a
little<00:03:46.510> bit<00:03:46.690> like<00:03:47.349> that<00:03:47.620> give<00:03:47.919> it<00:03:48.040> really<00:03:48.549> a

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
and let's put some sage in the back a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.490 
and let's put some sage in the back a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
so we'll put that in the back because

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.080 
so we'll put that in the back because
that's<00:04:08.590> going<00:04:08.919> to<00:04:09.010> get<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.310> little<00:04:09.579> bit<00:04:09.819> taller

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
that's going to get a little bit taller

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.830 
that's going to get a little bit taller
and<00:04:11.370> let's<00:04:12.370> see<00:04:12.549> what<00:04:12.730> else<00:04:12.849> do<00:04:13.090> we<00:04:13.150> have<00:04:13.209> here

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
and let's see what else do we have here

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.099 
and let's see what else do we have here
Oh<00:04:13.959> basil<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:15.940> almost<00:04:16.239> like<00:04:16.359> an<00:04:16.570> Italian

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
Oh basil this is almost like an Italian

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.860 
Oh basil this is almost like an Italian
garden<00:04:17.700> ok<00:04:19.799> basil<00:04:20.799> will<00:04:21.010> get<00:04:21.250> almost<00:04:21.539> 2<00:04:22.539> feet

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
garden ok basil will get almost 2 feet

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.140 
garden ok basil will get almost 2 feet
high<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.680> even<00:04:24.370> though<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.669> is<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.910> small

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
high so even though this is a small

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.540 
high so even though this is a small
specimen<00:04:25.690> I'm<00:04:26.440> going<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.770> go<00:04:26.889> ahead<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.280> plant

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
specimen I'm going to go ahead and plant

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.879 
specimen I'm going to go ahead and plant
it<00:04:27.760> in<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.000> back<00:04:28.330> because<00:04:28.900> in<00:04:29.199> time<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.740> will

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
it in the back because in time it will

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.000 
it in the back because in time it will
grow<00:04:30.130> above<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.449> thyme<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.260> mint<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.710> it

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
grow above the thyme and the mint and it

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.969 
grow above the thyme and the mint and it
will<00:04:33.130> get<00:04:33.310> as<00:04:33.490> tall<00:04:33.729> as<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.330> sage<00:04:34.659> so<00:04:35.289> this<00:04:35.770> is

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
will get as tall as the sage so this is

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.290 
will get as tall as the sage so this is
basil

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
basil

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.939 
basil
and<00:04:37.389> that<00:04:37.629> will<00:04:37.840> be<00:04:37.990> really<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.470> nice<00:04:38.740> little

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
and that will be really a nice little

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.420 
and that will be really a nice little
plant<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.550> grow<00:04:39.729> and<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:41.080> think<00:04:41.319> one<00:04:41.650> more<00:04:42.009> and

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
plant to grow and I think one more and

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.760 
plant to grow and I think one more and
notice<00:04:43.419> how<00:04:43.539> many<00:04:43.599> plants<00:04:44.199> are<00:04:44.289> getting<00:04:44.500> in

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
notice how many plants are getting in

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.869 
notice how many plants are getting in
here<00:04:45.009> you<00:04:45.520> can<00:04:45.759> really<00:04:46.389> jam<00:04:46.990> them<00:04:47.229> in<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.879> you

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
here you can really jam them in and you

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.430 
here you can really jam them in and you
have<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.120> harvest<00:04:49.419> them<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.780> lot<00:04:49.960> quicker<00:04:50.139> but

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
have to harvest them a lot quicker but

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.260 
have to harvest them a lot quicker but
they<00:04:50.560> do<00:04:50.620> grow<00:04:51.009> quicker<00:04:51.340> in<00:04:51.610> containers

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
they do grow quicker in containers

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.480 
they do grow quicker in containers
simply<00:04:52.900> because<00:04:53.199> you<00:04:53.470> have<00:04:53.710> more<00:04:54.039> control

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
simply because you have more control

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.700 
simply because you have more control
