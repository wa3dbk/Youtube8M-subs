00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.969
 Hello youtube do not scare the end 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.070
 are pretty tall or the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.580
 fingers are pretty big in the picture 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.529
 it's about the ears, there's such a thing 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.649
 shift immediately with me 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.930
 the areas of interest it now go after 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.489
 especially like to walk then 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.690
 because depending on how the pay as 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:36.420
 Proof of being recently on vacation best 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 garden bit by the area 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.589
 I also have videos though 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.469
 made but there I would be mine 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.359
 family with the present 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.640
 In fact, interest areas are now 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.530
 drove mechanical watches 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.999
 I've been in some Lutzen 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.010
 our been stuck with it a bit 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.850
 that's the latest model that is 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.109
 that's a tissot 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:05.250
 a mechanical watch for as it is 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.979
 only because several models want to week 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.390
 been 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.840
 there are also that, for example 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.690
 a seiko also a brand the divers 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.280
 From dive watch holder there are two models 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.770
 lie is 200 meters are waterproof 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.510
 but not only against this deep too 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.960
 use are the 200 meters 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.660
 that does not mean just the deep well 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.790
 the importance for which it is intended 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.150
 that does not pay the deep the pay 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.780
 Water depth has with this tightness 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.220
 Specification so little to do 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.340
 that's another side is one 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.409
 pretty classic model 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.110
 It is a clock that every beginner gives 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.220
 it is a very beautiful one in my opinion 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.890
 rest all occasionally go 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.200
 actually that same model of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.649
 syco as just shown just another 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.299
 a nice different coloring 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.399
 in the end, the work is identical 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.620
 very little attention to the reflections 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.890
 of light that is a bit day 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.310
 or art leaves the art 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.680
 reflects extreme the surfaces so 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.360
 the exact name of the glass 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.150
 I'm sorry for the watches now 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.989
 still after hot or 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:35.260
 Deposit description box 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:37.750
 these are various tours a citizen of the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.920
 the same problem has also become 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.829
 Picture reflects the artificial light a little bit 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.519
 A surface is also one 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.950
 diver's watch variant of 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.040
 These are very common too 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.930
 Popular many just for the driver 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.070
 more likely these models 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.730
 probably already get to know 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.650
 they are very common 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.829
 now only a rough short presentation 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.410
 this is not the case with the current ones 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.010
 a bit busy so many 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.660
 interests relocation not necessarily 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.840
 a one hundred percent shift 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.359
 but currently what's here 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:25.660
 busy interested in that 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:31.000
 in fact this model of salto spd 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.100
 10 01 05 in the fall to a blue one 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.800
 dial the blue one 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.380
 then a bit off a front 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.760
 is so with a blue dial or 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.080
 one from syco also with one 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.560
 blue target stays away 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.440
 the orange models are now 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.200
 ordered that will come yet 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.240
 I advise so a few weeks 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.110
 maybe I'll show you then too 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.950
 look the mirroring are the 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.320
 Also fantastic that we have to go to the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.380
 new topic of the mission last 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.330
 time has worked as a bit 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.520
 said these videos from a vacation 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.460
 if I want to show now 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.330
 This is what I think was up 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.330
 every case for watching
