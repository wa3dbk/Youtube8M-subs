00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.410
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.600
 today to this new video I am 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.150
 moreover, I always read who else on 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.620
 this channel if I don't read guess a 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.629
 little the video game you are seeing in 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.540
 this moment that video game will ever be 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.699
 but surely lollipop space 3 la 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.860
 revenge of the werewolf rabbit 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.600
 but not really if he had answered 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.489
 so you got close enough 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.350
 but in reality this is dead space 3 but 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.690
 surely you will have already recognized it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.580
 the space 3 which will be released in February is 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 currently in demo version and for 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.750
 any of you would follow me even on the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.940
 my social pages such as google plus 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.100
 twitter and facebook in description if 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.720
 you want to register because after the jump 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.729
 surely many of you in short I have 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 left information on how 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.330
 be able to access the demo in preview e 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.580
 some keys for those who failed 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.390
 to take them and therefore certainly many 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.810
 of you today 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.909
 in short, today is January 21st here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 they had certainly already tried the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.750
 video game had already taken a while 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.549
 human and now I'm here in harlem 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.409
 impressions but at the end of this video 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.570
 or during this video you saw that 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.570
 the light lucina never said see mocco 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.100
 that this video you will see me trample 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.620
 only from beginning to end but they would see 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.150
 certainly an idiot to step on the ground 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.800
 I walk what is done 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.990
 we walk we trample the ground but 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.310
 keeps kicking the ground e 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.750
 this is more the data however we go to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.100
 made with the right I was just saying that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.770
 in this video my video type I hope 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.810
 that I will give you my impressions about 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.730
 what was this demo and you 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.980
 since you've played with it and if you haven't 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.350
 you guys played guys today 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.970
 should come out or tomorrow will come out anyway 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.450
 the demo for all playstation consoles 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.060
 3 and pc that was not available before 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.159
 you can try it so let's see some 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.260
 play here 80 euros a type came out 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.540
 they went back because qua boom 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.099
 here is the kind little caio is that me 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.629
 I start to kick the ground 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.430
 here I told you it hung 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.150
 delete the why I 'm an incapable la 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.099
 we put 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.200
 let us start from the assumption that I the 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.780
 space 1 and 2 not what actually 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.970
 I've played for it I've never followed 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.950
 the history despite this there is a meeting place 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.930
 quietly on the net a video that on 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.379
 game that gives you a summary of all the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.959
 history 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.209
 however it is quite interesting of 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.680
 this is the story of the space 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.329
 I'm not here will deepen I want more 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.950
 talk about the game I was only dwelling on 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.040
 too much and it becomes a video totally 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.980
 canned then it is often we talk about 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.840
 let's play here let's say I remembered 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.030
 the space 1 and the space 2 that was 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.190
 by clearly he could tell it was ok 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.260
 anyway video that I remembered the space 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.420
 like a slow video game here 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.069
 this the space 3 turns out to be like 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.500
 an instant a bit in the trailers in the games 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.489
 a little faster a little more voting is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.069
 a little more if a little more so things action 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.129
 we can say trivially in the sense that 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.590
 if the first is much slower the 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:27.220
 cacchiarola the one as it was called la 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.250
 Yoshimitsu ship the bag mutu the osci 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.750
 mix 1st memory was the shac amura 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.970
 but what did you see anyway 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.549
 I am very informed this is the terrain 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.680
 as you can see the video was much slower 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.060
 dark but if a little faster it is 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.400
 however this snowy environment 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.409
 which I don't think will be with the weight 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.310
 it may be hit but not named 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.199
 the only one 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.989
 if anything be nice enough but 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.730
 in short, perhaps the most important element 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.739
 the cooperative is the cooperative of 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.109
 game without any doubt is perhaps one 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.139
 of the biggest news we can also 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.699
 call here but that also seen of 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.370
 good eye of bad eye here 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.530
 because why neowin laid a game 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.229
 like this one that should make you shit 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.900
 below come as it comes 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:13.209
 played together with a friend 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.479
 unfortunately loses some maybe his 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.479
 side 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.880
 can't give you to pass it on 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.680
 same fear because if in the company of 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.560
 someone you feel reassured we can 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.510
 almost say and therefore perhaps the cooperative 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.490
 can go a little to dampen what 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.530
 the attention that is generated in a game 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.970
 like this kind this is mine 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.340
 thought about what may be the 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.620
 cooperative despite this I hope to 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.120
 find someone you could possibly be with 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.750
 face this game together because 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.310
 I think I take it, I should go out 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.620
 perhaps opening them in the company of this 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.910
 person can offer you some videos 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.130
 then we'll see short I don't want to know 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.110
 anticipating too much, however, were many 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.169
 what I play on 6 is not me 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.850
 What especially sorry for the 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.000
 Spending space had a dog 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.640
 success something reason if you see are 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 come out one two and three chapters and I think 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.560
 that is the case here after maybe he had a 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.300
 tone I have not had a chance to 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.640
 play the first to try this 3 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.600
 play with it and then maybe recover in a 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.260
 future time the previous chapters here 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.790
 this however more or less 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.550
 indicatively they are my impressions 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:23.570
 not therefore a video game that keeps yes 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.200
 a component that is not on file anyway 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.940
 horror 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.130
 we say that has to scare are 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.830
 been moments of boys as soon 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.880
 that I have everything quiet see here the 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.180
 mine without that is now I'll show you 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.979
 I tell you what it is experiencing here 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.470
 fucking dick to ii comes out no no 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.240
 a hole here and a patch of buildings 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.220
 fixed that is not much luck from behind 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.710
 because I told you no but bolelli a 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.910
 massacre shoot everything here is more or less 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.760
 my reaction when it was like this 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.800
 because I said of fixed but in short 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.200
 arrives in front and mails behind little laundry 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.670
 who said 2 this however the 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.930
 the beauty of these games however they are 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.930
 those games that don't always leave you 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.310
 there is always a breath on the neck 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.440
 care attention when you play 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.600
 because you know that increasing the high could 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.370
 jumped out as i enjoy i know something like 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.900
 now it shouldn't happen anymore here 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:19.030
 nothing then there is this carmen stage and so 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.220
 the reaction I like these games 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.740
 because you carry a little bit of 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.550
 enough feelings give you accounts 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.620
 game an adrenaline rush 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.630
 you can do it under practically ie 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.430
 but beautiful no then in short there is to whom 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.200
 like them who doesn't like who they like 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.310
 shit under I think nobody likes 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.650
 shit under but in short 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.900
 seize the finesse of this sentence which 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.520
 is what is below is taken away 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.680
 this guys that's all for it 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.810
 Video for my easy fast 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.460
 impression on despres that will then come out a 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.980
 February try the demo if you were 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.880
 interested to make an impression 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.400
 an idea about the game 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.660
 I'm read leave a comment with 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.930
 your impressions 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.960
 and why not left me like me 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.960
 like it
