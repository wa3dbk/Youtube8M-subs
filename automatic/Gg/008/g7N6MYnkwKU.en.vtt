00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.900
 hello how about youtube people I am 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.250
 wallace and here I bring you one more video 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.580
 of a product that I did not make at the time 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.200
 the unboxing but more than anything I love them 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.230
 upload the video of what you bought 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.470
 already a couple of months ago because of the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.720
 news that I just saw today 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.390
 that already has a few days out there and is 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.270
 that will leave an xbox one with a disk 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.000
 hard of a terabyte in this case for me 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.949
 It arrived a little late because for everyone and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.160
 not the most I think for me I think that for 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.160
 everyone who bought the xbox on day 1 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.680
 good at the beginning of the first months 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.800
 when the xbox one came out was not 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.149
 enough for all our games and 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.950
 in this case because I wanted to show them what 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.160
 that I bought in the news that the 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.440
 xbox one now for June in the USA already 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.509
 they are already selling it with a 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.090
 hard disk terabyte that then arrives 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.710
 late for many and what I love them 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.630
 ask and leave less comments 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.840
 this video is if a terabyte will be 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.990
 enough 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 the hardcore gamer that as you know 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.250
 since this issue came out of the new 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.319
 generations of consoles as always 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.020
 you have to update every time you put a 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:35.049
 I play sometimes three or two times 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.539
 week you have to update the game and 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.039
 well that space that consumes us and good 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.709
 in my case, I had to make myself 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.649
 a hard drive that is not cheap at all 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.810
 one data is a hard disk of two 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.799
 terabytes that has a cost 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.000
 approximately 2,000 100 weights 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.909
 this is what I'm seeing what they are 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.880
 watching right now in case you do not 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.920
 have an xbox and walk watching the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.719
 possibility of buying one because I think 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.969
 that this is the moment my question is yes 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.219
 one terabyte will be enough in my case 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.229
 I have two terabytes and I wanted to 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.629
 show what what I bought not this 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.430
 is a disc of the brand data is a disc 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:17.440
 hard of two terabytes is a usb 3.0 that 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.690
 is what he asks you and as you can see here 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.299
 bring with a touch to make a backup 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.700
 You can put vertical and horizontal 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.740
 a vertical use and translate a design 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.290
 innovative for heat sink 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.150
 and let's see more that is something very 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.690
 important 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.000
 sb 3.0 compatible with 2.0 but I think that 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 so you can use it in the xbox has 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.180
 to be 3.0 and as you can see is 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.150
 increase the speed four times by 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.330
 the fact of being a usb 3.0 than a usb 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.210
 2.0 me from computer systems I do not know 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.040
 I'm reading so much what comes here 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.570
 brings a backup system with a button 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.400
 that crushes you is here in the part of 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.680
 back and can do the backing of 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.960
 your files in this case I imagine that 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.490
 of video games and here comes the 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.440
 technical specification that we do not understand 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.080
 in detail and talks about a system 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.240
 required to be able to connect in this 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.580
 obviously, we connect it to what 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.940
 what is the xbox one and well this 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.870
 package brings the 3.5 inch disc 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.660
 external hard is a USB 3.0 cable a 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.030
 power adapter and what is the 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.430
 guarantee and the manual and by agent if 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.459
 your 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.920
 they decide to buy a hard drive that 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.900
 has an xbox one at this time 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.090
 I think it 's the most convenient thing 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.560
 buy another console with a hard drive 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.599
 a terabyte for those who do not have a 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.030
 xbox one console, I recommend them 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.739
 that you buy the xbox one with a 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.510
 terabyte for people I hope that they 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.829
 like this little video and see you in 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.829
 a next see you later
