00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Y 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.750
 in the 90s without the internet 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.580
 or other means of communication to 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.920
 exception of weekly programs and very 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.320
 shorts on television such as the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.300
 unforgettable in internal mania the gamers 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.550
 we have to give many times a 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.590
 leap of faith then without internet like today 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.100
 in day we do not know if the game which 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.230
 we were buying it was good to regulate 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.239
 bad or flat a kick in the balls 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.950
 of so bad that I was remembering that in 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.080
 many times the majority to be 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.540
 precise takes me just for the cover of 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.030
 a video game if I looked at it decently what 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.769
 changed or bought it for later 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.839
 get home and realize the 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.400
 scam that I had done in many 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.930
 I was waiting impatiently for the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.600
 weekly videogame program that 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.150
 I was looking to see gameplays photos and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.830
 news about new games but 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.890
 sometimes they only talked about games that 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.210
 I already had or had already acquired 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.070
 I remember going through a local sales 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.840
 magazines then back then it was so 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.729
 common see magazines posts like today 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.040
 in day but taco stands in all 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.140
 the streets I remember seeing a magazine of 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.229
 videogames which a shoestring 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.140
 I had to buy, I remember that time 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.730
 I was even with being to be able to 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.640
 to see the art of the magazine the current 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.070
 it's the father's tweets I stayed 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.040
 impressed the art the lyrics what 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.510
 it said automatically it caught my attention 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.610
 I remember that day was very early and 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.650
 He came to visit my aunt, because he helped him 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.000
 loading the bags of your order for 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.520
 to give me money to play in the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.740
 little machines sweet shopping or others but 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.630
 this time it was this magazine and already 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.940
 they know that when you're little you do what 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.250
 that is for money to vitiate good to 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.590
 less me after a while I got to 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.080
 my house I sat in an armchair and I put myself 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.660
 I only looked at it with my mouth 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.600
 open for all its content since 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.060
 analysis interviews tricks advances and 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.800
 project reports and endless things 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.649
 that we could find in this little 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.959
 gamer encyclopedia but to be honest 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.450
 almost at the beginning I did not read much about 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.940
 the reviews or tips what absorbed me 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.400
 were the images special mention to their 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.310
 covers simply a work of art 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.080
 each and every one of them from there 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.390
 I made a fan of many series that I did not know 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.020
 and that there they went out and showed with luxury 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.140
 details don king kong country mega 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.700
 starfox with the street fighter pay and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.320
 Clarin state are just some of the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.390
 sagas recognized thanks to this 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.700
 magnificent magazine that by the way was 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.650
 edited and founded by bush 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.110

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.150
 video games very understand you was going 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.160
 time and how everything evolves I left 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.020
 take on the internet like all 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.330
 others leaving the magazine relegated to 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.770
 background still from time to time 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.810
 I bought a number to remember 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.150
 those incredible times that I went through 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.830
 now for you it is very easy to know 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.410
 about a video game thanks to the internet 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.820
 but I want to take them to the past to one 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.670
 of the most important moments of my 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.230
 greg in which is this magazine I have a 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.170
 friend which even today 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.750
 is a mega fan to death of this magazine that 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.540
 even after 20 years he remained active 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.410
 to see part of his collection 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.260

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.970
 of nostalgia and much joy and as well as 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.550

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.950

 He said he would lend me three and then 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.800
 he was returning those were his words 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.050
 I know it hurt until the soul let go 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.230
 something so dear because I knew that I was going to 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.360
