00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.750
 hi everyone i am now is a co room 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.310
 we find ourselves again in ours 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 office to see other products 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.750
 regarding our our cameras 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.290
 loved video cameras right today i wanted to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.810
 tell you about a gopro accessory now 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.640
 used by many of ours 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.890
 customers and users in general 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.079
 we talk in particular about the three way 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.179
 the tweet is a product I buy 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.850
 however, it brought it to market 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:44.420
 quite recently we talk 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.480
 in the last year it is widely used date 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.820
 also the current fashion of 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.159
 do selphy especially with i 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.899
 copro devices creates short hours 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.440
 these very characteristic photos with 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.519
 wide angle at 170 degrees and freeway from the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.190
 possibility 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.430
 also uses cover to have we say 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.140
 three supports in one then now 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.649
 we go down a little more specifically and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.780
 let's see how this accessory works 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.830
 then this accessory has like 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.000
 main function we say that of 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.060
 racket and stretchable stick 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.100
 sensitive or as we want to call it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.100
 therefore logically it already has 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.630
 attack cover does not require 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.539
 special adapters for use 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.319
 with gopro then we will go to fix the 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.789
 our video camera directly 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.800
 on the pro attack via the video of 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.460
 fastening that comes supplied 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.049
 to all models of video cameras I cover 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.369
 besides we are other troubles like 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.710
 additional accessory 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.500
 so let's go directly to fix the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.319
 video camera at the end and so 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.420
 we get a racket and sensitive 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.580
 let's call it the advice I give 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.649
 always the one 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.049
 while using the three way it is 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.310
 that of trying to tighten the most 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.200
 possible the slot screws i why 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.260
 we will often use ours 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.270
 tribe is in a situation with gods 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.580
 stress forces and therefore not 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.900
 risk the weight of the camera 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.470
 go to weigh on the support and then 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.959
 bring it down when in short ha 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.160
 solicited is always better to tighten 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.400
 screws otherwise we would find ourselves in this 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.110
 situation that when we have the first le 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.390
 first stress our tribes and 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.000
 it will fall under the weight of the camera 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.060
 therefore it is important to observe the screws well 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.470
 the tribute to a different structure 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.200
 compared to 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.470
 then extendable classic rackets 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.560
 we have not a telescopic structure but 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.810
 in segments this gives us a big one 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.930
 advantage especially in the speech 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.970
 selphy because the video camera 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.700
 sorry for the racket will not be 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.670
 therefore visible in the frame 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.680
 the racket in this way we will avoid 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.020
 that the handle is visible 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.770
 in the image in the video in the photo that 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.920
 we are performing in addition to the function 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.370
 racket and sensitive the three way 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.760
 can be used or as a handle 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.600
 single now let's see how it's possible 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.510
 use it but in the single so we have 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.410
 this situation here we can use 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.430
 then in this way or if we want a 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.520
 as compact as possible 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.580
 we can however eliminate from our 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.100
 support 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.489
 the extension segments and then 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.440
 get a grip with an attachment though 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.870
 a single handle that can be 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.400
 used for many activities 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.520
 included in what also activity on 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.950
 boat because I do n't remember what to keep 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.680
 the gopro camera on a handle 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.860
 of the genre or however not to hold it 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.870
 directly in the hand can give the 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.580
 ability to create a video a video 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.620
 more stable than holding it 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.390
 this because because every minimum 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.950
 movement of our hand of ours 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.850
 however arm of our body comes 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.350
 transmitted directly to the camera 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.980
 so having a handle can 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.700
 facilitate video stabilization 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.790
 the tir in those besides being a 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.980
 let's say single handle so I have one 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.490
 racket and sensitive can become 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.130
 also a small and practical tripod of the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.950
 foot we extract it directly from the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.240
 back of the support then it 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.540
 we find just inside 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.390
 of the handle we can use it or 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.630
 so directly so have your own 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.320
 one small foot queen we have 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.850
 in the copro attack we have 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.920
 directly in attack against then 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.870
 we can fix the camera 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.660
 directly on our little one 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.480
 tripod or if we want to have a 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:13.040
 slightly higher tripod we can 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.300
 replace the cap and fix the 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.840
 tripod directly below 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.840
 the handle 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.880
 in this way then we get a 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.990
 slightly taller tripod 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:40.000
 alternatively you can also reassemble the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:42.010
 extension arm and therefore have a 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.200
 even higher tripod logically 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:49.270
 this tripod is not born for this 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.139
 type of use ie in the sense not 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.060
 we can use it with 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.530
 the extension arm if not in 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.449
 this case, however, we must have 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.090
 always the video camera aligned with the 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.949
 support because if we pull it down from 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.669
 this on this side logically the 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.680
 our support 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.509
 does not hold the weight of the camera e 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.960
 until it falls then always with the 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:14.310
 video camera possible mines with the 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.090
 support this product you can find it
