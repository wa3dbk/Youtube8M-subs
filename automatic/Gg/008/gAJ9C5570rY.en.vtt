the original plan we've ability
production<00:01:00.550> Julia<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:01.270> this<00:01:01.450> is<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.600> woman<00:01:02.010> I'm

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
production Julia so this is a woman I'm

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.430 
production Julia so this is a woman I'm
exploring<00:01:03.550> later<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:05.080> chilling<00:01:05.560> ahead<00:01:07.440> so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
exploring later not chilling ahead so

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.530 
exploring later not chilling ahead so
there's<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.160> lot<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.880> something<00:01:10.300> looks

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
there's a lot of something looks

there's a lot of something looks
complicated<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.880> want<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.180> speak<00:01:13.390> to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
complicated it is and I want to speak to

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.420 
complicated it is and I want to speak to
