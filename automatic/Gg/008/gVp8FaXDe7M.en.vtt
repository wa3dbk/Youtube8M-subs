00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.940
 and that the rhythm 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.380
 minecraft I follow the snapshots review 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.590
 weekly 12 w 42 and like every wednesday 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.280
 a new one is no no no no wait is 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.620
 Wednesday because if he did not come on Thursday 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.140
 which is supposed to leave tomorrow but 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.390
 that they have taken a tad ahead and have 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.940
 taken out today Wednesday therefore 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.379
 let's see what changes line here is the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 first the change and that is that they have 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.269
 modified our dear anvil now 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.430
 the crack teo is quite cheaper three 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.040
 metal ingots here unique metal in 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.259
 medium and three metal blocks in the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.259
 top and have also modified 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.399
 a little bit what would be the anvil 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.630
 now for example imagine that no 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.630
 we have another diamond breastplate 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.220
 protection 4 good well if we put the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.630
 material that is constituted the breastplate 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.310
 we could repair it I guess it's from 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.539
 metal then we could metal imagine that 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.479
 it's golden, so we could talk where 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.970
 leather leather and so the truth is that 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.260
 for example repairing a breastplate comes out very very 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.410
 all right 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.590
 repair a sword comes out pretty 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.260
 quite expensive since here there are more than two 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.830
 and the truth is that it is very very 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.770
 interesting this as you see I have changed 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.390
 the text with this enchantment 13 before 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.390
 it was not like that in green or with these 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.690
 letters and they have also changed this other 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.870
 text let's mix these perfect and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.540
 now he's going to put us too expensive on 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.830
 red because nothing the truth is that it is a 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.270
 small modification of the anvil but it 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.850
 thanks a lot and now it's pretty 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.040
 cheaper all enchantments and 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.410
 all the modifications and arrangements that 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.360
 do even the same crafter all 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.730
 the new menus for example options 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.840
 multiplayer that were previously in English 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.819
 the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.830
 updated and now we can have in 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.890
 the language that we choose for example if I 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.630
 I'm going here now I'll give like this and most 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.670
 social of the world kind of the world is 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.890
 flat customize all this before 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.800
 it was in English and now the whole limit 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.510
 superior templates and well this is not yet 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.980
 they have updated it but for example 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.800
 do you want to convert this template with 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.540
 someone uses the following and the truth is 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.970
 thank you very much that they have 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.670
 updated acquired a bat is 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.400
 That truth that you have as amended 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.520
 yes now our bats writings 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.470
 they break the crops or activate the 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.620
 keywords and for that then to put here 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:06.040
 eight thousand million 234 thousand 729 3 x 10 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.950
 raised to 7 and as you see we break the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.320
 crops do not activate the ti wise I'm going to 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.300
 stop by and I do I charge the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.030
 crops very well guys now 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.850
 we can explain the mother stone in 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.340
 survival to be able to get this 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.569
 kind of repeated no no no no no I'm 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.700
 planning 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.249
 now the repeaters look like a 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.439
 little bit like a transistor and that's 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:31.719
 they have a special quality 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.359
 I'm going to explain to you I have it here 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:37.359
 repeater that is lit by this 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.609
 torch that lights this lamp 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.650
 reston very well imagine that I put 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.709
 here a repeater and I give it current 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.889
 well this barrier appears and good as 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.560
 As you know, this repeater can not 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:53.169
 give energy to this, so see what happens 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.280
 tatxan has blocked the energy passed 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:59.079
 here and now if I remove this it goes off 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.840
 Well I'll explain to you another little thing 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.540
 imagine that this is blocked if I 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.519
 now the energy can not pass the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.879
 energy towards there because it's this 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.409
 barrier very the truth is that it is a 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.659
 new feature pretty 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.090
 interesting and the truth is that you can 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.699
 do enough little things and if not what 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.639
 you ask if I put several of these 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.440
 it will not be different or not much 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.729
 we're going to have is that we're going to have to 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.639
 turn this off and we'll have to turn off 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.759
 this so that the barrier is removed 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.830
 it was quite interesting you see these 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.219
 servers are from the hunger games 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.919
 You see the ip here, now with the new 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:42.819
 snapshot we can hide it hide 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.370
 address if accept and hidden now not 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.169
 you can know what was the ip and good 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.870
 Of course you can give it a few seconds back and 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.180
 see it but good the truth is that this 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.129
 It is very much appreciated and it is a very 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.770
 silly but that really has made me 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:59.680
 liked it so much here all the snap 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.439
 shot I hope you liked it a lot 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.379
 nothing else that has been a brief snapshot 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:07.150
 quite interesting is not that I have 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:10.000
 a lot of things but I liked it 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.360
 enough therefore I hope that I have 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.909
 I liked it a lot and I 'm another but before 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.419
 to leave I want to show you the new block 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.430
 and the letter well if we put five here 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.699
 melon blocks we put here three 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.060
 papers we should leave the key to the 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.189
 new dimension it seems that you 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.909
 I was surrounding but the crafter now 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:32.909
 a lot yes guys 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.170
 and
