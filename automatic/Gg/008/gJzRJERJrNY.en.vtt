00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
rabbits and set our one net so as you

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.759 
rabbits and set our one net so as you
can<00:01:01.059> see<00:01:01.329> there's<00:01:01.570> enough<00:01:01.839> rabbit<00:01:02.199> damage<00:01:02.530> on

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769

this small farm and a hidden bottle

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.340 
this small farm and a hidden bottle
could<00:01:05.740> present<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.190> danger<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.759> these<00:01:06.909> horses
