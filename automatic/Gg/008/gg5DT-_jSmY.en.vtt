00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
out this is pretty much one of the more

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.690 
out this is pretty much one of the more
permanent<00:01:04.680> methods<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.339> will<00:01:05.549> just

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
permanent methods and this will just

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
permanent methods and this will just
sort<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.939> grow<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.330> I'm<00:01:07.200> usually<00:01:07.409> after<00:01:07.860> about

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
sort of grow out I'm usually after about

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.539 
sort of grow out I'm usually after about
four<00:01:08.880> months<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.560> find<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.830> time<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.189> sort<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
four months I find it's time to sort of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.880 
four months I find it's time to sort of
take<00:01:11.729> them<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.390> take<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.200> catch<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.710> your

that just helps to release them and then

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.940 
that just helps to release them and then
with<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:20.430> nice<00:01:20.580> handy<00:01:20.880> pliers<00:01:21.830> it'll<00:01:22.830> only

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
with some nice handy pliers it'll only

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.770 
with some nice handy pliers it'll only
here<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> second<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.540> basically

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
here for a second to just basically

break the seal and then they just sort
of<00:01:26.729> slide<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.869> looks<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.229> cool<00:01:29.150> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
of slide right out that looks so cool it
