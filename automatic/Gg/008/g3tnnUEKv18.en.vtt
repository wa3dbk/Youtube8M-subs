few exciting changes one of the big ones
is<00:00:21.060> we've<00:00:21.750> added<00:00:22.050> what's<00:00:22.890> called<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> module

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
is we've added what's called the module

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.300 
is we've added what's called the module
and<00:00:23.970> preset<00:00:24.330> system<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.289> what<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.920> does<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and preset system so what that does is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.339 
and preset system so what that does is
it<00:00:26.609> allows<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.869> really<00:00:28.019> built

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it allows it's really it's really built

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.890 
it allows it's really it's really built
for<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.250> new<00:00:29.340> players<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.689> players

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
for the new players or for the players

who really just want to see some changes
to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> plane<00:00:33.300> may<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.570> upgraded<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.230> little

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
to the plane may be upgraded a little

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.569 
to the plane may be upgraded a little
bit<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:35.010> want<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> spend<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> lot

of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> time<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> dig<00:00:36.510> deep<00:00:36.809> into<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
of the time to kind of dig deep into the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the nuts and bolts or the the theory

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840 
the nuts and bolts or the the theory
crafting<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.350> min<00:00:40.530> maxing<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.489> we're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
crafting and the min maxing so we're

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.510 
crafting and the min maxing so we're
we're<00:00:42.390> putting<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> module<00:00:43.379> module<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
we're putting in this module module and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
we're putting in this module module and
preset<00:00:44.940> system<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.420> allows<00:00:45.600> people<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.960> say

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
preset system that allows people to say

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
preset system that allows people to say
oh<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.039> want<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:47.910> bit

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
Japanese planes is that like tanks we

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
Japanese planes is that like tanks we
have<00:01:30.240> different<00:01:30.630> types<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.530> planes<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.950> will

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
have different types of planes that will

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.830 
have different types of planes that will
be<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> game<00:01:32.580> so<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.030> light<00:01:33.480> fighters

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
be in the game so there's light fighters

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.530 
be in the game so there's light fighters
heavy<00:01:34.050> fighters<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> ground<00:01:35.220> us<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.540> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
heavy fighters and ground us all and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.750 
heavy fighters and ground us all and
then<00:01:36.900> there's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:37.800> something<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.610> bit

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
then there's a there's something a bit

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.730 
then there's a there's something a bit
different<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.270> things<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.690> that<00:01:39.870> nations

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
different for things and that nations

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.190 
different for things and that nations
will<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> little<00:01:41.370> specialty<00:01:41.730> class<00:01:42.200> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
will have a little specialty class and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
will have a little specialty class and
the<00:01:43.680> Japanese<00:01:44.220> specialty<00:01:44.610> classes<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the Japanese specialty classes the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.120 
the Japanese specialty classes the
carrier-based<00:01:45.540> planes<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.830> little<00:01:46.980> bit

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
carrier-based planes so a little bit

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.670 
carrier-based planes so a little bit
lighter<00:01:47.280> more<00:01:48.060> nimble<00:01:48.450> great<00:01:49.230> dog<00:01:49.410> fighting

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
lighter more nimble great dog fighting

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.270 
lighter more nimble great dog fighting
playing<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.930> we're<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.680> looking<00:01:52.920> forward

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
playing and we're really looking forward

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.390 
playing and we're really looking forward
to<00:01:53.310> seeing<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.850> end<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:55.160> min<00:01:56.160> ago<00:01:56.370> we

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
to seeing it in the end so I min ago we

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.980 
to seeing it in the end so I min ago we
were<00:01:56.550> just<00:01:56.670> talking<00:01:57.060> about<00:01:57.120> eight<00:01:57.630> point<00:01:57.870> 0

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
were just talking about eight point 0

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.280 
were just talking about eight point 0
and<00:01:58.170> world<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> tanks<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.240> are<00:02:00.240> those<00:02:00.900> physics

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and world of tanks and are those physics

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.980 
and world of tanks and are those physics
is<00:02:01.800> coming<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.670> world<00:02:03.150> war<00:02:03.360> planes<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.810> well

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
is coming to world war planes as well

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.930 
is coming to world war planes as well
well<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.940> interesting<00:02:05.940> question<00:02:06.330> but<00:02:07.250> as<00:02:08.250> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
well a interesting question but as you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.430 
well a interesting question but as you
can<00:02:09.030> see<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:09.420> kind<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> physics<00:02:10.170> change

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
can see that kind of physics change

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.590 
can see that kind of physics change
wouldn't<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.010> as<00:02:11.130> much<00:02:11.450> application<00:02:12.450> in

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
wouldn't have as much application in

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.960 
wouldn't have as much application in
planes<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.860> crash<00:02:14.100> into<00:02:14.250> somebody<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.730> midair

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
planes you crash into somebody in midair

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.530 
planes you crash into somebody in midair
you're<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.750> die<00:02:16.020> you're<00:02:16.500> plummeting<00:02:17.540> so

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
you're going to die you're plummeting so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.510 
you're going to die you're plummeting so
there<00:02:18.840> isn't<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.380> kind<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.830> component<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
there isn't that kind of component of

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.150 
there isn't that kind of component of
the<00:02:20.700> physics<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.720> what<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.800> see<00:02:23.070> in

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the physics but what you do see in

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.949 
the physics but what you do see in
planes<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.760> very<00:02:23.940> similar<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.750> when

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
planes that is very similar is that when

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.470 
planes that is very similar is that when
your<00:02:25.140> plane<00:02:25.410> takes<00:02:25.680> damage<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.300> get

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
your plane takes damage like if you get

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.270 
your plane takes damage like if you get
holes<00:02:27.720> punched<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> wings<00:02:28.920> or<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
holes punched in in the wings or in the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.699 
holes punched in in the wings or in the
tail<00:02:29.520> or<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.630> engine<00:02:30.959> gets<00:02:31.050> shot<00:02:31.320> up<00:02:31.350> that

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
tail or the engine gets shot up that

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.800 
tail or the engine gets shot up that
does<00:02:32.040> change<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.670> dynamics<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.390> plane<00:02:33.600> so

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
does change the dynamics of the plane so

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.170 
does change the dynamics of the plane so
if<00:02:33.900> your<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.440> your<00:02:34.500> plane<00:02:34.920> wing<00:02:35.520> does<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.970> shot

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
if your if your plane wing does get shot

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.210 
if your if your plane wing does get shot
up<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.630> changes<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.170> lift<00:02:37.410> or<00:02:37.709> your<00:02:37.860> ability

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
up it changes the lift or your ability

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.600 
up it changes the lift or your ability
to<00:02:38.340> turn<00:02:38.570> maybe<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:39.930> ability<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.560> do<00:02:41.400> certain

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
to turn maybe your ability to do certain

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.360 
to turn maybe your ability to do certain
maneuvers<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:43.440> kind<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.739> real<00:02:43.920> physics

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
maneuvers so that kind of real physics

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.420 
maneuvers so that kind of real physics
is<00:02:44.550> there<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.290> it's<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:47.010> pretty<00:02:47.220> cool

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
is there and it's a it's a pretty cool

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.490 
is there and it's a it's a pretty cool
component<00:02:48.000> another<00:02:48.510> place<00:02:49.019> where<00:02:49.200> you'll<00:02:49.350> see

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
component another place where you'll see

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.780 
component another place where you'll see
physics<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.040> one<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> war<00:02:50.370> planes<00:02:50.610> is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
physics and one of the war planes is

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.360 
physics and one of the war planes is
that<00:02:51.410> based<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.560> how<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.800> spec<00:02:53.190> you're

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
that based on how you spec you're

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.190 
that based on how you spec you're
playing<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.910> armaments<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.900> types<00:02:55.110> of

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
playing the armaments so the types of

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.840 
playing the armaments so the types of
machine<00:02:55.500> guns<00:02:55.530> or<00:02:56.250> whether<00:02:56.400> or<00:02:56.519> not<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.730> go

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
machine guns or whether or not you go

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.220 
machine guns or whether or not you go
with<00:02:57.000> bombs<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:59.580> bombs<00:02:59.820> are<00:03:00.030> pretty<00:03:00.269> heavy<00:03:00.510> so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
with bombs the bombs are pretty heavy so

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.860 
with bombs the bombs are pretty heavy so
when<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.519> bomb<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.090> plane<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
when you have the bomb on the plane the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.270 
when you have the bomb on the plane the
plane<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.290> going<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.470> fly<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> lot<00:03:04.920> different

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
plane is going to fly a lot different

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.070 
plane is going to fly a lot different
because<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.610> weighing<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.090> down<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.870> won't

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
because it's weighing it down you won't

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.360 
because it's weighing it down you won't
be<00:03:07.200> as<00:03:07.290> nimble<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.739> won't<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:07.980> able<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.220> turn

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
be as nimble you won't be able to turn

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.540 
be as nimble you won't be able to turn
or<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.880> accelerate<00:03:09.360> our<00:03:09.480> climate<00:03:09.930> I've<00:03:10.110> as<00:03:10.980> you

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
or to accelerate our climate I've as you

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.370 
or to accelerate our climate I've as you
would<00:03:11.760> without<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.300> but<00:03:12.510> once<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.840> drop<00:03:13.140> it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
would without it but once you drop it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.830 
would without it but once you drop it
now<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.340> frees<00:03:15.060> up<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.330> ton<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.660> weight<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
now it frees up a ton of weight on the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.259 
now it frees up a ton of weight on the
feel<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:16.989> so<00:03:17.590> how<00:03:17.920> do<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.310> clouds<00:03:18.819> and<00:03:19.060> Sun

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
feel that so how do the clouds and Sun

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.100 
feel that so how do the clouds and Sun
dynamics<00:03:19.870> come<00:03:20.019> in<00:03:20.170> okay<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:21.629> there's<00:03:22.629> there's

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
dynamics come in okay so there's there's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.540 
dynamics come in okay so there's there's
a<00:03:23.230> new<00:03:23.349> cloud<00:03:23.560> system<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.069> just<00:03:24.220> went<00:03:24.370> into

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
a new cloud system that just went into

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.300 
a new cloud system that just went into
the<00:03:24.640> game<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.900> cloud<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.650> Sun<00:03:26.920> also

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
the game and the cloud and the Sun also

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.809 
the game and the cloud and the Sun also
play<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.550> very<00:03:27.819> key<00:03:28.209> component<00:03:28.810> in<00:03:28.930> how<00:03:29.319> you<00:03:29.379> fly

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
play a very key component in how you fly

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.570 
play a very key component in how you fly
how<00:03:30.819> you<00:03:31.450> devise<00:03:32.230> some<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.560> your<00:03:32.650> tactics<00:03:32.860> so

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
how you devise some of your tactics so

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.280 
how you devise some of your tactics so
if<00:03:33.760> you're<00:03:33.940> getting<00:03:34.299> chased<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.959> want<00:03:35.200> to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
if you're getting chased or you want to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.979 
if you're getting chased or you want to
strategize<00:03:36.190> an<00:03:36.340> ambush<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:37.299> can<00:03:37.629> go<00:03:37.750> up<00:03:37.780> into

the clouds and you won't the target will
lose<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:42.040> um<00:03:42.310> or<00:03:42.849> if<00:03:43.330> you're<00:03:43.510> strategizing<00:03:44.260> an

lose you um or if you're strategizing an
ambush<00:03:44.739> they<00:03:45.040> won't<00:03:45.220> be<00:03:45.340> able<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.610> see<00:03:45.790> that

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
ambush they won't be able to see that

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.110 
ambush they won't be able to see that
you're<00:03:46.060> up<00:03:46.180> there<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:47.310> really<00:03:48.310> cool<00:03:48.580> dynamics

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
you're up there so really cool dynamics

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.120 
you're up there so really cool dynamics
the<00:03:49.630> way<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.959> Sun<00:03:50.140> plays<00:03:50.410> into<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.769> is<00:03:50.980> it

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
the way the Sun plays into it is it

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.270 
the way the Sun plays into it is it
let's<00:03:51.400> say<00:03:51.519> you're<00:03:51.640> getting<00:03:51.849> chased<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:53.280> you

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
let's say you're getting chased and you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.979 
let's say you're getting chased and you
want<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.030> try<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.209> get<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.510> guy<00:03:55.630> off<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.930> your

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
want to try to get that guy off of your

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.020 
want to try to get that guy off of your
tail<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.950> go<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:57.250> fly<00:03:57.459> up<00:03:57.640> towards<00:03:57.940> the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
tail you can go and fly up towards the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.970 
tail you can go and fly up towards the
Sun<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.540> it's<00:03:58.750> going<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:58.959> provide<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.709> glare

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
Sun and it's going to provide the glare

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.860 
Sun and it's going to provide the glare
and<00:04:00.220> maybe<00:04:01.000> give<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.299> an<00:04:01.390> opportunity<00:04:01.540> to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
and maybe give you an opportunity to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.990 
and maybe give you an opportunity to
kind<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.260> slip<00:04:02.799> away<00:04:02.950> while<00:04:03.310> he's<00:04:03.519> distracted

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
kind of slip away while he's distracted

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.750 
kind of slip away while he's distracted
by<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.510> Sun<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.440> really<00:04:06.310> interesting

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
by the Sun so really interesting

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.000 
by the Sun so really interesting
components<00:04:07.239> coming<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:07.569> there<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.870> know<00:04:08.739> you

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
components coming in there I know you

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.500 
components coming in there I know you
guys<00:04:09.099> are<00:04:09.160> using<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.640> environment<00:04:10.239> just<00:04:10.360> a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
guys are using the environment just a

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.210 
guys are using the environment just a
little<00:04:10.690> bit<00:04:10.780> more<00:04:10.930> between<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.530> physics<00:04:11.980> and

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
little bit more between the physics and

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.220 
little bit more between the physics and
that<00:04:12.370> we<00:04:13.180> are<00:04:13.209> so<00:04:13.599> one<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.930> things<00:04:13.989> that

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
that we are so one of the things that

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.620 
that we are so one of the things that
that<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.280> designers<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.150> developers<00:04:16.239> have

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
that the designers and developers have

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.479 
that the designers and developers have
done<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.049> actually<00:04:17.440> lowered<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:18.130> fighting

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
done is it actually lowered the fighting

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.350 
done is it actually lowered the fighting
ceiling<00:04:18.880> so<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.449> it<00:04:19.810> does<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:21.609> does<00:04:22.030> make<00:04:22.240> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
ceiling so that it does it does make the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.879 
ceiling so that it does it does make the
battle<00:04:22.660> closer<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.169> ground<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.650> the

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
battle closer to the ground so that the

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.820 
battle closer to the ground so that the
ground<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.870> buildings<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.500> trees

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
ground and the buildings and the trees

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.469 
ground and the buildings and the trees
and<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.160> canyons<00:04:27.639> and<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.910> bridges<00:04:28.300> and

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
and the canyons and the bridges and

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.450 
and the canyons and the bridges and
things<00:04:28.630> like<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.810> become<00:04:29.350> they<00:04:29.950> also<00:04:30.100> become

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
things like that become they also become

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.250 
things like that become they also become
strategic<00:04:30.970> components<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:31.690> if<00:04:31.840> you<00:04:31.960> want<00:04:32.200> to

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
strategic components so if you want to

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.230 
strategic components so if you want to
try<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.470> lose<00:04:32.710> somebody<00:04:32.919> in<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.190> canyon<00:04:33.400> or<00:04:33.729> get

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
try to lose somebody in a canyon or get

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.570 
try to lose somebody in a canyon or get
them<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:34.510> crash<00:04:34.750> into<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.080> bridge<00:04:35.410> or<00:04:35.680> into<00:04:36.010> you

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
them the crash into a bridge or into you

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.330 
them the crash into a bridge or into you
know<00:04:36.700> let's<00:04:36.970> say<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.060> natural<00:04:37.570> land<00:04:38.070> bridge<00:04:39.070> you

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
know let's say a natural land bridge you

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.510 
know let's say a natural land bridge you
can<00:04:39.370> do<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:39.789> what<00:04:40.720> about<00:04:40.810> customization<00:04:42.960> so

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
can do that what about customization so

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.159 
can do that what about customization so
the<00:04:45.520> customization<00:04:46.210> component<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.780> World<00:04:47.050> of

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
the customization component of World of

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.300 
the customization component of World of
Warplanes<00:04:47.289> is<00:04:47.650> actually<00:04:47.889> something<00:04:48.070> we're

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
Warplanes is actually something we're

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.900 
Warplanes is actually something we're
really<00:04:48.340> excited<00:04:48.760> about<00:04:49.000> planes<00:04:49.930> are<00:04:50.820> tanks<00:04:51.820> at

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
really excited about planes are tanks at

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.240 
really excited about planes are tanks at
the<00:04:51.940> moments<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.419> little<00:04:52.720> limited<00:04:53.250> partly

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
the moments a little limited partly

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.360 
the moments a little limited partly
because<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:55.840> don't<00:04:56.110> want<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.620> take<00:04:56.830> away<00:04:56.979> from

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
because you don't want to take away from

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.879 
because you don't want to take away from
the<00:04:57.580> camel<00:04:58.539> component<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.229> tank<00:04:59.470> too<00:04:59.680> much

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
the camel component of the tank too much

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.600 
the camel component of the tank too much
even<00:05:00.580> though<00:05:00.700> you<00:05:00.760> do<00:05:01.030> see<00:05:01.300> some<00:05:02.400> some<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.520> that

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
even though you do see some some of that

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.379 
even though you do see some some of that
happening<00:05:04.090> in<00:05:04.300> history<00:05:05.169> most<00:05:05.500> of<00:05:05.680> it<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:05.919> is

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
happening in history most of it is is

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.210 
happening in history most of it is is
camo<00:05:07.389> because<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.169> camel<00:05:08.560> was<00:05:08.680> relevant<00:05:09.039> to

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
camo because the camel was relevant to

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.490 
camo because the camel was relevant to
the<00:05:09.580> tank<00:05:09.820> with<00:05:10.419> planes<00:05:10.720> we<00:05:11.020> have<00:05:11.169> a<00:05:11.200> lot<00:05:11.380> more

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
the tank with planes we have a lot more

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.390 
the tank with planes we have a lot more
