00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.929 

for<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
for the

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.530 
for the
new<00:02:09.569> OS

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
new OS

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.250 
new OS
now<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.500> saw<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.920> spacebar<00:02:14.489> there<00:02:15.170> when<00:02:16.170> I

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
now you saw in the spacebar there when I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.640 
now you saw in the spacebar there when I
typed<00:02:16.530> OS<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:18.590> didn't<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.890> time<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:23.819> had

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
typed OS I didn't do that time it had

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.140 
typed OS I didn't do that time it had
gave<00:02:25.650> me<00:02:25.799> an<00:02:25.860> option<00:02:26.129> on<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> spacebar<00:02:26.909> to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
gave me an option on the spacebar to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.440 
gave me an option on the spacebar to
auto<00:02:27.569> correct<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:29.099> spelling<00:02:29.819> mistake

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
auto correct the spelling mistake

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.899 
auto correct the spelling mistake
because<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.110> knew<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.829> should<00:02:32.670> be

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
because it knew that it should be

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.449 
because it knew that it should be
uppercase

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.910 

so<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.420> keyboard<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.109> a<00:02:39.349> really<00:02:39.739> awesome
