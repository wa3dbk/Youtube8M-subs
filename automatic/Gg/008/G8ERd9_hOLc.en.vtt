lot differently than us but you know
they<00:04:01.640> have<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.790> lot<00:04:01.940> more<00:04:02.090> storage<00:04:02.480> space<00:04:02.660> but

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
they have a lot more storage space but

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.960 
they have a lot more storage space but
we've<00:04:03.530> created<00:04:03.860> a<00:04:04.100> lot<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.370> space<00:04:04.580> on<00:04:04.790> there

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
we've created a lot of space on there

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.460 
we've created a lot of space on there
and<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> lot<00:04:05.240> of<00:04:05.300> comfort<00:04:05.630> and<00:04:05.900> it's<00:04:06.170> it's

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
and a lot of comfort and it's it's

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.130 
and a lot of comfort and it's it's
purely<00:04:06.800> variety<00:04:07.340> recovery<00:04:07.820> so<00:04:08.120> it's<00:04:08.690> not<00:04:08.900> done

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
purely variety recovery so it's not done
