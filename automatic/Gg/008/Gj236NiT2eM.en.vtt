catalytic<00:00:07.349> stoves<00:00:07.769> use<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> catalytic

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:08.640 
catalytic stoves use a catalytic

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.880 
catalytic stoves use a catalytic
combustor<00:00:09.270> to<00:00:09.510> recirculate<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.260> burn<00:00:10.680> the

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:10.890 
combustor to recirculate and burn the

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.440 
combustor to recirculate and burn the
smoke<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.340> otherwise<00:00:11.790> would<00:00:12.120> leave<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
smoke that otherwise would leave the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.440 
smoke that otherwise would leave the
chimney<00:00:12.810> as<00:00:12.990> dirty<00:00:13.380> wasted<00:00:14.040> fuel<00:00:14.450> unlike
