hi<00:00:00.359> I'm<00:00:00.570> Steve<00:00:00.840> Jones<00:00:00.870> and<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.500> going<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.890> show

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to show

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.930 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.820> solve<00:00:03.240> linear<00:00:03.890> inequalities<00:00:04.940> now

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
you how to solve linear inequalities now

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.780 
you how to solve linear inequalities now
there<00:00:06.150> are<00:00:06.180> one<00:00:06.359> or<00:00:06.390> two<00:00:06.680> tricks<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:08.220> this

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
there are one or two tricks about this

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.080 
there are one or two tricks about this
that<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.120> don't<00:00:09.360> get<00:00:09.540> when<00:00:09.599> you're<00:00:09.960> solving

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
that you don't get when you're solving

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.810 
that you don't get when you're solving
linear<00:00:12.090> equations<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> let's<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.490> look<00:00:14.670> at

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
linear equations so let's just look at

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.470 
linear equations so let's just look at
this<00:00:14.969> carefully<00:00:15.920> here<00:00:16.920> we've<00:00:17.160> got<00:00:17.190> 4x<00:00:17.699> minus<00:00:18.060> 2

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
this carefully here we've got 4x minus 2

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.220 
this carefully here we've got 4x minus 2
and<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.080> less<00:00:19.470> than<00:00:19.800> eight<00:00:20.779> just<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.930> warning

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and it is less than eight just a warning

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:33.350 
and it is less than eight just a warning
is<00:00:23.359> that<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:26.060> multiply<00:00:28.699> or<00:00:29.699> divide<00:00:29.929> by<00:00:32.360> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
is that if we multiply or divide by a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.650 
is that if we multiply or divide by a
negative<00:00:33.420> number<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:35.280> must<00:00:36.210> change<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:38.660> for

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
negative number we must change that for

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.979 
negative number we must change that for
that<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.290> vice<00:00:40.800> versa<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.420> little<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that or vice versa just a little one to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
that or vice versa just a little one to
remember<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> something<00:00:44.430> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
remember because this is something that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
remember because this is something that
people<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.379> suddenly<00:00:46.530> finally

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
people do and then they suddenly finally

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.779 
people do and then they suddenly finally
got<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> wrong<00:00:47.370> answer<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.789> don't<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.180> why

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
got the wrong answer and don't know why

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.150 
got the wrong answer and don't know why
here<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:52.890> deal<00:00:53.129> with

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
here we know we can actually deal with

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
here we know we can actually deal with
it<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.670> though<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.920> equation<00:00:56.030> but<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it as though it is an equation but it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.260 
it as though it is an equation but it
isn't<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.780> inequality<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:59.010> 4x<00:00:59.370> minus<00:00:59.820> two

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
isn't it's an inequality so 4x minus two

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.889 
isn't it's an inequality so 4x minus two
is<00:01:00.480> eight<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.600> same

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
is eight so what we can do is the same

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.270 
is eight so what we can do is the same
to<00:01:04.110> both<00:01:04.260> sides<00:01:04.939> because<00:01:05.939> after<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:07.280> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to both sides because after all if that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.630 
to both sides because after all if that
is<00:01:08.610> less<00:01:09.240> than<00:01:09.479> eight<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.350> add<00:01:10.590> two<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
is less than eight and I add two to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.630 
is less than eight and I add two to
there<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> add<00:01:12.330> two<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:14.189> this

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
there and add two to there it is this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.219 
there and add two to there it is this
site<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.939> still<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.900> bigger<00:01:16.110> than

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
site is still going to be bigger than

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.320 
site is still going to be bigger than
that<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.150> add<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:19.229> hear<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.610> add<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that so if I add to hear and I add to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.550 
that so if I add to hear and I add to
hear<00:01:21.630> they're<00:01:21.810> still<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.470> equal

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
hear they're still going to be equal

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.719 
hear they're still going to be equal
this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> idea<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:25.430> six<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
this is the idea here we have six and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.350 
this is the idea here we have six and
here<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.210> 88<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.500> bigger<00:01:28.860> than<00:01:29.070> six<00:01:29.460> but

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
here we have 88 is bigger than six but

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.170 
here we have 88 is bigger than six but
if<00:01:30.450> i<00:01:30.570> add<00:01:30.750> 2<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.259> ATEC<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.740> 10<00:01:32.070> add<00:01:32.640> 2<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
if i add 2 to the ATEC a 10 add 2 to the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.480 
if i add 2 to the ATEC a 10 add 2 to the
six<00:01:33.479> i<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.810> 8-10<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.829> still<00:01:35.070> bigger<00:01:35.280> than

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
six i get 8-10 is still bigger than

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.780 
six i get 8-10 is still bigger than
eight<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.329> hasn't<00:01:36.659> changed<00:01:36.720> things<00:01:37.579> so<00:01:38.579> what

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
eight it hasn't changed things so what

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.710 
eight it hasn't changed things so what
I'm<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.979> evaluate<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.720> 4x

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I'm now going to do is evaluate this 4x

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.460 
I'm now going to do is evaluate this 4x
minus<00:01:43.259> two<00:01:43.770> plus<00:01:44.670> two<00:01:44.850> will<00:01:45.810> leave<00:01:46.020> me<00:01:46.259> with

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
minus two plus two will leave me with

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.819 
minus two plus two will leave me with
just<00:01:46.680> four<00:01:47.369> X<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:50.090> I'll<00:01:51.090> still<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.930> my<00:01:52.500> less

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
just four X here I'll still have my less

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
just four X here I'll still have my less
than<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> I've<00:01:53.970> got<00:01:54.210> eight<00:01:54.450> plus<00:01:55.110> two<00:01:56.420> that's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
than and I've got eight plus two that's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.280 
than and I've got eight plus two that's
10<00:01:58.880> well<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.390> seems<00:02:00.750> fairly

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
10 well that's it seems fairly

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.840 
10 well that's it seems fairly
straightforward<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> must<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
straightforward so what I must do now is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.710 
straightforward so what I must do now is
/<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.380> both<00:02:07.380> sides<00:02:07.829> sign<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.610> by<00:02:08.789> two<00:02:08.849> by<00:02:09.239> four

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
/ to both sides sign up by two by four

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.070 
/ to both sides sign up by two by four
don't<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.349> divide<00:02:10.739> by<00:02:10.979> 4<00:02:11.599> because<00:02:12.599> I've<00:02:12.930> got

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
don't I divide by 4 because I've got

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.670 
don't I divide by 4 because I've got
four

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
four

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.490 
four
okay<00:02:14.579> and<00:02:14.849> i<00:02:14.909> divide<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.359> side<00:02:15.659> by<00:02:15.900> four<00:02:16.260> as

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
okay and i divide this side by four as

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.890 
okay and i divide this side by four as
well<00:02:16.769> okay<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.359> 4x<00:02:18.780> divided<00:02:19.739> by<00:02:20.040> 4<00:02:20.489> we'll<00:02:21.239> just

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
well okay so 4x divided by 4 we'll just

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.479 
well okay so 4x divided by 4 we'll just
give<00:02:22.109> me<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> plane<00:02:22.739> X<00:02:24.140> I've<00:02:25.140> still<00:02:25.680> got<00:02:25.920> less

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
give me a plane X I've still got less

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.509 
give me a plane X I've still got less
than<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:27.319> I've<00:02:28.319> got<00:02:29.099> 10<00:02:29.430> /<00:02:30.000> 4<00:02:30.629> or<00:02:31.170> 2<00:02:31.590> 48<00:02:32.040> so

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
than and I've got 10 / 4 or 2 48 so

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.559 
than and I've got 10 / 4 or 2 48 so
that's<00:02:32.639> 2.5<00:02:33.030> or<00:02:33.750> two<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.349> half<00:02:35.090> okay<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.180> X

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
that's 2.5 or two and a half okay so X

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.670 
that's 2.5 or two and a half okay so X
is<00:02:36.870> two<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.280> half<00:02:38.519> or<00:02:39.150> two<00:02:39.349> point<00:02:40.349> five

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
is two and a half or two point five

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.250 
is two and a half or two point five
depending<00:02:41.219> on<00:02:41.340> how<00:02:41.549> you're<00:02:42.150> asked<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.599> express

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
depending on how you're asked to express

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.390 
depending on how you're asked to express
the<00:02:43.889> result<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.919> essentially<00:02:46.919> what<00:02:47.189> we're

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the result so essentially what we're

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.729 
the result so essentially what we're
saying<00:02:47.609> here<00:02:47.700> we've<00:02:48.150> solved<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.989> quality<00:02:49.500> we

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
saying here we've solved the quality we

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.750 
saying here we've solved the quality we
know<00:02:49.919> that<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.370> value<00:02:50.849> of<00:02:51.000> x<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.540> less<00:02:51.599> than

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
know that the value of x is less than

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.000 
know that the value of x is less than
two<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.939> half<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.419> 2.5<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:55.439> could<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.769> one

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
two and a half or 2.5 so it could be one

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.539 
two and a half or 2.5 so it could be one
it<00:02:56.430> could<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.849> zero<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:58.099> cannot<00:02:59.099> be<00:03:00.709> 2.5<00:03:01.709> x<00:03:02.219> is

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
it could be zero it cannot be 2.5 x is

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.800 
it could be zero it cannot be 2.5 x is
not<00:03:02.760> equal<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.480> 2.5<00:03:04.319> it's<00:03:04.650> less<00:03:05.159> than<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.480> it

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
not equal to 2.5 it's less than so it

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.740 
not equal to 2.5 it's less than so it
can't<00:03:07.109> be<00:03:07.230> equal<00:03:07.859> to<00:03:07.950> 2.5<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.879> it<00:03:09.269> can't<00:03:09.540> be

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
can't be equal to 2.5 and it can't be

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.610 
can't be equal to 2.5 and it can't be
three<00:03:10.139> or<00:03:10.379> four<00:03:10.799> or<00:03:11.069> whatever<00:03:11.879> after<00:03:12.659> that<00:03:12.870> so

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
three or four or whatever after that so

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.909 
three or four or whatever after that so
here<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.519> X<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:16.639> there<00:03:17.639> is<00:03:18.019> 2.5<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.620> fact

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
here is X and there is 2.5 so in fact

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.909 
here is X and there is 2.5 so in fact
our<00:03:23.250> number<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.440> everything<00:03:26.540> x<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.989> everything

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
our number is everything x is everything

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.879 
our number is everything x is everything
less<00:03:29.639> than<00:03:30.109> 2.5<00:03:31.579> but<00:03:32.579> not<00:03:32.879> equal<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.930> 2.5<00:03:34.590> so

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
less than 2.5 but not equal to 2.5 so

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.179 
less than 2.5 but not equal to 2.5 so
that<00:03:35.129> is<00:03:35.340> how<00:03:35.549> we<00:03:35.609> solve<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.449> linear<00:03:37.189> inequality

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
that is how we solve a linear inequality

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.960 
that is how we solve a linear inequality
and<00:03:38.370> remember<00:03:39.000> if<00:03:39.409> I<00:03:40.409> did<00:03:40.439> come<00:03:41.250> if<00:03:41.579> this<00:03:41.760> was

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
and remember if I did come if this was

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.770 
and remember if I did come if this was
minus<00:03:42.659> 4x<00:03:43.729> then<00:03:44.729> I'd<00:03:45.030> have<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.299> be<00:03:45.569> very

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
minus 4x then I'd have to be very

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.929 
minus 4x then I'd have to be very
careful<00:03:46.139> because<00:03:46.530> when<00:03:46.829> i<00:03:46.859> multiplied<00:03:47.639> by<00:03:47.909> a

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
careful because when i multiplied by a

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.390 
careful because when i multiplied by a
minus<00:03:48.780> here<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.799> have<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.699> change<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.299> round

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
minus here I have to change this round

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.090 
minus here I have to change this round
okay<00:03:53.400> good<00:03:53.879> luck
