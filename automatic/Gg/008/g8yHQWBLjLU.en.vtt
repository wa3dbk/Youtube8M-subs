look<00:00:07.170> into<00:00:07.680> AC<00:00:08.040> voltage<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:09.030> human<00:00:09.929> ribcage

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
look into AC voltage on human ribcage

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.039 
look into AC voltage on human ribcage
and<00:00:10.740> as<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.639> see<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> model<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
and as you can see we have a model of a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.220 
and as you can see we have a model of a
rib<00:00:13.200> cage<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.679> front<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.040> us<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.960> we<00:00:15.960> also<00:00:16.080> have

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
rib cage in front of us and we also have

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.279 
rib cage in front of us and we also have
a<00:00:16.440> multimeter<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:18.060> multimeter<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.900> actually

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
a multimeter this multimeter is actually

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.189 
a multimeter this multimeter is actually
connected<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.039> ground<00:00:20.869> outside<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> house

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
connected to ground outside the house

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
connected to ground outside the house
and<00:00:23.359> we<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.840> positive<00:00:25.289> Pro<00:00:25.580> go<00:00:26.580> again<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and we have positive Pro go again to the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.759 
and we have positive Pro go again to the
top<00:00:27.810> rope<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.470> our<00:00:28.650> ribcage<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:30.560> machine<00:00:31.560> see

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
top rope of our ribcage and machine see

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.770 
top rope of our ribcage and machine see
these<00:00:31.890> ropes<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.399> made<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> God

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
these ropes are made out of God

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.760 
these ropes are made out of God
irrigation<00:00:34.620> tube<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.820> four<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> them<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
irrigation tube we have four of them and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.680 
irrigation tube we have four of them and
they<00:00:37.770> link<00:00:38.010> together<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:39.329> copper

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
they link together with little copper

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.280 
they link together with little copper
links<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:42.989> connected

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
links so right now it's all connected

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.190 
links so right now it's all connected
together<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.489> rib<00:00:44.760> cage<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
together as a rib cage and as you can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
together as a rib cage and as you can
see<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.829> four<00:00:47.579> point<00:00:47.820> three<00:00:47.910> bolts<00:00:48.539> on

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
see we have four point three bolts on

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.560 
see we have four point three bolts on
our<00:00:49.050> ribcage<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:51.120> light<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
our ribcage and the light and the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660 
our ribcage and the light and the
background<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.530> actually<00:00:52.770> passing<00:00:53.399> current

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
background is actually passing current

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.029 
background is actually passing current
through<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> cable<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.440> cable

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
through the cable you have this cable

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.569 
through the cable you have this cable
that's<00:00:56.430> running<00:00:56.670> behind<00:00:57.000> here<00:00:57.510> 2<00:00:57.989> loops<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.590> an

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that's running behind here 2 loops of an

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.689 
that's running behind here 2 loops of an
AC<00:00:59.899> extension<00:01:00.899> cord<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.219> doesn't<00:01:02.520> run

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
AC extension cord and it doesn't run

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
AC extension cord and it doesn't run
through<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> ribcage<00:01:03.270> actually<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.019> runs

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
through the ribcage actually just runs

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.760 
through the ribcage actually just runs
down<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> back<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.960> it's<00:01:06.960> inducing<00:01:07.530> an

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
down the back of it and it's inducing an

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.520 
down the back of it and it's inducing an
AC<00:01:07.950> voltage<00:01:08.270> onto<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> water<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:10.020> inside

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
AC voltage onto the water that inside

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
AC voltage onto the water that inside
the<00:01:11.189> ribs<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.659> standard<00:01:12.960> tap

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the ribs and it's just standard tap

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.859 
the ribs and it's just standard tap
water<00:01:13.500> standard<00:01:14.250> hard<00:01:14.610> tap<00:01:15.299> water<00:01:15.540> there's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
water standard hard tap water there's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.130 
water standard hard tap water there's
nothing<00:01:16.170> special<00:01:16.350> about<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.960> it's<00:01:18.960> an

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
nothing special about it and it's an

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.719 
nothing special about it and it's an
interesting<00:01:19.439> effect<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.100> we're<00:01:20.250> seeing<00:01:20.400> now

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
interesting effect that we're seeing now

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.570 
interesting effect that we're seeing now
I'm<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> switch<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.380> land<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.799> we

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
I'm going to switch off the land and we

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.149 
I'm going to switch off the land and we
can<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.090> happens<00:01:24.450> when<00:01:25.020> no<00:01:25.530> current<00:01:25.950> is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
can see what happens when no current is

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.740 
can see what happens when no current is
passed<00:01:26.520> through<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.360> extension<00:01:27.900> lead

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.050 

so<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:35.810> can<00:01:35.960> see<00:01:36.230> it<00:01:37.100> actually<00:01:37.220> dropped<00:01:37.730> the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
so you can see it actually dropped the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.610 
so you can see it actually dropped the
voltage<00:01:38.480> so<00:01:39.350> cables<00:01:40.250> are<00:01:40.400> passing<00:01:40.820> current

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
voltage so cables are passing current

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.580 
voltage so cables are passing current
actually<00:01:42.620> will<00:01:43.190> induce<00:01:43.580> voltage<00:01:44.480> on<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.320> water

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
actually will induce voltage on to water

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.320 
actually will induce voltage on to water
and<00:01:45.770> actually<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.640> more<00:01:46.790> current<00:01:47.060> that's

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
and actually the more current that's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.820 
and actually the more current that's
flowing<00:01:47.450> through<00:01:47.810> cables<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.470> larger<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
flowing through cables the larger the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.910 
flowing through cables the larger the
voltage<00:01:49.190> will<00:01:49.370> be<00:01:49.450> but<00:01:50.450> as<00:01:50.600> we<00:01:50.750> see<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.590> only

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
voltage will be but as we see it only

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.310 
voltage will be but as we see it only
dropped<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.340> by<00:01:52.490> about<00:01:52.610> point<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.330> evolve<00:01:53.780> so

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
dropped it by about point to evolve so

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.230 
dropped it by about point to evolve so
we've<00:01:54.590> still<00:01:54.800> got<00:01:54.950> four<00:01:54.980> point<00:01:55.460> one<00:01:55.490> volt<00:01:55.880> so

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
we've still got four point one volt so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.170 
we've still got four point one volt so
the<00:01:56.900> bulk<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.950> induction<00:01:58.460> effect<00:01:58.790> that

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
the bulk of the induction effect that

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.240 
the bulk of the induction effect that
has<00:01:59.300> taken<00:01:59.450> place<00:01:59.660> onto<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.560> water<00:02:00.740> that's<00:02:01.130> in

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
has taken place onto the water that's in

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.700 
has taken place onto the water that's in
the<00:02:01.370> ribs<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:02.450> just<00:02:02.900> coming<00:02:03.110> from<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.560> mere

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
the ribs is just coming from the mere

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.220 
the ribs is just coming from the mere
presence<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.610> voltage<00:02:05.480> on<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.660> cable<00:02:05.900> there

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
presence of voltage on the cable there

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.870 
presence of voltage on the cable there
is<00:02:06.320> no<00:02:06.560> current<00:02:06.890> flowing<00:02:07.340> through<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.700> cable

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
is no current flowing through the cable

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.900 
is no current flowing through the cable
right<00:02:08.210> now<00:02:08.890> essentially<00:02:09.890> it's<00:02:10.010> open<00:02:10.460> circuit

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
right now essentially it's open circuit

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.590 
right now essentially it's open circuit
so<00:02:12.040> let's<00:02:13.040> see<00:02:13.310> what<00:02:13.340> happens<00:02:13.760> let<00:02:14.030> me<00:02:14.150> start

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
so let's see what happens let me start

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.330 
so let's see what happens let me start
taking<00:02:14.960> ribs<00:02:15.170> out<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.650> circus<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.160> right

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
taking ribs out of the circus so right

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.240 
taking ribs out of the circus so right
now<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:16.820> all<00:02:17.330> four<00:02:17.750> ribs<00:02:18.020> in<00:02:18.320> let's<00:02:18.650> take

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
now we have all four ribs in let's take

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.850 
now we have all four ribs in let's take
out<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.520> links<00:02:19.940> one<00:02:20.150> at<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.270> time<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.780> see<00:02:21.770> what

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
out the links one at a time and see what

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.750 
out the links one at a time and see what
happens<00:02:22.130> for<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.280> voltage<00:02:24.370> its<00:02:25.370> first<00:02:25.670> link

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
happens for the voltage its first link

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.150 
happens for the voltage its first link
ok<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.360> we've<00:02:29.600> dropped<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.560> three<00:02:30.860> point<00:02:31.100> nine

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
ok so we've dropped to three point nine

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.870 
ok so we've dropped to three point nine
volts<00:02:31.640> let's<00:02:32.450> take<00:02:32.660> out<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.870> second<00:02:33.200> link<00:02:36.880> so

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
volts let's take out the second link so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.490 
volts let's take out the second link so
we've<00:02:38.000> dropped<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.330> three<00:02:38.660> point<00:02:38.930> two<00:02:39.110> volts

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
we've dropped to three point two volts

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.740 
we've dropped to three point two volts
and<00:02:39.970> arnel<00:02:40.970> link<00:02:44.830> ok<00:02:45.830> 2.1<00:02:46.520> volt<00:02:46.730> certain<00:02:47.420> see

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
and arnel link ok 2.1 volt certain see

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.740 
and arnel link ok 2.1 volt certain see
the<00:02:48.080> voltages<00:02:48.500> adder<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.330> rib<00:02:50.480> cage<00:02:50.720> and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the voltages adder in the rib cage and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.300 
the voltages adder in the rib cage and
more<00:02:51.110> ribs<00:02:51.320> they<00:02:51.500> have<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.010> higher<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
more ribs they have in the higher the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.280 
more ribs they have in the higher the
voltage<00:02:52.400> gets<00:02:52.850> now<00:02:53.600> it's<00:02:53.720> probably<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.050> same

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
voltage gets now it's probably the same

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.070 
voltage gets now it's probably the same
in<00:02:54.440> this<00:02:54.530> human<00:02:54.800> rib<00:02:54.980> cage<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.750> it's<00:02:56.870> put<00:02:56.989> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
in this human rib cage so it's put the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.560 
in this human rib cage so it's put the
links<00:02:57.320> back<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.489> we'll<00:02:58.940> take<00:02:59.180> off<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> loop

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
links back in and we'll take off a loop

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:12.750 
links back in and we'll take off a loop
the<00:02:59.690> cable<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.310> first<00:03:04.580> link<00:03:08.140> second<00:03:09.140> link

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.760 

so<00:03:13.760> link<00:03:14.590> okay<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:15.650> back<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.670> 4.1<00:03:17.480> bolts<00:03:17.840> let's

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
so link okay so back to 4.1 bolts let's

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.540 
so link okay so back to 4.1 bolts let's
take<00:03:19.040> off<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.459> little<00:03:19.670> cable<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:25.130> we<00:03:25.160> just<00:03:25.370> have

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
take off a little cable so we just have

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.790 
take off a little cable so we just have
one<00:03:26.120> month<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.510> cable<00:03:26.690> running<00:03:27.260> down<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> back

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
one month of cable running down the back

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.520 
one month of cable running down the back
of<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.010> rib<00:03:28.160> cage<00:03:28.370> now<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:29.540> we're<00:03:29.840> at<00:03:29.930> 3.1

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
of the rib cage now and we're at 3.1

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.100 
of the rib cage now and we're at 3.1
bolts<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.670> again<00:03:31.910> let's<00:03:32.120> take<00:03:32.510> out<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.690> links

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
bolts so again let's take out the links

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.670 
bolts so again let's take out the links
and<00:03:33.290> see<00:03:33.709> what<00:03:33.860> happens<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.440> first

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
and see what happens this is the first

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.460 
and see what happens this is the first
link<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.519> we<00:03:40.640> dropped<00:03:40.820> 22<00:03:41.450> point<00:03:41.690> 6<00:03:41.750> volts

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.990 

second<00:03:45.470> link<00:03:45.650> has<00:03:46.190> dropped<00:03:46.460> to<00:03:47.050> 2.1<00:03:48.050> bolts<00:03:49.000> and

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
second link has dropped to 2.1 bolts and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.640 
second link has dropped to 2.1 bolts and
final<00:03:50.990> link<00:03:51.140> has<00:03:51.980> dropped<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:53.200> one<00:03:54.200> point<00:03:54.410> 4

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
final link has dropped to one point 4

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.020 
final link has dropped to one point 4
volts<00:03:55.390> it's<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.450> very<00:03:56.780> interesting<00:03:56.990> effect<00:03:58.030> so

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
volts it's a very interesting effect so

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.660 
volts it's a very interesting effect so
let's<00:03:59.300> put<00:03:59.750> blinks<00:04:00.200> back<00:04:00.380> in<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.860> then<00:04:01.520> we'll

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
let's put blinks back in and then we'll

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:13.570 
let's put blinks back in and then we'll
remove<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.990> cable<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.840> first<00:04:09.140> link<00:04:12.580> second

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
remove the cable so first link second

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.690 
remove the cable so first link second
link

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.160 

third<00:04:18.700> link<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.590> I'm<00:04:20.830> back<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.520> 3.1<00:04:22.090> volts<00:04:22.420> so

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
third link so I'm back to 3.1 volts so

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:37.470 
third link so I'm back to 3.1 volts so
let's<00:04:23.320> take<00:04:23.500> off<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.740> final<00:04:24.100> piece<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.400> cable

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.930 

so<00:04:38.140> it's<00:04:38.350> quite<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.590> change<00:04:38.890> we<00:04:39.490> dropped<00:04:41.070> 2.0<00:04:42.070> 35

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
so it's quite a change we dropped 2.0 35

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.670 
so it's quite a change we dropped 2.0 35
volts<00:04:43.390> AC<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:45.840> as<00:04:46.840> we<00:04:47.020> can<00:04:47.110> see<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.500> the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
volts AC so as we can see the the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.020 
volts AC so as we can see the the
voltage<00:04:48.010> was<00:04:48.220> definitely<00:04:48.550> coming<00:04:48.760> from<00:04:48.910> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
voltage was definitely coming from the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.720 
voltage was definitely coming from the
cable<00:04:49.390> and<00:04:49.590> let's<00:04:50.590> take<00:04:51.040> out<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.280> links<00:04:51.610> and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
cable and let's take out the links and

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.100 
cable and let's take out the links and
see<00:04:51.940> what<00:04:52.360> effect<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.690> has<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.980> first<00:04:57.370> link

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
see what effect that has the first link

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:06.890 
see what effect that has the first link
so<00:04:59.110> we're<00:04:59.260> down<00:04:59.380> to<00:05:00.630> zero<00:05:02.250> one<00:05:03.250> nine<00:05:03.280> volt

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.720 

second<00:05:07.900> link<00:05:08.110> has<00:05:08.590> dropped<00:05:08.860> us<00:05:08.980> down<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.370> point

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
second link has dropped us down to point

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.350 
second link has dropped us down to point
zero<00:05:10.180> one<00:05:10.510> one<00:05:10.900> bolt<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.550> link<00:05:15.850> has<00:05:16.090> dropped

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
zero one one bolt on a link has dropped

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.020 
zero one one bolt on a link has dropped
us<00:05:16.480> down<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:17.310> point<00:05:18.310> zero<00:05:18.730> zero<00:05:18.820> nine<00:05:19.810> volts<00:05:20.230> so

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
us down to point zero zero nine volts so

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.780 
us down to point zero zero nine volts so
it's<00:05:22.030> quite<00:05:22.630> different<00:05:23.260> so<00:05:23.920> this<00:05:24.040> effect<00:05:24.490> is

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
it's quite different so this effect is

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.020 
it's quite different so this effect is
probably<00:05:25.360> happening<00:05:26.610> continually<00:05:27.610> in<00:05:27.790> the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
probably happening continually in the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.500 
probably happening continually in the
human<00:05:28.330> body<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.870> whenever<00:05:29.590> you<00:05:29.800> get<00:05:29.920> around

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
human body and whenever you get around

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.210 
human body and whenever you get around
voltage<00:05:31.510> fields<00:05:32.080> you're<00:05:32.650> probably<00:05:32.980> having

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
voltage fields you're probably having

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.390 
voltage fields you're probably having
quite<00:05:33.850> large<00:05:34.090> voltages<00:05:34.720> induced<00:05:35.230> into<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:35.710> as

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
quite large voltages induced into you as

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.400 
quite large voltages induced into you as
you<00:05:36.520> can<00:05:36.610> see<00:05:36.730> we've<00:05:36.880> just<00:05:37.060> got<00:05:37.210> four<00:05:37.570> ribs<00:05:37.810> in

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
you can see we've just got four ribs in

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.170 
you can see we've just got four ribs in
our<00:05:38.590> model<00:05:38.860> but<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:39.280> human<00:05:39.580> body<00:05:39.760> has<00:05:39.910> many

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
our model but the human body has many

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.470 
our model but the human body has many
more<00:05:40.390> ribs<00:05:40.630> so<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:42.340> effect<00:05:43.150> on<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.450> human

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
more ribs so this effect on the human

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.970 
more ribs so this effect on the human
body<00:05:43.720> when<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.170> get<00:05:44.320> around<00:05:44.500> electrical

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
body when you get around electrical

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.910 
body when you get around electrical
systems<00:05:45.430> means<00:05:45.790> that<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:46.870> may<00:05:47.140> actually<00:05:47.500> find

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
systems means that you may actually find

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.860 
systems means that you may actually find
that<00:05:48.130> your<00:05:48.280> body<00:05:48.520> voltage<00:05:48.970> gets<00:05:49.240> into<00:05:49.780> the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
that your body voltage gets into the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.560 
that your body voltage gets into the
range<00:05:50.080> of<00:05:50.230> tens<00:05:50.560> of<00:05:50.740> volts<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:51.480> possibly<00:05:52.480> even

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
range of tens of volts and possibly even

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.990 
range of tens of volts and possibly even
hundreds<00:05:53.230> of<00:05:53.350> volts<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:54.040> you're<00:05:54.640> just<00:05:54.820> not

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
hundreds of volts and you're just not

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.370 
hundreds of volts and you're just not
aware<00:05:55.120> of<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.450> you<00:05:55.600> won't<00:05:55.750> be<00:05:55.840> able<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.110> sense

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
aware of it you won't be able to sense

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.740 
aware of it you won't be able to sense
it<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:58.020> it<00:05:59.020> will<00:05:59.290> have<00:06:00.270> impacts<00:06:01.270> on<00:06:01.420> your

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
it and it will have impacts on your

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.630 
it and it will have impacts on your
health<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.260> this<00:06:03.010> is<00:06:03.160> called

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
health and this is called

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.260 
health and this is called
electromagnetic<00:06:04.390> hypersensitivity<00:06:05.820> so<00:06:06.820> if

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
electromagnetic hypersensitivity so if

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.790 
electromagnetic hypersensitivity so if
you<00:06:07.420> google<00:06:07.840> electromagnetic

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
you google electromagnetic

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.030 
you google electromagnetic
hypersensitivity<00:06:09.870> you'll<00:06:10.870> find<00:06:11.260> the<00:06:11.410> effects

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
hypersensitivity you'll find the effects

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.610 
hypersensitivity you'll find the effects
