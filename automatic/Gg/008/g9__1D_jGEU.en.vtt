worse so or to buy I mean so yes one
thing<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.250> do<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.240> set<00:02:18.360> up

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
thing I do like is so you can set up

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.810 
thing I do like is so you can set up
against<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.870> wall<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.680> has<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.400> rubber<00:02:20.760> coating

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
against the wall it has a rubber coating

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.190 
against the wall it has a rubber coating
around<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.680> bottom<00:02:23.070> right<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.810> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
around the bottom right here so you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.630 
around the bottom right here so you
could<00:02:25.320> set<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.500> against<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> wall<00:02:26.130> when

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
could set up against the wall when

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.250 
could set up against the wall when
you're<00:02:26.790> dressed<00:02:27.120> no<00:02:27.450> taking<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.810> break<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.230> you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you're dressed no taking a break so you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.510
