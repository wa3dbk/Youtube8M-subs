hi<00:00:20.900> I'm<00:00:21.050> dr.<00:00:21.380> James<00:00:21.620> Meschino<00:00:21.860> let's<00:00:22.850> talk

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
hi I'm dr. James Meschino let's talk

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.760 
hi I'm dr. James Meschino let's talk
about<00:00:23.210> natural<00:00:23.660> remedies<00:00:24.230> for

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
about natural remedies for

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.000 
about natural remedies for
osteoarthritis<00:00:25.750> well<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:26.840> know

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
osteoarthritis well you know

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.840 
osteoarthritis well you know
osteoarthritis<00:00:28.010> is<00:00:28.190> sometimes<00:00:28.610> called

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
osteoarthritis is sometimes called

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.610 
osteoarthritis is sometimes called
degenerative<00:00:29.690> arthritis<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.500> that's

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:30.620 
degenerative arthritis and that's

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.250 
degenerative arthritis and that's
because<00:00:30.920> it<00:00:31.100> it's<00:00:31.490> often<00:00:31.910> related<00:00:32.419> to<00:00:32.720> aging

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
because it it's often related to aging

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.410 
because it it's often related to aging
as<00:00:33.739> we<00:00:33.860> get<00:00:34.010> older<00:00:34.340> almost<00:00:34.610> everybody<00:00:35.090> runs

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
as we get older almost everybody runs

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.040 
as we get older almost everybody runs
into<00:00:35.809> some<00:00:36.220> osteoarthritis<00:00:37.360> over<00:00:38.360> time<00:00:38.630> and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
into some osteoarthritis over time and

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.380 
into some osteoarthritis over time and
so<00:00:39.620> we<00:00:39.739> used<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:40.010> think<00:00:40.280> that<00:00:40.340> it<00:00:40.550> was<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.760> you

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
so we used to think that it was a you

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.540 
so we used to think that it was a you
know<00:00:41.450> a<00:00:41.540> wear<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:41.960> tear<00:00:42.440> problem<00:00:43.070> because<00:00:43.370> you

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
know a wear and tear problem because you

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.979 
know a wear and tear problem because you
know<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:43.730> seems<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.090> happen<00:00:44.270> as<00:00:44.510> people<00:00:44.840> get

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
know it seems to happen as people get

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.400 
know it seems to happen as people get
older<00:00:45.280> but<00:00:46.280> we<00:00:46.400> realized<00:00:46.850> during<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.660> 1980s

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
older but we realized during the 1980s

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.810 
older but we realized during the 1980s
oh<00:00:48.500> that's<00:00:48.680> not<00:00:48.890> really<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.250> case<00:00:49.400> in<00:00:49.550> fact<00:00:49.730> a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
oh that's not really the case in fact a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.610 
oh that's not really the case in fact a
lot<00:00:49.970> of<00:00:50.000> people<00:00:50.120> who<00:00:50.570> use<00:00:50.780> their<00:00:50.990> joints<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.410> lot

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
lot of people who use their joints a lot

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.980 
lot of people who use their joints a lot
actually<00:00:52.340> have<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.880> healthiest<00:00:53.420> joints<00:00:53.870> as

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
actually have the healthiest joints as

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.480 
actually have the healthiest joints as
they<00:00:54.140> get<00:00:54.290> older<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:54.740> it's<00:00:54.860> not<00:00:54.980> really<00:00:55.310> wear

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
they get older so it's not really wear

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.580 
they get older so it's not really wear
and<00:00:55.670> tear<00:00:55.880> there<00:00:56.630> was<00:00:56.720> a<00:00:56.750> big<00:00:57.020> breakthrough<00:00:57.290> in

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
and tear there was a big breakthrough in

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.010 
and tear there was a big breakthrough in
the<00:00:57.650> 1980s<00:00:58.340> we<00:00:58.460> started<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.880> see<00:00:59.060> that<00:00:59.090> one<00:00:59.990> of

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
the 1980s we started to see that one of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.020 
the 1980s we started to see that one of
the<00:01:00.170> underlying<00:01:00.710> biochemical<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:02.000> genetic

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
the underlying biochemical and genetic

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.930 
the underlying biochemical and genetic
steps<00:01:02.630> that<00:01:02.840> occurs<00:01:03.200> in<00:01:03.470> osteoarthritis

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
steps that occurs in osteoarthritis

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.730 
steps that occurs in osteoarthritis
development<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.080> body<00:01:06.350> stops

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
development is that the body stops

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.310 
development is that the body stops
making<00:01:07.100> optimal<00:01:07.970> amounts<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.540> glucosamine

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
making optimal amounts of glucosamine

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.960 
making optimal amounts of glucosamine
you<00:01:09.710> probably<00:01:10.009> have<00:01:10.130> heard<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.460> glucosamine

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
you probably have heard of glucosamine

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.969 
you probably have heard of glucosamine
as<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.240> supplement<00:01:11.780> but<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.440> body<00:01:12.649> makes

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
as a supplement but the body makes

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.889 
as a supplement but the body makes
glucosamine<00:01:13.759> and<00:01:13.940> you<00:01:14.570> need<00:01:14.720> that

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
glucosamine and you need that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.749 
glucosamine and you need that
glucosamine<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:15.740> order<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.160> make<00:01:16.369> joint

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
glucosamine in order to make joint

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.190 
glucosamine in order to make joint
cartilage<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.390> see<00:01:17.630> there's<00:01:17.810> normally<00:01:18.170> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
cartilage you see there's normally a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.350 
cartilage you see there's normally a
turnover<00:01:18.860> for<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.310> joint<00:01:19.550> cartilage<00:01:19.790> you

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
turnover for the joint cartilage you

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.150 
turnover for the joint cartilage you
break<00:01:20.630> some<00:01:20.840> cartilage<00:01:21.140> down<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.860> body's

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
break some cartilage down and the body's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.859 
break some cartilage down and the body's
already<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:22.819> synthesizing<00:01:23.450> some<00:01:23.750> new

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
already is synthesizing some new

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.840 
already is synthesizing some new
cartilage<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.470> replace<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.429> natural

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
cartilage to replace it the natural

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.969 
cartilage to replace it the natural
dynamic<00:01:26.390> flux<00:01:26.690> of<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.020> body<00:01:27.229> as<00:01:27.440> we<00:01:27.590> call<00:01:27.800> it

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
dynamic flux of the body as we call it

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.749 
dynamic flux of the body as we call it
after<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.060> age<00:01:29.179> of<00:01:29.330> 40<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.050> body<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.310> enzyme

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
after the age of 40 the body the enzyme

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.850 
after the age of 40 the body the enzyme
to<00:01:31.940> make<00:01:32.149> glucosamine<00:01:32.869> drops<00:01:33.140> off<00:01:33.410> and<00:01:33.649> so<00:01:33.830> you

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
to make glucosamine drops off and so you

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.499 
to make glucosamine drops off and so you
can't<00:01:34.310> make<00:01:34.640> it<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:34.940> way<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.090> did<00:01:35.330> when<00:01:35.450> you

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
can't make it the way you did when you

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.690 
can't make it the way you did when you
were<00:01:35.600> younger<00:01:35.929> and<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.649> result<00:01:37.009> is<00:01:37.160> over<00:01:37.429> time

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
were younger and the result is over time

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.609 
were younger and the result is over time
the<00:01:37.910> cartilage<00:01:38.390> breaks<00:01:38.630> down<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.259> becomes

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
the cartilage breaks down and becomes

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.949 
the cartilage breaks down and becomes
thinner<00:01:39.950> on<00:01:40.250> x-rays<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.179> start<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.509> see<00:01:41.660> bones

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
thinner on x-rays you start to see bones

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.240 
thinner on x-rays you start to see bones
getting<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.470> little<00:01:42.590> closer<00:01:42.920> together

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
getting a little closer together

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.669 
getting a little closer together
narrowing<00:01:44.179> of<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.450> joint<00:01:44.720> space<00:01:45.050> as<00:01:45.319> we<00:01:45.470> say

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
narrowing of the joint space as we say

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.370 
narrowing of the joint space as we say
when<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:45.950> look<00:01:46.100> at<00:01:46.190> those<00:01:46.369> x-rays<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:48.170> for

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
when we look at those x-rays and so for

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.779 
when we look at those x-rays and so for
a<00:01:48.410> long<00:01:48.560> time<00:01:48.860> no<00:01:49.069> one<00:01:49.220> really<00:01:49.250> knew<00:01:49.610> what<00:01:49.759> to

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
a long time no one really knew what to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:50.790 
a long time no one really knew what to
do<00:01:50.000> about<00:01:50.149> it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
do about it

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.469 
do about it
but<00:01:51.800> in<00:01:52.039> recent<00:01:52.670> years<00:01:52.910> they<00:01:53.060> said<00:01:53.209> you<00:01:53.360> know

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
but in recent years they said you know

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.240 
but in recent years they said you know
if<00:01:53.539> we<00:01:53.660> run<00:01:53.869> out<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.020> glucosamine<00:01:54.560> maybe<00:01:54.890> if<00:01:55.100> we

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
if we run out of glucosamine maybe if we

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.859 
if we run out of glucosamine maybe if we
give<00:01:55.399> people<00:01:55.610> glucosamine<00:01:56.600> supplementation

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
give people glucosamine supplementation

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.290 
give people glucosamine supplementation
it<00:01:57.770> can<00:01:57.950> compensate<00:01:58.429> for<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.940> glucosamine

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
it can compensate for the glucosamine

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.990 
it can compensate for the glucosamine
the<00:02:00.140> body<00:02:00.380> doesn't<00:02:00.679> make<00:02:00.950> for<00:02:01.160> itself<00:02:01.459> anymore

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
the body doesn't make for itself anymore

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.490 
the body doesn't make for itself anymore
and<00:02:02.209> studies<00:02:02.929> have<00:02:02.959> shown<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.380> that's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
and studies have shown that that's

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.490 
and studies have shown that that's
exactly<00:02:04.160> true<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.119> we're<00:02:06.020> seeing<00:02:06.259> that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
exactly true so we're seeing that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.109 
exactly true so we're seeing that
glucosamine<00:02:06.920> can<00:02:07.310> be<00:02:07.399> very<00:02:07.580> helpful<00:02:07.910> but

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
glucosamine can be very helpful but

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.080 
glucosamine can be very helpful but
that's<00:02:08.360> not<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.990> whole<00:02:09.020> story<00:02:09.709> around

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
that's not the whole story around

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.610 
that's not the whole story around
osteoarthritis<00:02:11.090> as<00:02:11.240> we<00:02:11.810> get<00:02:11.990> older<00:02:12.349> on<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
inner lining of our joints there's like

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.230 
inner lining of our joints there's like
saran<00:02:15.020> wrap<00:02:15.319> around<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.800> joints<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
morph into what are called macrophages

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.580 
morph into what are called macrophages
and<00:02:23.000> as<00:02:23.270> we<00:02:23.420> get<00:02:23.510> older<00:02:23.569> those<00:02:23.930> macrophages

that<00:02:26.870> also<00:02:27.200> promote<00:02:27.560> more<00:02:28.010> inflammation<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
that also promote more inflammation and

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.620 
that also promote more inflammation and
pain<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:29.329> we<00:02:29.480> get<00:02:29.599> older<00:02:29.930> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
pain as we get older and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.420 
pain as we get older and
it's<00:02:30.750> part<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.200> aging<00:02:31.530> process<00:02:31.560> as<00:02:32.190> well

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
it's part of the aging process as well

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.950 
it's part of the aging process as well
so<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:34.380> best<00:02:34.650> way<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.950> prevent

so the best way to prevent
osteoarthritis<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.260> manage<00:02:37.800> it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
osteoarthritis and to manage it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.800

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
make the mistake of taking chondroitin

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.050 
make the mistake of taking chondroitin
sulfate<00:02:58.080> or<00:02:58.710> they<00:02:58.980> take<00:02:59.130> glucosamine<00:02:59.580> with

chondroitin the body can't really absorb

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.250 
chondroitin the body can't really absorb
much<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.120> chondroitin<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:03.960> sort<00:03:04.200> of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
much of the chondroitin so it's sort of

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260 
much of the chondroitin so it's sort of
useless<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:05.310> much<00:03:05.580> better<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.970> combine

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
useless it's much better to combine

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.070 
useless it's much better to combine
glucosamine<00:03:07.260> with<00:03:07.980> three<00:03:08.250> natural

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
glucosamine with three natural

glucosamine with three natural
anti-inflammatory<00:03:10.080> herbs<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.710> like

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
anti-inflammatory herbs that I like

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.740 
anti-inflammatory herbs that I like
bromelain

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
bromelain

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.300 
bromelain
MSM<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.020> quercetin<00:03:13.440> when<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.950> put<00:03:14.130> those

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
MSM and quercetin when you put those

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.270 
MSM and quercetin when you put those
together<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.750> natural

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
together you get the natural

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.320 
together you get the natural
anti-inflammatory<00:03:17.280> effect<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.670> suppress<00:03:18.090> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
anti-inflammatory effect to suppress the

anti-inflammatory effect to suppress the
inflammatory<00:03:18.810> chemicals<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.430> also<00:03:20.610> help

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
inflammatory chemicals and you also help

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360 
inflammatory chemicals and you also help
to<00:03:21.150> stabilize<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.840> joint<00:03:22.230> cartilage<00:03:22.560> when

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
to stabilize the joint cartilage when

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.500 
to stabilize the joint cartilage when
you<00:03:23.460> combine<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:23.880> with<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.240> good

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
you combine that with a good

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.810 
you combine that with a good
anti-inflammatory<00:03:24.990> diet<00:03:25.950> meaning<00:03:26.460> less

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
anti-inflammatory diet meaning less

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.510
