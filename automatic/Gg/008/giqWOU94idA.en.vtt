to<00:00:39.910> look<00:00:40.120> at<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.329> differences<00:00:40.750> between<00:00:40.809> the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
to look at the differences between the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.970 
to look at the differences between the
two<00:00:41.550> devices<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.570> what<00:00:43.660> you<00:00:43.720> want<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:43.899> go<00:00:44.079> it's

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
two devices so what you want to go it's

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.660 
two devices so what you want to go it's
um<00:00:45.190> it's<00:00:45.399> paper<00:00:45.610> toss<00:00:45.910> right<00:00:46.149> here

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.349 

so<00:00:53.300> just<00:00:53.480> wait<00:00:53.570> for<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:53.899> load<00:00:59.469> easy<00:01:01.359> and

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
so just wait for that to load easy and

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.969 
so just wait for that to load easy and
point<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:02.870> this<00:01:02.960> game<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:04.670> kind<00:01:04.909> of<00:01:05.380> aim<00:01:06.380> the

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
point of this game to kind of aim the

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.149 
point of this game to kind of aim the
taper<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.840> toss<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:08.869> with<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:09.680> direction<00:01:09.979> of

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
taper and toss it with the direction of

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.940 
taper and toss it with the direction of
the<00:01:10.280> wind<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.270> this<00:01:12.229> month<00:01:12.440> now<00:01:12.500> there's<00:01:12.799> no

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
the wind so this month now there's no

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.389 
the wind so this month now there's no
wind<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.460> it's<00:01:13.940> goes<00:01:14.180> into<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.890> paper<00:01:15.890> bin

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
wind and it's goes into the paper bin

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.450 
wind and it's goes into the paper bin
there's<00:01:17.090> again<00:01:17.450> there's<00:01:17.720> barely<00:01:18.200> any<00:01:18.439> win<00:01:18.680> it

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
there's again there's barely any win it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.999 
there's again there's barely any win it
also<00:01:19.640> goes<00:01:19.909> into<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.299> paper<00:01:20.509> bin<00:01:20.810> now<00:01:21.770> that's

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
also goes into the paper bin now that's

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.560 
also goes into the paper bin now that's
quite<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.220> lot<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.460> win<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.450> flip

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
quite a lot of win so you have to flip

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.520 
quite a lot of win so you have to flip
it<00:01:23.720> more<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.259> side<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:26.539> goes<00:01:26.750> in<00:01:26.929> pretty

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
it more to the side and I goes in pretty

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.680 
it more to the side and I goes in pretty
simple<00:01:27.740> game<00:01:28.100> pretty<00:01:28.340> simple<00:01:28.700> concept<00:01:28.880> it's<00:01:29.600> a

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
simple game pretty simple concept it's a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.770 
simple game pretty simple concept it's a
fun<00:01:29.899> game<00:01:29.929> with<00:01:30.319> your<00:01:30.500> board<00:01:30.740> I<00:01:31.780> would

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
fun game with your board I would

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.940 
fun game with your board I would
definitely<00:01:32.869> recommend<00:01:33.200> downloading<00:01:33.619> this

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
definitely recommend downloading this

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
now we're going to do a comparison with

00:01:43.759 --> 00:02:02.050 
now we're going to do a comparison with
this<00:01:44.000> one<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.819> the<00:01:46.819> one<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:48.679> iDevice

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.430 

Oh

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:24.350 

I<00:02:07.500> started<00:02:08.400> here<00:02:09.200> that's<00:02:10.200> at<00:02:10.470> studios<00:02:23.360> this

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
I started here that's at studios this

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.420 
I started here that's at studios this
one's<00:02:24.570> still<00:02:24.660> loading<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.320> frenzy<00:02:28.310> I'll<00:02:29.310> be

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
one's still loading to frenzy I'll be

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.730 
one's still loading to frenzy I'll be
back<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.850> one<00:02:30.000> that's<00:02:30.150> unloaded<00:02:30.740> and

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
back with you one that's unloaded and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.650 
back with you one that's unloaded and
now<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.280> got<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.730> game<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.270> running<00:02:33.450> on

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
now that we got the game is running on

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.890 
now that we got the game is running on
both<00:02:33.870> devices<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.460> see<00:02:35.820> already<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.540> bit

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
both devices you can see already a bit

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.950 
both devices you can see already a bit
of<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.110> difference<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:38.610> been<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.480> example

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
of a difference this been for example

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.670 
of a difference this been for example
seems<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.440> be<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.890> better<00:02:41.640> definition<00:02:42.680> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
seems to be in a better definition you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.310 
seems to be in a better definition you
see<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:43.980> ben<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.460> bit<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.910> pixel<00:02:45.870> run<00:02:46.050> very

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
see this ben is a bit and pixel run very

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.190 
see this ben is a bit and pixel run very
good<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.150> definitely<00:02:48.600> better<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.050> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
good so it's definitely better on the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.760 
good so it's definitely better on the
iDevice<00:02:50.990> but<00:02:52.460> before<00:02:53.460> forth<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.120> game

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
iDevice but before forth for this game

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.170 
iDevice but before forth for this game
purpose<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> graphics<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.640> not<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> big

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
purpose of the graphics is not a big

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.780 
purpose of the graphics is not a big
issue<00:02:59.900> yeah<00:03:00.900> if<00:03:01.350> i<00:03:01.950> would<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.460> choose

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
issue yeah if i would have to choose

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.130 
issue yeah if i would have to choose
these<00:03:03.240> chaps<00:03:03.900> examples<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.710> bit<00:03:04.890> pixelated<00:03:06.140> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
these chaps examples a bit pixelated the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.750 
these chaps examples a bit pixelated the
one<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.650> iDevice<00:03:08.340> isn't<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:11.370> if<00:03:11.520> i<00:03:11.610> would

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
one on the iDevice isn't so if i would

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.979 
one on the iDevice isn't so if i would
have<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.880> choose<00:03:12.150> which<00:03:12.330> game<00:03:12.630> would<00:03:12.840> look
