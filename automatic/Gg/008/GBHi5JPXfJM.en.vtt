00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
card is using two or three and the 270
in<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.369> case<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.420> we're<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.630> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
in this case and then we're going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.649 
in this case and then we're going to
download<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.380> windows<00:01:16.920> 7<00:01:17.549> 64<00:01:17.880> bits<00:01:18.420> that's

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
download the windows 7 64 bits that's

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539 
download the windows 7 64 bits that's
what<00:01:18.869> we're<00:01:18.990> using<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> move<00:01:19.650> vary

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
what we're using but a move vary

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.670 
what we're using but a move vary
depending<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.330> using<00:01:21.619> Windows<00:01:22.619> Vista

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
depending if we're using Windows Vista

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.249 
depending if we're using Windows Vista
for<00:01:23.100> example<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:24.119> need<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:24.990> bit

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
for example we need the right bit

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
for example we need the right bit
version<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.740> well<00:01:25.770> once<00:01:26.520> you've<00:01:26.640> got<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
version as well once you've got all that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.899 
version as well once you've got all that
we<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.930> begin<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.740> process<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.640> first

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
we can then begin the process so first

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.670 
we can then begin the process so first
thing<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.180> you're<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
thing what you're going to do is go and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800 
thing what you're going to do is go and
get<00:01:32.220> rid<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.430> any<00:01:32.640> old<00:01:32.729> drivers<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.450> may<00:01:33.600> have

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
AMD software you need to do a quick

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.830 
AMD software you need to do a quick
system<00:02:40.690> restart<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:41.680> we've<00:02:41.860> got<00:02:42.040> our<00:02:42.220> really

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
one on once we install the drivers but

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.080 
one on once we install the drivers but
we're<00:02:53.920> going<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.100> remain<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.550> one<00:02:54.670> card<00:02:54.880> for

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
for now we're going to just install

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.070 
for now we're going to just install
everything<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.680> guide<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:13.360> let's<00:03:13.959> move

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
everything for this guide so let's move

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.610 
everything for this guide so let's move
this<00:03:14.200> up<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.410> little<00:03:14.500> bit<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:16.810> about<00:03:16.989> see<00:03:17.350> it

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
this up a little bit just about see it

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.000 
this up a little bit just about see it
next<00:03:18.660> install<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:20.350> I'm<00:03:20.440> going<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.650> do<00:03:20.769> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
next install and I'm going to do the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
next install and I'm going to do the
Express<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.650> then<00:03:23.650> create<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.459> folder<00:03:24.820> so

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
Express and then create the folder so

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.670 
Express and then create the folder so
that's<00:03:25.269> going<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.480> install<00:03:25.780> all<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.140> and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
that's going to install all that and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.170 
that's going to install all that and
we'd<00:03:26.800> have<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.010> do<00:03:27.100> another<00:03:27.220> nice<00:03:27.489> restart

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
we'd have to do another nice restart

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.790 
we'd have to do another nice restart
when<00:03:28.420> it's<00:03:28.660> finished<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.140> then<00:03:29.320> we'll<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.769> a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
when it's finished and then we'll have a

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.400 
when it's finished and then we'll have a
bit<00:03:30.100> better<00:03:31.060> resolution<00:03:31.420> there's<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.930> bit<00:03:32.080> less

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
bit better resolution there's a bit less

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.140 
bit better resolution there's a bit less
painful<00:03:32.980> on<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.220> eyes<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.790> I'm<00:03:33.850> going<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.060> let

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
painful on the eyes so I'm going to let

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.940 
painful on the eyes so I'm going to let
this<00:03:34.300> one<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.780> we'll<00:03:35.200> be<00:03:35.320> back<00:03:35.470> with<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:35.890> a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.420 
this one and we'll be back with you in a
second

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
second

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.460 
second
okay<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.000> we've<00:03:37.209> installed<00:03:37.480> our<00:03:37.690> AMD<00:03:38.170> drivers

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
okay so we've installed our AMD drivers

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.900 
okay so we've installed our AMD drivers
and<00:03:38.830> they're<00:03:38.920> all<00:03:39.010> correctly<00:03:39.430> installed

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
and they're all correctly installed

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.030 
and they're all correctly installed
we've<00:03:40.269> now<00:03:40.420> got<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.630> better<00:03:41.110> resolution<00:03:41.440> which

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
we've now got a better resolution which

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.580 
we've now got a better resolution which

we're not going to put across my bridge

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.020

we're<00:03:52.269> going<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.480> allow<00:03:52.720> Windows<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.110> find<00:03:53.830> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
we're going to allow Windows to find the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.949 
we're going to allow Windows to find the
second<00:03:54.580> card<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.360> make<00:03:55.540> sure<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:55.840> all

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
registering properly before we do that

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.940 
registering properly before we do that
step<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.360> in<00:03:58.989> install<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.350> second<00:03:59.620> card<00:03:59.769> and

step so in install the second card and
I'll<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.160> right<00:04:00.340> back<00:04:00.580> in<00:04:00.850> a<00:04:01.150> second

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
I'll be right back in a second

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.259 
I'll be right back in a second
