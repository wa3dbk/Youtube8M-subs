00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.750 
going at like high speed so there's
absolutely<00:05:26.350> no<00:05:26.890> way<00:05:27.040> you<00:05:27.070> can<00:05:27.250> avoid<00:05:27.340> that<00:05:27.490> but

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
absolutely no way you can avoid that but

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.750 
absolutely no way you can avoid that but
scorpion<00:05:28.360> is<00:05:28.630> from<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.470> realm<00:05:29.770> where<00:05:30.550> there's

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
scorpion is from a realm where there's

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.190 
scorpion is from a realm where there's
nothing<00:05:31.120> but<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.420> know<00:05:31.480> carnage<00:05:32.020> and

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
nothing but you know carnage and

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.960 
nothing but you know carnage and
fighting<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:32.800> all<00:05:32.830> that<00:05:32.980> kind<00:05:33.190> of<00:05:33.220> stuff<00:05:33.340> so<00:05:33.730> I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
fighting and all that kind of stuff so I

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.050 
fighting and all that kind of stuff so I
think<00:05:34.390> that<00:05:34.840> would<00:05:34.930> give<00:05:35.730> scorpion<00:05:36.730> a<00:05:36.820> little

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
think that would give scorpion a little

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.870 
think that would give scorpion a little
edge<00:05:37.390> over<00:05:38.200> Batman<00:05:38.470> but<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:39.340> definitely<00:05:39.640> think

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
edge over Batman but I definitely think

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.580 
edge over Batman but I definitely think
Batman<00:05:40.420> without<00:05:40.540> smart<00:05:41.050> scorpion<00:05:41.470> but

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
Batman without smart scorpion but

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.140 
Batman without smart scorpion but
scorpion<00:05:42.040> has<00:05:42.130> like<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:42.460> many<00:05:42.610> weapons<00:05:42.790> and

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
scorpion has like so many weapons and

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.420 
scorpion has like so many weapons and
whatnot<00:05:43.360> so<00:05:43.570> many<00:05:43.750> things<00:05:44.230> like<00:05:44.380> fire<00:05:44.680> and<00:05:45.010> you

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
whatnot so many things like fire and you

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.190 
whatnot so many things like fire and you
can<00:05:45.520> easily<00:05:45.670> just<00:05:46.030> throw<00:05:46.090> Batman<00:05:46.630> in<00:05:46.780> hell<00:05:46.930> I
