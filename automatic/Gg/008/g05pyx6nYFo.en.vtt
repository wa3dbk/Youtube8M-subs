three-foot hull extensions that's a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.890 
three-foot hull extensions that's a
thirty<00:01:48.770> nine<00:01:48.979> thirty<00:01:49.190> now<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:50.450> can<00:01:50.600> see<00:01:50.750> the

thirty nine thirty now you can see the
whole<00:01:51.020> sections<00:01:51.500> will<00:01:51.650> work<00:01:51.800> here<00:01:52.040> a<00:01:52.070> little

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
whole sections will work here a little

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.190 
whole sections will work here a little
bit<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:52.850> really<00:01:53.510> think<00:01:53.660> they're<00:01:53.810> helping<00:01:54.080> the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
bit I really think they're helping the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.730 
bit I really think they're helping the
lifts<00:01:54.500> turn<00:01:54.770> up<00:01:55.010> and<00:01:55.700> he's<00:01:55.820> following<00:01:56.180> seas

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
lifts turn up and he's following seas

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.800 
lifts turn up and he's following seas
and<00:01:57.740> really<00:01:58.220> getting<00:01:58.430> us<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.790> serve<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.390> lot

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
and really getting us to serve a lot

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.690 
and really getting us to serve a lot
more<00:01:59.990> frequently<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:00.979> didn't<00:02:01.400> have<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.550> lot

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
more frequently that I didn't have a lot

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.380 
more frequently that I didn't have a lot
of<00:02:01.729> experience<00:02:02.119> with<00:02:02.180> boat<00:02:02.479> prior<00:02:04.150> blue<00:02:05.150> water

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
of experience with boat prior blue water

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.169 
of experience with boat prior blue water
sailing<00:02:05.660> but<00:02:06.220> that's<00:02:07.220> my<00:02:07.369> impression<00:02:07.520> so

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
sailing but that's my impression so

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.050 
sailing but that's my impression so
we're<00:02:08.750> about<00:02:08.860> 200<00:02:09.860> miles<00:02:09.979> into<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.700> new<00:02:10.880> hull

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
we're about 200 miles into the new hull

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.750 
we're about 200 miles into the new hull
extensions<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:12.020> performing<00:02:12.860> really<00:02:13.040> nicely

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.089 

and<00:02:15.940> we're<00:02:16.930> having<00:02:17.140> really<00:02:17.349> fast<00:02:17.590> passage

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
and we're having really fast passage

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.229 
and we're having really fast passage
here<00:02:18.250> we're<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.580> our<00:02:18.670> way<00:02:18.700> from<00:02:18.940> Mystic

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
here we're on our way from Mystic

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.009 
here we're on our way from Mystic
Connecticut<00:02:19.360> down<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.760> Norfolk<00:02:21.760> Virginia

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
Connecticut down to Norfolk Virginia

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.660 
Connecticut down to Norfolk Virginia
right<00:02:23.019> now<00:02:23.170> we're<00:02:23.379> probably<00:02:23.530> about<00:02:23.830> 50<00:02:24.250> or<00:02:24.400> 60

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
right now we're probably about 50 or 60

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.089 
right now we're probably about 50 or 60
miles<00:02:24.819> off<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.150> coast<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.720> New<00:02:25.900> Jersey<00:02:26.349> maybe

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
miles off the coast of New Jersey maybe

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.960 
miles off the coast of New Jersey maybe
somewhere<00:02:28.980> off<00:02:29.980> Cape<00:02:30.310> May<00:02:30.489> or<00:02:30.670> something

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
somewhere off Cape May or something

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.250 
somewhere off Cape May or something
right<00:02:31.150> now

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
right now

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.030 
right now
so<00:02:33.890> again<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.489> see<00:02:35.620> when's<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.800> really

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
so again you can see when's I really

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.619 
so again you can see when's I really
well<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.430> hard<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.700> mean<00:02:37.819> she's<00:02:38.060> like<00:02:38.090> not

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
well that hard I mean she's like not

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.960 
well that hard I mean she's like not
even<00:02:38.720> standing<00:02:39.080> out<00:02:39.200> straight<00:02:39.819> we<00:02:40.819> are

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
even standing out straight we are

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.160 
even standing out straight we are
getting<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> surpri

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
getting a surpri

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.940 
getting a surpri
you<00:02:42.950> can<00:02:43.099> see<00:02:44.080> pretty<00:02:45.080> clean<00:02:45.409> water<00:02:45.650> flowing

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you can see pretty clean water flowing

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.410 
you can see pretty clean water flowing
off<00:02:46.069> those<00:02:46.250> transoms<00:02:46.790> even<00:02:47.060> when<00:02:47.209> were<00:02:47.299> up

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
off those transoms even when were up

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.500 
off those transoms even when were up
from<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.629> teens

don't<00:04:13.209> know<00:04:13.360> if<00:04:13.390> we'll<00:04:13.510> catch<00:04:13.690> one<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:13.930> the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
don't know if we'll catch one of the

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.890 
don't know if we'll catch one of the
camera<00:04:14.290> right<00:04:14.319> now<00:04:14.410> but<00:04:15.419> you<00:04:16.419> know<00:04:16.510> taking

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.580 

so<00:04:24.260> we're<00:04:24.440> still<00:04:24.680> doing<00:04:25.040> about<00:04:25.660> mid<00:04:26.660> mid<00:04:27.350> eats

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
so we're still doing about mid mid eats

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.619 
so we're still doing about mid mid eats
right<00:04:28.040> now

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.040 

our<00:04:34.139> wind<00:04:34.409> is<00:04:34.679> down<00:04:34.889> in<00:04:35.159> around<00:04:35.429> 19<00:04:36.210> knots<00:04:36.419> true

at<00:04:37.559> the<00:04:37.679> moment

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.959 

can't<00:04:57.690> really<00:04:57.780> film<00:04:58.020> waves

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.199 

but<00:05:02.589> following<00:05:03.589> see<00:05:03.860> both<00:05:04.669> spreading

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:05.209 
but following see both spreading

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:11.230 
but following see both spreading
beautifully

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:25.529 

that's<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.450> for<00:05:12.600> now

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:45.850
