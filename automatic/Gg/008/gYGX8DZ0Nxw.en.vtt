00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.309
 Today I received such a generator 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:10.740
 for a windmill from an inch and could not resist 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.799
 decided to test it in haste 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 collected 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:22.650
 diode bridge I have on the internet 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:27.060
 Maxim Ivanov car action at 100 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 watt and what I saw here I begin now 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:38.510
 rotate it and we carefully look at 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:45.420
 im permit that he starts could immediately 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.430
 hand rotation ammeter became 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.399
 deviate 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.329
 Well, now we try it now 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:03.750
 this door 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:05.450
 here I am allochka made 750 watt drill 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.479
 will rotate 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.450
 through the belt and apologize for 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:19.250
 recording quality 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.250
 have to either rotate and shoot 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.770
 because this is the first 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.770
 do not rotate the boeing bulb for a year 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:52.049
 as you saw the arrow 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:57.869
 as you just saw the arrow 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:00.670
 children cookie invested to the end 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.530
 100 watt bulb burned 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.769
 windmill itself does not rotate very quickly that 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.840
 there were turns were not very big drill 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:16.209
 was not at maximum speed I like 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.030
 would not file because here 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.030
 I will burn these bulbs for 2 pieces 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.810
 23 port we do not somehow immediately 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.489
 refueled i didn't realize 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:37.209
 Well, as we see the generator in general to me 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.040
 I really like hope the windmill we will 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.239
 work at times 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.690
 case than he is now working on this 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.690
 style bye
