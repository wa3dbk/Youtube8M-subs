00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.349
 Greetings and thanks for your comments and 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.090
 registration to the transformation channel 

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:09.280
 extraordinary today I want 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.890
 share you how to make an ugly cradle 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.540
 or a stroller and the materials that 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.730
 we occupy are 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.930
 squats of course the color fabric 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:24.950
 that you have chosen and you something to 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.950
 mark pen or pencil the rule 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.680
 scissors 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:35.860
 and the thread and the needle 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.140
 we are also going to occupy an elastic and 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.240
 also this plastic cord because with 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.540
 this we are going to have the pampers and 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.480
 we occupy this slats of different 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.370
 wide the thinnest since it's going to 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.530
 help also stop the pamperos and 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.770
 the widest to make the bow and 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.780
 our suspenders to the silicone gun and 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.600
 Cordova 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.790
 Cardboard rubber eva or foami and this 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.559
 our base I previously had already 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.600
 done this project but I did it 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.330
 recycling using a box of 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.430
 shoes but I want now that the base is 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.420
 a little firmer to the mom 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.350
 use 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.240
 our first step is you are going to cut the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.610
 cardboard or cardboard what is 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.460
 used of the desired size and width 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.940
 second step to grab the fabric and the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.670
 you're going to do regularly and last 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.630
 Pull the thread so it fits like that and what 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.299
 does at both ends 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.930
 and then the third step you're going to 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.840
 paste to the base in the carton together with 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.640
 the fabric to form precisely this 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.469
 base and our fourth step is let's 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.399
 grab our fields and we're going to 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.890
 start doubling and we depend on them 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.530
 league you are going to do what you need to 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.289
 according to the size of your keith base and 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.060
 then we are going to unite with our 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.159
 plastic cord and we will go through 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.080
 the union for there is no one in the camper 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.799
 because that's how the league is less likely 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.810
 plastic you break that and so all the 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.910
 that I need, as I tell you, we're going 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.069
 to hit the base and we're going to stop them 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.610
 we are going to tie him up and so that we stay 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.380
 more fixed we will use the cord that 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.519
 and over so that the cord does not go 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.670
 our ribbon and with the widest ribbon 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.220
 let's make our bun to cover 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.170
 all these injuries that we did and 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.900
 you're just going to fold your ribbon 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.200
 of the size that could be and in the middle what 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.150
 stops with the plastic league and 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.020
 ends simply because we 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.510
 you're going to open them like that so he can go 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.450
 giving the form precisely then well of 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.450
 Monkey like that so you have something like that 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.900
 and then it 's here as you see it already moored 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.660
 everything I told you and then because it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.090
 see the black plastic then 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.099
 cover it, let's put the bow and 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.920
 We cut a piece of ribbon for 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.730
 stop it with the same color and those that 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.470
 It was like that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.030
 ok it seems it is the bun to cover all the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.280
 hard series how do you wear we do not use 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.350
 silicone because the purpose is that the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.120
 mom also use pamperos now 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.680
 to put it in the part of in the part 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.700
 from inside because here you put what you 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.989
 you want me to decorate it with chocolate 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.560
 and I'm using this kind of 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.239
 chocolate and I'm going to put an egg that 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.160
 he welcomes the baby and 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.900
 we simply take away the hard energy 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.730
 the chocolate and 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.760
 in the wrap all the chocolate and 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.489
 now we are going to put the new ok in 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.079
 the union looks like this so that the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.590
 chocolate 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.260
 and here everyone likes it and looks at you 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.329
 be without me 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.150
 a little gift that I'm going to make to a 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.909
 known and so we have our 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.290
 project on the bottom I'm 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.840
 using a plate that you can use 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.090
 cardboard eva rubber or with thread which is 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.799
 used I was even looking 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.739
 the tires to give him more this 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.530
 view but of a stroller but not what 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.859
 I found here I leave you another option look 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.449
 how do you see this time I did not wrap him 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:20.280
 do not wind up, I just put them on 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.710
 just like the pamperos using the 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.800
 same technique mooring it with 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.110
 the elastic and then with the with the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.150
 ribbon to decorate them and we have pin 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.610
 well I thank you and I tell you 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.789
 until next time 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.789
 to
