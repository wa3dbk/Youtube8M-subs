is is the the body hair body it's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:50.720 
is is the the body hair body it's
clogged<00:00:47.780> what<00:00:48.780> happens<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> EGR<00:00:50.070> valve

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
clogged what happens is the EGR valve

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720 
clogged what happens is the EGR valve
which<00:00:51.090> mounts<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> side<00:00:52.730> comes

through<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.059> gets<00:00:54.239> clogged<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.739> gets

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
through it gets clogged and it gets

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
through it gets clogged and it gets
clogged<00:00:56.280> tight<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.719> why<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> have

canister it's applause thank you you
know<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.850> average<00:02:25.000> mechanic<00:02:25.780> take<00:02:25.990> less<00:02:26.200> than

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
know the average mechanic take less than

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.170 
know the average mechanic take less than
an<00:02:26.440> hour<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> job<00:02:27.250> probably<00:02:27.970> take

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
an hour to do the job probably take

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.820 
an hour to do the job probably take
longer<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.690> clean<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.990> carbon<00:02:29.380> out<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.740> it

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
longer to clean the carbon out that it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.660 
longer to clean the carbon out that it
will<00:02:29.980> do<00:02:30.250> take<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.209> off<00:02:32.070> there<00:02:33.070> we<00:02:33.190> go<00:02:33.340> we're

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
will do take it off there we go we're

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.070 
will do take it off there we go we're
gonna<00:02:33.730> go<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.180> clean<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.690> out<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.870> then

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
gonna go out and clean it out and then

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.050 
gonna go out and clean it out and then
I'll<00:02:35.290> come<00:02:35.470> back<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.740> when<00:02:36.640> it's<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:36.850> back

together
and<00:02:38.190> we'll<00:02:39.190> check<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.970> codes<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.310> that

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
and we'll check the codes and that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.650 
and we'll check the codes and that
should<00:02:42.550> be<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> only<00:02:42.940> code<00:02:43.120> leftovers

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
should be the only code leftovers

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660 
should be the only code leftovers
vehicle<00:02:44.080> alright<00:02:45.040> y'all<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.520> good<00:02:45.610> day
