00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
first I think you should definitely

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.680 
first I think you should definitely
start<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.719> few<00:00:49.440> glasses<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.370> sunglasses<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
start with few glasses or sunglasses a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.080 
start with few glasses or sunglasses a
glasses<00:00:52.530> case<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.430> sunglasses<00:00:53.610> your

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
glasses case with your sunglasses your

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720

glasses in it just move your Bradley but

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
glasses in it just move your Bradley but
I<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.270> that's<00:00:57.420> essential<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.079> if

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
I think that's essential because if

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.260 
I think that's essential because if
you're<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.890> outside<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.309> gym<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> you

you're going outside for gym and you
don't<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.770> you're<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> need

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
don't know or if you're just if you need

your glasses
you<00:01:03.750> obviously<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.860> school<00:01:05.100> so
