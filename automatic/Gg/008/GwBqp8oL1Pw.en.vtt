they are lower height but if white for
example<00:01:46.990> went<00:01:47.560> here<00:01:47.920> then<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> future<00:01:48.910> turn

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
example went here then on a future turn

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.580 
example went here then on a future turn
white<00:01:49.420> would<00:01:49.600> be<00:01:49.630> able<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.869> go<00:01:49.960> on<00:01:50.080> top<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.410> here

you<00:01:51.010> can't<00:01:51.250> jump<00:01:51.550> over<00:01:51.700> spaces<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:52.960> once

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
you can't jump over spaces so once

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.810 
you can't jump over spaces so once
you're<00:01:53.440> isolated<00:01:54.190> let's<00:01:54.430> say<00:01:54.580> for<00:01:54.790> example

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
you're isolated let's say for example

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.270 
you're isolated let's say for example
Brown<00:01:55.810> jump<00:01:56.080> sooner<00:01:56.290> than<00:01:56.440> later<00:01:56.619> jumps<00:01:56.979> here

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
Brown jump sooner than later jumps here

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.830 
Brown jump sooner than later jumps here
this<00:01:57.580> one's<00:01:57.820> isolated<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.540> that<00:01:58.570> player

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
this one's isolated and that player

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.540 
this one's isolated and that player
going<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.080> simply<00:01:59.380> take<00:01:59.440> that<00:01:59.770> cup<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.190> put<00:02:00.460> it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
going to simply take that cup and put it

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.029 
going to simply take that cup and put it
in<00:02:00.670> front<00:02:00.910> of<00:02:01.060> themselves<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.740> can<00:02:02.890> see

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
in front of themselves so you can see

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.800 
in front of themselves so you can see
that<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.399> that's<00:02:03.640> really<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.270> all<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
that that that's really the all the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.840 
that that that's really the all the
rules<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.259> game<00:02:05.440> in<00:02:05.649> fact<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.399> games<00:02:06.610> so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
rules of the game in fact the games so

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.090 
rules of the game in fact the games so
simple<00:02:07.300> that<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.810> figured<00:02:08.200> let's<00:02:08.710> just<00:02:08.890> show

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
simple that I figured let's just show

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.100 
simple that I figured let's just show
you<00:02:09.160> kind<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:09.940> quick<00:02:10.210> rundown<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.780> how<00:02:10.960> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
you kind of a quick rundown of how the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:47.010 
you kind of a quick rundown of how the
game<00:02:11.350> works<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:46.000> when<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.300> over<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.690> simply

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
game works now when it's over you simply

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.770 
game works now when it's over you simply
take<00:02:47.230> each<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.620> colors<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.160> put<00:02:48.780> all

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
take each of the colors and you put all

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.750 
take each of the colors and you put all
the<00:02:50.050> ones<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:50.710> on<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.069> top<00:02:51.310> there

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
the ones that you have on the top there

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.690 
the ones that you have on the top there
and<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.660> see<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.050> instance<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:54.250> ice

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
and you can see in this instance the ice

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.590 
and you can see in this instance the ice
cream<00:02:55.180> color<00:02:55.600> has<00:02:55.990> one<00:02:56.470> array<00:02:57.459> now<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.450> was

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
cream color has one array now that was

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.750 
cream color has one array now that was
not<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.780> very<00:02:58.900> strategic<00:02:59.650> game<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.220> was<00:03:00.520> doing<00:03:00.700> it

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
not a very strategic game I was doing it

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.160 
not a very strategic game I was doing it
fairly<00:03:00.940> quickly<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.510> wasn't<00:03:01.750> them<00:03:01.870> putting<00:03:02.140> a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
fairly quickly it wasn't them putting a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.020 
fairly quickly it wasn't them putting a
lot<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.319> thought<00:03:02.560> into<00:03:02.590> strategy<00:03:03.280> but<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.910> can

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
lot of thought into strategy but you can

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.160 
lot of thought into strategy but you can
see<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.210> different<00:03:04.510> strategies<00:03:04.780> if<00:03:05.080> you

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
see the different strategies if you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.080 
see the different strategies if you
isolate<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.650> section<00:03:05.920> you'll<00:03:06.670> be<00:03:06.820> able<00:03:06.940> to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
isolate a section you'll be able to

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.790 
isolate a section you'll be able to
control<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.450> section<00:03:07.930> but<00:03:08.170> anyhow<00:03:08.500> that's

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
control that section but anyhow that's

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.890 
control that section but anyhow that's
how<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.040> play<00:03:09.250> now<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.240> can<00:03:10.450> see<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.750> this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
how you play now you can see that this

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.670 
how you play now you can see that this
game<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.430> incredibly<00:03:12.430> simple<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:14.080> problem

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
game is incredibly simple the problem

called Devon where you move stacks

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.730 
called Devon where you move stacks
around<00:03:54.790> now<00:03:55.120> this<00:03:55.330> one<00:03:55.510> here<00:03:55.780> has<00:03:56.020> a<00:03:56.050> ruin<00:03:56.620> at

around now this one here has a ruin at

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.620 
around now this one here has a ruin at

you can't attack a stack that's bigger

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.760 
you can't attack a stack that's bigger
than<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.490> so<00:04:01.210> essentially<00:04:02.050> when<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.620> bigger

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.980 
these are really cool pieces although
they<00:04:12.100> don't<00:04:12.370> fit<00:04:12.760> in<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.030> box<00:04:13.360> that<00:04:13.660> well<00:04:13.840> they

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
they don't fit in the box that well they

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.600 
they don't fit in the box that well they
kind<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.260> push<00:04:14.500> against<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.950> size<00:04:15.220> of<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.460> they

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
kind of push against the size of it they

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.249 
kind of push against the size of it they
push<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.940> sides<00:04:16.180> out<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.389> little<00:04:16.540> bit<00:04:16.720> it's

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 
push the sides out a little bit it's

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:18.990 
push the sides out a little bit it's
kind<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.590> it's<00:04:17.949> not<00:04:18.009> a<00:04:18.100> big<00:04:18.340> deal<00:04:18.519> just<00:04:18.549> it's<00:04:18.940> a

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
kind of it's not a big deal just it's a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.999 
kind of it's not a big deal just it's a
little<00:04:19.269> odd<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.449> they<00:04:19.720> do<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:20.019> but<00:04:20.889> they're

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
little odd that they do that but they're

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.250 
little odd that they do that but they're
great<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.579> they<00:04:21.729> have<00:04:21.759> pictures<00:04:22.210> on<00:04:22.539> them

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
great and they have pictures on them

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.080 
great and they have pictures on them
to<00:04:23.530> help<00:04:23.800> differentiate<00:04:24.190> between<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.760> colors

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
to help differentiate between the colors

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.550 
to help differentiate between the colors
and<00:04:25.270> that's<00:04:25.330> cool

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
and that's cool

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.680 
and that's cool
setup<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> little<00:04:27.910> wonky<00:04:28.150> because<00:04:28.450> you<00:04:28.540> kind

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
setup is a little wonky because you kind

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.030 
setup is a little wonky because you kind
of<00:04:28.720> just<00:04:28.900> set<00:04:29.050> up<00:04:29.170> and<00:04:29.410> that's<00:04:29.650> kind<00:04:29.920> of<00:04:29.980> a

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
of just set up and that's kind of a

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.430 
of just set up and that's kind of a
random<00:04:30.190> setup<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:30.820> like<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.510> said<00:04:31.780> in<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
random setup and like I said in the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.650 
random setup and like I said in the
overview<00:04:32.800> if<00:04:33.100> you're<00:04:33.430> placing<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.150> oh<00:04:34.390> come

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
overview if you're placing that oh come

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.050 
overview if you're placing that oh come
on<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:34.930> just<00:04:35.140> lengthens<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.650> game<00:04:35.860> out

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
on that just lengthens the game out

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.250 
on that just lengthens the game out
gameplay<00:04:37.060> is<00:04:37.210> quick<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.720> simple

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
gameplay is quick and simple

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.830 
gameplay is quick and simple
I'm<00:04:38.770> just<00:04:39.130> not<00:04:39.250> seeing<00:04:39.640> much<00:04:39.940> tension<00:04:40.390> in<00:04:40.720> the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
I'm just not seeing much tension in the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.940 
I'm just not seeing much tension in the
game<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.230> then<00:04:41.380> kind<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.680> an<00:04:41.770> abstract

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
game and then kind of an abstract

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.170 
game and then kind of an abstract
strategy<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.580> guess<00:04:42.700> I<00:04:42.790> want<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:43.000> be<00:04:43.060> like

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
strategy and I guess I want to be like

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.210 
strategy and I guess I want to be like
what<00:04:43.660> am<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.810> gonna<00:04:43.930> do<00:04:44.020> next<00:04:44.200> there's<00:04:45.040> not<00:04:45.190> a

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
what am I gonna do next there's not a

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.380 
what am I gonna do next there's not a
whole<00:04:45.460> lot<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.610> moves<00:04:45.880> there's<00:04:46.090> just<00:04:46.240> not<00:04:46.330> a

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
whole lot of moves there's just not a

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.960 
whole lot of moves there's just not a
lot<00:04:46.510> here<00:04:47.290> this<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:47.920> a<00:04:47.950> really<00:04:48.490> simple<00:04:48.730> concept

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
lot here this is a really simple concept

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.480 
lot here this is a really simple concept
that<00:04:49.480> they<00:04:49.750> took<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.260> put<00:04:50.920> some<00:04:51.040> really<00:04:51.310> cool

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
that they took and put some really cool

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.970 
that they took and put some really cool
components<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.390> put<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:52.870> in<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.990> box<00:04:53.170> but<00:04:53.860> it's

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
components and put it in a box but it's

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.800 
components and put it in a box but it's
really<00:04:54.220> not<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.520> entertaining<00:04:55.000> of<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.630> game

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
really not that entertaining of a game

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.660 
really not that entertaining of a game
and<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:55.990> played<00:04:56.200> with<00:04:56.290> two<00:04:56.470> three<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:56.980> four<00:04:57.430> and

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
and I played with two three and four and

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.420 
and I played with two three and four and
none<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.030> those<00:04:58.210> configurations<00:04:59.110> really<00:05:00.100> seem

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
none of those configurations really seem

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.580 
none of those configurations really seem
to<00:05:00.460> make<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.300> interesting<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:02.140> me<00:05:02.290> so

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
to make it that interesting to me so

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.110 
to make it that interesting to me so
while<00:05:03.100> it<00:05:03.250> looks<00:05:03.280> cool

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
while it looks cool

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.560 
while it looks cool
and<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.630> wasn't<00:05:04.900> unfun<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:06.160> play<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:07.210> just

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
and it wasn't unfun to play it's just

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.300 
and it wasn't unfun to play it's just
not<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:07.780> game<00:05:08.200> that<00:05:08.470> I<00:05:08.500> would<00:05:08.800> really<00:05:09.010> recommend

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
not a game that I would really recommend

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.730 
not a game that I would really recommend
that<00:05:09.850> much<00:05:10.060> at<00:05:10.240> this<00:05:10.360> point<00:05:10.480> because<00:05:11.080> there

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
that much at this point because there

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.110 
that much at this point because there
are<00:05:11.830> other<00:05:11.980> games<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.370> bring<00:05:12.700> a<00:05:12.790> level<00:05:12.970> of

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
are other games that bring a level of

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.150 
are other games that bring a level of
tension<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:13.660> make<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.140> that<00:05:14.560> that<00:05:14.800> makes

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
tension and make and that that makes

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.580 
tension and make and that that makes
it's<00:05:15.370> more<00:05:15.550> fun<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.120> rules<00:05:17.020> are<00:05:17.200> almost

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
it's more fun and the rules are almost

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.310 
it's more fun and the rules are almost
too<00:05:18.190> simple<00:05:18.690> but<00:05:19.690> they<00:05:19.870> don't<00:05:20.080> agree<00:05:20.230> on

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
too simple but they don't agree on

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.080 
too simple but they don't agree on
simple<00:05:20.950> rules<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.250> abstract<00:05:21.550> game<00:05:21.640> is<00:05:21.820> great

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
simple rules and abstract game is great

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.500 
simple rules and abstract game is great
but<00:05:22.600> there<00:05:22.780> needs<00:05:22.960> to<00:05:23.110> be<00:05:23.340> some<00:05:24.360> intensity<00:05:25.360> and

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
but there needs to be some intensity and

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.590 
but there needs to be some intensity and
some<00:05:25.630> cool<00:05:25.840> strategy<00:05:26.470> that's<00:05:27.100> not<00:05:27.430> here<00:05:27.850> so<00:05:28.240> I

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
some cool strategy that's not here so I

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.860 
some cool strategy that's not here so I
really<00:05:29.020> can't<00:05:29.140> recommend<00:05:29.320> this<00:05:29.710> one<00:05:30.870> thanks

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
really can't recommend this one thanks
