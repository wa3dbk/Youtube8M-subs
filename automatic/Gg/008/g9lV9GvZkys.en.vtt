00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
in the Andes two very different waters

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.420 
in the Andes two very different waters
and<00:01:01.000> they<00:01:01.090> don't<00:01:01.239> like<00:01:01.480> each<00:01:01.510> other<00:01:02.130> the<00:01:03.130> water

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
from the Rio Negro this is coming down

the<00:01:09.040> place<00:01:09.250> of<00:01:09.460> very<00:01:10.299> high<00:01:10.600> up<00:01:10.750> in<00:01:11.040> northern

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
the place of very high up in northern

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.029 
the place of very high up in northern
part<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.340> South<00:01:12.399> America<00:01:13.119> and<00:01:14.079> it<00:01:14.259> very<00:01:14.619> slowly

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
part of South America and it very slowly

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.879 
part of South America and it very slowly
percolates<00:01:15.700> down<00:01:15.789> and<00:01:16.329> makes<00:01:17.319> its<00:01:17.499> way<00:01:17.649> down

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:17.889 
percolates down and makes its way down

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:22.020 
percolates down and makes its way down
here<00:01:18.389> moves<00:01:19.389> very<00:01:19.630> slowly<00:01:20.189> has<00:01:21.189> no<00:01:21.520> minerals

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
here moves very slowly has no minerals

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.010 
here moves very slowly has no minerals
in<00:01:22.179> it<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:23.409> it's<00:01:23.740> traveling<00:01:24.219> so<00:01:24.520> slowly

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
in it because it's traveling so slowly

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.239 
in it because it's traveling so slowly
it<00:01:26.020> picks<00:01:26.319> up<00:01:26.499> a<00:01:26.649> lot<00:01:26.679> of<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:26.950> rotting

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
it picks up a lot of the rotting

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.639 
it picks up a lot of the rotting
vegetation<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.990> can<00:01:29.109> see<00:01:29.350> it's<00:01:29.499> like

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
vegetation and you can see it's like

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.960 
vegetation and you can see it's like
team<00:01:30.299> sack<00:01:31.299> fact<00:01:31.600> it's<00:01:31.779> exactly<00:01:31.869> like<00:01:32.289> teen

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.510 

it<00:01:35.780> floats<00:01:36.170> down<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.590> rivers<00:01:36.860> very<00:01:37.280> very

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
it floats down the rivers very very

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.030 
it floats down the rivers very very
slowly<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.260> as<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.440> does<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:40.300> it<00:01:41.300> picks<00:01:41.510> up

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
slowly and as it does so it picks up

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.760 
slowly and as it does so it picks up
heat<00:01:43.040> from<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.400> Amazon<00:01:44.000> sub<00:01:44.620> now<00:01:45.620> in

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
heat from the Amazon sub now in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.740 
heat from the Amazon sub now in
comparison<00:01:46.400> is<00:01:46.940> whitewater<00:01:47.570> I'm

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
comparison is whitewater I'm

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.320 
comparison is whitewater I'm
transitioning<00:01:48.200> into<00:01:48.760> it's<00:01:49.760> coming<00:01:50.030> down<00:01:50.180> from

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
transitioning into it's coming down from

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.610 
transitioning into it's coming down from
the<00:01:50.420> Andes<00:01:50.830> it's<00:01:51.830> moving<00:01:52.220> way<00:01:52.460> faster<00:01:53.470> this<00:01:54.470> is

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
the Andes it's moving way faster this is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.910 
the Andes it's moving way faster this is
actually<00:01:54.980> snowmelt<00:01:55.580> originally<00:01:56.540> it's<00:01:57.440> colder

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
actually snowmelt originally it's colder

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.410 
actually snowmelt originally it's colder
it's<00:01:58.100> probably<00:01:58.340> at<00:01:58.460> least<00:01:58.550> 10<00:01:58.850> degrees<00:01:59.180> colder

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
it's probably at least 10 degrees colder

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
it's probably at least 10 degrees colder
and<00:01:59.780> it's<00:02:00.710> traveling<00:02:01.190> much<00:02:01.490> much<00:02:01.820> faster<00:02:02.440> so

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
and it's traveling much much faster so

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.980 
and it's traveling much much faster so
you'll<00:02:03.590> see<00:02:03.800> around<00:02:04.070> me<00:02:04.720> vegetation<00:02:05.720> that's

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
you'll see around me vegetation that's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.219 
you'll see around me vegetation that's
swirling<00:02:06.350> around<00:02:07.270> things<00:02:08.270> like<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.959> is

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
swirling around things like that it is

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.730 
swirling around things like that it is
moving<00:02:09.500> very<00:02:09.679> quickly<00:02:11.290> because<00:02:12.290> it's<00:02:12.320> moving

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
moving very quickly because it's moving

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.380 
moving very quickly because it's moving
so<00:02:12.890> fast<00:02:13.130> picking<00:02:13.700> up<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.910> lot<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.240> them

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
so fast picking up a lot of them

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.980 
so fast picking up a lot of them
sediment<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.140> lot<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.010> debris<00:02:16.540> rushing<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.810> down

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
sediment a lot of debris rushing it down

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.820 
sediment a lot of debris rushing it down
the<00:02:18.140> river<00:02:18.490> so<00:02:19.490> because<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.560> these<00:02:21.560> two

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the river so because of that these two

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.390 
the river so because of that these two
rivers<00:02:22.250> will<00:02:22.520> travel<00:02:22.940> side<00:02:23.240> by<00:02:23.480> side<00:02:24.130> down<00:02:25.130> the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
rivers will travel side by side down the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.750 
rivers will travel side by side down the
Amazon<00:02:26.290> brought<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.440> 30<00:02:27.800> or<00:02:28.040> 40<00:02:28.490> miles

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
Amazon brought to 30 or 40 miles

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.510 
Amazon brought to 30 or 40 miles
depending<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.510> season<00:02:30.190> riding<00:02:31.190> down

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
depending on the season riding down

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.010 
depending on the season riding down
there<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.910> not<00:02:32.120> mixing<00:02:33.400> eventually<00:02:34.400> they<00:02:34.580> do

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
there and not mixing eventually they do

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.590 
there and not mixing eventually they do
but<00:02:36.020> it's<00:02:36.140> amazing<00:02:36.620> for<00:02:36.650> how<00:02:36.950> far<00:02:37.340> these<00:02:38.300> two

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
but it's amazing for how far these two
