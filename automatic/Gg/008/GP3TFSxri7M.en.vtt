00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.559
 hello to you gamers and be the ones 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.269
 welcome 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.599
 we find ourselves for success or 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:18.640
 trophies and priest inferno of the treal game 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.480
 fusion so to be able to unlock this 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.610
 success or trophies 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.039
 you have to find three 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.460
 squirrels hidden on the dlc fire in the 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.170
 deep 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.930
 so the first one is on the track 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.930
 the bottom of the bottom we just eject just 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.280
 there and then we hang on this 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.130
 screen in orient that left joystick 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:41.230
 to the right to open the valves and 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.690
 then to reappear at the checkpoint 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.130
 we will have to go right here 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.130
 under pipes that releases water 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.460
 so important things we can fall 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.020
 and reappear from a checkpoint 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.820
 time we opened the valves to 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.829
 can still recover 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.870
 the squirrel is no problem besides I 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.579
 scold me right there and so it's just 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.899
 after falling flat, you have to succeed 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.329
 move gently over this 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.889
 little ramp like these is then 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.759
 just let yourself go down 

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:14.759
 down 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.350
 and here we are we will position ourselves just 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.240
 in front of this lever we have oriental sounds 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.460
 linguistic left down that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.869
 explodes the barrels and there we 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.869
 shoppe our first squirrels 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.650
 so now we're going on 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.800
 immediately on the sub-county priest who is 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.540
 found on the catabase track then 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.970
 to arrive at a place you must pass 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.990
 this molten lava 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.910
 it's just after he's going to have to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.310
 eject from the bike to be able to follow 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.890
 a path in fps view so you have to 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.530
 just stand here and there notice the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.630
 signboard with the motorcycle to bar you 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.290
 eject by pressing y or triangle 1 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.140
 and then just follow the path 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.580
 it's quite long so look 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.020
 well the video because it's still 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.020
 hard to find 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.560
 so take as a landmark 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:29.939
 some places for example here the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:32.519
 little arrow so a hit you go back 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.680
 in this tunnel well past the first 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.819
 wells are then just right on the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.819
 locomotive that fell 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.790
 then right there you take a right and 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.440
 still right and there just look at 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.310
 right you have a little tunnel this 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.050
 is not the one to take 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.050
 it's right here 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.990
 once you get out of here you 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:14.330
 follow the arrow the direction that the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:18.280
 arrow then indicates deep down there 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.280
 just have to take this little ramp 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.360
 we continue here we notice a species 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:31.700
 kind of big hamper on the on 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.410
 the left we trace straight there we have 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.090
 several doors several cells 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.270
 we go to the last one at the bottom to 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.280
 left and it's just inside 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.000
 so we go back in the other direction and if 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.290
 we listen well we heard a little 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.500
 noise is the door that opened 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.800
 just enter the room 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.520
 is going to the bottom right the wall face 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.520
 to us will get up 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.620
 alas at the end of this conduit we will have 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.510
 access to the second and parish priest 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.400
 so I got a bug when I 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.769
 found this second squirrels the game has 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.690
 planted so I had to return the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.010
 look for and that's the reason for 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.430
 which you see the success that is 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.140
 unblocks 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.730
 in fact the game thought I already had 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.560
 picked up the three squirrels while this 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.090
 was only the second so normally 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.919
 you should not unlock the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.359
 success in the second and third 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.630
 so we will immediately go on the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.400
 third is priest and so that's it for 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.139
 third and last squirrels it's on 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.419
 the ferron smelt track that's going on 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.220
 so happen a moment where I owed you 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.010
 pass over all this lava in 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.380
 fusion on the track and just after we go 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.800
 having to climb this long climb from where 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.199
 lava 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.550
 hence the lava flow so that's for sure 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.979
 second floor that's going 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.180
 we will have to eject so just in 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.270
 top of this ramp 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.000
 we're going to have to eject just right here 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.800
 when you arrive just before 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.510
 eject because the characters on 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.370
 the rear at this level and the switch on 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.229
 the front when one is on the tip of 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.080
 the ramp and then eject in 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.470
 pressing the y or triangle key it 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.180
 have to hang on to the hook 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.360
 not to the chain well to the hooks as 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.880
 these here and there we have the right to a 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.250
 epic kinematics that refers to 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.250
 a great movie of the late 80s 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.580
 and so that's for this success or trophies 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:40.190
 go I give you an appointment on a 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.630
