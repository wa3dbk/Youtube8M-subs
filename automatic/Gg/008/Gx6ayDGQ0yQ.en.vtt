00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.000

 nintendo content generated by the 

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:45.339
 user as for example a guide of a 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.620
 nintendo game if we record videos 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.239
 independent we will receive a 60 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.370
 percent of the profits generated by the 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.569
 video if we record a whole channel 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.089
 we will generate a 70% eye to the words of 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.529
 judy pay what they do not get at all is 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.869
 that you get publicity and diffusion 

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:03.670
 free thanks to the youtubers that 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.619
 best way to sell and publicize a 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.390
 I play to see someone that you like 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.330
 playing and enjoying with said 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.920
 Attentive to the words of Dubai says yes 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.170
 game with a nintendo title in my 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.210
 what channel is safer than most 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.400
 visits and advertising revenue are 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.770
 derive from the fact that my followers 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.510
 are subscribed to me not necessarily to 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.759
 who want to see a game of nintendo in 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.000
 concrete for this reason the games of 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.280
 nintendo just happened at the end of the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.170
 list is to say judy pae what is us 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.090
 saying is that from now on it's not going 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.890
 to play Nintendo games or so we 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.619
 makes you understand but it's not the only one 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.869
 pronounced on this subject since it is 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.479
 code another youtube user the truth 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.610
 is that it also wanted to show very 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.380
 critical about it and these have been his 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.479
 words I've never dealt with a 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.759
 company that does not want visibility 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.220
 free video creators give 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.740
 big companies like sony microsoft and 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.960
 ubisoft rovio and others allow monetization 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.110
 lots lots of developers 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.880
 independent have also defined 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.729
 due to the openness of other companies 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.860
 rare encounter the idea of nintendo to 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.170
 compare it with the politics of others 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.370
 companies I do not see that it's attractive to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.010
 stable youtubers 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.280
 Of course, it has caused much controversy 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.739
 that nintendo partner this way 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.930
 to get into the world of youtube 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.700
 nintendo and trying to recruit 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.739
 youtubers good then to stay 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.959
 also with part of your benefits for 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.760
 supposedly nintendo as a company has 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.769
 all the right of the world to do what 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.230
 want with your eye games with this but 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.060
 of course the users also have 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.060
 all the right to criticize it
