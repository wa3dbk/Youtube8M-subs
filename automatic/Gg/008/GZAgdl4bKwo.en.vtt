00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
would cut off my signal at the wrong

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.190 
would cut off my signal at the wrong

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
places and take out a bit more than I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.880 
places and take out a bit more than I
want<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.969> sometimes<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> doesn't<00:02:00.210> cover<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
want and sometimes it doesn't cover the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.670 
want and sometimes it doesn't cover the
hum<00:02:01.969> if<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> set<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
hum if you don't have it set to that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.399 
hum if you don't have it set to that
level<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:05.939> I'm<00:02:06.119> doing<00:02:06.360> courting<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
level but here I'm doing courting and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.199 
level but here I'm doing courting and
having<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.979> lot<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.220> breaks<00:02:08.519> in<00:02:08.729> between<00:02:08.759> you

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
having a lot of breaks in between you

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.120 
having a lot of breaks in between you
hear<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.380> doesn't<00:02:10.649> cut<00:02:10.769> out<00:02:10.859> anything

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
hear that it doesn't cut out anything

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:42.950 
hear that it doesn't cut out anything
it's<00:02:11.250> not<00:02:11.340> supposed<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.530 

so<00:02:43.960> it's<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.140> really<00:02:44.320> quick<00:02:44.500> pedal<00:02:45.180> yeah<00:02:46.180> it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
so it's a really quick pedal yeah it

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.820 
so it's a really quick pedal yeah it
might<00:02:46.750> cost<00:02:46.960> more<00:02:47.230> than<00:02:47.410> some<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.710> other

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
might cost more than some of the other

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.770 
might cost more than some of the other
ones<00:02:48.010> they're<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.460> boss<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:49.150> know<00:02:49.690> they

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
ones they're just a boss I know they

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.570 
ones they're just a boss I know they
have<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.930> noise<00:02:50.140> reduction<00:02:50.320> panel<00:02:50.800> mxr<00:02:51.370> ones

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
have a noise reduction panel mxr ones

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.510 
have a noise reduction panel mxr ones
are<00:02:51.910> better<00:02:52.600> than<00:02:52.780> bosses<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.650> still<00:02:54.340> won't

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
are better than bosses but I still won't
