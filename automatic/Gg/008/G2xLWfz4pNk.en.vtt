00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
for the shot we kind of just put the the

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.560 
for the shot we kind of just put the the
camera<00:00:27.499> in<00:00:27.589> the<00:00:27.679> back<00:00:27.859> of<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:28.279> car<00:00:28.820> in<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.390> trunk

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
camera in the back of a car in the trunk

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.760 
camera in the back of a car in the trunk
and<00:00:30.220> what<00:00:31.220> I<00:00:31.249> did<00:00:31.490> was<00:00:31.519> on<00:00:32.240> action<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.320> the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
and what I did was on action the the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.800 
and what I did was on action the the
driver<00:00:34.010> started<00:00:34.430> driving<00:00:35.150> forward<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.720> then

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
driver started driving forward and then

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.189 
driver started driving forward and then
they've<00:00:36.260> reacted<00:00:36.469> and<00:00:36.920> then<00:00:37.760> he<00:00:38.090> he<00:00:38.750> ran

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
they've reacted and then he he ran

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.740 
they've reacted and then he he ran
toward<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.739> car<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.309> we<00:00:40.820> kind<00:00:41.420> of<00:00:41.480> tried<00:00:41.719> to

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
toward the car and we kind of tried to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.450 
toward the car and we kind of tried to
keep<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.109> at<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.350> same<00:00:42.530> pace<00:00:42.859> so<00:00:43.100> he's<00:00:43.280> not

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
keep it at the same pace so he's not

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.760 
keep it at the same pace so he's not
really<00:00:43.609> like<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.329> know<00:00:44.449> falling<00:00:44.899> behind<00:00:45.140> and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
really like you know falling behind and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.470 
really like you know falling behind and
catching<00:00:46.250> up<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:46.550> falling<00:00:46.760> behind<00:00:46.940> catching

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
catching up and falling behind catching

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.819 
catching up and falling behind catching
up<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:47.899> kind<00:00:48.079> of<00:00:48.109> had<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.260> orchestrate<00:00:48.469> it

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
up so we kind of had to orchestrate it

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.619 
up so we kind of had to orchestrate it
and<00:00:49.070> we<00:00:49.160> did<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:49.370> like<00:00:49.489> probably<00:00:50.210> like<00:00:50.359> three

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
and we did it like probably like three

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.540 
and we did it like probably like three
or<00:00:50.719> four<00:00:50.750> times<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:51.410> we<00:00:51.680> were<00:00:52.039> able<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.309> get<00:00:52.399> it

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
or four times and we were able to get it

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.430 
or four times and we were able to get it
so<00:00:53.210> we<00:00:53.239> just<00:00:53.480> had<00:00:53.600> him<00:00:53.719> run<00:00:53.899> toward<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.199> car

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
so we just had him run toward the car

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.529 
so we just had him run toward the car
and<00:00:54.739> we<00:00:55.129> extracted<00:00:55.760> him<00:00:56.030> from<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.390> picture

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
and we extracted him from the picture

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.500 
and we extracted him from the picture
using<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.530> rotoscoping<00:00:58.519> and<00:00:58.699> then<00:00:59.120> we<00:00:59.269> placed

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
using a rotoscoping and then we placed

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.259 
using a rotoscoping and then we placed
the<00:00:59.719> fire<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:00.429> the<00:01:01.429> background<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
the fire in the background the

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.509 
the fire in the background the
rotoscoping<00:01:02.809> was<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.109> main<00:01:03.649> was<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.370> main

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
rotoscoping was the main was the main

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.310 
rotoscoping was the main was the main
thing<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:04.699> took<00:01:04.910> so<00:01:05.089> long<00:01:05.269> this<00:01:05.750> spec<00:01:06.080> took

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
thing that took so long this spec took

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.590 
thing that took so long this spec took
about<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.890> month<00:01:07.400> or<00:01:07.760> maybe<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.120> little<00:01:08.240> bit<00:01:08.420> over

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
about a month or maybe a little bit over

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.900 
about a month or maybe a little bit over
a<00:01:08.630> month<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.170> complete<00:01:09.860> in<00:01:10.250> post-production

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
a month to complete in post-production

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.790 
a month to complete in post-production
so<00:01:11.450> pretty<00:01:11.630> much<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.930> bulk<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.410> work<00:01:12.530> was

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
so pretty much the bulk of the work was

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.230 
so pretty much the bulk of the work was
in<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:13.070> shot<00:01:13.340> I'm<00:01:13.670> pretty<00:01:13.880> sure<00:01:14.030> I<00:01:14.060> could

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
in this shot I'm pretty sure I could

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.460 
in this shot I'm pretty sure I could
have<00:01:14.330> used<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.630> green<00:01:14.870> screen<00:01:15.050> instead<00:01:15.350> of

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
have used a green screen instead of

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.010 
have used a green screen instead of
rotoscoping<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:16.270> green<00:01:17.270> screen<00:01:17.510> stuff<00:01:17.750> tends

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
rotoscoping but green screen stuff tends

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.640 
rotoscoping but green screen stuff tends
to<00:01:18.110> look<00:01:18.320> pretty<00:01:18.770> bad<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:20.480> just<00:01:21.200> opted<00:01:21.500> to

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
to look pretty bad so I I just opted to

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.950 
to look pretty bad so I I just opted to
go<00:01:22.040> with<00:01:22.460> rotoscoping<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.540> I<00:01:23.570> just<00:01:23.720> said<00:01:23.930> you

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
go with rotoscoping and I just said you

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.720 
go with rotoscoping and I just said you
know<00:01:24.110> what<00:01:24.290> I'll<00:01:25.010> just<00:01:25.220> deal<00:01:25.370> with<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.580> I'll

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
know what I'll just deal with it I'll

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.130 
know what I'll just deal with it I'll
just<00:01:25.880> wrote<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.090> scope<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.480> entire<00:01:26.720> thing<00:01:26.750> and

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
just wrote a scope the entire thing and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.530 
just wrote a scope the entire thing and
then<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:28.280> i<00:01:28.310> sat<00:01:28.580> down<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:28.910> do<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.180> i<00:01:29.300> was<00:01:29.420> like

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
then that i sat down to do it i was like

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.270 
then that i sat down to do it i was like
oh<00:01:29.690> what<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.260> hell<00:01:30.440> did<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.680> get<00:01:30.740> myself<00:01:30.980> into

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
oh what the hell did I get myself into

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.550 
oh what the hell did I get myself into
quitting<00:01:31.730> it<00:01:31.940> wasn't<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:32.810> bad<00:01:32.960> i<00:01:33.020> cut<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
quitting it wasn't that bad i cut the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.500 
quitting it wasn't that bad i cut the
shot<00:01:33.740> down<00:01:33.950> originally<00:01:34.670> was<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.850> long<00:01:35.120> but<00:01:35.480> now

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
shot down originally was a long but now

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.240 
shot down originally was a long but now
i<00:01:35.750> think<00:01:35.900> i<00:01:36.170> think<00:01:36.230> it's<00:01:36.500> only<00:01:36.590> about<00:01:36.770> 100

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
i think i think it's only about 100

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.520 
i think i think it's only about 100
something<00:01:37.460> frames<00:01:37.820> now<00:01:38.090> for<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.080> next<00:01:39.140> shot

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
something frames now for this next shot

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.110 
something frames now for this next shot
we<00:01:39.680> just<00:01:39.860> kind<00:01:40.010> of<00:01:40.040> had<00:01:40.190> him<00:01:40.340> run<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:40.850> then

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
we just kind of had him run and then

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.120 
we just kind of had him run and then
peel<00:01:41.300> off<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.690> side<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.320> hide<00:01:42.800> behind<00:01:42.950> a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
peel off to the side and hide behind a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.820 
peel off to the side and hide behind a
tree<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.550> then<00:01:43.970> we<00:01:44.390> added<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.840> flames<00:01:45.440> in<00:01:45.800> the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
tree and then we added the flames in the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.370 
tree and then we added the flames in the
background<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:46.550> then<00:01:46.670> we<00:01:46.760> added<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.380> explosion

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
background and then we added a explosion

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.350 
background and then we added a explosion
to<00:01:48.500> cover<00:01:48.740> up<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.250> flames<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.180> your<00:01:50.300> i

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
to cover up the flames so that your i

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.270 
to cover up the flames so that your i
couldn't<00:01:50.720> really<00:01:50.810> adjust<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.530> how<00:01:51.890> you

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
couldn't really adjust to it how you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.120 
couldn't really adjust to it how you
know<00:01:52.400> then<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.910> can<00:01:53.030> really<00:01:53.240> study<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.540> and

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
know then you can really study it and

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.680 
know then you can really study it and
after<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.370> explosion<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.330> happened

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
after the explosion it just so happened

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.720 
after the explosion it just so happened
that<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.020> camera<00:01:58.010> pans<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.640> left

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
that the camera pans to the left

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.580 
that the camera pans to the left
following<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.570> actor<00:01:59.900> you<00:02:00.050> might<00:02:00.200> also<00:02:00.350> see

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
following the actor you might also see

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.220 
following the actor you might also see
over<00:02:00.740> here<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.980> uh<00:02:01.190> there's<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.240> pan<00:02:02.600> up<00:02:02.930> which

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
over here that uh there's a pan up which

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.470 
over here that uh there's a pan up which
was<00:02:03.410> kind<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:03.980> an<00:02:04.100> afterthought<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.550> in

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
was kind of an afterthought in in

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.480 
was kind of an afterthought in in
post-production<00:02:05.990> because<00:02:06.410> when<00:02:07.070> i<00:02:07.100> added<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
post-production because when i added the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.800 
post-production because when i added the
235<00:02:08.379> aspect<00:02:09.379> ratio<00:02:09.679> bars<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:11.239> flame<00:02:11.629> in<00:02:11.750> the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
235 aspect ratio bars the flame in the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.140 
235 aspect ratio bars the flame in the
windows<00:02:12.049> couldn't<00:02:12.349> you<00:02:13.189> couldn't<00:02:13.340> see<00:02:13.609> it<00:02:13.730> so

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
windows couldn't you couldn't see it so

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.610 
windows couldn't you couldn't see it so
what<00:02:14.659> I<00:02:14.689> did<00:02:14.780> was<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.200> was<00:02:15.349> like<00:02:15.439> you<00:02:15.500> know<00:02:15.560> what

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
what I did was I was like you know what

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.350 
what I did was I was like you know what
let<00:02:16.219> me<00:02:16.250> just<00:02:16.340> pan

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
let me just pan

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.850 
let me just pan
up<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.720> post-production<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.740> can

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
up in post-production so that you can

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.990 
up in post-production so that you can
see<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.400> kind<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.610> figured<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.880> that

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
see that I kind of figured that that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.160 
see that I kind of figured that that
would<00:02:20.240> add<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> little<00:02:20.630> bit<00:02:20.780> more<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
would add a little bit more to the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.230 
would add a little bit more to the
cinematography<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.190> scene<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:23.030> ended

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
cinematography of the scene so it ended

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.480 
cinematography of the scene so it ended
up<00:02:23.360> working<00:02:23.510> out<00:02:23.810> also<00:02:24.440> we<00:02:24.590> brightened<00:02:25.310> up<00:02:25.340> his

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
up working out also we brightened up his

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.580 
up working out also we brightened up his
face<00:02:25.700> here<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.360> post-production<00:02:26.900> because<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
face here in post-production because the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.350 
face here in post-production because the
color<00:02:27.770> grading<00:02:28.100> really<00:02:28.490> really<00:02:28.730> darkened<00:02:29.300> his

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
color grading really really darkened his

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.120 
color grading really really darkened his
face<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:29.840> we<00:02:29.960> brightened<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.410> up<00:02:30.530> over<00:02:30.920> here

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
face so we brightened it up over here

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.850 
face so we brightened it up over here
you<00:02:31.190> have<00:02:31.430> your<00:02:31.550> basic<00:02:32.020> bullet<00:02:33.020> hits<00:02:33.320> against

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
you have your basic bullet hits against

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.060 
you have your basic bullet hits against
wood<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:36.200> kind<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.470> comp<00:02:36.710> that<00:02:36.890> in

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
wood so we just kind of comp that in

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.470 
wood so we just kind of comp that in
over<00:02:37.400> here<00:02:37.550> this<00:02:37.670> looks<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.030> very<00:02:38.240> basic

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
over here this looks like a very basic

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.020 
over here this looks like a very basic
shot<00:02:39.440> that's<00:02:39.740> one<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.010> Holy<00:02:40.190> shots<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
shot that's one of the Holy shots in the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.140 
shot that's one of the Holy shots in the
film<00:02:41.870> with<00:02:42.080> no<00:02:42.200> visual<00:02:42.530> effects<00:02:42.830> but<00:02:43.520> we<00:02:43.940> did

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
film with no visual effects but we did

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.610 
film with no visual effects but we did
brighten<00:02:44.750> his<00:02:44.840> face<00:02:45.050> up<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.290> little<00:02:45.500> bit

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
brighten his face up a little bit

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.680 
brighten his face up a little bit
because<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.790> color<00:02:47.000> grading<00:02:47.330> once<00:02:47.480> again

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
because the color grading once again

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.150 
because the color grading once again
darkened<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.470> we<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:48.740> kind<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:48.950> hand

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
darkened it so we just kind of hand

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.010 
darkened it so we just kind of hand
tracked<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.580> mask<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.270> there<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:50.840> was

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
tracked that mask in there this was

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.360 
tracked that mask in there this was
actually<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.320> first<00:02:51.380> visual<00:02:51.800> effect<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.340> I

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
actually the first visual effect that I

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.250 
actually the first visual effect that I
did<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.420> actually<00:02:53.570> came<00:02:53.870> out<00:02:53.990> looking

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
did and it actually came out looking

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.870 
did and it actually came out looking
really<00:02:54.620> good<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.070> I<00:02:55.310> was<00:02:55.430> like<00:02:55.580> this<00:02:55.820> is

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
really good and I was like this is

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.920 
really good and I was like this is
something<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.239> could<00:02:56.360> probably<00:02:56.510> keep<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
something I could probably keep on the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.140 
something I could probably keep on the
screen<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.170> little<00:02:57.260> bit<00:02:57.620> longer<00:02:57.860> but<00:02:58.489> when<00:02:59.090> I

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
screen a little bit longer but when I

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.340 
screen a little bit longer but when I
was<00:02:59.270> shooting<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.810> kind<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.050> figured<00:03:00.170> that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
was shooting it I kind of figured that

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.870 
was shooting it I kind of figured that
you<00:03:00.890> know<00:03:00.920> what<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.130> should<00:03:01.190> cut<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.850> middle

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
you know what I should cut in the middle

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.390 
you know what I should cut in the middle
because<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:03.260> don't<00:03:03.739> want<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.950> keep<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.130> visual

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
because I don't want to keep the visual

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.770 
because I don't want to keep the visual
effects<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.850> screen<00:03:05.150> for<00:03:05.180> too<00:03:05.390> long<00:03:05.570> so

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
effects on the screen for too long so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.030 
effects on the screen for too long so
that<00:03:05.930> your<00:03:06.050> i<00:03:06.080> can<00:03:06.290> adjust<00:03:06.380> i<00:03:06.680> wouldn't<00:03:06.920> see

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
that your i can adjust i wouldn't see

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.680 
that your i can adjust i wouldn't see
what<00:03:07.250> looks<00:03:07.430> fake<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.670> whatever<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.360> kind

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
what looks fake and whatever so I kind

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.670 
what looks fake and whatever so I kind
of<00:03:08.750> just<00:03:08.930> figured<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.260> know<00:03:09.320> what<00:03:09.500> let<00:03:09.650> me

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
of just figured you know what let me

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680 
of just figured you know what let me
just<00:03:09.739> add<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.400> cut<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:10.850> plus<00:03:11.090> it's<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.390> action

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
just add a cut and plus it's in action

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.780 
just add a cut and plus it's in action
so<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.200> figured<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.770> adding<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.220> cut<00:03:13.430> in<00:03:13.580> there

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
so I figured that adding a cut in there

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.520 
so I figured that adding a cut in there
was<00:03:14.090> kind<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.360> necessary<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.020> it<00:03:15.170> just<00:03:15.380> helps

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
was kind of necessary and it just helps

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.350 
was kind of necessary and it just helps
sell<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.860> effect<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.459> can<00:03:16.790> see<00:03:16.970> we<00:03:17.090> added<00:03:17.300> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.210 
sell the effect you can see we added the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.750 
explosion and then in the next shot we
added<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.760> black<00:03:20.450> charred<00:03:21.260> grass<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.130> we

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
added the black charred grass and we

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.570 
added the black charred grass and we
added<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.600> second<00:03:24.590> half<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.040> explosion

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
added the second half of the explosion

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.640 
added the second half of the explosion
there<00:03:25.760> we<00:03:26.120> also<00:03:26.269> added<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.840> bullet<00:03:27.350> hits<00:03:27.530> in

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
there we also added the bullet hits in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.130 
there we also added the bullet hits in
the<00:03:27.739> ground<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.549> ricochets<00:03:29.150> off<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.540> dirt<00:03:29.720> so

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
the ground the ricochets off the dirt so

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.420 
the ground the ricochets off the dirt so
here's<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.440> shot<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.799> I<00:03:30.860> kind<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.070> picked<00:03:31.280> up

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
here's a shot that I kind of picked up

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.310 
here's a shot that I kind of picked up
about<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.820> month<00:03:32.030> later<00:03:32.660> maybe<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:33.049> little<00:03:33.170> bit

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
about a month later maybe a little bit

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.990 
about a month later maybe a little bit
longer<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.769> didn't<00:03:34.250> like<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.400> original<00:03:34.850> shot

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
longer I didn't like the original shot

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.910 
longer I didn't like the original shot
that<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.180> got<00:03:35.390> on<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.989> day<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.380> shoot<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:36.890> I

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
that I got on the day of the shoot so I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.370 
that I got on the day of the shoot so I
went<00:03:37.430> back<00:03:37.519> out<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.209> picked<00:03:38.930> up<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.140> shot

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
went back out and I picked up the shot

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.970 
went back out and I picked up the shot
only<00:03:39.950> problem<00:03:40.310> was<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.760> wreath<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:42.590> wasn't

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
only problem was that wreath it wasn't

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.710 
only problem was that wreath it wasn't
there<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.489> day<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:43.670> went<00:03:43.850> back<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.360> was<00:03:44.420> thrown

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
there the day I went back it was thrown

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.320 
there the day I went back it was thrown
out<00:03:44.870> actually<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:45.560> what<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.100> had<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.310> do<00:03:46.519> was<00:03:46.850> I

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
out actually so what I had to do was I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.560 
out actually so what I had to do was I
kind<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.900> extracted<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.830> wreath<00:03:49.040> from<00:03:49.730> one<00:03:50.480> of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
kind of extracted the wreath from one of

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.990 
kind of extracted the wreath from one of
the<00:03:50.630> other<00:03:50.660> shots<00:03:51.049> which<00:03:51.769> was<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.010> head-on<00:03:52.430> shot

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
the other shots which was a head-on shot

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.880 
the other shots which was a head-on shot
so<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.900> would<00:03:54.049> match<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.500> then<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:54.680> kind<00:03:54.860> of

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
so it would match and then I kind of

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.740 
so it would match and then I kind of
shrunk<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.340> down<00:03:55.370> blended<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.239> using<00:03:56.540> color

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
shrunk it down blended it using color

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.440 
shrunk it down blended it using color
correction<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:58.760> know<00:03:58.850> just<00:03:58.880> pasted<00:03:59.360> it

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
correction and you know just pasted it

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.789 
correction and you know just pasted it
on<00:03:59.540> there<00:03:59.780> and<00:03:59.840> then<00:03:59.900> in<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.350> final<00:04:00.500> shot

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
on there and then in the final shot

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.100 
on there and then in the final shot
where<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.280> camera<00:04:01.580> pans<00:04:01.880> up<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.330> just<00:04:02.720> motion

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
where the camera pans up I just motion

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.699 
where the camera pans up I just motion
tracked<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:03.470> into<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.769> shot<00:04:03.980> Oh<00:04:04.220> on<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.030> Jets

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
tracked it into the shot Oh on the Jets

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.259 
tracked it into the shot Oh on the Jets
well<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.739> quick<00:04:07.010> Google<00:04:07.370> search<00:04:07.400> came<00:04:07.970> up<00:04:08.000> with

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
well a quick Google search came up with

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.910 
well a quick Google search came up with
this<00:04:08.420> picture<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.049> look<00:04:09.500> it's<00:04:09.590> against<00:04:09.830> a

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
this picture and look it's against a

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.940 
this picture and look it's against a
blue<00:04:10.190> sky<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:11.480> just<00:04:11.720> extracted<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.680> Jets

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
blue sky so I just extracted the Jets

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.240 
blue sky so I just extracted the Jets
using<00:04:13.579> key<00:04:13.760> light<00:04:13.970> i<00:04:14.180> scaled<00:04:14.780> them<00:04:14.900> up<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.290> I

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
using key light i scaled them up and I

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.610 
using key light i scaled them up and I
added<00:04:16.760> some<00:04:16.970> motion<00:04:17.479> blur<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.900> After<00:04:18.380> Effects

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
added some motion blur in After Effects

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.550 
added some motion blur in After Effects
and<00:04:18.859> I<00:04:19.609> animated<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.390> position<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.410> have

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
and I animated the position and you have

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.300 
and I animated the position and you have
your<00:04:21.739> jets<00:04:22.010> flying<00:04:22.340> by

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
your jets flying by

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.620 
your jets flying by
