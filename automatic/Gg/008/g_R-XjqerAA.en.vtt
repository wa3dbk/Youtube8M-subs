00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.240
 that does not exceed 2% 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.880
 the migration that we are making 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.890
 server 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.410

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.640

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.710
 I have also sent

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.730

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.430
 puteando to level of truth so 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.420
 I tried my best 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.940
 Y 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.890
 out there I read on some forum page 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.470
 American or North American 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.060
 they had a similar problem a 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.540
 last time they had a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.540
 upgrade 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.860
 the user said that we had to 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.860
 uninstall everything from the client of 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.610
 hyères and reinstall everything good 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.890

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.430
 I tried it too and it did not work 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 the idea I wanted to send my computer to 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.700
 toilet 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.380
 trying again 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.060
 by modifying certain things you can achieve it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.680

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.680

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.810
 I really do not have a lot of connection 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.920
 I will explain quickly how 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.980
