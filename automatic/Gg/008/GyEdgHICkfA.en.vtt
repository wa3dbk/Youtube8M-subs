droids<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.350> customize<00:02:41.770> because<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.160> think

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
droids to customize because I think

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.370 
droids to customize because I think
they're<00:02:42.490> just<00:02:42.670> better<00:02:43.360> proportioned<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
they're just better proportioned and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
they're easier to customize and they

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.270 
they're easier to customize and they
just<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.470> results<00:02:47.920> speak<00:02:48.010> for<00:02:48.160> themselves

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
