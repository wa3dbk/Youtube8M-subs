00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.660
 east of the big lyon in the commune of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 decines charpieu the site of the great 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.109
 Montout is fast becoming a pole 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.449
 strategy for the development of 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 the Lyon agglomeration on the agenda 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.019
 the realization of the stage of the lights 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.300
 worn by the Olympique Lyonnais 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.580
 sports equipment with a capacity of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.070
 68 people and a program of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 construction of equipment at destination 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.469
 tertiary hotel business and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.540
 Hobbies 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.190
 even if the stadium is the lever of this 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.930
 urban project the big lyon is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 more focused on redevelopment 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.190
 global territory so that the future 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.950
 site meet the demographic challenges 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 and those of sustainable development as well 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.579
 the water management teams have 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.930
 been mobilized first so 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.899
 to undertake a general reflection 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.309
 on site water management then the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.230
 work of the Water Directorate of the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.149
 grand lyon sits on the three 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.760
 main issues that are the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.049
 first stormwater management 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.549
 with in fact the limitation of 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.750
 flooding and time management 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.979
 rain with all the assets the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.430
 runoff that can happen on 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.110
 the site 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 the second is the management of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.369
 sanitation with the evacuation of 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.680
 wastewater that will be created by the site 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.850
 and therefore the evacuation of its wastewater 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.729
 towards the treatment plant 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.080
 of the feyssine and the third 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.750
 problematic is the diet in 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.240
 drinking water from the entire project 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.189
 urban that must be created after three 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 years of studies the work of the direction 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.210
 of water started last February 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.600
 and this for a first phase of 19 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.180
 weeks 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.159
 objective rainwater management 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.190
 the location of the future stadium being on 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.230
 a flood risk site 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.510
 if the teams of the big Lyon undertaken 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.520
 first the inevitable displacement 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.470
 two existing infiltration basins 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.260
 the operation moving the basins of the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.510
 Montout is about creating new 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.220
 basins that will replace the 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.250
 basins that are at present on 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.420
 the site recreating the same volume of 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.000
 storage and the same surface 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.050
 infiltration of these basins 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.900
 the operation moving the basins of the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.260
 Montout is spread over a duration of 19 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.210
 weeks 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.550
 the first works consisting of 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.830
 carry out the earthworks of these 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.330
 basins since we have holes in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.040
 create nearly thirty six thousand meters 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.740
 volume cube 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.050
 so we have to create these holes created the 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.250
 earthworks then we will come 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.900
 beat nepal boards that are going 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.580
 actually constitute the slopes of the basins 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.800
 we will also create a structure 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.070
 strengthen embankments constitute 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.750
 the other floor slopes of the basins and 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.220
 then it's up to him will be dressed by 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.380
 gabions in fact these are cages 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.750
 grilled with pebbles inside 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.700
 who will come to give a landscape aspect 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.160
 more friendly than bare slopes 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.610
 then we will come to vegetate the bottom 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.310
 basins 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.410
 finally we will come to create the fence all 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.580
 around the basins to prevent 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.680
 feet come in the background 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.390
 of these basins the site of the great mountain 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.700
 and for the great lyon truly 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.590
 the opportunity to demonstrate his expertise 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.420
 the imposing yard many 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.489
 constraints we actually had 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.280
 constraints rather limited time 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.989
 to release the rights of way 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.570
 works for infrastructure that 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.910
 will arrive we have also heard 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.350
 always worry about the constraint 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.060
 because we are here to 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.860
 spend public money so for 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.360
 optimize our expenses and 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.560
 and after there is a pretty compelling 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.540
 important for community management 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.800
 because for the moment we are still 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.600
 alone on the site but very 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.760
 quickly the road teams the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.260
 stadium teams are coming up and we're going 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.610
 to meet at a dozen or even 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.710
 fifteen companies working 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.210
 at the same time on the site so we have 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.860
 all a management of the security of the 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.330
 during the construction phase to be implemented 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.380
 artwork 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.940
 three months after the launch of 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.920
 works the great lyon holds its 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.690
 commitments his teams complete the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.760
 displacement of the basins and start the 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.920
 remediation work co activity 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.930
 will be the workforce in a few weeks 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.640
 the teams of the road will start 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.060
 then the accessibility works at 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.800
 site 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.570
 while the big stadium teams 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.870
 will consider the break of their first 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.870
