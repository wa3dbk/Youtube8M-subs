00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello today i'm with julien 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.960
 coach photos of all my coaches point 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 com then to succeed perfectly 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.660
 your photo and return the real ones 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.120
 colors 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.049
 Julian will show you how to make a 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.930
 white balance 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.740
 we will evoke the meaning the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.130
 white balance you have to know that the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.410
 white is not always white imagine 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.790
 for example we are in a room 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 you have a blue wall in front of you 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.059
 have another white wall you do not perceive 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.370
 not the really white wall he takes the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.200
 color of the blue cairo in front it's going to be 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.860
 so a bluish white 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.140
 you have conditions where the white goes 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 to be called cold white colors a little 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.430
 bluish or others a warm white a little 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.840
 yellowish for this it is important to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 understand well the system of good 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.910
 set your device to be faithful 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.309
 the colors you have in front of you 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.770
 we will start with the setting 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.270
 automatic white balance that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.260
 you will find both on your 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.180
 reflex your bridge your contact 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.780
 only by a small wheel with 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.680
 a symbol sun clouds or a light 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 artificial 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.189
 take yourself a picture the same and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.470
 change the settings you will see that he 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.869
 there are big changes in the result 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.970
 colors if you take to 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.280
 inside your house a photo 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.130
 with a light setting of the day at large 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.740
 sun the result of the colors will only be 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.710
 not faithful for that do the mount 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.170
 settings according to your situation 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.350
 then the last point is the setting 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.579
 manual 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.049
 it is important to give 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.439
 information your camera 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.960
 ie what is the white 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.520
 in the situation where you are 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.520
 I take the example I am in a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.950
 apartment a very blue wall a light 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.259
 artificial ceiling on the other side 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.899
 a very white wall the camera is not 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.560
 not able to know the true color 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.080
 of white 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.700
 for that you need an accessory that 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.270
 you simply find a sheet 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.370
 white or for photographers at geri 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.700
 you buy a pattern that is a fabric 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.080
 18% neutral gray purchased in a 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.269
 photo store so we go 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.310
 continue for example with the fac 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.560
 white walk in your room 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.060
 with the blue wall the white sheet 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.190
 full frame then belly and in the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.670
 your camera settings and you 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.269
 we say that this picture there so your 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.260
 blank sheet corresponds to whites of 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.900
 your universe and then the device 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.130
 photo will make its settings internally 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.450
 and all the photos that are taken 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.420
 in this piece 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.540
 gold a faithful reproduction of the colors 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.860
 we will do live an example 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.209
 concrete white balance 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.239
 I will take my blank sheet 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.250
 I'm going to zoom in on this 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.250
 sheet to have no other 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.799
 disturbing color 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.579
 here you see that the white 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.980
 then I will show you also in 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.670
 direct a bad adjustment of the scale 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.400
 whites 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.400
 you see the result with a bad 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.609
 setting the white balance the landscape 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.900
 surrounding plus my portrait that was 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.590
 initially rather on a yellow hue 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.489
 yellowish goes on to a hue rather 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.810
 bluish and now I'm going to restore the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.650
 balance for the universe to match 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.530
 to accuracy 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.370
 in conclusion the white balance is 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.139
 very important 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.980
 take as an example the photo that is 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.170
 just behind me a building where there 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.700
 had artificial light 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.760
 the setting was rather in light of the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.459
 day and we can see an atmosphere 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.650
 rather greenish you can harm 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.220
 the aesthetics of the photo it can be a 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.220
 aesthetic bias
