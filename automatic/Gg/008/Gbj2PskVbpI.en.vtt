00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
all of those features so let's start

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080 
all of those features so let's start
with<00:00:37.350> some<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> incredible<00:00:38.520> things<00:00:39.000> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
with some of the incredible things that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
with some of the incredible things that
we<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.750> let's<00:00:40.170> first<00:00:40.410> turn<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
we see here let's first turn it on this

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.790 
we see here let's first turn it on this
is<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.899> click<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.440> button

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
is all you do you click the on button

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040 
is all you do you click the on button
and<00:00:44.329> it's<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> tell<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> current

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and it's going to tell you the current

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.340 
and it's going to tell you the current
temperature<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:47.789> basically<00:00:48.270> what<00:00:49.230> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
temperature and then basically what you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
temperature and then basically what you
do<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.710> set<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.039> temperature<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.760> super

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
do to set your temperature it's super

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.860 
do to set your temperature it's super
easy<00:00:51.590> you<00:00:52.760> simply<00:00:53.760> push<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.840> down

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
easy you simply push the up or down

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
easy you simply push the up or down
button<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.190> case<00:00:56.460> we'll<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
button in this case we'll go up and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.560 
button in this case we'll go up and
we'll<00:00:57.480> set<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:57.930> 88<00:00:58.379> degree<00:00:59.329> temperature<00:01:00.329> for

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
we'll set an 88 degree temperature for

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.470 
we'll set an 88 degree temperature for
inside<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.930> incubator<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.180> in<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> few

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
inside the incubator and in a few

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.030 
inside the incubator and in a few
minutes<00:01:03.840> you'll<00:01:04.049> achieve<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.619> 88

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
minutes you'll achieve that 88

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.250 
minutes you'll achieve that 88
incubation<00:01:05.880> temperature<00:01:06.090> what's<00:01:06.990> neat<00:01:07.229> about

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
incubation temperature what's neat about

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.160 
incubation temperature what's neat about
this<00:01:07.740> though<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.220> doesn't<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.880> keep<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.810> also

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this though it doesn't just keep it also

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.670 
this though it doesn't just keep it also
cools<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> actually<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.080> I

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
cools so you can actually go down I

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
cools so you can actually go down I
think<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:14.970> low<00:01:15.210> temperature<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
think it's a pretty low temperature that

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
think it's a pretty low temperature that
this<00:01:16.049> will<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.439> too<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.490> also<00:01:17.670> will

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this will go down too and it also will

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.060 
this will go down too and it also will
go<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.659> high<00:01:18.780> temperature<00:01:19.070> but

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
go up to a very high temperature but

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
go up to a very high temperature but
generally<00:01:20.549> speaking<00:01:20.820> we're<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.360> stay

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
generally speaking we're going to stay

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.179 
generally speaking we're going to stay
in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.170> 80s<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.369> most<00:01:23.880> reptile<00:01:24.450> eggs<00:01:25.189> you'll

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
in the 80s for most reptile eggs you'll

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.649 
in the 80s for most reptile eggs you'll
have<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> look<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:26.909> own<00:01:27.060> individual

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
have to look up your own individual

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.030 
have to look up your own individual
species<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.320> incubating<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
species that your incubating for the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.550 
species that your incubating for the
correct<00:01:29.700> temperatures<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.049> also<00:01:31.229> goes<00:01:31.500> up

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
correct temperatures but it also goes up

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.499 
correct temperatures but it also goes up
to<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.280> most<00:01:32.490> birds<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:32.970> at<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.360> is

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
to what most birds are at which is

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
to what most birds are at which is
around<00:01:33.720> 99<00:01:34.259> degrees<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> very

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
around 99 degrees so it's a very

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
around 99 degrees so it's a very
versatile<00:01:36.180> incubator<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.530> see

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
versatile incubator and as you can see

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.460 
versatile incubator and as you can see
what<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> wonderful<00:01:39.030> viewing<00:01:39.810> space<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.380> you

what a wonderful viewing space that you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.609 
what a wonderful viewing space that you
have<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.659> it<00:01:42.659> also<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> light<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
have here so it also has a light and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.440 
have here so it also has a light and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
on inside the incubator and basically

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.060 
on inside the incubator and basically
opening<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.360> unit<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.689> very<00:01:51.869> easy<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.770> got

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
opening this unit is very easy it's got

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
opening this unit is very easy it's got
a<00:01:53.100> nice<00:01:53.430> handle<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.240> actually<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
a nice handle that actually kind of

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
a nice handle that actually kind of
locks<00:01:55.200> into<00:01:55.470> place<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> close<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.399> so

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
locks into place when you close it so

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.399 
locks into place when you close it so
you<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.780> worry<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.200> somehow

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
you don't have to worry that somehow

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:58.850 
you don't have to worry that somehow
it's

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.100 
it's
swinging<00:01:59.340> open<00:01:59.430> or<00:02:00.270> something's<00:02:00.870> going<00:02:01.080> to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
swinging open or something's going to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.450 
swinging open or something's going to
happen<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.650> it<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.980> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.190> cause<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
happen to it that's going to cause a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.420 
happen to it that's going to cause a
temperature<00:02:03.060> fluctuation<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.860> easy<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
temperature fluctuation so very easy to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.200 
temperature fluctuation so very easy to
use<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:06.810> also<00:02:06.990> has<00:02:07.410> an<00:02:07.740> adjustable<00:02:08.310> shelf<00:02:09.000> in

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
use it also has an adjustable shelf in

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.360 
use it also has an adjustable shelf in
here<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.289> actually<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.860> has<00:02:11.009> several

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
here and you can actually it has several

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.460 
here and you can actually it has several
different<00:02:11.550> set<00:02:12.060> level<00:02:12.480> settings<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.320> you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
different set level settings that you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.680 
different set level settings that you
can<00:02:13.650> go<00:02:13.800> into<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:14.760> people<00:02:15.090> actually<00:02:15.510> also

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
can go into some people actually also

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.940 
can go into some people actually also
create<00:02:16.200> their<00:02:16.380> own<00:02:16.530> shelf<00:02:17.190> out<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:18.180> acrylic

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
create their own shelf out of acrylic

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.550 
create their own shelf out of acrylic
very<00:02:19.950> easy<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.490> do<00:02:20.900> there's<00:02:21.900> other<00:02:22.200> slide

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
very easy to do there's other slide

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.530 
very easy to do there's other slide
areas<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.340> put<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> into<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.360> can

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
areas that you can put it into you can

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.570 
areas that you can put it into you can
make<00:02:24.750> stands<00:02:25.050> if<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.350> want<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.740> but<00:02:26.130> we<00:02:26.310> find

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
make stands if you want to but we find

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.449 
make stands if you want to but we find
the<00:02:26.670> easiest<00:02:27.030> way<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.600> maybe<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:29.220> know<00:02:29.250> if

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the easiest way is maybe not you know if

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.560 
the easiest way is maybe not you know if
you're<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.790> do<00:02:29.880> something<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.360> this

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
you're going to do something like this

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.040 
you're going to do something like this
and<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.230> your<00:02:31.650> standard<00:02:32.010> kind<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.730> um

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
and you have your standard kind of um

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.540 
and you have your standard kind of um
plastic<00:02:34.050> container<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.830> few<00:02:35.190> small<00:02:35.370> holes

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
plastic container with a few small holes

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.270 
plastic container with a few small holes
put<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.660> then<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:37.950> your

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
put in it and then you have like your

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.150 
put in it and then you have like your
eggs<00:02:39.020> inside<00:02:40.020> with<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> vermiculite<00:02:40.650> your

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
eggs inside with the vermiculite your

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
eggs inside with the vermiculite your
date<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.510> kind<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.750> eggs<00:02:42.959> they<00:02:43.110> are

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
date and and what kind of eggs they are

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.410 
date and and what kind of eggs they are
I<00:02:43.470> advised<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.580> incubator<00:02:44.880> using<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
I advised in this incubator using a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.060 
I advised in this incubator using a
little<00:02:45.660> smaller<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.890> make

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
little smaller one so that you can make

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.770 
little smaller one so that you can make
excellent<00:02:47.550> use<00:02:47.700> because<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.300> could<00:02:48.450> stack

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
excellent use because you could stack

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.920 
excellent use because you could stack
quite<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.770> bit<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.310> these<00:02:50.910> kind<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.330> containers

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
quite a bit of these kind of containers

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.229 
quite a bit of these kind of containers
in<00:02:52.140> smaller<00:02:52.500> sizes<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.340> here<00:02:53.610> we've<00:02:54.209> had

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
in smaller sizes up in here we've had

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.300 
in smaller sizes up in here we've had
some<00:02:54.600> people<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:55.080> smaller<00:02:55.470> reptile<00:02:56.130> eggs

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
some people with smaller reptile eggs

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.690 
some people with smaller reptile eggs
get<00:02:56.550> 90<00:02:57.000> plus<00:02:57.570> eggs<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.020> here<00:02:58.260> okay<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.489> does

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
get 90 plus eggs in here okay so it does

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.890 
get 90 plus eggs in here okay so it does
hold<00:03:00.000> quite<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.360> bit<00:03:00.600> at<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.650> bottom<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.250> is

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
hold quite a bit at the bottom here is

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.710 
hold quite a bit at the bottom here is
your<00:03:03.900> water<00:03:04.140> tray<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.010> simply<00:03:05.519> fill<00:03:05.790> up<00:03:06.030> this

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
your water tray you simply fill up this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.729 
your water tray you simply fill up this
water<00:03:07.110> tray

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.220 
water tray
very<00:03:08.250> easy<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.790> has<00:03:08.880> water<00:03:09.180> tracks<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.989> water

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
very easy it has water tracks the water

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.650 
very easy it has water tracks the water
dissipates<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.040> increases<00:03:11.880> humidity<00:03:12.390> inside

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
dissipates and increases humidity inside

dissipates and increases humidity inside
the<00:03:13.230> incubator<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:14.010> course<00:03:15.110> we<00:03:16.110> advise<00:03:16.470> that

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
the incubator of course we advise that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.949 
the incubator of course we advise that
you<00:03:16.980> go<00:03:17.160> ahead<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.820> put<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:20.690> put<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> thermometer

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
you go ahead and put a put a thermometer

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.530 
you go ahead and put a put a thermometer
in<00:03:22.350> there<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.190> besides<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.970> readout

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
in there so that you besides the readout

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.270 
in there so that you besides the readout
that<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.810> get<00:03:25.019> here<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.830> also<00:03:26.010> have

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
that you get here and you also have

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.220 
that you get here and you also have
another<00:03:26.310> thermometer<00:03:27.180> which<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:27.840> read<00:03:28.049> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
another thermometer which can read the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.170 
another thermometer which can read the
varying<00:03:28.620> levels<00:03:29.040> because<00:03:29.700> there<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
varying levels because there is going to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.420 
varying levels because there is going to
be<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.299> little<00:03:30.570> variation<00:03:31.350> at<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.830> bottom<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
be a little variation at the bottom and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.190 
be a little variation at the bottom and
the<00:03:32.549> top<00:03:32.580> so<00:03:33.150> normally<00:03:33.570> when<00:03:33.720> we<00:03:33.900> do

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the top so normally when we do

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.350 
the top so normally when we do
incubation<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:34.980> reptile<00:03:35.340> eggs<00:03:35.549> we<00:03:35.970> put<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
incubation of reptile eggs we put the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.050 
incubation of reptile eggs we put the
new<00:03:36.480> ones<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.930> bottom<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.519> then<00:03:38.519> as<00:03:38.730> we

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
new ones in the bottom and then as we

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.880 
new ones in the bottom and then as we
add<00:03:39.239> more<00:03:39.269> eggs<00:03:39.810> from<00:03:40.140> different<00:03:40.500> clutches

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
add more eggs from different clutches

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.220 
add more eggs from different clutches
they<00:03:41.430> start<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.850> build<00:03:42.000> up<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.510> top<00:03:42.870> ones

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
they start to build up so the top ones

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.280 
they start to build up so the top ones
become<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.830> ones<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.760> are<00:03:45.180> ready<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.110> hatch

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
become the ones that are ready to hatch

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.490 
become the ones that are ready to hatch
earlier<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.370> that's<00:03:47.970> basically<00:03:48.600> how<00:03:49.170> easy

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
earlier so that's basically how easy

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.220 
earlier so that's basically how easy
this<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:52.070> there's<00:03:53.070> kind<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.519> neat

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230

just shut down because it's achieved its

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.580 
just shut down because it's achieved its
temperature<00:04:26.139> and<00:04:27.419> basically<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.750> think<00:04:29.290> I've

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
temperature and basically I think I've

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.770
