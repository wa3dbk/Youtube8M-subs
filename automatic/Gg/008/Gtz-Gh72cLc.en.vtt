wanted to have and nothing else yeah so
it<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.510> was<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> primary<00:00:43.079> focus

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it is like that was the primary focus

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.529 
it is like that was the primary focus
for<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.579> me<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.149> has<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.510> few

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
for this one to me this one has a few

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.470 
for this one to me this one has a few
different<00:00:45.989> layers<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:47.070> magic<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:48.149> here

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
different layers of magic going on here

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
different layers of magic going on here
so<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> layers<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.800> fresh<00:00:50.129> fruit

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so one of the layers is fresh fruit

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.700 
so one of the layers is fresh fruit
juices<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.940> fresh<00:00:51.149> pineapple<00:00:51.660> juice<00:00:51.710> so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
juices like fresh pineapple juice so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
juices like fresh pineapple juice so
fresh<00:00:53.340> juice<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> moisturizer<00:00:54.210> may<00:00:54.660> sound<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
fresh juice in a moisturizer may sound a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600 
fresh juice in a moisturizer may sound a
little<00:00:55.050> bit<00:00:55.260> weird<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.100> actually<00:00:56.219> use<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
little bit weird but we actually use it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.270 
little bit weird but we actually use it
for<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.600> enzyme<00:00:58.020> properties<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> has<00:00:58.829> so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
for the enzyme properties that it has so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.610 
for the enzyme properties that it has so
those<00:00:59.579> little<00:00:59.760> alpha<00:01:00.539> hydroxy<00:01:00.899> acids<00:01:01.469> in

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
those little alpha hydroxy acids in

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.830 
those little alpha hydroxy acids in
there<00:01:01.800> are<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.000> almost<00:01:03.510> act<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
there are going to almost act like a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960 
there are going to almost act like a
micro<00:01:04.290> level<00:01:04.470> exfoliator<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.610> makes<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
micro level exfoliator so that makes the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.899 
micro level exfoliator so that makes the
skin<00:01:06.210> feel<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:06.720> smooth<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.369> gives<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
skin feel really smooth and gives it a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.830 
skin feel really smooth and gives it a
brighter<00:01:09.330> more<00:01:09.659> even<00:01:09.869> appearance<00:01:10.909> also<00:01:11.909> has

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
brighter more even appearance also has

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.830 
brighter more even appearance also has
lots<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.430> cold-pressed<00:01:14.430> vegetable<00:01:15.150> oils<00:01:15.360> now

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
lots of cold-pressed vegetable oils now

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
lots of cold-pressed vegetable oils now
cold-pressed<00:01:16.380> vegetable<00:01:16.770> oils<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.460> little

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
cold-pressed vegetable oils are a little

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.910 
cold-pressed vegetable oils are a little
more<00:01:17.820> expensive<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.360> produce<00:01:18.509> than<00:01:18.830> ones<00:01:19.830> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
more expensive to produce than ones that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.910 
more expensive to produce than ones that
use<00:01:20.220> heat<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> imagine<00:01:21.890> like<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
use heat but if you imagine like a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.399 
use heat but if you imagine like a
crispy<00:01:23.700> fresh<00:01:23.939> raw<00:01:24.180> carrot<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.900> crunches

crispy fresh raw carrot just crunches

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.020 
crispy fresh raw carrot just crunches
versus<00:01:25.979> one<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.340> been<00:01:26.490> sitting<00:01:26.820> under<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
versus one that's been sitting under a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
versus one that's been sitting under a
heat<00:01:27.299> lamp<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> few<00:01:27.990> hours<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.530> can

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
heat lamp for a few hours you can

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.859 
heat lamp for a few hours you can
imagine<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> nutritional<00:01:30.150> buzz<00:01:30.450> that
