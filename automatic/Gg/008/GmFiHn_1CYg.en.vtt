00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.940
 magic must be useful but also 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.680
 socks I call it lips you rip 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.830
 need a mesh number yellow 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:18.240
 through eight +2 a backhand stitch one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:25.470
 mesh left two stitches right three 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.560
 mesh left two stitches right and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.440
 again from the beginning 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:41.610
 one stitch left two stitches right 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:44.930
 three stitches left and two stitches 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.930
 right and again 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:03.650
 when I struck 26 stitches and 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.900
 A border stitch in the end so if you're after 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.500
 the country after the stop with 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:18.979
 this dismantling started you get 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:22.490
 then in 1344 meshes like her 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.770
 So right stitches will appear 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.360
 knitted on the right left-left stitches 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.149
 left, however, we do here at the end 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.880
 of the report or almost at the end of the 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.860
 reports a deep stitched mesh 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.720
 This creates a kind of patent rib 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.740
 So stab a floor deeper and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:54.679
 again from the front two stitches left three 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.530
 mesh on the right two stitches left and on the 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:01.340
 the end of the rapport on the front the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:06.739
 right stitch deeper a sting as well 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.920
 a patent mesh that you do in 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:12.160
 all rhine in one pattern 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160
 line 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:29.019
 this is how the front looks like in total 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:32.650
 Four purely after the stroke will be on the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:38.140
 Back a pattern knits there 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:43.239
 a mermaid quite simply a rand 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:47.049
 mesh one stitch left two stitches 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.019
 right and now these three left stitches 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.920
 right together stretch serve you 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.829
 the mesh a bit on better that 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.430
 not that elastic at all 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.370
 a bit stretched and now all three 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.310
 knit right together but still on 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.349
 The needle let so thread again 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.079
 forward again together 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.829
 knit thread back and back 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:19.049
 knit right again together and 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:24.040
 Again , two stitches had to be right 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:26.109
 one stitch left two stitches right 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.709
 the next three left stitches again 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:32.109
 right together knit up first 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.319
 Otherwise, you can only get them 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.900
 Knit hard right along the right 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.139
 stretch it together back thread 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.790
 thread knitting together the front left 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:47.620
 again back and again 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:52.480
 knit right together and two again 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.480
 mesh right one stitch left two 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.609
 mesh right and once again the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.639
 next three left stitches right 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:04.709
 knit together and left together 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.709
 knit and knit right together 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.900
 and two more stitches right and the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.630
 So rand mesh that was really 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.350
 all the magic in the pattern that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.190
 it was already 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.260
 and then you are strictly the now 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.880
 next row you strictly like the stitches 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.250
 they appear the three together 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.830
 knitted are knitted off to the right 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:41.690
 two stitches left after that and we do not 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.240
 Forget these lips mesh a deep 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.320
 prick 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.810
 So after that so after the mosterei 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.030
 there are always five in between, but you 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.700
 Of course you can also choose 79 or more 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.960
 stretch in between and that's how it looks 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.960
 great things have to help
