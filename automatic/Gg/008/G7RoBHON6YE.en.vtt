00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
much harder this game actually is now so

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.370 
much harder this game actually is now so
but<00:02:31.100> since<00:02:31.489> not<00:02:31.760> its<00:02:32.090> classic<00:02:32.569> Mario<00:02:32.810> platform

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
but since not its classic Mario platform

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.750 
but since not its classic Mario platform
it<00:02:33.620> feels<00:02:33.920> good<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.970> get<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.590> isn't<00:02:37.040> really

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
it feels good to get but it isn't really

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.819 
it feels good to get but it isn't really
it<00:02:38.390> hasn't<00:02:38.959> been<00:02:39.200> changed<00:02:39.410> from<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.799> original

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
it hasn't been changed from the original

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.069 
it hasn't been changed from the original
so<00:02:40.549> we<00:02:40.640> can't<00:02:40.850> give<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.360> high<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.780> score

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079
