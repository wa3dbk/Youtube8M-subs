 whose family 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.799
 in the blog computers are working on this 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:16.970
 points and 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.970
 qualifying round dedicated 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.769
 they are not 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.509
 about acceleration 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.819
 the circle of stepans met him 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.199
 that's 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.689
 hardly 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.960
 maiden appetite fitch 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.240
 leading expert 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.560
 Klyuev and continue to default 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.460
 added to the frame hit the properties 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.380
 startup icons windows media player 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.660
 and what are projects 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 according to the chorus 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.280
 Russian translation sounds like 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.690
 prefetch 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.290
 on Friday 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.280
 functions 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.470
 is the acceleration of loading programs 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.470
 computer players a little peak overall 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.330
 she creates files and in the folder in her forearm 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.010
 containing information in ways 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.360
 to these programs on your hard drive 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.420
 and on sites 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.350
 in the top of Yandex on demand wine is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.000
 drink can be found necessary 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.870
 information about this feature 24 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.050
 in particular on sites on the second and on the net 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.060
 author support the myth of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.000
 something I managed less loading 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.240
 the program can be added to the address 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.790
 lines of their labels klitschko bake 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.980
 eventually 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.130
 one 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 and that to speed up the boot system 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.570
 you need to periodically delete all files 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.230
 pitta format row 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.300
 not the fact of this meeting 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.680
 and leading expert attempt meeting 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.980
 usually located at the address during this time 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.840
 managed to save 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.880
 they are in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.499
 forearm files extension a. f kiev 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.670
 these are file markers for download so 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.830
 called cache 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.250
 their names are regenerated 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.250
 arrived rubles for files after downloading 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.369
 every time you run this file 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.280
 and what happens they decided romania 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.090
 checks if appropriate 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.479
 eep files in the penny folder 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.479
 and where sometime surrounding these files 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.569
 i hardly appropriate 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.419
 forerunner files system exists 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:24.819
 keeping track of which 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.709
 pavel it acts when you run it 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:27.319
 the first 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.659
 subroutine 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.439
 creates this square file does not save 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.339
 intrigue of ways casinform 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.429
 oh what conclusions can be drawn from 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:37.439
 of this 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.410
 First of all 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.220
 it is a very good idea to clear the fact and 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.559
 forearm 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.669
 as some computers suggest 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:46.849
 sites 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.939
 system just create a vsk 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.069
 in the third shawls 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.059
 anyway 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.829
 unless of course you guess how 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.739
 fitch subscribers 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.749
 in the second world automatically 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.200
 deletes files itch this batch 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.609
 if a 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.339
 it gets bigger will be eight pieces 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.019
 so almost 500 pack not only in 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.089
 rallies of many years around the program 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.859
 temporarily 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.619
 least performance 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:17.859
 your computer 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.779
 next moment ooo some 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.459
 Stalin's specialists add personal 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.179
 meeting 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.169
 and when it starts programs 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.699
 hero km 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.109
 many have noticed that automatically 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.699
 created firm as a domino media player 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.299
 will feel this inclusion of it at all 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.219
 not based depending 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.629
 from program functions performed 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.669
 eg 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.100
 hero functions by double m 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.100
 at the elections 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.569
 click to view video 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.649
 one parameter is assigned 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:52.119
 Kapshagai 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.459
 scores around autorun for 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.969
 play her copy music 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.169
 which appears when you insert 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.709
 audio components 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.299
 and other parameters 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.319
 and some specialists 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.169
 the assumption that it is not worth the candle 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.529
 it involves a preliminary process 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.179
 sampling 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.269
 they immediately began to add each 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.879
 executable files recommend doing 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.090
 this to others 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.250
 on red 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.680
 so sites or word 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.550
 they thus formed long ago 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.729
 not 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.199
 and other specialists 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.710
 wrote on their sites that it is complete 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.779
 bullshit 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.069
 her rumors plan that that circle 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.069
 specific for one year only media player 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.230
 seeing structurally files forerunner stupid 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.230
 in Kiev training mind 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.180
 In general, bikini other than you 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.819
 have guessed 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.889
 operating system look at the parameter 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.889
 forerunner when creates process 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.169
 she does it with just one instruction 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.699
 Anna adds a sequence number 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.599
 cottage 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.300
 what for 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.630
 vinus medic doesn't have many different functions 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.330
 eggs per year which 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.810
 full list of enterprises not 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.449
 catch up and overtake 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.809
 very different from libraries 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.789
 participating replay 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.089
 nine days 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.049
 however, the first Kiev companies 

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:28.430
 audition defended then 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.550
 the smell of the shelf 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.110
 and any of the bag inconvenience and warm 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.120
 No, I am pleased to note that it was 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.710
 only 1 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.059
 by appointment sample 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:44.799
 would only work correctly for one of 

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.430
 two functions 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.470
 The causes of invalid data are files. 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.379
 river 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.870
 there would be no potanin chic 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.139
 Pavel Skate 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.289
 just for friends to keep in memory and not 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.360
 was to use 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.389
 nevertheless it 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.099
 it would be medical aid products 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.150
 parameter almost immediately unpeeled for 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.520
 every function 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.089
 him a duty media player 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.219
 allows for each function to create its own 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:14.979
 separately low file 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.930
 and somehow preliminary 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:17.900
 sample 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.089
 ooo done correctly 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.569
 what settings 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.300
 Forerunners are not only typical for windows media 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.129
 player 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.979
 the same is done for their god other 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.639
 applications 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.610
 parameters buy taken in 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.110
 attention when created first 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.770
 flow in progress 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.440
 but no is removed from the functions of books about us 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.990
 j 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.970
 from the command line so any 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.030
 the application that smokes 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.979
 immortal parameters 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.019
 project team will not work with him 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.789
 and that's why so many people noticed that 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.740
 many programs 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.130
 issued errors or simply refuse 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.409
 start up Safavid articles 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.389
 promote media player of course 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.159
 you know, we can eat 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.069
 will indicate the parameters and just 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.559
 common room fund existence 

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:12.249
 garlic what does 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:13.909
 and 4 9 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:16.360
 there is no year for me 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.680
 the operating system loads the program from 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.770
 him the same way 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.719
 how are you no and not him 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:27.199
 just save the data 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.020
 by preliminary sampling 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.159
 other 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.159
 them 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.159
 in the album Alexander Kibovsky 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.800
 there new meetings 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.889
 computer malfunction
