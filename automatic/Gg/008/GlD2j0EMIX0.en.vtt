00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.810 

well<00:05:25.449> what<00:05:26.449> does<00:05:26.570> it<00:05:26.600> feel<00:05:26.900> like<00:05:27.430> I'm<00:05:28.430> having

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
well what does it feel like I'm having

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.870 
well what does it feel like I'm having
the<00:05:29.000> wrong<00:05:29.240> controls<00:05:30.580> probably<00:05:31.580> because<00:05:31.850> I

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
the wrong controls probably because I

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:44.950 
the wrong controls probably because I
have<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:38.949> just<00:05:39.949> go<00:05:40.190> back<00:05:40.780> options<00:05:43.750> you<00:05:44.750> can

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
have that just go back options you can

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:54.720

stuff

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.140 

maybe<00:05:55.420> they<00:05:55.720> have<00:05:56.020> so<00:05:56.440> you<00:05:56.500> can't<00:05:57.130> have<00:05:57.850> that

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
maybe they have so you can't have that

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.550 
maybe they have so you can't have that
on<00:05:59.370> the<00:06:00.370> iPhone<00:06:00.520> that's<00:06:01.090> weird<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:01.660> can't
