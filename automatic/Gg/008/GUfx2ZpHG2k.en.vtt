00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.480 

starting<00:00:12.200> with<00:00:12.290> melon<00:00:12.650> green<00:00:12.830> make<00:00:13.070> a<00:00:13.100> base<00:00:13.309> of

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
starting with melon green make a base of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.650 
starting with melon green make a base of
16<00:00:15.430> so<00:00:16.430> take<00:00:16.700> three<00:00:16.910> pieces<00:00:19.300> and<00:00:20.300> connect<00:00:20.540> them

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
16 so take three pieces and connect them

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:30.120 
16 so take three pieces and connect them
together<00:00:20.869> like<00:00:21.140> this<00:00:21.200> so<00:00:23.500> make<00:00:24.500> 16<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.130> these

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.499 

once<00:00:31.130> you<00:00:31.250> have<00:00:31.369> 16<00:00:31.730> units<00:00:32.029> connect<00:00:32.360> them

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
once you have 16 units connect them

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:50.349 
once you have 16 units connect them
together<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.960> make<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.140> circle<00:00:49.239> then<00:00:50.239> you're

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
together to make a circle then you're

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.840 
together to make a circle then you're
going<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.539> remove<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:51.109> row<00:00:51.289> of<00:00:51.500> five<00:00:51.679> pieces<00:00:54.850> and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
going to remove a row of five pieces and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.779 
going to remove a row of five pieces and
then<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.420> row<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:56.690> four<00:00:57.170> pieces<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.829> you're

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
then a row of four pieces and you're

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.329 
then a row of four pieces and you're
going<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:58.940> replace<00:00:59.179> with<00:00:59.449> lime-green<00:01:00.190> so<00:01:01.190> as

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
going to replace with lime-green so as

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.860 
going to replace with lime-green so as
you<00:01:01.489> remove<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.940> wrong<00:01:02.120> four<00:01:02.420> pieces<00:01:02.659> you

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
you remove the wrong four pieces you

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.390 
you remove the wrong four pieces you
have<00:01:03.109> to<00:01:03.230> put<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.469> lime<00:01:03.620> green<00:01:03.859> pieces<00:01:04.100> on

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
have to put the lime green pieces on

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.420 
have to put the lime green pieces on
straight<00:01:04.670> away<00:01:05.710> otherwise<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.950> base<00:01:07.220> will

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
straight away otherwise the base will

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.149 
straight away otherwise the base will
just<00:01:07.640> come<00:01:07.820> about<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:12.320> these<00:01:12.470> are<00:01:12.710> our<00:01:12.860> four

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
just come about so these are our four

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.969 
just come about so these are our four
pieces<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:15.110> this<00:01:15.259> is<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:15.530> row<00:01:15.649> of<00:01:15.680> five

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
pieces and this is the row of five

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.780 
pieces and this is the row of five
pieces<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:21.590> keep<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:21.950> side<00:01:22.159> pieces<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:22.700> the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
pieces so keep the side pieces in the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.090 
pieces so keep the side pieces in the
middle<00:01:22.880> piece<00:01:23.500> remove<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.649> runs<00:01:24.829> in<00:01:24.950> between

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
middle piece remove the runs in between

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.469 
middle piece remove the runs in between
and<00:01:25.820> replace<00:01:26.119> with<00:01:26.270> Brett<00:01:28.119> then<00:01:29.119> with<00:01:29.270> lime

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
and replace with Brett then with lime

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.920 
and replace with Brett then with lime
green<00:01:29.780> at<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.020> row<00:01:30.229> all<00:01:30.380> four<00:01:30.590> pieces<00:01:30.770> on<00:01:31.070> top

now on top of that at a row of three
pieces

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.730 

now<00:01:41.630> following<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.020> rest<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.469> bodies
