00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
to stay closed or one thing is not good

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:45.280 
to stay closed or one thing is not good
for<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.060> plate<00:02:41.420> here<00:02:42.079> and<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.959> little<00:02:45.079> bit

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
for the plate here and it's a little bit

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.309 
for the plate here and it's a little bit
round<00:02:45.739> here<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.959> can<00:02:48.109> see<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
round here but you can see the

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.470 
round here but you can see the
difference<00:02:48.769> with<00:02:49.599> with<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.750> cheat<00:02:51.139> Orval

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
difference with with the cheat Orval

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.379 
difference with with the cheat Orval
this<00:02:53.480> round<00:02:53.900> here<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.739> edges<00:02:55.250> are<00:02:55.459> around<00:02:55.730> so

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
this round here the edges are around so

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.629 
this round here the edges are around so
with<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.900> one<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:57.590> create<00:02:57.889> like<00:02:58.190> curls

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639
