little reset switch which I've only

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.170 
little reset switch which I've only
needed<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.899> once<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.940> stuff<00:00:51.149> working

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.170 
needed to use once to get stuff working
and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> lock<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.500> unlock

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.700 
and then you have this lock and unlock
slider<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> back<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.199> controls

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
slider on the back here that controls

how it slides open you want to keep it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.209 
how it slides open you want to keep it

seems<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.320> solve<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.770> problem<00:03:03.110> just<00:03:04.110> kind<00:03:04.290> of

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
seems to solve that problem just kind of

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.890 
seems to solve that problem just kind of
mash<00:03:04.560> buttons<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.280> attack<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.570> feels

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
mash buttons to attack and it feels

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.130 
mash buttons to attack and it feels
oddly<00:03:07.400> close<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.790> Xbox<00:03:09.240> version<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
oddly close to the Xbox version of the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.190 
oddly close to the Xbox version of the
game<00:03:10.610> with<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> B<00:03:12.120> button<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.510> attack<00:03:12.810> and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
game with the B button to attack and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.920 
game with the B button to attack and
then<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.950> use<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.160> other<00:03:14.280> buttons<00:03:14.610> to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
then you can use the other buttons to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.450 
then you can use the other buttons to
switch<00:03:15.930> weapons<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.040> trigger<00:03:17.250> button

switch weapons and the trigger button

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.030 
switch weapons and the trigger button
actually<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:18.000> what<00:03:18.360> causes<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.950> bring<00:03:19.950> up

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
actually is what causes you to bring up

need to and that problem is totally

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.970 
need to and that problem is totally
resolved<00:03:33.390> when<00:03:33.540> you've<00:03:33.690> got<00:03:33.980> physical

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.570 
controls well you can kind of notice
that<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:37.170> buttons<00:03:37.500> are<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.890> little<00:03:38.070> clicky<00:03:38.430> as

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
that the buttons are a little clicky as

you can hear in this video which makes

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.690 
you can hear in this video which makes
button-mashing<00:03:42.870> games<00:03:43.500> kind<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.100> annoying<00:03:44.550> to

button-mashing games kind of annoying to

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.820 
button-mashing games kind of annoying to
play<00:03:44.970> because<00:03:45.210> there<00:03:46.110> just<00:03:46.320> makes<00:03:46.560> more<00:03:46.770> noise

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
play because there just makes more noise

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.830 
play because there just makes more noise
than<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.280> would<00:03:47.490> be<00:03:47.580> used<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.910> over<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
than you would be used to over the

than you would be used to over the
controller<00:03:49.910> as<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.240> see<00:03:51.420> there<00:03:52.880> but

controller as you can see there but
overall<00:03:54.150> bastions<00:03:54.720> greatly<00:03:55.320> improved<00:03:55.680> the

overall bastions greatly improved the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
physical controls and that really

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.670 
physical controls and that really
shouldn't<00:03:57.870> come<00:03:58.050> as<00:03:58.170> much<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.500> surprise

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
shouldn't come as much of a surprise

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.530 
shouldn't come as much of a surprise
because<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.430> was<00:03:59.580> never<00:03:59.790> built<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.180> virtual

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
because it was never built with virtual

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.619 
because it was never built with virtual
controls<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.050> mind<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.440> first<00:04:01.620> place

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
limbo by play dead is a puzzle

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.399 
limbo by play dead is a puzzle
platformer<00:04:08.430> which<00:04:08.609> similarly<00:04:09.329> is<00:04:09.659> improved

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
platformer which similarly is improved

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.080 
platformer which similarly is improved
by<00:04:10.560> adding<00:04:10.859> physical<00:04:11.159> controls<00:04:11.700> just<00:04:11.760> because

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
by adding physical controls just because

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.610 
by adding physical controls just because
of<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.299> nature<00:04:12.569> of<00:04:12.599> platformers<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.409> seems

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
of the nature of platformers it seems

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.370 
of the nature of platformers it seems
like<00:04:14.150> although<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.239> seems<00:04:15.450> like<00:04:15.510> limbo<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.350> a

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
like although it seems like limbo is a

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.599 
like although it seems like limbo is a
little<00:04:16.560> bit<00:04:16.650> more<00:04:16.799> fun<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.130> play<00:04:17.280> on<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.430> big

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
little bit more fun to play on a big

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.779 
little bit more fun to play on a big
screen<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:19.470> unfortunate<00:04:19.829> side<00:04:20.459> effect

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
screen and the unfortunate side effect

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.189 
screen and the unfortunate side effect
of<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.000> way<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.269> controller<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.720> designed

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
of the way this controller is designed

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.930 
of the way this controller is designed
and<00:04:22.470> using<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.949> Lightning<00:04:23.280> port<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.820> you

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
and using the Lightning port is that you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.249 
and using the Lightning port is that you
can't<00:04:24.240> use<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.810> lightning<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.410> HDMI<00:04:25.530> adapter

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
can't use the lightning to HDMI adapter

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.050 
can't use the lightning to HDMI adapter
you<00:04:28.259> can<00:04:28.289> play<00:04:28.650> over<00:04:28.770> airplay<00:04:29.220> via<00:04:29.460> mirroring

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
you can play over airplay via mirroring

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.469 
you can play over airplay via mirroring
but<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.720> problem<00:04:31.050> with<00:04:31.169> that<00:04:31.199> is<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:32.479> tiny

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
but the problem with that is the tiny

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.950 
but the problem with that is the tiny
tiny<00:04:33.870> lag<00:04:34.259> between<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.699> controller<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.270> your

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
tiny lag between the controller and your

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.659 
tiny lag between the controller and your
ipod<00:04:37.320> touch<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.800> then<00:04:37.949> all<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.370> getting

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
ipod touch and then all that getting

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
blasted up into airplay and then down

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.370 
blasted up into airplay and then down
through<00:04:41.759> your<00:04:42.090> Apple<00:04:42.389> TV<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.840> back<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.229> your

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.010 
through your Apple TV and back to your
TV<00:04:43.610> adds<00:04:44.610> enough<00:04:44.910> latency<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.360> becomes

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
TV adds enough latency that becomes

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.260 
TV adds enough latency that becomes
pretty<00:04:46.710> noticeable<00:04:47.310> especially<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:48.060> games

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
pretty noticeable especially in games

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.189 
pretty noticeable especially in games
where<00:04:48.680> any<00:04:49.680> kind<00:04:49.919> of<00:04:50.009> precision<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.669> valued<00:04:51.199> so

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
where any kind of precision is valued so

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.360 
where any kind of precision is valued so
that's<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.440> little<00:04:52.560> disappointing<00:04:53.160> but

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
that's a little disappointing but

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.249 
that's a little disappointing but
overall<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.449> know<00:04:54.570> just<00:04:54.750> like<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.050> previous

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
overall you know just like the previous

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.529 
overall you know just like the previous
two<00:04:55.470> games<00:04:55.680> limbo<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.430> an<00:04:56.970> experience<00:04:57.419> that's

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
two games limbo is an experience that's

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.499 
two games limbo is an experience that's
greatly<00:04:57.960> improved<00:04:58.289> physical<00:04:58.710> controls<00:04:59.509> it

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
greatly improved physical controls it

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.390 
greatly improved physical controls it
seems<00:05:00.990> far<00:05:01.229> less<00:05:01.289> frustrating<00:05:01.949> to<00:05:02.009> play<00:05:02.130> when

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
seems far less frustrating to play when

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.920 
seems far less frustrating to play when
you're<00:05:02.550> not<00:05:02.789> missing<00:05:03.240> a<00:05:03.300> jump<00:05:03.479> or<00:05:03.690> something

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
you're not missing a jump or something

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.360 
you're not missing a jump or something
like<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.080> because<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.740> know<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:04.889> wandered

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
like that because you know you wandered

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.330 
like that because you know you wandered
off<00:05:05.870> from<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.960> virtual<00:05:07.289> control<00:05:07.680> segments<00:05:08.190> of

off from the virtual control segments of

you're<00:05:10.199> playing<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.500> on<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.880> basically

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
you're playing it on so basically

because it was designed to be a

because it was designed to be a
touchscreen<00:05:32.400> game<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:34.440> could<00:05:34.590> argue<00:05:34.740> that

touchscreen game you could argue that

touchscreen game you could argue that
dead<00:05:35.130> trigger<00:05:35.310> 2<00:05:35.430> was<00:05:35.789> as<00:05:35.940> well<00:05:36.120> but

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
dead trigger 2 was as well but

themselves to different controls that

my<00:05:40.830> opinion<00:05:40.949> and<00:05:41.280> then<00:05:41.880> Bastion<00:05:42.509> and<00:05:42.690> limbo

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
my opinion and then Bastion and limbo

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.529 
my opinion and then Bastion and limbo
were<00:05:43.680> both<00:05:44.009> console<00:05:44.639> ports<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.240> came<00:05:45.419> to

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
were both console ports that came to

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.060 
were both console ports that came to
Iowa<00:05:45.870> so<00:05:46.050> naturally<00:05:46.440> they<00:05:46.560> don't<00:05:46.740> work<00:05:46.889> as

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
Iowa so naturally they don't work as

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.850 
Iowa so naturally they don't work as
well<00:05:47.099> with<00:05:48.090> virtual<00:05:48.479> controls<00:05:48.900> oceanhorn

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
well with virtual controls oceanhorn

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.290 
well with virtual controls oceanhorn
however<00:05:50.310> was<00:05:50.460> designed<00:05:50.759> from<00:05:50.849> the<00:05:50.969> ground<00:05:51.000> up

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
however was designed from the ground up

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.390 
however was designed from the ground up
with<00:05:51.539> virtual<00:05:51.900> controls<00:05:52.259> in<00:05:52.409> mind<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:52.919> it

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
with virtual controls in mind and it

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.159 
with virtual controls in mind and it
almost<00:05:53.699> seems<00:05:54.270> like<00:05:54.419> it<00:05:54.659> makes<00:05:54.870> no<00:05:55.050> difference

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
almost seems like it makes no difference

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.480 
almost seems like it makes no difference
whether<00:05:55.590> or<00:05:55.740> not<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:55.979> play<00:05:56.219> it<00:05:56.340> with<00:05:56.460> a

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
whether or not you play it with a

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.879 
whether or not you play it with a
controller<00:05:57.139> the<00:05:58.139> virtual<00:05:58.440> controls<00:05:58.740> and

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
controller the virtual controls and

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.620 
controller the virtual controls and
ocean<00:05:59.099> are<00:05:59.310> great<00:05:59.490> the<00:06:00.240> buttons<00:06:00.509> are

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
ocean are great the buttons are

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.820 
ocean are great the buttons are
positioned<00:06:00.960> in<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.080> way<00:06:01.199> that<00:06:01.409> it's<00:06:01.590> never

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
positioned in a way that it's never

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.120 
positioned in a way that it's never
really<00:06:02.190> a<00:06:02.219> problem<00:06:02.990> and<00:06:03.990> what's<00:06:04.650> strange<00:06:05.009> is

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
really a problem and what's strange is

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.680 
really a problem and what's strange is
when<00:06:05.310> you<00:06:05.430> play<00:06:05.699> it<00:06:05.849> with<00:06:06.030> a<00:06:06.060> physical

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
when you play it with a physical

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.830 
when you play it with a physical
controller<00:06:07.050> it<00:06:07.530> almost<00:06:08.370> seems<00:06:08.759> like<00:06:08.909> the<00:06:09.630> game

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
controller it almost seems like the game

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.279 
controller it almost seems like the game
is<00:06:10.050> too<00:06:10.259> simple<00:06:10.710> for<00:06:11.009> your<00:06:11.750> for<00:06:12.750> your<00:06:12.870> controls

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
is too simple for your for your controls

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.409 
is too simple for your for your controls
and<00:06:13.680> that<00:06:14.520> you<00:06:14.639> really<00:06:14.789> only<00:06:14.880> are<00:06:15.180> ever

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
and that you really only are ever

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:16.890 
and that you really only are ever
hitting<00:06:15.690> one<00:06:15.840> button

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
hitting one button

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.450 
hitting one button
the<00:06:17.200> analog<00:06:17.530> sticks<00:06:17.830> a<00:06:17.919> little<00:06:18.100> weird<00:06:18.280> because

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
the analog sticks a little weird because

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.330 
the analog sticks a little weird because
I<00:06:19.060> feel<00:06:19.570> like<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:19.870> touchscreen<00:06:20.860> controls

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
I feel like the touchscreen controls

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.480 
I feel like the touchscreen controls
just<00:06:21.460> are<00:06:21.790> more<00:06:22.600> precise<00:06:23.020> which<00:06:24.010> is<00:06:24.190> kind<00:06:24.430> of

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
just are more precise which is kind of

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.129 
just are more precise which is kind of
an<00:06:24.580> odd<00:06:24.760> thing<00:06:24.790> to<00:06:25.180> experience<00:06:25.840> because

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
an odd thing to experience because

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.420 
an odd thing to experience because
you're<00:06:26.260> so<00:06:26.410> used<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.770> a<00:06:26.830> controller<00:06:27.220> being

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
you're so used to a controller being

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.120 
you're so used to a controller being
better<00:06:28.290> but<00:06:29.290> as<00:06:29.380> you<00:06:29.500> can<00:06:29.590> kind<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:29.800> see<00:06:29.950> here

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
better but as you can kind of see here

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.970 
better but as you can kind of see here
everyone<00:06:31.000> smile<00:06:31.240> have<00:06:31.450> a<00:06:31.480> little<00:06:31.720> trouble

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
everyone smile have a little trouble

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.290 
everyone smile have a little trouble
moving<00:06:32.980> and<00:06:33.190> that<00:06:33.790> could<00:06:33.970> just<00:06:34.000> be<00:06:34.180> a

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
moving and that could just be a

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.700 
moving and that could just be a
calibration<00:06:34.870> issue<00:06:35.020> with<00:06:35.230> the<00:06:35.320> developers

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
calibration issue with the developers

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.620 
calibration issue with the developers
not<00:06:35.889> having<00:06:36.160> a<00:06:36.250> physical<00:06:36.610> controller<00:06:36.940> to<00:06:37.240> test

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
not having a physical controller to test

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.600 
not having a physical controller to test
on<00:06:37.810> or<00:06:38.020> anything<00:06:38.200> like<00:06:38.410> that<00:06:38.440> but<00:06:39.400> I'm

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
on or anything like that but I'm

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.310 
on or anything like that but I'm
definitely<00:06:39.820> preferring<00:06:40.389> oceanhorn<00:06:40.720> just<00:06:41.139> on

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
definitely preferring oceanhorn just on

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.080 
definitely preferring oceanhorn just on
the<00:06:41.440> touchscreen<00:06:41.620> itself<00:06:42.190> which<00:06:42.550> wasn't

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
the touchscreen itself which wasn't

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.340 
the touchscreen itself which wasn't
really<00:06:43.360> something<00:06:43.480> I<00:06:43.690> was<00:06:43.810> expecting<00:06:43.960> I

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
really something I was expecting I

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.480 
really something I was expecting I
thought<00:06:44.590> everything<00:06:44.889> was<00:06:45.040> going<00:06:45.190> to<00:06:45.400> be

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
thought everything was going to be

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.210 
thought everything was going to be
improved<00:06:45.820> by<00:06:45.970> the<00:06:46.030> controller<00:06:46.389> so<00:06:47.220> definitely

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
improved by the controller so definitely

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.180 
improved by the controller so definitely
take<00:06:48.340> a<00:06:48.370> look<00:06:48.550> when<00:06:48.669> these<00:06:48.760> are<00:06:48.910> released
