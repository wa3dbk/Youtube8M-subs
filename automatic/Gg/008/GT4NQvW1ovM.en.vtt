breadcrumb consistency now to combine
that<00:01:46.530> together<00:01:46.709> into<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.160> dough<00:01:47.369> we're<00:01:47.550> just

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that together into a dough we're just

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.339 
that together into a dough we're just
going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.940> take<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.179> couple<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.569> tablespoons<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
going to take a couple of tablespoons of

going to take a couple of tablespoons of
fresh<00:01:49.560> milk<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.129> that's<00:01:50.970> usually<00:01:51.360> enough<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
fresh milk and that's usually enough to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
fresh milk and that's usually enough to
start<00:01:52.379> to<00:01:52.560> pull<00:01:52.830> this<00:01:53.009> together<00:01:53.399> into<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.789> dough

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
start to pull this together into a dough

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.320 
start to pull this together into a dough
and<00:01:55.099> that<00:01:56.099> should<00:01:56.310> combine<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.940> like<00:01:57.179> that

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
and that should combine just like that

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.029 
and that should combine just like that
to<00:01:57.479> make<00:01:57.599> this<00:01:57.660> beautiful<00:01:58.020> soft<00:01:58.440> dough<00:01:58.619> we're

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
to make this beautiful soft dough we're

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.770

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
or so in the fridge to make it a little

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.910 
or so in the fridge to make it a little
easier<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.580> handle

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
