00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:25.760
 with a good mouse because we saw how it 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.170
 connected and how the keyboard was used 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.160
 then we saw how the mouse was used 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:39.440

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.180

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.720

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.560
 now let's witness 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:22.120
 how it is done here I have prepared 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.770
 a Google Drive spreadsheet and in 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.000
 This sheet 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.040
 and even with the mouse we can appreciate 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.070
 as 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.240
 we can edit it here we are 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.240

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:45.080
 a cell and we're going to put the name of 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.650
 Carla 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.650
 Carla 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.829
 I'm doing it with just one hand 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.490
 because I'm also stopping the other 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.549
 cell phone that allows me to record well 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.469
 I've already recorded Carla's name and now 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:11.290
 what I include is already included in the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:14.350
 cell then 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.940
 I do walk 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.730

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.940

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.290
