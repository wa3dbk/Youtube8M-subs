00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.039 
everything is awesome in the lego movie
we<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:05.040> movie<00:00:05.310> just<00:00:05.460> came<00:00:05.640> out<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.150> huge<00:00:06.750> hit

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
and now we're seeing how it was made

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.850 
and now we're seeing how it was made
exactly<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.870> lot<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.200> people<00:00:10.469> actually<00:00:10.559> thought

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
exactly a lot of people actually thought

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.039 
exactly a lot of people actually thought
it<00:00:10.920> was<00:00:11.070> stop-motion<00:00:11.759> animation<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.900> was

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
it was stop-motion animation but it was

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.049 
it was stop-motion animation but it was
not<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:13.469> let's<00:00:13.650> take<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.830> look<00:00:14.130> at<00:00:14.340> some<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
not but let's take a look at some of the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.900 
not but let's take a look at some of the
animation<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.560> style<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.190> him<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.760> on

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
animation and the style with him up on

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:30.570 
animation and the style with him up on
the<00:00:18.000> monorail<00:00:18.270> release<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.500> cover<00:00:19.740> choppers

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.410 

it's<00:00:31.509> gorgeous<00:00:31.869> so<00:00:32.290> you<00:00:32.469> can<00:00:32.829> see<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.460> the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
it's gorgeous so you can see the the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.090 
it's gorgeous so you can see the the
difficulty<00:00:34.989> there<00:00:35.140> would<00:00:35.290> be<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.680> animate

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
difficulty there would be to animate

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.280 
difficulty there would be to animate
something<00:00:36.579> that<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.809> Lego<00:00:37.989> world

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
something that is in the Lego world

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.560 
something that is in the Lego world
meaning<00:00:38.800> it's<00:00:39.250> all<00:00:39.550> made<00:00:39.790> out<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:39.970> Legos<00:00:40.329> the

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
meaning it's all made out of Legos the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.270 
meaning it's all made out of Legos the
fire<00:00:40.809> was<00:00:41.050> Legos<00:00:41.440> they're<00:00:41.680> scenes<00:00:41.890> with<00:00:42.010> water

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
fire was Legos they're scenes with water

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.670 
fire was Legos they're scenes with water
that<00:00:42.519> are<00:00:42.640> Legos<00:00:43.090> it's<00:00:43.629> not<00:00:43.809> an<00:00:43.930> easy<00:00:44.110> task<00:00:44.379> to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
that are Legos it's not an easy task to

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.880 
that are Legos it's not an easy task to
take<00:00:44.829> on<00:00:44.980> but<00:00:45.550> they<00:00:46.390> did<00:00:46.629> it<00:00:46.809> because<00:00:47.470> I'm<00:00:47.769> an

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
take on but they did it because I'm an

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.110 
take on but they did it because I'm an
eight-year-old<00:00:48.250> child<00:00:48.430> I'm<00:00:48.670> pretty<00:00:48.909> sure<00:00:49.089> I

coolest things seeing that it looks like
Legos<00:00:59.470> yet<00:00:59.710> it's<00:00:59.829> obviously<00:01:00.250> animated<00:01:00.670> I<00:01:00.699> had

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
Legos yet it's obviously animated I had

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.580 
Legos yet it's obviously animated I had
the<00:01:00.879> fire<00:01:01.120> stuff<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.690> lasers<00:01:02.079> all<00:01:02.229> that<00:01:02.409> kind

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
the fire stuff the lasers all that kind

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.770 
the fire stuff the lasers all that kind
of<00:01:02.620> stuff<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.980> thought<00:01:03.370> was<00:01:03.579> was<00:01:04.330> particularly

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
of stuff I thought was was particularly

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.560 
of stuff I thought was was particularly
cool<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.789> movie<00:01:07.030> just<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.420> had<00:01:07.539> a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
cool and and the movie just it had a

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.419 
cool and and the movie just it had a
great<00:01:07.780> message<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:08.320> was<00:01:08.440> for<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.130> adult

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
great message and it was for the adult

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:10.310 
great message and it was for the adult
and<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.729> kid<00:01:09.970> in<00:01:10.090> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and the kid in you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320 
and the kid in you
so<00:01:11.320> an<00:01:11.500> animal<00:01:11.800> logic<00:01:12.429> is<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:13.060> studio

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
so an animal logic is the the studio

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.660 
so an animal logic is the the studio
behind<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:13.960> at<00:01:14.590> least<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.890> animations<00:01:15.429> and

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
behind this at least the animations and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.150 
behind this at least the animations and
they<00:01:16.030> wanted<00:01:16.300> it<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.570> look<00:01:16.720> like<00:01:17.160> realistic

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
they wanted it to look like realistic

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.370 
they wanted it to look like realistic
like<00:01:18.910> how<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.149> would<00:01:19.360> actually<00:01:19.570> move<00:01:19.929> Legos

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
like how you would actually move Legos

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.469 
like how you would actually move Legos
and<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:21.039> color<00:01:21.250> palettes<00:01:21.700> were<00:01:21.850> real<00:01:22.149> color

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
and the color palettes were real color

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.540 
and the color palettes were real color
palettes<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.170> Legos<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.100> there<00:01:24.220> were

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
palettes and Legos and there were

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.340 
palettes and Legos and there were
obvious<00:01:24.940> limitations<00:01:25.479> limitations<00:01:25.690> for

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
obvious limitations limitations for

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.510 
obvious limitations limitations for
instance<00:01:26.590> they<00:01:26.710> said<00:01:26.890> like<00:01:27.039> well<00:01:27.250> they<00:01:27.310> wanted

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
instance they said like well they wanted

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.490 
instance they said like well they wanted
to<00:01:27.580> carry<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.880> shrug<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.929> know<00:01:29.020> that's<00:01:29.229> not<00:01:29.350> how

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
to carry a shrug you know that's not how

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.529 
to carry a shrug you know that's not how
many<00:01:29.710> figs<00:01:30.009> worked<00:01:30.280> so<00:01:30.550> they<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.820> turned<00:01:31.450> out

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
many figs worked so they it turned out

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.559 
many figs worked so they it turned out
to<00:01:31.659> be<00:01:31.750> like<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.440> know<00:01:32.470> it's<00:01:32.800> its<00:01:33.420> thing<00:01:34.420> we're

to be like you know it's its thing we're
set<00:01:34.750> free<00:01:34.929> by<00:01:35.020> their<00:01:35.140> limitations<00:01:35.709> is<00:01:35.860> what

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
set free by their limitations is what

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.650 
set free by their limitations is what
I'm<00:01:36.099> trying<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.369> say<00:01:36.520> here<00:01:36.759> yeah<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.509> also

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
actually helped the comedy of the movie

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.949 
actually helped the comedy of the movie
because<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:39.970> things<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.479> they<00:01:40.569> couldn't

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
because the things that they couldn't

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.169 
because the things that they couldn't
actually<00:01:41.170> do<00:01:41.649> they<00:01:41.860> do<00:01:42.429> this<00:01:42.610> very<00:01:42.819> early<00:01:42.880> on

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
exercises sort of and he has to do it

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.839 
exercises sort of and he has to do it
within<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.200> constraints<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.770> how<00:01:48.220> Legos<00:01:48.640> can

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:48.849 
within the constraints of how Legos can

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.180 
within the constraints of how Legos can
actually<00:01:49.209> move<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:50.050> actually<00:01:50.560> helped<00:01:51.009> the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
actually move so it actually helped the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.309 
actually move so it actually helped the
story<00:01:51.489> along<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.179> have<00:01:52.330> some<00:01:52.569> awkward<00:01:52.929> funny

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
story along to have some awkward funny

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.529 
story along to have some awkward funny
stuff<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:53.770> that<00:01:53.920> mm-hmm<00:01:54.459> so<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.509> a

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
stuff like that mm-hmm so this is a

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.999 
stuff like that mm-hmm so this is a
lengthy<00:01:56.140> article<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.530> they<00:01:56.590> talked<00:01:56.739> about<00:01:56.770> a

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
lengthy article and they talked about a

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.440 
lengthy article and they talked about a
lot<00:01:57.160> of<00:01:57.220> different<00:01:57.340> strategies<00:01:57.700> they<00:01:58.209> used

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
lot of different strategies they used

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.930 
lot of different strategies they used
when<00:01:58.899> they<00:01:59.110> were<00:01:59.140> animating<00:01:59.860> it<00:01:59.950> number<00:02:00.789> one

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
when they were animating it number one

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.029 
when they were animating it number one
they<00:02:01.090> watched<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.750> lot<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.110> stop-motion<00:02:03.009> lego

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
they watched a lot of stop-motion lego

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.040 
they watched a lot of stop-motion lego
videos<00:02:03.520> because<00:02:03.789> there's<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.060> huge<00:02:04.420> number<00:02:05.020> of

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
videos because there's a huge number of

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.510 
videos because there's a huge number of
thought<00:02:05.410> motion<00:02:05.679> Lego<00:02:05.890> videos<00:02:06.190> on<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
thought motion Lego videos on the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.960

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
recreation that's a good one they also

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.640 
recreation that's a good one they also
went<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.330> Legoland<00:02:13.810> they<00:02:14.500> saw<00:02:14.890> vast<00:02:15.610> Lego

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
went to Legoland they saw vast Lego

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.559 
went to Legoland they saw vast Lego
skyscrapers<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.920> landscapes<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.760> how<00:02:19.300> they

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
skyscrapers and landscapes and how they

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.089 
skyscrapers and landscapes and how they
were<00:02:19.629> made<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.290> how<00:02:20.410> they<00:02:20.530> were<00:02:20.590> preserved

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
were made and how they were preserved

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.770 
were made and how they were preserved
and<00:02:21.400> actually<00:02:21.760> they<00:02:21.849> use<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.239> like<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> coating

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
and actually they use it like a coating

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.680 
and actually they use it like a coating
film<00:02:23.349> like<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.250> things<00:02:25.060> they<00:02:25.239> don't<00:02:25.390> want<00:02:25.599> to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
film like on things they don't want to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.449 
film like on things they don't want to
ever<00:02:25.780> come<00:02:25.989> apart<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.980> gave<00:02:27.220> an

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
ever come apart and that gave an

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.140 
ever come apart and that gave an
interesting<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:28.200> worn<00:02:29.400> texture<00:02:30.400> sun-faded

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
interesting like worn texture sun-faded

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.210 
interesting like worn texture sun-faded
add<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> little<00:02:31.750> opacity<00:02:32.379> peel<00:02:32.680> off<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.099> they

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
add a little opacity peel off so they

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.220 
add a little opacity peel off so they
incorporated<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.209> into<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.780> dirty<00:02:35.050> or

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
incorporated that into the dirty or

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.800 
incorporated that into the dirty or
dingy<00:02:35.470> or<00:02:35.650> parts<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.280> landscape<00:02:36.790> they<00:02:37.599> put

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
dingy or parts of the landscape they put

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.380 
dingy or parts of the landscape they put
Legos<00:02:38.140> under<00:02:38.410> microscopes<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.640> like<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
Legos under microscopes to see like the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.750 
Legos under microscopes to see like the
the<00:02:40.720> textures<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.560> pores<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.430> seams

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
the textures and the pores and the seams

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.620 
the textures and the pores and the seams
how<00:02:43.360> they

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
how they

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.050 
how they
dirty<00:02:43.930> how<00:02:44.140> they<00:02:44.260> got<00:02:44.380> warm<00:02:44.710> we<00:02:45.670> definitely

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
dirty how they got warm we definitely

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.730 
dirty how they got warm we definitely
get<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.330> effect<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.900> movie<00:02:47.170> actually<00:02:47.380> we

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
get that effect in the movie actually we

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.460 
get that effect in the movie actually we
do<00:02:47.920> have<00:02:47.950> another<00:02:48.430> video<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.930> animation

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
do have another video of the animation

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.220 
do have another video of the animation
process<00:02:50.680> or<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:52.090> LEGO<00:02:52.300> Minifigures<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.110> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
process or the LEGO Minifigures in the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.530 
process or the LEGO Minifigures in the
animation<00:02:53.680> process<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:55.060> there<00:02:55.210> we<00:02:55.300> have<00:02:55.420> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
animation process so there we have the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.320 
animation process so there we have the
range<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.930> motion<00:02:56.350> for<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.620> arms<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
range of motion for the arms the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
range of motion for the arms the

which are also wildly popular the the
video<00:03:06.640> games<00:03:06.880> they<00:03:07.420> take<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> lot<00:03:07.990> of<00:03:08.020> liberties

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
video games they take a lot of liberties

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.530 
video games they take a lot of liberties
with<00:03:08.950> their<00:03:09.310> animation<00:03:09.940> they<00:03:10.090> have<00:03:10.240> a<00:03:10.270> lot<00:03:10.510> of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
with their animation they have a lot of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.500 
with their animation they have a lot of
bendy<00:03:11.200> movements<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.040> stretchiness<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.300> and

bendy movements and stretchiness and and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.890 
bendy movements and stretchiness and and
kind<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.370> different<00:03:15.370> limitations<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.690> them

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
kind of different limitations on them

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.800 
kind of different limitations on them
this<00:03:17.500> stays<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> lot<00:03:18.280> truer<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:19.120> what<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.660> can

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
this stays a lot truer to what you can

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.150 
this stays a lot truer to what you can
do<00:03:19.990> with<00:03:20.140> Legos<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.590> what<00:03:20.740> you<00:03:20.830> can<00:03:20.980> make<00:03:21.100> with

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
do with Legos and what you can make with

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.460 
do with Legos and what you can make with
Legos<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.700> how<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:22.210> movie<00:03:22.780> would<00:03:22.900> look<00:03:23.110> if<00:03:23.320> it

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
Legos and how a movie would look if it

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.070 
Legos and how a movie would look if it
was<00:03:23.590> made<00:03:23.800> with<00:03:23.950> actual<00:03:24.520> legos<00:03:24.960> you<00:03:25.960> know<00:03:26.050> I

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
was made with actual legos you know I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
was made with actual legos you know I
was<00:03:26.230> thinking<00:03:26.320> when<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.590> was<00:03:26.740> watching<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
was thinking when I was watching the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.440 
was thinking when I was watching the
movie<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.460> how<00:03:27.700> many<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.970> these<00:03:28.030> kids<00:03:28.300> that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
movie that how many of these kids that

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.060 
movie that how many of these kids that
are<00:03:28.510> there<00:03:28.780> like<00:03:29.320> seven-year-old<00:03:29.890> kids

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
are there like seven-year-old kids

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.740 
are there like seven-year-old kids
they're<00:03:30.640> growing<00:03:31.030> up<00:03:31.180> playing<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.630> video

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
they're growing up playing the video

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.600

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
mean even the camera was was done in a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.610 
mean even the camera was was done in a
much<00:04:25.150> different<00:04:25.300> way<00:04:25.540> than<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.110> would<00:04:26.230> see<00:04:26.440> in

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
much different way than you would see in

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.400 
much different way than you would see in
the<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.040> Lego<00:04:27.310> games<00:04:27.610> or<00:04:28.060> even<00:04:28.410> stop-motion

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
the the Lego games or even stop-motion

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.840 
the the Lego games or even stop-motion
lego<00:04:29.440> right<00:04:30.070> they<00:04:30.220> wanted<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.490> make<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.640> more

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
lego right they wanted to make it more

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.940 
lego right they wanted to make it more
fluid<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.660> took<00:04:31.840> out<00:04:32.020> all<00:04:32.230> no<00:04:32.470> they<00:04:32.620> took<00:04:32.770> out

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
fluid it took out all no they took out

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.410 
fluid it took out all no they took out
motion<00:04:33.250> blur<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:33.790> that<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.000> would<00:04:34.090> be<00:04:34.180> less

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
motion blur so that it would be less

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.390 
motion blur so that it would be less
fluid<00:04:34.870> it<00:04:35.200> would<00:04:35.320> be<00:04:35.410> more<00:04:35.620> jerky<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.250> that

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
fluid it would be more jerky and that

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.640 
fluid it would be more jerky and that
you<00:04:36.520> could<00:04:36.700> see<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.180> moments<00:04:37.660> between<00:04:37.810> one

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
you could see the moments between one

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.710 
you could see the moments between one
motion<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.550> other<00:04:39.730> blurred<00:04:40.030> some<00:04:40.450> of<00:04:40.600> the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
motion and the other blurred some of the

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.420 
motion and the other blurred some of the
Legos<00:04:41.050> for<00:04:41.140> instance<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.710> fire<00:04:41.920> effects

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
Legos for instance in the fire effects

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.290 
Legos for instance in the fire effects
they<00:04:42.580> made<00:04:43.060> blur<00:04:43.960> effects<00:04:44.440> with<00:04:44.830> Legos<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.700> if

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
they made blur effects with Legos so if

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.390 
they made blur effects with Legos so if
there<00:04:46.480> was<00:04:46.570> like<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.780> four-block<00:04:47.470> Lego<00:04:47.830> moving

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
there was like a four-block Lego moving

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.610 
there was like a four-block Lego moving
really<00:04:48.550> quickly<00:04:48.910> they<00:04:49.540> would<00:04:49.720> add<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:49.990> fifth<00:04:50.410> to

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
really quickly they would add a fifth to

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.110 
really quickly they would add a fifth to
the<00:04:50.650> end<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.100> look<00:04:51.340> like<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.550> blur<00:04:51.790> but<00:04:51.910> there's

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
the end to look like a blur but there's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.150 
the end to look like a blur but there's
not<00:04:52.240> actually<00:04:52.419> blur<00:04:53.020> in<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.260> animation<00:04:53.680> and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
not actually blur in the animation and

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.890 
not actually blur in the animation and
and<00:04:54.460> for<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.700> record<00:04:54.910> I'm<00:04:55.120> pretty<00:04:55.479> sure<00:04:55.720> that

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
and for the record I'm pretty sure that

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.180 
and for the record I'm pretty sure that
the<00:04:56.020> transformer<00:04:56.590> movies<00:04:56.890> were

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
the transformer movies were

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.130 
the transformer movies were
made<00:04:57.340> just<00:04:57.700> so<00:04:58.210> that<00:04:58.360> Michael<00:04:58.660> Bay<00:04:58.780> could<00:04:59.020> get

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
made just so that Michael Bay could get

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.570 
made just so that Michael Bay could get
people<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.470> hate<00:04:59.590> transformers<00:05:00.280> it's<00:05:00.490> a

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
people to hate transformers it's a

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.150 
people to hate transformers it's a
really<00:05:00.880> kind<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.210> sick<00:05:01.890> but<00:05:02.890> that's<00:05:03.010> a

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
really kind of sick but that's a

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.300 
really kind of sick but that's a
different<00:05:03.460> topic<00:05:03.880> altogether<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:05.110> yes<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:06.070> was

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310
