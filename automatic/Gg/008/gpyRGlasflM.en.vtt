disliked about Capo's is you're always

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.609

having<00:00:21.160> to<00:00:21.550> clamp<00:00:22.060> them<00:00:22.270> in<00:00:22.509> odd<00:00:22.930> ways<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.560> I

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
having to clamp them in odd ways and I

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.050 
having to clamp them in odd ways and I
wanted<00:00:23.890> something<00:00:24.189> that<00:00:24.369> would<00:00:24.610> really<00:00:24.880> allow

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
wanted something that would really allow

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.019 
wanted something that would really allow
you<00:00:25.270> to<00:00:25.720> use<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.500> same<00:00:26.830> threading<00:00:27.610> motion

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
you to use the same threading motion

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.210 
you to use the same threading motion
that<00:00:28.150> you<00:00:28.300> do<00:00:28.450> when<00:00:28.630> you<00:00:28.810> do<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.169> bar<00:00:29.439> chord<00:00:29.710> to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
that you do when you do a bar chord to

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.710 
that you do when you do a bar chord to
be<00:00:30.310> able<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.520> put<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.849> cable<00:00:31.029> onto<00:00:31.329> the<00:00:31.540> neck

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
be able to put the cable onto the neck

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.290 
be able to put the cable onto the neck
and<00:00:32.200> move<00:00:32.410> it<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.590> any<00:00:32.710> position<00:00:32.950> and<00:00:33.460> slide<00:00:34.149> it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
and move it to any position and slide it

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.560 
and move it to any position and slide it
around<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.870> so<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.739> capo<00:00:36.130> is<00:00:36.489> all<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:37.059> plus

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.639 
around and so the capo is all that plus
we've<00:00:38.410> really<00:00:38.800> taken<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:40.149> idea<00:00:40.540> of<00:00:40.809> artistry

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
we've really taken the idea of artistry

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.069 
we've really taken the idea of artistry
and<00:00:41.800> beauty<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.309> tried<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.760> bring<00:00:43.079> those

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
and beauty and tried to bring those

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.139 
and beauty and tried to bring those
things<00:00:44.500> that<00:00:44.739> come<00:00:44.920> from<00:00:45.010> guitars<00:00:45.460> like<00:00:45.820> fine

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
things that come from guitars like fine

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.720 
things that come from guitars like fine
woods<00:00:46.539> like<00:00:46.929> Y<00:00:47.589> &amp;<00:00:47.800> Co<00:00:48.039> and<00:00:48.280> bird's-eye<00:00:48.699> maple

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
woods like Y &amp; Co and bird's-eye maple

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.720 
woods like Y &amp; Co and bird's-eye maple
and<00:00:49.329> actually<00:00:49.929> bring<00:00:50.230> that<00:00:50.260> into<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.829> K<00:00:51.010> Bo<00:00:51.190> so

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
and actually bring that into the K Bo so

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.819 
and actually bring that into the K Bo so
that<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:51.999> capo<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.629> also<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:52.989> work<00:00:53.260> of<00:00:53.410> art<00:00:53.589> so

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
that the capo is also a work of art so

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.579 
that the capo is also a work of art so
the<00:00:54.609> failure<00:00:54.760> capo<00:00:55.329> is<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.809> little<00:00:56.109> bit<00:00:56.230> heavier

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
the failure capo is a little bit heavier

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.829 
the failure capo is a little bit heavier
than<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.039> normal<00:00:57.160> capo<00:00:57.789> what<00:00:58.329> we've<00:00:58.480> done<00:00:58.690> is

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
than a normal capo what we've done is

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.619 
than a normal capo what we've done is
we've<00:00:59.050> actually<00:00:59.230> turned<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.980> lever<00:01:00.219> arm<00:01:00.629> 180

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
we've actually turned the lever arm 180

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.890 
we've actually turned the lever arm 180
degrees<00:01:02.079> so<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:02.980> can<00:01:03.159> actually<00:01:03.900> depress

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
degrees so that you can actually depress

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.160 
degrees so that you can actually depress
the<00:01:05.140> capo<00:01:05.530> with<00:01:05.860> your<00:01:06.490> fretting<00:01:07.030> hand<00:01:07.170> instead

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
the capo with your fretting hand instead

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.080 
the capo with your fretting hand instead
of<00:01:08.320> having<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.830> constantly<00:01:09.220> do<00:01:09.550> something<00:01:09.940> up

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
of having to constantly do something up

of having to constantly do something up
here<00:01:10.360> on<00:01:10.480> the<00:01:10.600> top<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.020> neck<00:01:11.200> the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
here on the top of the neck the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.820 
here on the top of the neck the
advantages<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:13.060> failure<00:01:13.510> capo<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:14.140> that

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
advantages of the failure capo is that

this<00:01:34.980> started<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.520> an<00:01:35.640> idea<00:01:35.730> that<00:01:36.150> my

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this started out as an idea that my

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.170 
this started out as an idea that my
daughter<00:01:36.690> came<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.230> with<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.550> 8<00:01:38.940> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180

I was sitting in my room looking at my
guitar<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.090> thinking<00:01:42.690> because<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.620> had

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
guitar and I was thinking because I had

this poster of Taylor Swift on my wall

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.600 
this poster of Taylor Swift on my wall
and<00:01:46.080> it<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> picture<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.130> her<00:01:47.340> playing

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.760 
guitar and she had a capo on it that
wasn't<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.210> cool<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.320> thinking

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
wasn't really cool and I was thinking

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.520 
wasn't really cool and I was thinking
that<00:01:52.800> maybe<00:01:53.550> like<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.270> would<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.479> cooler<00:01:55.290> if

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that maybe like it would be cooler if

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
that maybe like it would be cooler if
she<00:01:55.710> had<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.130> pretty<00:01:56.369> capo<00:01:56.940> that<00:01:57.090> went<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.450> it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.780 
I started working on the failure cave of
about<00:02:02.850> four<00:02:03.149> years<00:02:03.300> ago<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.130> started<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
about four years ago and started with a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.660 
about four years ago and started with a
lot<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.360> different<00:02:06.750> design<00:02:07.080> ideas<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.800> so<00:02:08.489> we

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
lot of different design ideas and so we

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.340 
lot of different design ideas and so we
went<00:02:08.850> through<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> whole<00:02:09.690> round<00:02:09.929> of

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
went through a whole round of

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.190 
went through a whole round of
prototyping<00:02:11.130> where<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:12.000> looked<00:02:12.810> at<00:02:12.959> different

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
prototyping where we looked at different

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.250 
prototyping where we looked at different
ways<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:14.090> different<00:02:15.090> mechanisms<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:16.050> how<00:02:16.200> we

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
ways and different mechanisms for how we

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.810 
ways and different mechanisms for how we
could<00:02:16.530> achieve<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.010> result<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.459> were<00:02:17.550> looking

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
could achieve the result we were looking

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.180 
could achieve the result we were looking
for<00:02:18.060> I'd<00:02:18.510> say<00:02:18.570> about<00:02:18.840> two<00:02:19.200> years<00:02:19.410> ago<00:02:19.590> we

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
for I'd say about two years ago we

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580 
for I'd say about two years ago we
finally<00:02:20.370> developed<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.540> internal<00:02:22.200> linkage

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
finally developed the internal linkage

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.979 
finally developed the internal linkage
and<00:02:22.830> mechanism<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:24.209> we<00:02:24.360> thought<00:02:24.570> would<00:02:24.780> just

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
and mechanism that we thought would just

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.410 
and mechanism that we thought would just
work<00:02:25.140> perfectly<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.920> spring<00:02:26.730> was<00:02:27.000> also

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
work perfectly the spring was also

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.180 
work perfectly the spring was also
something<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.290> has<00:02:28.530> taken<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.950> lot<00:02:29.130> of

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
something that has taken a lot of

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.250 
something that has taken a lot of
development<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:30.000> get<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> spring<00:02:30.660> tension<00:02:30.930> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
development to get the spring tension to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.770 
development to get the spring tension to
work<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:31.709> right<00:02:31.880> design<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.450> really

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
work just right design is is really

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.710 
work just right design is is really
everything<00:02:34.370> design<00:02:35.370> when<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.540> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
everything design when you have this

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.339 
everything design when you have this
gorgeous<00:02:37.370> form<00:02:38.370> meets

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
gorgeous form meets

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.500 
gorgeous form meets
just<00:02:39.680> an<00:02:39.799> amazing<00:02:40.069> function<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.939> marriage

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
just an amazing function that marriage

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.690 
just an amazing function that marriage
is<00:02:41.689> what<00:02:41.900> really<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.799> me<00:02:43.010> makes<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.430> product

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
is what really to me makes a product

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.350 
is what really to me makes a product
exceptional

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.570 

we<00:02:50.140> need<00:02:50.260> backing<00:02:50.710> at<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:50.980> point<00:02:51.220> because

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
we need backing at this point because

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.460 
we need backing at this point because
we've<00:02:51.760> invested<00:02:51.790> all<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.810> our<00:02:52.900> money<00:02:53.080> and

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
we've invested all of our money and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.050 
we've invested all of our money and
getting<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.890> product<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> point<00:02:54.790> where

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
getting the product to the point where

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.020 
getting the product to the point where
we<00:02:55.660> know<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.530> it's<00:02:56.710> almost<00:02:57.220> ready<00:02:57.910> for

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
we know that it's almost ready for

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.910 
we know that it's almost ready for
market<00:02:58.360> but<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:58.870> still<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> lot<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.560> things

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
market but we still have a lot of things

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.890 
market but we still have a lot of things
that<00:03:00.100> we<00:03:00.220> need<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.460> buy<00:03:00.610> we<00:03:01.300> need<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.570> go<00:03:01.690> from

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
that we need to buy we need to go from

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.990 
that we need to buy we need to go from
prototype<00:03:02.470> molds<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.950> production<00:03:03.400> diecast

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
prototype molds to production diecast

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.820 
prototype molds to production diecast
models<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:04.960> that<00:03:04.990> we<00:03:05.170> can<00:03:05.320> make<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.650> cable

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
models so that we can make the cable

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.040 
models so that we can make the cable
parts<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.400> higher<00:03:06.520> quantities<00:03:07.090> we<00:03:07.840> need<00:03:07.990> to
