00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 yes what can one say about shi qi big 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.549
 I have to say and which is the beginning 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.700
 I noticed there was a pretty 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 oppressive atmosphere that's all right so 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.849
 I find it animated for mystery horror 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 that's very good, that's one 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.350
 plus point then the second one here very much 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 so many characters emerge 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.070
 really many characters 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.070
 that is something in my opinion 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.960
 negative if you really hardly what 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.029
 learn about the individual characters 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 then the next point would be the story 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.040
 I do not know but somehow has 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.050
 me the story all the time to this 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 a story of stephen king namely 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.489
 Burn must salem or sale in the slot 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.140
 plus the whole one two three 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.960
 Short stories that there too 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.329
 belong remember because that was somehow 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.550
 pretty much the same I do not know if that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.950
 make that consciously so or did 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.340
 probably not but I really found the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.750
 very very very very very similar 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.760
 what he is nothing bad in itself 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.350
 because i have this sieveking story 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.329
 I also liked the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.039
 filmic realization of the story even 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.600
 did not like it and now it will 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.430
 I like her, but I come 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.920
 right back to the characters of ours 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.740
 main character so far this actually 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.990
 young man named almost only happy 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.650
 our second main character is then 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.619
 also in this doctor called toshiba 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.810
 both will be placed relatively in focus 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.790
 where I have to say that on ours 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.409
 actual main character so me 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.689
 think that it's the real prelude 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.970
 is that on the nation that is in there 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.799
 the focus of the anime is on 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.909
 bit disappears and there I have to 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.400
 say that I have a bit of a shame 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.650
 but this in itself not quite as 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.509
 Bad is another feature of this 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.750
 animes that's you that the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.939
 strands many many people 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.250
 So I have it in one 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.380
 Doctor then this boy then one follows 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.450
 on your temple priest and one 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.710
 Pretty much girl at the beginning 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.420
 for example 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.159
 I really do not think so 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.100
 bad but I think it's partly 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.210
 a little too many strands of action to 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.710
 many people 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.780
 I had some at some point 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.360
 a little less desired but 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.459
 All in all, it's not quite so 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.379
 bad and next to this stephen king 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.180
 Story that's me there a bit 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.120
 remembered if I can get there 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.060
 even such power 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.849
 discover dracula element in it as well 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.180
 for example, with the village and this 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.040
 huge castle as I will find here 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.989
 the atmosphere is really good 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.959
 brought over so it was very 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.430
 oppressive and I like that very much 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.290
 then we come to the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.720
 animations are the animations 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.700
 only class style has some 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.650
 special features that are not really 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.780
 bad but at the one or 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.819
 other route used needy are like that 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.430
 have some characters right 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.650
 interesting abstract hairstyles and the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.959
 the eyes of the undead are almost always almost 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 completely black the synchronization 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.489
 has generally been quite good 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.480
 I am also not negative 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.280
 but I can not 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.170
 so good at criticizing because I am yes 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.239
 no japanese i do not understand any word 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.909
 where you can do relatively little Japanese 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.250
 or can I judge it too badly 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.549
 the first opening and the second ending 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.980
 von taktik are both very good songs 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.049
 the atmosphere fits the first one 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.900
 ending is nothing special but in 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.319
 places and I have to admit that that 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.450
 second ending absolutely does not fit 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.299
 it is ok but it fits absolutely 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.319
 not to have the first endingen 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.049
 should let 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.090
 let the first opening low 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.769
 because the atmosphere is much better 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.900
 has brought over and what is 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.269
 maybe some ask why the anime 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.450
 de and shi qi are said to be natural in the 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.980
 explains the course of animes and want because 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.980
 Now a little spoiler warning again 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.290
 give this then come back 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.599
 So in these vampires and the payment 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.569
 that came from the temple priest 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.239
 concludes a classic vampire story 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.919
 who relocated to Japan with variations 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.440
 was and interesting 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.419
 strand of action offers with characters 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.239
 in the meantime forced 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.190
 change sides and so much 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.379
 could be interesting but the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.750
 story something just too sweet and 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.849
 superficially processed you remain 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.199
 Nevertheless, the last will be exciting 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.570
 you can argue 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.970
 either it is the fireworks the series 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.159
 or murks for the latter speaks unfortunately 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.130
 the end too predictable 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:26.620
 You could say exactly what you want 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.540
 expected and not what you like 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.600
 because I have to say that was mine 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.949
 that in the end but up to much 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.570
 massacre but what still long yet 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.880
 does not mean that he is bad me 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.580
 would turn him over in a total score 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.669
 give the 83 points because I think that 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.250
 I still see him as one 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.310
 pending implementation of stephen kings 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.860
 timeslot in small changes 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.660
 Of course, but I see that as seen 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.389
 the very very very horny and 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.520
 so I'm going to score points in 83 of 100 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.949
 already definitely new items, if you 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.740
 mystery or horror anime fans are 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.289
 otherwise I do not know if he's good for you 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.039
 and I hope that we will of course 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.590
 with one another too many 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.630
 character can do what else possible 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.070
 is the name of the characters not interesting 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.139
 but they are just really 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.050
 incredibly many as you could in part to 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.150
 So the only way was the name 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.940
 I do not have it from most of them 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.340
 but I do not think so 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.630
 So bad then we'll see each other 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.760
 next time, and as always, 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.830
 Of course, everything has said mine 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.840
 opinion with you not the violence of 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.070
 and we will see each other 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.070
 next time your citigroup
