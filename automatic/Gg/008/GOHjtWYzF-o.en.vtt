00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm just going to follow. 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.040
 edu 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.860
 the author of the book Confessions Online and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.990
 today I came to tell you how it was 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.820
 I published my still come good 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.139
 a lot of people ask me for tips on how 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.119
 publish a book 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.439
 I do not really like giving tips because 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.490
 I think this is a very 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.930
 individual 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.880
 There are people who publicly 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.039
 There are independent public people tonight. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 country has people blends in amazon has 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 Public people have great people. 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.160
 that the public will not be small and many 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.260
 Sometimes people are very satisfied 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 with the form they have chosen to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.100
 publish because what the publication is 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 very individual depends on what you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.500
 wait for your book you want to know 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.690
 with him and everything max I'll tell 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
 You are my story, I hope. 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 help you in the coming months I can 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.879
 talk a little bit about each model of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.800
 Publication 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.210
 measured in the comments what you 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.860
 They think it's good 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.809
 well my first book was not with 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.180
 online functions was divided honey 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.219
 it was published in 2011 by the publisher 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.969
 Draco is a very small story of 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.489
 Paulo 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.760
 they worry I was asked to ask 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.400
 in them you have a ready text and I had 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.659
 no meo or sharing honey in fact he 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.210
 It was a joke with some friends. 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.810
 my because that's how it just had 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.909
 just finished in the mouth 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.530
 That's when I said, oh, Mom, I think it's a 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.150
 funny story about it all 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.610
 history began 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.470
 and then I went there and started to write only 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.509
 who until then never finished writing 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.500
 a book none of this was a super 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.770
 even kidding 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.329
 and after that I was talking to the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.400
 my friends and talk look I'm in 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.439
 doubt if this will happen to this and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 they were giving me tips were cheering 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.009
 more for one character than for another 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.450
 and I was created in history but it is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.549
 That's what I'm here to talk about, right? 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.560
 It's here to talk about how it was published. 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.369
 I had this book ready in the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.409
 cantinho and where i what am i 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.299
 ask if they have a text 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.649
 ready then we wanted to check 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.750
 We really like the way you do. 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.890
 writes who knows how to publish this was in 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.800
 end of 2010 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.100
 I showed him he breaks into meo and he 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.380
 topou published is draco did not charge me 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.680
 nothing by publication they put everything 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.480
 cover personal publication review 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.220
 this has history that charges an amount 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.170
 the authors but this was never my case 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.610
 and that's when I told them to put it on 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.780
 release schedule of the book was 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:32.370
 launched in December 2011 more than one 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.350
 year later when he left is up to some 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.540
 problems because the book was in a 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.090
 small publisher had no distribution 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.370
 it was very difficult for people to find 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.209
 this book because the distribution was a 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.910
 little limited and then it was very cool 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.840
 because it was a place where I started 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.180
 I wanted to grow up the author so I 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.890
 I contacted her there today. 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.500
 my people the people of several others 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.989
 authors to barbarian moraes not day 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.570
 build a fernanda mania do like me 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:09.390
 really that of dantas and then she got the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.790
 my text that was to continue until in 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.790
 truth does not notice the debt of honey 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.400
 because who does not know melissa who 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.310
 send mariana here in online shopping is 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:27.120
 in fact the melissa of the divine honey 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:30.239
 So it's the book was a spinoff but it's a 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.209
 Yes, completely independent of the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.799
 honey honey I'll be there for her 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.290
 liked it and then we started working 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.900
 book and submit to publishers 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.600
 it was initially sent to three 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.480
 two publishers accepted one of them and 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.459
 refused and then those two who accepted 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.970
 I sat with them and started to talk 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.549
 with him about work and about what 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.650
 I imagined the book to head in the world. 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.900
 with Generali because they had a 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.780
 project that was somewhat similar to what 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.600
 I expected and we taught 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.400
 folks combined book publishing this 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.989
 the signing of the contract was at the beginning 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.519
 of 2013 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.900
 we combined published in the book the 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.420
 end of 2013 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.100
 then the book was published and I was already in 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.250
 time 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.730
 signed contract for two books is 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.260
 all this negotiation was done together with 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.390
 my people want ag 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.510
 then in this second step while in the 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.460
 first book the future is myself 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.220
 I try to talk to the editor myself 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.010
 and the contract if no contract or if I 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.780
 I was mediated here by an agent who 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.830
 it was the text before sending it to 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.990
 publisher showed them all is made 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.280
 Contact tried those with more 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.530
 my profile so this was very cool 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.600
 because it was an aid to do all 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.900
 this more complicated part that sometimes 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.480
 It gets a little tiring for the author. 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.950
 I did it and I published it and then I 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.140
 I started writing the next one that goes 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.550
 I leave now in the biennial of the river. 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.950
 A little bit to write because I am 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.870
 kind of slow writing that already takes 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.180
 werneck I wrote very fast but 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.970
 takes a lot of time planning and 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.250
 organizing the story then the second 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.240
 It leaves now at the end of the year we have 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.490
 other plans like that but I 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.830
 I will not say anything do not yet have this 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.080
 It was my story. It was very simple. 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.230
 had that thing so target my god 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.490
 happened this happened what I 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.200
 I say that my show is bland. 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:34.340
 publication because fortunately I got it 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.720
 very fast and was a very easy way 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.180
 but this does not happen with all 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.490
 authors only today that the publishers 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.360
 are much more open to others 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.380
 authors 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.110
 and it is they look very eye me 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.150
 I think that part of the facility that 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.370
 I found to present my books 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.060
 President, and to be able to 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.340
 publish quickly and at no cost 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.080
 was because these publishers already knew 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.510
 My job because of the blog they 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.980
 they knew that I had an audience even though 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.140
 was not very big but an audience 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.030
 who accompanied me and would be interested 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.130
 reading my book was very important 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.810
 For me, I said that neither doctor 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.330
 But I'm here to tip if you 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.040
 or much writing is something very 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.200
 important that you are poorly 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.630
 haiti that sometimes you are wonderful 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.009
 you write better than anyone who 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.400
 you 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.990
 but you may not be able to publish 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.939
 because you have no guarantee by 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.050
 publisher that your book will be well 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.360
 Received 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.539
 so if you started writing now 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.869
