00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
are certain factors if you think about

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.820 
are certain factors if you think about
them<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.670> probably<00:00:21.630> reasons<00:00:22.109> why<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.590> not

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
them are probably reasons why it's not

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.439 
them are probably reasons why it's not
mmm<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.880> gave<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> couple<00:00:24.840> examples<00:00:25.039> how

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
mmm I gave a couple examples how

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.650 
mmm I gave a couple examples how
platforming<00:00:27.449> games<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:28.109> general<00:00:29.179> thus<00:00:30.179> non

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
platforming games in general thus non

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.360 
platforming games in general thus non
slow<00:00:31.349> floaty<00:00:31.859> bullshit<00:00:32.430> ones<00:00:32.700> yeah<00:00:34.070> they<00:00:35.070> are

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
slow floaty bullshit ones yeah they are

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.030 
slow floaty bullshit ones yeah they are
about<00:00:35.700> precision<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.200> they're<00:00:37.440> about<00:00:37.590> time

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
about precision and they're about time

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.369 
about precision and they're about time
that's<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.469> can't<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.219> motherfucker

block making us just disappear and I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.240 
block making us just disappear and I
can't<00:00:47.879> fucking<00:00:48.059> jump<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.890> that's<00:00:49.890> time

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
can't fucking jump on it and that's time

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.540 
can't fucking jump on it and that's time
and<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.660> lot<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.469> lace<00:00:52.620> latency<00:00:53.370> lag

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and a lot of thing with lace latency lag

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.200 
and a lot of thing with lace latency lag
have<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.390> too<00:00:55.079> plus<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:57.030> as

the stream she's flying at me i got duck
it<00:01:03.239> yeah<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.830> other<00:01:05.640> crap<00:01:05.970> there's<00:01:06.360> like

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it yeah you know other crap there's like

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.200 
it yeah you know other crap there's like
AI<00:01:07.460> incorporated<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.670> level<00:01:09.090> design

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
AI incorporated in the level design

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
AI incorporated in the level design
that's<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.740> have

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that's going on there like you have

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
that's going on there like you have
enemies<00:01:11.400> move<00:01:11.670> moving<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.900> things

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
enemies move moving the way things

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.800 
enemies move moving the way things
flying<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.090> whole<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.780> whole

animation<00:01:16.560> goes<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.250> attention<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
animation goes it with the attention to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
animation goes it with the attention to
animation<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.650> there's<00:01:20.070> no<00:01:20.570> girl<00:01:21.570> we're

not<00:01:22.320> being<00:01:22.560> apologist<00:01:23.780> it's<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.409> it's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
not being apologist it's like it's it's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
not being apologist it's like it's it's
it<00:01:26.040> doesn't<00:01:26.369> we're<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.119> yet<00:01:27.420> where<00:01:27.810> we

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
can have perfect latency you know what

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
can have perfect latency you know what
the<00:01:32.009> lag<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:33.180> keep<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.869> a
