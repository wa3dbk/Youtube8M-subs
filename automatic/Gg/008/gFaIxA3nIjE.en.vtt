us a little bit about the endings and
the<00:00:43.089> kicker<00:00:43.300> arbors<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:43.839> what<00:00:43.930> makes<00:00:44.110> them

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
the kicker arbors and what makes them

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.500 
the kicker arbors and what makes them
quite<00:00:44.379> so<00:00:44.440> special<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:45.670> whole<00:00:45.850> concept

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
quite so special the whole concept

quite so special the whole concept
behind<00:00:46.629> building<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.350> envy<00:00:47.680> was<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.070> make<00:00:48.250> a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
behind building the envy was to make a

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.340 
behind building the envy was to make a
reel<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.030> had<00:00:49.390> all<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.690> qualities<00:00:49.809> of<00:00:50.140> our

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
reel that had all the qualities of our

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.859 
reel that had all the qualities of our
CCF<00:00:50.799> crag<00:00:51.040> system<00:00:51.489> but<00:00:52.299> making<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.659> lighter

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:52.869 
CCF crag system but making a lighter

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.259 
CCF crag system but making a lighter
package<00:00:53.409> right<00:00:53.710> when<00:00:54.519> we<00:00:54.640> first<00:00:54.879> launched<00:00:55.210> a

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
package right when we first launched a

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.210 
package right when we first launched a
CCF<00:00:55.690> drag<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.140> was<00:00:56.350> one<00:00:56.860> of<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.010> lighter

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
CCF drag it was one of the lighter

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.680 
CCF drag it was one of the lighter
wheels<00:00:57.489> in<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.699> market<00:00:58.089> it<00:00:58.269> was<00:00:58.420> large

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
wheels in the market it was large

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.780 
wheels in the market it was large
arboreal<00:00:59.229> but<00:00:59.860> everyday<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.430> wheels<00:01:00.610> are

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
arboreal but everyday the wheels are

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.549 
arboreal but everyday the wheels are
going<00:01:00.820> bigger<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.570> we<00:01:01.960> wanted<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.290> make<00:01:02.440> him

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
going bigger and we wanted to make him

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.859 
going bigger and we wanted to make him
lighter<00:01:02.830> and<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:03.850> what<00:01:04.000> we<00:01:04.119> did<00:01:04.299> was<00:01:04.540> we<00:01:04.570> took

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
lighter and so what we did was we took

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.340 
lighter and so what we did was we took
this<00:01:05.049> drag<00:01:05.549> that's<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:07.360> CCF<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.990> original

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
this drag that's the CCF the original

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.010 
this drag that's the CCF the original
CCF<00:01:08.770> drag<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.670> realized<00:01:10.360> that<00:01:10.570> all<00:01:10.780> the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
CCF drag and realized that all the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.770 
CCF drag and realized that all the
weight<00:01:11.200> who<00:01:11.830> resides<00:01:12.159> in<00:01:12.369> this<00:01:12.490> drive<00:01:12.790> alright

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
weight who resides in this drive alright

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.170 
weight who resides in this drive alright
so<00:01:14.049> in<00:01:14.260> order<00:01:14.439> to<00:01:14.590> reduce<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.220> weight<00:01:15.880> on<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
so in order to reduce the weight on the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.810 
so in order to reduce the weight on the
envies<00:01:16.510> as<00:01:16.689> opposed<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.049> CCF<00:01:17.619> we<00:01:18.400> have<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.640> take

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
envies as opposed to CCF we have to take

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.249 
envies as opposed to CCF we have to take
the<00:01:18.939> main<00:01:19.090> components<00:01:19.659> out<00:01:19.780> which<00:01:20.079> are<00:01:20.229> the

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
the main components out which are the

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.889 
the main components out which are the
bearings<00:01:20.649> on<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.490> CCF<00:01:22.000> wheels<00:01:22.299> we<00:01:22.689> have<00:01:22.780> to

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
bearings on the CCF wheels we have to

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.959 
bearings on the CCF wheels we have to
reduce<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.500> size<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.890> these<00:01:24.039> that<00:01:24.250> way<00:01:24.399> quite

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
reduce the size of these that way quite

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.569 
reduce the size of these that way quite
a<00:01:25.000> bit<00:01:25.210> more<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.859> so<00:01:26.859> what<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.189> ended<00:01:27.399> up<00:01:27.520> with

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
a bit more and so what we ended up with

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.399 
a bit more and so what we ended up with
was<00:01:27.880> really<00:01:28.179> small<00:01:28.509> extremely<00:01:29.350> strong

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
was really small extremely strong

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.489 
was really small extremely strong
bearings<00:01:30.240> ceramics<00:01:31.240> titanium<00:01:31.810> components

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
bearings ceramics titanium components

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.520 
bearings ceramics titanium components
and<00:01:33.359> ended<00:01:34.359> up<00:01:34.420> with<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.600> brake<00:01:34.990> system<00:01:35.020> that's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and ended up with a brake system that's

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.419 
and ended up with a brake system that's
twice<00:01:35.710> as<00:01:35.770> big

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
twice as big

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.429 
twice as big
yet<00:01:37.090> weighs<00:01:37.299> half<00:01:37.509> as<00:01:37.689> much<00:01:37.840> as<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.079> one<00:01:38.320> in

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
yet weighs half as much as the one in

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.580 
yet weighs half as much as the one in
the<00:01:38.530> CCF<00:01:38.950> wheels<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.329> this<00:01:40.810> rail<00:01:41.049> used<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.409> get

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
the CCF wheels so this rail used to get

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.870 
the CCF wheels so this rail used to get
between<00:01:41.770> eight<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.039> ten<00:01:42.340> pounds<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.729> drag

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
between eight and ten pounds of drag

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.239 
between eight and ten pounds of drag
this<00:01:43.479> one<00:01:43.659> persistently<00:01:44.200> clocks<00:01:44.439> in<00:01:44.619> over<00:01:44.920> 15

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
this one persistently clocks in over 15

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.849 
this one persistently clocks in over 15
pounds<00:01:45.429> so<00:01:46.359> it's<00:01:46.539> more<00:01:47.140> drag<00:01:47.409> than<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.710> would

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
pounds so it's more drag than you would

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.239 
pounds so it's more drag than you would
ever<00:01:47.979> need<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.770> we<00:01:50.859> built<00:01:51.100> it

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
ever need but that's what we built it

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.580 
ever need but that's what we built it
for<00:01:51.429> so<00:01:51.700> this<00:01:52.539> reel<00:01:52.780> now<00:01:53.020> we<00:01:53.079> were<00:01:53.319> able<00:01:53.560> to

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
for so this reel now we were able to

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.550 
for so this reel now we were able to
make<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.039> much<00:01:54.069> lighter<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.450> then<00:01:56.380> we

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
make it that much lighter and then we

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.749 
make it that much lighter and then we
said<00:01:56.770> okay<00:01:57.009> let's<00:01:57.039> take<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.639> next

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
said okay let's take it to the next

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.789 
said okay let's take it to the next
level<00:01:58.179> and<00:01:58.420> that's<00:01:58.869> when<00:01:59.079> we<00:01:59.200> decided<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.710> the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
level and that's when we decided on the

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.489 
level and that's when we decided on the
Giga<00:01:59.979> schools<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:01.030> we<00:02:01.149> took<00:02:01.299> our<00:02:01.509> NV<00:02:01.840> 1112

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:02.499 
Giga schools so we took our NV 1112

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:04.410 
Giga schools so we took our NV 1112
that's<00:02:02.979> still<00:02:03.219> weighed<00:02:03.460> less<00:02:03.670> than<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.939> CCF

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
that's still weighed less than that CCF

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.609 
that's still weighed less than that CCF
eight<00:02:04.659> originally<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.319> you're<00:02:05.469> in<00:02:05.560> an

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
eight originally so you're in an

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.499 
eight originally so you're in an
eight-way<00:02:05.950> here<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:07.030> weighs<00:02:07.210> less<00:02:07.450> than

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
eight-way here that weighs less than

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.300 
eight-way here that weighs less than
some<00:02:07.840> five<00:02:08.080> weights<00:02:08.350> along<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.800> market<00:02:09.160> today

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
some five weights along the market today

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.270 
some five weights along the market today
still<00:02:09.759> being<00:02:10.179> made<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.869> we<00:02:11.680> said<00:02:11.860> okay<00:02:12.040> let's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
still being made and we said okay let's

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.510 
still being made and we said okay let's
take<00:02:12.850> this<00:02:12.910> reel<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.010> try<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.069> make<00:02:15.250> something

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
take this reel and try to make something

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.190 
take this reel and try to make something
that'll<00:02:16.060> fit<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.270> nine<00:02:16.510> weight<00:02:16.750> we're<00:02:16.959> not<00:02:17.080> so

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
that'll fit a nine weight we're not so

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.600 
that'll fit a nine weight we're not so
much<00:02:17.350> back<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.800> so

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
much back in so

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.690 
much back in so
what<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.730> did<00:02:20.940> was<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.180> built<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.630> g9<00:02:21.990> spools

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
what we did was we built the g9 spools

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.790 
what we did was we built the g9 spools
for<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.820> 11-12<00:02:24.360> frame<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.440> goes<00:02:25.650> all

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
for the 11-12 frame and this goes all

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.980 
for the 11-12 frame and this goes all
the<00:02:25.860> way<00:02:25.980> down<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.490> 1011<00:02:27.060> has<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> g8<00:02:27.600> spool

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
the way down the 1011 has the g8 spool

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.250 
the way down the 1011 has the g8 spool
the<00:02:28.590> eight<00:02:28.710> nine<00:02:28.890> as<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> g7<00:02:29.610> spool<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.390> then<00:02:31.050> G

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the eight nine as a g7 spool and then G

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.250 
the eight nine as a g7 spool and then G
6<00:02:31.560> into<00:02:31.890> 5<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.460> way<00:02:32.550> down<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.110> what

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
6 into 5 all the way down and so what

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.040 
6 into 5 all the way down and so what

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
things we wanted something that would

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.080 
things we wanted something that would
really<00:02:53.820> pick<00:02:54.060> up<00:02:54.209> line<00:02:54.420> fast<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:56.550> dried<00:02:56.880> the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
really pick up line fast that dried the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.560 
really pick up line fast that dried the
backing<00:02:57.510> really<00:02:57.750> fast<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:59.090> what<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.209> designed

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
backing really fast so what we designed

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.479 
backing really fast so what we designed
was<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.930> reel<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.470> will<00:03:01.590> fit<00:03:01.770> on<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.950> 11-12

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
was this reel that will fit on the 11-12

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.320 
was this reel that will fit on the 11-12
frame<00:03:02.820> it's<00:03:03.480> called<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.810> Giga<00:03:04.470> nine<00:03:04.739> spool<00:03:05.330> it

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
frame it's called the Giga nine spool it

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.850 
frame it's called the Giga nine spool it
looks<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.870> backing<00:03:07.200> floats<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.650> top

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
looks like the backing floats on top

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.979 
looks like the backing floats on top
there<00:03:08.130> ventilates<00:03:08.850> dries<00:03:09.390> really<00:03:09.660> quickly

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
there ventilates dries really quickly

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.210 
there ventilates dries really quickly
and<00:03:10.489> now<00:03:11.489> suddenly<00:03:11.790> you've<00:03:12.120> got<00:03:12.150> one<00:03:12.630> rail

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
and now suddenly you've got one rail

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.520 
and now suddenly you've got one rail
that<00:03:14.220> was<00:03:14.550> four<00:03:15.060> inch<00:03:15.209> reel<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.720> now<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.440> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
that was four inch reel and now it's a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.350 
that was four inch reel and now it's a
four<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.830> half<00:03:16.860> inch<00:03:17.190> reel<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:18.180> weight

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
four and a half inch reel the weight

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.640 
four and a half inch reel the weight
difference<00:03:18.570> is<00:03:18.900> one<00:03:19.110> ounce

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
difference is one ounce

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.470 
difference is one ounce
visually<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.640> makes<00:03:20.880> your<00:03:21.000> brain<00:03:21.120> actually

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
visually it makes your brain actually

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.300 
visually it makes your brain actually
think<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:21.810> lighter<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.530> feels<00:03:22.800> like<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.220> me

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
think it's lighter it feels like it me

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.470 
think it's lighter it feels like it me
it<00:03:23.400> feels<00:03:23.580> lighter<00:03:23.820> but<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:24.209> actually

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
it feels lighter but it's actually

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.509 
it feels lighter but it's actually
heavier<00:03:24.750> whale<00:03:24.930> than<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.230> one<00:03:25.440> not<00:03:26.100> by<00:03:26.310> much

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
heavier whale than this one not by much

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.180 
heavier whale than this one not by much
still<00:03:27.000> much<00:03:27.209> lighter<00:03:27.480> than<00:03:27.660> CCF<00:03:28.170> eight<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.650> mean

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
still much lighter than CCF eight I mean

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.979 
still much lighter than CCF eight I mean
it's<00:03:29.340> really<00:03:29.760> quick<00:03:30.180> really<00:03:30.480> quick<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.959> you

it's really quick really quick so you
need<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.320> dig<00:03:31.470> by<00:03:31.620> inflation<00:03:31.920> yeah<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.880> all

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
need to dig by inflation yeah and on all

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.430 
need to dig by inflation yeah and on all
the<00:03:33.239> Giga<00:03:33.420> spools<00:03:33.780> we've<00:03:34.019> installed<00:03:34.320> the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
the Giga spools we've installed the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.020 
the Giga spools we've installed the
big-game<00:03:34.830> handle<00:03:35.280> as<00:03:35.370> well<00:03:35.549> which<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:35.880> just
