suggest<00:01:13.020> doing<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.830> sometimes<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.330> not

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
suggest doing this sometimes it is not

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.149 
suggest doing this sometimes it is not
really<00:01:15.840> an<00:01:15.960> option<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.890> let<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
really an option that you can let it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
really an option that you can let it
discharge<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:18.000> daylight<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.600> other<00:01:18.750> words<00:01:18.990> let

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
discharge to daylight in other words let

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
discharge to daylight in other words let
it<00:01:19.290> come<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.890> ground<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it come out on the ground you see that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.600 
it come out on the ground you see that
house<00:01:21.479> back<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.049> back<00:01:22.229> well<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.280> that

house back in the back well all that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.460 
house back in the back well all that
water<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.689> straight<00:01:25.049> into<00:01:25.229> their

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

there<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.270> help<00:01:51.600> stop<00:01:51.960> some<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.470> water

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
there to help stop some of that water

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.660 
there to help stop some of that water
now<00:01:55.140> we're<00:01:55.320> connecting<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> rear<00:01:56.040> downspouts

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
now we're connecting the rear downspouts

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.670 
now we're connecting the rear downspouts
and<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> cat<00:01:57.210> space<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.689> there<00:01:57.899> by<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.380> gate

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and the cat space in there by the gate

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.240 
and the cat space in there by the gate
and<00:01:59.000> this<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.270> had<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.689> dig<00:02:00.899> by<00:02:01.079> hand<00:02:01.250> had

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and this we just had to dig by hand had

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.760 
and this we just had to dig by hand had
to<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> repair<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> sprinkler<00:02:03.810> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
to make a repair to the sprinkler that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.389 
to make a repair to the sprinkler that
happens<00:02:05.219> sometimes<00:02:05.640> when<00:02:05.880> you're<00:02:06.030> trenching

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
happens sometimes when you're trenching

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.710 
happens sometimes when you're trenching
now<00:02:08.399> we're<00:02:08.610> laying<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.090> connecting<00:02:09.629> the

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:15.080 
front section as it comes down to the
fence<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.800> rake<00:04:06.310> out<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.700> soil

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.420 

we<00:04:15.630> had<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.900> put<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.139> together<00:04:16.470> first<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.340> we

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
we had to put that together first so we

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.610 
we had to put that together first so we
can<00:04:17.459> roll<00:04:18.180> our<00:04:18.359> wheelbarrows<00:04:18.840> over<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.260> area

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
can roll our wheelbarrows over the area

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.039 
can roll our wheelbarrows over the area
where<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.889> catch<00:04:20.100> basin<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.720> can<00:04:21.870> see

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
where the catch basin is and you can see

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.690 
where the catch basin is and you can see
we've<00:04:22.290> already<00:04:22.500> pretty<00:04:22.889> much<00:04:22.980> covered<00:04:23.490> most

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
we've already pretty much covered most

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.370 
we've already pretty much covered most
of<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.000> now<00:04:24.210> this<00:04:24.480> gravel<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.200> he's

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
of this now this gravel that he's

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.320 
of this now this gravel that he's
pouring<00:04:25.680> in<00:04:25.950> here<00:04:25.980> is<00:04:26.790> covering<00:04:27.210> up

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
pouring in here is covering up

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.409 
pouring in here is covering up
perforated<00:04:27.990> pipe<00:04:28.230> as<00:04:28.440> well<00:04:28.820> we<00:04:29.820> are<00:04:30.150> actually

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
perforated pipe as well we are actually

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.030 
perforated pipe as well we are actually
trying<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.990> discharge<00:04:31.530> this<00:04:31.740> water

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
trying to discharge this water

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.760 
trying to discharge this water
underground<00:04:32.600> so<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.139> doesn't<00:04:34.500> flood

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
underground so that it doesn't flood

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.190 
underground so that it doesn't flood
down<00:04:35.070> into<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.460> neighbor's<00:04:35.790> property<00:04:35.990> yes<00:04:36.990> we

are putting two overflows from each dry
well<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:41.360> you'll<00:04:42.360> see<00:04:42.570> those<00:04:42.750> here<00:04:42.960> in<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.110> a

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
well and you'll see those here in just a

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.220 
well and you'll see those here in just a
second<00:04:43.830> basically<00:04:44.550> if<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.210> ground<00:04:45.630> fills<00:04:46.020> up

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
second basically if the ground fills up

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.560 
second basically if the ground fills up
too<00:04:46.470> much<00:04:46.590> with<00:04:46.650> water<00:04:47.130> we're<00:04:47.820> just<00:04:48.060> giving<00:04:48.450> it

too much with water we're just giving it
a<00:04:48.630> place<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.110> go<00:04:49.290> so<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.130> can<00:04:50.280> actually<00:04:50.460> come<00:04:50.910> up

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
a place to go so it can actually come up

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.780 
a place to go so it can actually come up
and<00:04:51.300> yes<00:04:51.750> it's<00:04:51.960> going<00:04:52.169> to<00:04:52.290> go<00:04:52.680> down<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.340> little

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790
