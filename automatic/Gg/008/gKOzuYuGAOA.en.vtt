blow-drying it for several reasons it's

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.570

rid<00:01:27.789> of<00:01:27.819> the<00:01:28.030> funk<00:01:28.450> well<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:29.920> think<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:31.440> it's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
rid of the funk well so I think and it's

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.219 
rid of the funk well so I think and it's
getting<00:01:33.099> wavy<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.970> I'm<00:01:34.539> blow-drying<00:01:34.720> it<00:01:35.110> on

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
getting wavy and I'm blow-drying it on

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.350 
getting wavy and I'm blow-drying it on
medium<00:01:35.440> I'll<00:01:35.860> do<00:01:36.099> a<00:01:36.130> hot<00:01:36.459> blast<00:01:36.759> at<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.060> end

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
medium I'll do a hot blast at the end

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.960 
medium I'll do a hot blast at the end
but<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.020> should<00:01:38.289> get<00:01:38.470> rid<00:01:38.649> of<00:01:38.709> the<00:01:39.130> waviness

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
but that should get rid of the waviness

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.719 
but that should get rid of the waviness
the<00:01:40.479> sweaty<00:01:40.750> Nesta<00:01:41.259> stinkiness<00:01:41.709> and<00:01:42.130> then

in and then you know straightening out

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.190 
in and then you know straightening out
my<00:02:43.780> ends<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.800> far<00:02:45.099> as<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.519> know<00:02:46.200> detangling

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
my ends as far as you know detangling

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.600 
my ends as far as you know detangling
there's<00:02:47.560> no<00:02:47.709> tangles<00:02:48.160> there<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.489> just

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
there's no tangles there but just

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.290 
there's no tangles there but just
helping<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:50.280> flatten<00:02:51.280> out<00:02:51.459> with<00:02:52.060> my

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
helping it to flatten out with my

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.800 
helping it to flatten out with my
bristle<00:02:53.050> brush<00:02:53.610> before<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.640> roll<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:57.510> see<00:02:58.510> if<00:02:58.660> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
bristle brush before I roll it see if I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.020 
bristle brush before I roll it see if I
can't<00:02:59.110> get<00:02:59.410> this<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.599> frame<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:03.190> that

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
can't get this in the frame and that

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.660 
can't get this in the frame and that
will<00:03:04.269> allow<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.750> lay<00:03:05.110> down<00:03:05.140> on<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.430> roller

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
will allow it to lay down on the roller

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.229 
will allow it to lay down on the roller
better<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.390> give<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.720> better<00:03:07.870> chance<00:03:08.230> to

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
better and give it a better chance to

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.970 
better and give it a better chance to
straighten<00:03:10.239> back<00:03:10.510> out<00:03:10.720> because<00:03:11.349> even<00:03:11.829> though

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
straighten back out because even though

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.819 
straighten back out because even though
I'm<00:03:12.130> blow-drying<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:13.090> my<00:03:13.299> roots<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:14.019> want<00:03:14.680> my

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
I'm blow-drying just my roots I want my

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.050 
I'm blow-drying just my roots I want my
ends<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.370> lay<00:03:15.489> down<00:03:15.519> -<00:03:16.260> which<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.880> main

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
ends to lay down - which is the main

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.259 
ends to lay down - which is the main
reason<00:03:19.450> for<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.720> Roller<00:03:19.930> set<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:22.060> want

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
reason for the Roller set and I want

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.740 
reason for the Roller set and I want
them<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.510> lay<00:03:23.110> down<00:03:23.140> properly<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:25.450> water

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
them to lay down properly so the water

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.680 
them to lay down properly so the water
will<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.590> it's<00:03:27.130> set<00:03:27.400> better<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:28.390> here's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
will and it's set better so here's

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.770 
will and it's set better so here's
another<00:03:28.959> piece<00:03:29.319> back<00:03:29.650> here<00:03:30.390> where<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.630> can

another piece back here where you can
see<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.140> difference<00:03:32.590> with<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.920> roots

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.850 

pull<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.130> down<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.520> wrap<00:03:36.670> it<00:03:36.850> now<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.860> few
