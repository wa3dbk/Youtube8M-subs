00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.750
 when designing b elsa we had to 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.430
 make sure the car can 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.500
 deal with problems like 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.779
 broken roads or 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.460
 extreme temperature is everything 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.160
 illusion characterize a range 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.539
 technical solutions in terms of 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.970
 road stability 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.360
 clearance is particularly suitable for driving in 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.830
 countries the most severe conditions 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.710
 car wheels are located 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.250
 maximum in the corners of the body that improves 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.050
 manageability and stability on the road 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.480
 when developing the body a lot of attention 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.059
 was given to the driver's seat 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.250
 our goal was to 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.020
 provide ease of driver access to 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.329
 vehicle controls and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.329
 remove aerodynamic noise 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.950
 strength has been improved by 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.070
 using threaded they are riveted 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:11.380
 connections for panel door parts 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.630
 devices and mudguards at dawn 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.350
 the project we worked with 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.700
 quality as much as from a team 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.590
 designers and assemblers 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.690
 the use of threaded fasteners gives 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.190
 more confidence in the strength of the car 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.509
 now wheel arches fenders 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:39.240
 have 14 attachment points and provide 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.240
 best protection from you until 10 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.620
 for countries with high risk of flooding 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.850
 roads special attention was paid 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.909
 air intake system engine 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.590
 traditional placement for headlights 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.410
 used by peugeot citroen 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.619
 has been changed and moved to level 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.259
 the location of the chevrons center married 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.360
 take the initial development we 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.179
 chose double door seals 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.550
 opening to prevent dust 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.230
 in the salon and protect the door mechanisms 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.140
 This room is a vehicle 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.239
 subject to swinging extra 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.640
 we do impact testing 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.730
 sunlight using the test 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.050
 stand we accelerate the wear process 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.180
 car we are testing on 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.489
 special closed areas our 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.080
 the goal is to bring out all 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.019
 car weaknesses 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.750
 still in the early design stage 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.550
 finally we do field tests 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.720
 to make sure that the transport 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.150
 suitable for use 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.930
 our clients in any climate 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.820
 conditions in this way using 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.320
 drivers from different countries we experience 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.680
 car with a harsh climate 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.049
 smoked and bad roads si elsa 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.060
 goes on sale driving 4 million 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.060
 kilometers on test trials
