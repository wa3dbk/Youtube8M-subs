that<00:01:55.439> advancements<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.549> made<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.590> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that advancements will be made in the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.330 
that advancements will be made in the
four<00:01:59.189> horses<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.680> bits<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.570> saddles<00:02:04.049> I

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
four horses in the bits in the saddles I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.740 
four horses in the bits in the saddles I
didn't<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.430> about<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.729> pads<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> pads

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
didn't think about the pads but the pads

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.190 
didn't think about the pads but the pads

the shoeing the dental work the
nutrition<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.239> this<00:02:12.239> is

nutrition and this is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.229 
nutrition and this is
mark<00:02:13.680> my<00:02:13.830> words<00:02:13.860> it's<00:02:14.340> already<00:02:14.640> happening<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
mark my words it's already happening and

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.690 
mark my words it's already happening and
people<00:02:15.299> are<00:02:15.989> making<00:02:16.920> advanced<00:02:17.430> there's<00:02:17.579> going

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
people are making advanced there's going

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.660 
people are making advanced there's going
to<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.790> more<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:19.019> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.890> what<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.489> me

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
to be more to but this is what to me

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.020 
to be more to but this is what to me
having<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.780> program<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.439> that<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:23.610> it's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
having a program is that it's it's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.509 
having a program is that it's it's
all-encompassing<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.829> how<00:02:26.459> you

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
all-encompassing it's not just how you

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.890 
all-encompassing it's not just how you
do<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.000> now<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.569> because<00:02:27.689> if

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
do this now you do that because if

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.300 
do this now you do that because if
you're<00:02:28.049> doing<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.560> right<00:02:28.709> thing<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.159> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
you're doing the right thing with the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.220 
you're doing the right thing with the
wrong<00:02:29.519> something<00:02:30.360> that's<00:02:30.480> actually<00:02:30.629> causing

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
wrong something that's actually causing

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.580 
wrong something that's actually causing
your<00:02:31.349> horse<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:32.670> feel<00:02:33.090> negative<00:02:33.599> about<00:02:33.690> you

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
your horse to to feel negative about you

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.080 
your horse to to feel negative about you
know<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.769> can't<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.340> because<00:02:35.489> my<00:02:35.730> shoulders

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
know I can't do it because my shoulders

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.569 
know I can't do it because my shoulders
can't<00:02:36.360> move<00:02:36.540> whatever<00:02:36.780> those<00:02:37.079> things<00:02:37.110> are

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
can't move whatever those things are

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.130 
can't move whatever those things are
then<00:02:38.579> it's<00:02:38.760> pretty<00:02:38.909> hard<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> advance<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.780> be

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
then it's pretty hard to advance to be

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.930 
then it's pretty hard to advance to be
progressive<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.799> there's<00:02:41.489> nothing<00:02:41.790> worse

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
progressive and there's nothing worse

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.220 
progressive and there's nothing worse
than<00:02:42.209> not<00:02:42.329> being<00:02:42.390> able<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.810> realize<00:02:43.049> your

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
than not being able to realize your

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.370 
than not being able to realize your
dream

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.600 

one<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.160> things<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.400> was<00:02:50.550> really

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
one of the things that was really

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.720 
one of the things that was really
important<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:52.170> designing<00:02:52.920> being<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.340> saddle

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
important in designing being a saddle

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.390 
important in designing being a saddle
was<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.510> had<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:55.020> great<00:02:55.830> deal<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.130> weight

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
was that it had a great deal of weight

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.310 
was that it had a great deal of weight
distribution<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.270> lot<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.900> English<00:02:58.170> saddles

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
distribution a lot of English saddles

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.490 
distribution a lot of English saddles
are<00:02:58.650> kind<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.060> narrow<00:03:00.060> behind<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:01.080> across

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
are kind of narrow behind like across

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.560 
are kind of narrow behind like across
the<00:03:01.680> width<00:03:01.830> here<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.060> try<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.330> have

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
the width here and so we try to have

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.540 
the width here and so we try to have
ours<00:03:03.780> come<00:03:04.080> out<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:04.350> much<00:03:04.590> as<00:03:04.650> possible<00:03:04.890> to

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
ours come out as much as possible to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.250 
ours come out as much as possible to
cover<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.970> much<00:03:06.090> surface<00:03:06.360> area<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.050> horse

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
cover as much surface area of the horse

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.650 
cover as much surface area of the horse
as<00:03:07.470> possible<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.150> greater<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
as possible because the greater the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.440 
as possible because the greater the
surface<00:03:10.380> area<00:03:10.710> you're<00:03:10.860> covering<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:14.280> more<00:03:14.550> it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
surface area you're covering the more it

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.840 
surface area you're covering the more it
helps<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.140> horse<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.500> support<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.520> writers

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
helps the horse to support the writers

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.170 
helps the horse to support the writers
wait<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.100> saddle<00:03:20.490> I<00:03:20.550> used<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.880> ride<00:03:21.030> my

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
wait this is a saddle I used to ride my

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.320 
wait this is a saddle I used to ride my
horse<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.600> many<00:03:22.110> years<00:03:22.260> ago<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:23.910> thought<00:03:24.210> it

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
horse in many years ago and I thought it

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.550 
horse in many years ago and I thought it
was<00:03:24.420> really<00:03:24.570> good<00:03:24.750> because<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.170> was<00:03:25.290> kind<00:03:25.500> of

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
was really good because it was kind of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.130 
was really good because it was kind of
quite<00:03:25.920> wide<00:03:26.160> at<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.490> front<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.570> back<00:03:27.600> is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
quite wide at the front but the back is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740 
quite wide at the front but the back is
very<00:03:28.500> narrow<00:03:29.040> here<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:30.030> can<00:03:30.180> see<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.420> it

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
very narrow here and you can see that it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.210 
very narrow here and you can see that it
pretty<00:03:30.990> much<00:03:31.170> fits<00:03:31.470> my<00:03:31.650> horse<00:03:31.860> at<00:03:32.010> rest

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
pretty much fits my horse at rest

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.280 
pretty much fits my horse at rest
because<00:03:32.490> when<00:03:32.640> he's<00:03:32.760> at<00:03:32.940> rest<00:03:33.300> his<00:03:33.900> back<00:03:34.260> is

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
because when he's at rest his back is

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.280 
because when he's at rest his back is
down<00:03:34.740> but<00:03:35.610> watch<00:03:35.790> what<00:03:35.820> happens<00:03:36.450> when<00:03:36.840> he

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
down but watch what happens when he

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.860 
down but watch what happens when he
starts<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.740> engage<00:03:38.100> his<00:03:38.370> back<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.660> I'm<00:03:39.750> just

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
starts to engage his back so I'm just

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.740 
starts to engage his back so I'm just
going<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.080> lift<00:03:40.200> him<00:03:40.440> here<00:03:41.300> can<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.360> see<00:03:42.420> how

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
going to lift him here can you see how

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.540 
going to lift him here can you see how
the<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.260> back<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.650> saddle<00:03:44.130> lift<00:03:44.310> up<00:03:44.520> now

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
the the back of that saddle lift up now

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.210 
the the back of that saddle lift up now
and<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.960> tells<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.560> all<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.950> pressure

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
and that tells you that all the pressure

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.160 
and that tells you that all the pressure
is<00:03:47.460> going<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.820> be<00:03:47.970> down<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.210> the<00:03:48.480> middle<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:49.020> his

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
is going to be down in the middle of his

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.720 
is going to be down in the middle of his
back<00:03:49.200> which<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.770> what<00:03:49.920> pushes<00:03:50.220> their<00:03:50.520> backs

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
back which is what pushes their backs

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.790 
back which is what pushes their backs
down<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.270> prevents<00:03:52.020> them<00:03:52.140> from<00:03:52.170> rounding<00:03:52.680> up

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
down and prevents them from rounding up

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.910 
down and prevents them from rounding up
now<00:03:53.490> I'll<00:03:53.670> show<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.300> difference<00:03:54.920> with

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
now I'll show you the difference with

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.100 
now I'll show you the difference with
our<00:03:56.070> saddle<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.700> saddle<00:03:57.030> does<00:03:57.210> not<00:03:57.420> fit<00:03:57.960> my

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
our saddle this saddle does not fit my

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.170 
our saddle this saddle does not fit my
horse<00:03:58.350> at<00:03:58.470> rest<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.370> fluidity<00:03:59.790> saddle

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
horse at rest this is a fluidity saddle

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.240 
horse at rest this is a fluidity saddle
you<00:04:00.750> can<00:04:00.900> see<00:04:01.080> that<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.380> way<00:04:01.710> low<00:04:02.070> in<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
you can see that it's way low in the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.360 
you can see that it's way low in the
front<00:04:02.460> almost<00:04:03.000> touching<00:04:03.360> his<00:04:03.510> withers<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.370> it

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
front almost touching his withers and it

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.370 
front almost touching his withers and it
kind<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.850> lifts<00:04:06.150> up<00:04:06.240> at<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.480> back<00:04:06.630> here<00:04:06.990> see

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
kind of lifts up at the back here see

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.210 
kind of lifts up at the back here see
that<00:04:07.550> so<00:04:08.550> what<00:04:08.820> I'm<00:04:08.910> going<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.090> do<00:04:09.330> is<00:04:10.100> prop<00:04:11.100> it

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
that so what I'm going to do is prop it

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.580 
that so what I'm going to do is prop it
up<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:11.880> shims<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.540> we'll<00:04:13.170> talk<00:04:13.290> about<00:04:13.440> how

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
up with shims and we'll talk about how

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.080 
up with shims and we'll talk about how
to<00:04:13.860> shimmy<00:04:14.100> horse<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.550> know<00:04:14.670> according<00:04:14.850> to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
to shimmy horse you know according to

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.210 
to shimmy horse you know according to
his<00:04:15.180> back<00:04:15.360> in<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> little<00:04:15.690> bit<00:04:15.780> but<00:04:16.770> here's<00:04:17.040> what

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
his back in a little bit but here's what

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.300 
his back in a little bit but here's what
happens<00:04:17.580> when<00:04:18.420> you<00:04:18.540> lift<00:04:18.750> this<00:04:18.930> up<00:04:19.190> with<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
happens when you lift this up with the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.240 
happens when you lift this up with the
shims<00:04:20.580> in<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:22.230> appropriate<00:04:22.500> place<00:04:22.740> like<00:04:23.130> my

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
shims in the appropriate place like my

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.700 
shims in the appropriate place like my
horse<00:04:23.460> needs<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.820> at<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:23.970> front<00:04:24.120> now<00:04:24.960> the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
horse needs it at the front now the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.160 
horse needs it at the front now the
saddle<00:04:26.190> sits<00:04:26.430> kind<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.850> level<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.390> him<00:04:27.930> and

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
saddle sits kind of level on him and

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.770 
saddle sits kind of level on him and
I've<00:04:28.800> got<00:04:29.040> plenty<00:04:29.580> of<00:04:29.730> room<00:04:30.030> under<00:04:30.300> here

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
I've got plenty of room under here

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.230 
I've got plenty of room under here
whereas<00:04:31.080> before<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.740> could<00:04:32.220> not<00:04:32.430> put<00:04:32.850> my<00:04:32.970> hand

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
whereas before I could not put my hand

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.000 
whereas before I could not put my hand
underneath<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.780> saddle<00:04:34.110> because<00:04:34.170> it<00:04:34.350> fitted

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
underneath the saddle because it fitted

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.330 
underneath the saddle because it fitted
perfectly<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:36.900> now<00:04:37.110> when<00:04:37.440> my<00:04:37.560> horse<00:04:37.800> list<00:04:38.160> is

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
perfectly so now when my horse list is

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.070 
perfectly so now when my horse list is
back<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:41.070> saddle<00:04:42.770> works<00:04:43.770> for<00:04:44.070> his<00:04:44.160> shape

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
back the saddle works for his shape

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.690 
back the saddle works for his shape
because<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.230> gives<00:04:46.440> through<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.010> part<00:04:47.340> here

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
because it gives through this part here

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.290 
because it gives through this part here
and<00:04:47.910> keeps<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.360> contact<00:04:49.730> equal<00:04:50.730> all<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.180> way

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
and keeps the contact equal all the way

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.570 
and keeps the contact equal all the way
through
