00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.539
 to be able to have such a beautiful challenge after such an exciting year 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.810
 I think that we vicente gelós blecua person responsible for the season 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.669
 that we always have that weight rest because I know that they will not overcome 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.290
 who won it on the track for a medal that belongs to everyone 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.010
 A year ago many acknowledgments of many pinoso acknowledgments where 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.360

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.590

 and for you part of the gratitude me and my respect and my admiration as 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 always fierce 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.550
 the Madrid community is fortunate to have a great tradition to 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.480
 basketball 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.270
 undoubtedly one of the most important sports in the world and one of those that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.840
 more triumphs our country has given 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.020
 is for me a great honor and a great satisfaction that madrid welcome the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.460
 European basketball championship in its thirty-fifth edition 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.730
 she also now happens 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.189
 the guma 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.420
 One thing is important that said José Luis Saez and is that they have a home 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.330
 European is at home this has a plus of responsibility 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.040
 I only throw you an advice that manages it is well that is to say without 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.860
 anxiety 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.230
 Your best ally is yourselves 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.850
 do not fall moss but vega is trust the famous phrase that there is no 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.399
 little enemy all have 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.880
 efe maria and I think that include from san good management 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.950
 from that lot of the city those millions of Spaniards who are 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.130
 pending of you 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.470
 they were tremendously satisfied 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.500
 because evidently when sabah sports results are sought but more 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.659
 beyond the result 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.020
 I believe that at the end eurobasket 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.890
 the psychological contract will continue to be maintained 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.109
 that the Spanish basketball team has 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.019
 not only with basketball fans but with the whole of the 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.019
 society 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.389
 make a special mention for Spanish basketball federation 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.469
 and in a very special way to its president 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.719
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.290
 the world of management managers per hundred in sports 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.260
 is something that in many times is subject posa a critical vision has arrived 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.150
 polemics in the end defoliation knows it very well when there is a good team 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.370
 directive is when you got the maximum results and I think I do not know 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.739
 because we have been working with the federation and its president for many years 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.849
 that you are also responsible through that rigorous and continuous work and that 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.209
 is bearing fruit in elections across all categories and from 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.370
 way post very significant in this selection you are getting that 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.379
 this sport in addition to getting this sponsorship from society itself 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.870
 be one of the most followed and most admired by all fans to the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.870
 dépor 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.989
 that we all take out we join with a lot of enthusiasm with much desire 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:45.369
 we are both ready to start 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:47.539
 one to one basic condition 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.269
 it's going to be hard to do disciplined and 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.730
 Now, no, that's what we're best for, to massa en san 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.349
 fernando 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.449
 eye the only two parties 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:01.369
 a by efe from the networks in Spain prevented to reach the championship because with 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.199
 base in terms of concentration and possible preparation 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.939
 stateless and you will go party to Chinese party despise anyone 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.409
 I grew up in the championship and giving way to little step 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.619
 neither do we 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:17.859
 p - we want to put on the podium directly because for a championship it is long with 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.620
 other countries very competitive 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.890
 ii we know that its name has sand for the army i 1 the pressure for the 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:25.889
 state 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.439
 therefore our part not the other rivals is properly seems that as 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.229
 in spain / world cup juan atilano houses for so many prisoners with 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.130
 very excited especially with a lot of desire to give a good show and and 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.680
