00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
however one interesting point to note is

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.290 
however one interesting point to note is
that<00:02:19.750> junior<00:02:20.230> art<00:02:20.500> Okun<00:02:20.860> didn't<00:02:21.819> want<00:02:22.090> the

Lord of the Rings to be a trilogy he
wrote<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.209> he<00:02:25.540> wanted<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.170> be

this as a trilogy I think junior art
Okun<00:02:33.940> was<00:02:34.600> right<00:02:34.930> yeah<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:36.040> book<00:02:36.310> would<00:02:36.550> be

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
Okun was right yeah that book would be

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.960 
Okun was right yeah that book would be
massive<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.810> would<00:02:38.170> be<00:02:38.410> quite<00:02:39.040> an<00:02:39.190> epic<00:02:39.580> task

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
massive it would be quite an epic task

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.110 
massive it would be quite an epic task
to<00:02:40.690> finish<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:42.430> imagine<00:02:42.880> when<00:02:43.030> you

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
to finish that but imagine when you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150 
to finish that but imagine when you
finish<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.480> imagine<00:02:44.140> while<00:02:44.440> you're<00:02:44.739> reading

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
finish it imagine while you're reading

finish it imagine while you're reading
it<00:02:45.280> you're<00:02:45.400> reading<00:02:45.940> an<00:02:46.090> entire<00:02:46.510> epic<00:02:47.140> journey

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
it you're reading an entire epic journey

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.550 
it you're reading an entire epic journey
you<00:02:47.860> are<00:02:48.010> reading<00:02:48.340> an<00:02:48.640> epic<00:02:49.300> idea<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.230> it's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
you are reading an epic idea and it's

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.530 
you are reading an epic idea and it's
better<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.040> way<00:02:51.430> it's<00:02:51.670> better<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.209> my

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
better that way it's better in my

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.479 
better that way it's better in my
opinion<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.080> if<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.500> have<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.739> good<00:02:54.069> idea

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
opinion that if you have a good idea

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.940 
opinion that if you have a good idea
keep<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.239> as<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.360> good<00:02:55.600> idea<00:02:55.720> keep<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.410> together

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
keep it as a good idea keep it together

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.460 
keep it as a good idea keep it together
why<00:02:57.130> do<00:02:57.190> so<00:02:57.670> many<00:02:57.880> authors<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.660> publishers

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
why do so many authors and publishers

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.160 
why do so many authors and publishers
feel<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.549> they<00:03:00.790> need<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.060> stretch<00:03:01.690> out<00:03:01.930> their

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
feel that they need to stretch out their

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.030 
feel that they need to stretch out their
ideas<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.950> mean<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.430> don't<00:03:04.239> want<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.569> say<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.040> but

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
ideas I mean I don't want to say it but

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.009 
ideas I mean I don't want to say it but
it's<00:03:06.190> probably<00:03:06.459> true<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.209> big<00:03:07.630> part<00:03:07.900> of

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
it's probably true that a big part of

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.319 
it's probably true that a big part of
this<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.500> publishers<00:03:09.459> thinking<00:03:09.940> though<00:03:10.120> I

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
this is publishers thinking though I

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.970 
this is publishers thinking though I
think<00:03:10.600> we<00:03:10.810> could<00:03:11.049> sell<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:11.739> we

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
think we could sell this I think we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.920 
think we could sell this I think we
could<00:03:12.130> sell<00:03:12.370> three<00:03:12.850> books<00:03:13.150> instead<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.750> just

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
could sell three books instead of just

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.900 
could sell three books instead of just
one<00:03:14.230> why<00:03:14.530> can't<00:03:14.829> we<00:03:15.010> have<00:03:15.220> bigger<00:03:15.519> books

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
one why can't we have bigger books

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.240 
one why can't we have bigger books
bigger<00:03:16.510> books<00:03:16.870> with<00:03:17.110> bigger<00:03:17.440> adventures<00:03:18.040> and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
bigger books with bigger adventures and

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.280 
bigger books with bigger adventures and
better<00:03:18.579> character<00:03:19.150> development<00:03:19.690> where<00:03:20.170> it's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
better character development where it's

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.930 
better character development where it's
not<00:03:20.500> choppy<00:03:20.950> because<00:03:21.370> you're<00:03:21.489> cutting<00:03:21.700> it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
not choppy because you're cutting it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.400 
not choppy because you're cutting it
into<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.180> bunch<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.540> books<00:03:22.840> where<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.079> just

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
into a bunch of books where you just

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.210 
into a bunch of books where you just
have<00:03:23.680> one<00:03:24.430> awesome<00:03:25.420> story<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.290> wish<00:03:26.620> that

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
have one awesome story I wish that

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.490 
have one awesome story I wish that
authors<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.090> publishers<00:03:28.690> would<00:03:28.930> stop<00:03:29.230> being

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
authors and publishers would stop being

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.250 
authors and publishers would stop being
so<00:03:29.920> conceited<00:03:30.579> would<00:03:31.269> start<00:03:31.630> being<00:03:31.959> more

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
so conceited would start being more

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.190 
so conceited would start being more
critical<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.340> would<00:03:33.489> start<00:03:33.790> cutting<00:03:34.600> out<00:03:34.840> all

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
critical and would start cutting out all

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.229 
critical and would start cutting out all
of<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.500> unnecessary<00:03:35.859> stuff<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:36.790> give<00:03:37.060> us

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
of the unnecessary stuff and give us

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.140 
of the unnecessary stuff and give us
actually<00:03:37.989> well<00:03:38.590> compacted<00:03:39.160> well<00:03:39.760> told

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
actually well compacted well told

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.360 
actually well compacted well told
stories<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.320> wish<00:03:41.590> they<00:03:41.769> would<00:03:41.950> realize<00:03:42.340> that

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
stories I wish they would realize that

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
stories I wish they would realize that
sometimes<00:03:43.060> it's<00:03:43.299> better<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.989> have<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.200> big<00:03:44.650> bang

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
sometimes it's better to have a big bang

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.599 
sometimes it's better to have a big bang
than<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.870> have<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.079> slow<00:03:47.620> simmer<00:03:48.280> I'll

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
than it is to have a slow simmer I'll

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.230 
than it is to have a slow simmer I'll
see<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:48.910> guys<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.209> my<00:03:49.239> next<00:03:49.390> video<00:03:49.690> bye
