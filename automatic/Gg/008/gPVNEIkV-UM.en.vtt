00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.390
 allocate 11 major muscle groups in 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.730
 body and I will now very quickly list 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.650
 all of them I will not be too much time 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.690
 give a name to specific muscles 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.639
 however i would like you to get 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.989
 idea of ​​where they are located 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.810
 in the body and so the arm is the leg and the body i will write down 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.750
 this is here 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.289
 so 11 groups, these three, that is, four 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.599
 in the hand 3 in the leg and 4 in the body 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.059
 know where these muscles are very 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 important because whenever you 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.410
 go to the gym or do 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.340
 load somewhere else is very important 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 stretch these muscle groups 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.110
 and also it is important to dwell on each of 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.690
 them and understand which ones are weak or 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.060
 strong and try to develop those who 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.310
 not balanced 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.890
 so the left and right sides are different 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.470
 by its strength and therefore very important 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.510
 understand where they are and now 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.930
 we will go through them very quickly 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.270
 so let's look at the beginning of the hand in 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.370
 early we have forearm and you can 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.770
 to see him best from the front and from above 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.810
 from him is biceps muscle 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.990
 about here it is yours 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.430
 biceps muscle and behind biceps muscle 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.460
 actually on the other side 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.040
 the triceps muscle is located here 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.010
 she she 2 chapters and triceps muscles 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.670
 located shoulder muscle draw it 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.710
 here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 you can see it from the front as well 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.330
 it's just easier for me to draw in the back 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.909
 here and so here are our four arm muscles a 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.640
 now let's go down to the foot i 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.100
 let's mark the quadriceps here 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.619
 our quadriceps is called 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.750
 4 chapters because it consists of 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.420
 four separate muscles working 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.070
 together and behind the quadriceps 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.039
 on the other side the quadriceps 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.080
 located biceps thigh muscle here 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.299
 this is your biceps thigh 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.520
 I want to highlight the biceps muscle 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.979
 hips because she performs great 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.899
 work and a lot of people forget it 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.580
 stretch and you may experience 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.429
 severe pain if you are not enough 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.319
 sprained biceps muscle below 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.080
 calf muscles are located 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.090
 That's how they look calf muscles 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.590
 located on the opposite side 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.440
 shin bones 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.010
 more tibia and fibula 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.470
 bones 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.959
 that's why on your front 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.600
 shins you only have a bone while 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.819
 there are a lot of muscles behind you 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.500
 there are three muscles of the lower limb 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.900
 and now let's consider the muscles 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.150
 hulls and so here you have let's 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.890
 first consider the front department and so 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.540
 here in the place where people 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.489
 they say they need cubes here 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.670
 the anterior abdominal muscles are located 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.549
 walls is a very important muscle group 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.739
 she is involved in lifting torso a higher 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.260
 chest is located here this 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.380
 rib cage 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.380
 shade it 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.939
 two muscles and similarly back also 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.069
 there are two muscles and these muscles are on the back 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.040
 let me paint them yellow 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.780
 are called trapezius muscles 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.760
 and the trapezium is shaped like 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.489
 flipped diamond something like 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.129
 this she helps us to keep the neck and 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.530
 upper back and then like 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.530
 you have two wings 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.069
 muscle or one muscle consisting of two 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.670
 parts 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.739
 called the latissimus dorsi she 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.980
 is a large wide muscle 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.959
 I will not portray her entirely as she 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.959
 would spread over the whole area 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.900
 your back and this is the main muscle of your 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.090
 backs 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.310
 so when people say they pulled 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.620
 back very often when it comes to 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.409
 lower back they mean 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.200
 the broadest muscle of the back and so we 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:51.500
 now shows the four muscles of the body 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.409
 if we count all together we 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.299
 get 11 muscle groups and so that 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.370
 repeat let's go over once again 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.769
 him very quickly so you have 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.680
 shoulder muscle biceps muscle 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.290
 forearm and triceps muscle in the leg 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.239
 we have quadriceps 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.489
 biceps thigh and calf muscles 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.290
 in the body of our body we have 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.000
 muscles of the anterior abdominal wall of the chest 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.190
 upper back cells 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.930
 trapezius muscle and lower division 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.340
 back and latissimus dorsi 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.340
 11 muscle groups
