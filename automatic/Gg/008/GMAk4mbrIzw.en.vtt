00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.359
 hello everyone will be so short today 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:11.799
 Announcement of upcoming tests on 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:17.039
 rope a very interesting knife to my 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:20.410
 a look called china wiki 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.560
 Well, maybe someone knows little but 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.250
 Generally very well-known firm jess again 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.449
 from the city of saki city ​​means this can 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:36.790
 positioned as a marching model 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:41.070
 the power of stalin blades ats-34 claimed 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:47.140
 hardness 60 60 units of about 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:52.510
 he looks like this 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:55.719
 from interesting material which 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.390
 called a firm wound but it is very similar 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.370
 so on elastron so soft so 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 plastic Well, not that soft and, as it were 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.570
 rubberized 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.950
 in principle, very confidently sits in 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:16.240
 hand means blade shape 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.370
 back tantu if not mistaken means 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.950
 here here was a new firm yes we will see 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:30.780
 fierce and made of steel grade ats-34 briefly 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.940
 run through the characteristics means 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:39.850
 full length is 218 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.580
 millimeters blade length about ten 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.650
 and a half I think and cutting length 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.700
 the edges 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.549
 10 centimeters 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.310
 so I would like to drive this knife 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.090
 on the rope 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.770
 descents concave dropping by eye and 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.350
 even now I will not talk about it 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.220
 before the tests on the rope as you can 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.750
 more detailed run here but 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.739
 I would like to drive him on the rope 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:15.790
 look at what he can do for. 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:20.440
 that's out of the box just like a knife came 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.330
 simply no complaints at all 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.530
 It means it comes with such leather 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.900
 sheath novelty I personally do not like 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.819
 would pistol him not just visually 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.239
 don't like really need pretty 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:40.510
 nevertheless sound means look here them 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:44.150
 thick rough skin 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.920
 it is clear that it is painted so the skin itself 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:53.230
 brown well everything is pretty 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.230
 well done here is written jessica 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.730
 fine 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.140
 then son the price of a knife is 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.920
 approximately in the region of 3,000 rubles 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.660
 depending on the seller on ebay 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.390
 well, it seems to me all the same this knife 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.870
 let not your categories even 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.570
 although in principle with some models 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.540
 mora knives I still think like that 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.570
 probably more or less competitors for 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.360
 least in your environment and for those 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.150
 conditions for which they are created but also in 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.360
 principle would be interesting means 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.420
 drive this one knife to see what 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.200
 he is capable but then as they say 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.340
 look at what can the mora 2000 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.860
 have do such small 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.490
 comparative tests 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.100
 first it will be a rope then I don't know 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.930
 is there any sense in the board probably in 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.790
 carton meaning they sweat it most likely 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.960
 will be a piece of wood well and we'll see 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.290
 which knives which of these knives 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.500
 better cope with the task 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.830
 actually like holding 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.220
 I like this knife a lot more 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.720
 than mora 2000 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.020
 the popular knife mora 2000 is all about it 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.760
 know everyone knows this knife well keep in 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:26.850
 hands from Jessica will learn more such 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.570
 sure first grip here is notch 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.530
 on the ear 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.750
 done by the way that's the thickness of the butt not 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.750
 noticed looked let's see 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.750
 means 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:49.449
 Well, in the region of three millimeters naturally 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:51.989
 with a narrowing of the tip from here you can generally 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:57.599
 read this video as an announcement 

00:04:51.989 --> 00:05:02.159
 I will buy a rope soon and forward 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:04.389
 let's see which of these knives 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.249
 will show the best results well I 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.849
 Naturally in advance more rubles for 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:13.749
 Jessica matter how well the plague naturally 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:18.240
 here she is not without reason I have already explained to them 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:18.240
 thank you all, bye
