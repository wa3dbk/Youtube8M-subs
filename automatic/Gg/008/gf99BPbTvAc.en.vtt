00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello, this is a new master class 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.160
 Now I will teach you to make flowers 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.610
 wreaths with wire and varnish 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.109
 ordinary nail polish to start 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.400
 to make a petal we need 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.560
 so then again i take a marker well here it is 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.640
 the wire on the marker and so here I twist 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.450
 from i will have one petal so you can 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 shape beautiful curved 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:40.890
 we cut off the excess with scissors so you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.350
 can twist either one petal in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.390
 or you can make different blanks here 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.530
 I already have 3 petals 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:57.149
 twisted or 5 pieces what you want 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.629
 next we take some kind of basis and this 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.780
 daddy and take nail polish can 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.880
 use different varnishes 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.820
 mix different colors to try 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.130
 add glitter as you like 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.270
 do you like it here i take varnish and put it on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.270
 to fail 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.600
 here a little, I took a little more now! 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.539
 I will type on a brush you over time 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.259
 learn how to try several times 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:38.880
 make a petal 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.770
 I took to help this one 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.479
 vase there you can 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.179
 decorative pebbles take anything 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.909
 it's just to make you comfortable and 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:53.220
 leaving dry is best left 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.439
 dry for about a day you see how 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.819
 they dry here like this 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.060
 flowers turn out 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.869
 next we take our flowers and start 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.709
 twist them together when you have 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.349
 many flowers done you will see how 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:13.340
 it works as executed see we 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.420
 take and seriously on the wire 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.420
 twist very simple 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.379
 the more flowers you have 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.319
 your work will be more interesting 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:35.110
 to the sky can also add if you 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:38.440
 have any beads on the trainer if u 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.390
 you have beads you can twist in 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.299
 same technique with wire 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.519
 we wind beads we add to ours 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.780
 colors it will look original 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.299
 and interesting if you want to make flowers 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.579
 with leaves you can also do 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.640
 just take the leaves green 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:02.739
 colors and you can also wind and 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.340
 add if you want to make a wreath 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.549

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.040
 take ready to comb 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:22.829
 they are inexpensive and screw flowers 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.380
