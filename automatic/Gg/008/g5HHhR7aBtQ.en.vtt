00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
cotton wash cycle we can scroll through

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
cotton wash cycle we can scroll through
to<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.160> mix<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.599> through<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> delicates

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
to a mix going up through the delicates

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.630 
to a mix going up through the delicates
and<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.650> change<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.219> select<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and actually change and select the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.910 
and actually change and select the
buttons<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.420> changed<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> temperature<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
buttons it changed the temperature and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310 
buttons it changed the temperature and
also<00:00:35.640> change<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> Keeler<00:00:36.600> capacity<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.140> well

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
also change the Keeler capacity as well

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.040 
also change the Keeler capacity as well
we've<00:00:38.100> got<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> time<00:00:38.610> remaining<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
we've got a time remaining on here and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
we've got a time remaining on here and
it<00:00:40.170> also<00:00:40.290> throws<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.920> what's<00:00:41.370> being<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:42.059> spin

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it also throws up what's being or spin

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.729 
it also throws up what's being or spin
speed<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.140> looking<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
speed we're going to be looking at and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
speed we're going to be looking at and
we<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.920> also<00:00:44.070> change<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.610> spin<00:00:45.030> speed<00:00:45.300> as

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we can also change that spin speed as

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.549 
we can also change that spin speed as
well<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.809> bring<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.379> down

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
well you can bring it up or down

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.840 
well you can bring it up or down
depending<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> style<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.700> you're

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
depending on the style that you're

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.700 
depending on the style that you're
looking<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.239> we're<00:00:48.930> looking<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.320> let's<00:00:49.530> say

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
looking at we're looking at let's say

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.150 
looking at we're looking at let's say
mix<00:00:50.219> wash<00:00:50.780> we're<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> press<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.710> 40

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
mix wash we're going to press that at 40

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.520 
mix wash we're going to press that at 40
degrees<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:54.239> says<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> 4<00:00:55.079> kilo<00:00:55.410> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
degrees it says that it's a 4 kilo so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.340 
degrees it says that it's a 4 kilo so
it's<00:00:55.680> half<00:00:55.860> load<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.000> throws<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.690> spin

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
it's half load it also throws up spin

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.840 
it's half load it also throws up spin
speed<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.039> actually<00:00:59.250> change<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
speed and you can actually change that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.520 
speed and you can actually change that
thing<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> cycle<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> you're<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
thing on the cycle that you're going to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.439 
thing on the cycle that you're going to
be<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.739> until<00:01:01.920> sure<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:02.730> long<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> cycle<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
be on until sure how long the cycle is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.020 
be on until sure how long the cycle is
going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:05.010> key<00:01:05.220> light<00:01:05.369> diversity<00:01:05.790> here

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
going to be the key light diversity here

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.120 
going to be the key light diversity here
when<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> start<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> load<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.710> puts<00:01:07.920> weight

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
when you start to load it it puts weight

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
when you start to load it it puts weight
in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> Machine<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> starts

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
in the Machine and you can see it starts

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.560 
in the Machine and you can see it starts
to<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.890> kilos<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.390> never

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to go up in kilos so you can never

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.320 
to go up in kilos so you can never
actually<00:01:12.810> overload<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> machine<00:01:14.180> inside<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
actually overload the machine inside the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.179 
actually overload the machine inside the
machine<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.170> staying<00:01:16.470> still<00:01:16.890> it's

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
machine here it's or staying still it's

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
machine here it's or staying still it's
a<00:01:17.250> glass<00:01:17.490> door<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.240> Machine<00:01:18.540> does<00:01:18.720> go<00:01:18.869> up

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
a glass door so the Machine does go up

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.510 
a glass door so the Machine does go up
to<00:01:19.170> 90<00:01:19.500> degrees<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.070> quite<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> high

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to 90 degrees so it's quite a high

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
to 90 degrees so it's quite a high
temperature<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.509> means<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.080> nice

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
temperature so that means it can be nice

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
temperature so that means it can be nice
and<00:01:22.290> cool<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.860> outside<00:01:23.390> stainless<00:01:24.390> steel

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and cool on the outside stainless steel

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.810 
and cool on the outside stainless steel
bowl<00:01:24.869> within<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.979> actual<00:01:26.250> machine<00:01:26.430> itself

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
bowl within the actual machine itself

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
bowl within the actual machine itself
it's<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.150> these<00:01:27.270> nice<00:01:27.420> big<00:01:27.659> deep<00:01:27.930> pedals<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it's got these nice big deep pedals so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's got these nice big deep pedals so
it<00:01:28.650> stops<00:01:28.920> everything<00:01:29.280> from<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.970> increased<00:01:30.390> up

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it stops everything from be increased up
