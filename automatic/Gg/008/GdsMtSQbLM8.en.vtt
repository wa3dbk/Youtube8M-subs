00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
and you see the less joy has been drawn

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.410 
and you see the less joy has been drawn
on<00:00:32.350> the<00:00:32.470> dream<00:00:32.770> number<00:00:33.310> one<00:00:33.550> okay

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
on the dream number one okay

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.540 
on the dream number one okay
we<00:00:34.570> are<00:00:34.720> number<00:00:34.900> one<00:00:35.080> we're<00:00:36.010> all<00:00:36.130> going<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:36.430> do

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
we are number one we're all going to do

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.790 
we are number one we're all going to do
that<00:00:36.790> as<00:00:37.420> I'm<00:00:37.720> going<00:00:37.840> to<00:00:37.930> select<00:00:38.110> frame<00:00:38.500> number

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
that as I'm going to select frame number

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.120 
that as I'm going to select frame number
two<00:00:39.040> and<00:00:39.820> insert<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.890> new<00:00:42.850> keyframe<00:00:43.120> so<00:00:44.130> that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
two and insert a new keyframe so that

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.950 
two and insert a new keyframe so that
means<00:00:45.340> my<00:00:45.520> animation<00:00:46.090> is<00:00:46.210> made<00:00:46.390> up<00:00:46.510> of<00:00:46.660> two

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
means my animation is made up of two

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.860 
means my animation is made up of two
different<00:00:46.989> drawings<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:49.059> on<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.450> second

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
different drawings so on the second

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.460 
different drawings so on the second
joint<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.980> then<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.160> use<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.550> eraser<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:52.470> get

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
joint and then you use the eraser to get

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.479 
joint and then you use the eraser to get
rid<00:00:53.680> of<00:00:53.710> all<00:00:53.950> these<00:00:54.730> arms<00:00:55.360> here<00:00:57.630> so<00:00:59.250> pink<00:01:00.250> blush

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
rid of all these arms here so pink blush

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.630 
rid of all these arms here so pink blush
to<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:01.150> to<00:01:01.420> finish<00:01:01.690> off<00:01:01.870> his<00:01:02.800> arms<00:01:03.220> in<00:01:03.370> a

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
to and to finish off his arms in a

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.100 
to and to finish off his arms in a
different<00:01:04.269> position<00:01:05.190> okay<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.550> I<00:01:06.930> grab<00:01:07.930> this

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
different position okay so I grab this

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.070 
different position okay so I grab this
little<00:01:08.350> red<00:01:08.620> Slater<00:01:08.980> on<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.460> timeline<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:10.510> can

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
little red Slater on the timeline I can

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.490 
little red Slater on the timeline I can
view<00:01:11.500> with<00:01:11.890> two<00:01:12.100> frames<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.670> animation<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.260> I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
view with two frames of animation and I

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.310 
view with two frames of animation and I
can<00:01:14.650> play<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.860> animation<00:01:15.190> like<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.170> get

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
can play the animation like I'm you get

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.380 
can play the animation like I'm you get
this<00:01:17.470> kind<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.830> motion<00:01:18.190> like<00:01:18.400> that<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.909> can<00:01:19.270> also

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
this kind of motion like that I can also

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.390 
this kind of motion like that I can also
test<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.960> animation<00:01:20.290> are<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.159> choosing

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
test the animation are you choosing

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.870 
test the animation are you choosing
control<00:01:22.090> test<00:01:22.780> movie<00:01:22.960> in<00:01:23.640> Flash<00:01:24.640> Professional

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
control test movie in Flash Professional

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.560 
control test movie in Flash Professional
and<00:01:25.620> you'll<00:01:26.620> see<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.909> kind<00:01:28.120> of<00:01:28.210> flickering

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
and you'll see it's kind of flickering

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.740 
and you'll see it's kind of flickering
our<00:01:28.960> motion<00:01:29.800> here<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.670> that's<00:01:30.880> just<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.360> bit<00:01:31.479> too

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
our motion here so that's just a bit too

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.690 
our motion here so that's just a bit too
fast<00:01:32.080> so<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.590> want<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.830> slow<00:01:33.040> this<00:01:33.250> animation

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
fast so I want to slow this animation

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.510 
fast so I want to slow this animation
down<00:01:34.060> way<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.770> do<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.070> we<00:01:36.400> can

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
down way of that and to do that we can

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.400 
down way of that and to do that we can
insert<00:01:36.940> some<00:01:36.970> extra<00:01:37.690> frames<00:01:37.960> into<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
insert some extra frames into the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.920 
insert some extra frames into the
animation<00:01:38.800> more<00:01:39.700> frames<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.240> are<00:01:40.300> the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
animation more frames that are the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.990 
animation more frames that are the
school<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.410> animation<00:01:41.950> will<00:01:42.100> be<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.940> I'm

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
school of the animation will be so I'm

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.630 
school of the animation will be so I'm
gonna<00:01:43.150> select<00:01:43.330> frame<00:01:43.750> number<00:01:44.110> one<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.430> then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
gonna select frame number one and then

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.710 
gonna select frame number one and then
go<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.940> insert<00:01:46.650> timeline<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:48.280> free<00:01:49.060> now<00:01:49.690> you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
go to insert timeline and free now you

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.110 
go to insert timeline and free now you
see<00:01:50.080> there's<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.470> shortcut<00:01:50.770> key<00:01:51.160> f5<00:01:51.460> and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
see there's a shortcut key f5 and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.530 
see there's a shortcut key f5 and
keyboard<00:01:52.570> does<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.590> same<00:01:53.800> thing<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:55.360> I'm

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
keyboard does the same thing now I'm

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.240 
keyboard does the same thing now I'm
gonna<00:01:55.930> do<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.140> same<00:01:56.410> with<00:01:56.470> frame<00:01:56.950> number

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
gonna do the same with frame number

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.560 
gonna do the same with frame number
three<00:01:57.490> it's<00:01:57.820> light<00:01:58.060> up<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.630> served<00:01:59.200> time<00:02:00.570> y3

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
three it's light up and served time y3

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.330 
three it's light up and served time y3
and<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.500> will<00:02:02.650> slow<00:02:02.890> down<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.130> animation

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
and that will slow down the animation

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.750 
and that will slow down the animation
because<00:02:04.330> donors<00:02:04.870> for<00:02:05.170> dreams<00:02:05.980> of<00:02:06.190> animation

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
because donors for dreams of animation

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.999 
because donors for dreams of animation
instead<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.630> two

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
instead of two

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.390 
instead of two
so<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.729> will<00:02:09.819> be<00:02:09.940> off<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.929> boxed<00:02:11.409> test<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
so that will be off this boxed test the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.030 
so that will be off this boxed test the
movie<00:02:12.519> again<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.379> that<00:02:14.379> slow<00:02:14.650> down<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
movie again and that slow down the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.000 
movie again and that slow down the
animation<00:02:15.159> played<00:02:15.909> considerable<00:02:16.769> now<00:02:17.769> for

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
animation played considerable now for
