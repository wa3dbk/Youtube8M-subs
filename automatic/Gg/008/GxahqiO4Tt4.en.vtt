00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.580
 bye ladies gentlemen and ladies vincent m welcome to the dm news and uneven 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.140
 with the door to fall in house and we a nice announcement 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.789
 names 4 comes out on August 23rd 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.909
 linked to this stated the creators of the game 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.939
 and as you can see on that screen NATO then it already looks pretty cool 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.960
 but the collision is four areas that have been fruit to cd since that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.149
 namely, the mere they come in and as is to know a strip it is always 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.010
 A bit of a strange game has always been over the top eczema 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.920
 but with a large share you also have to beat the villages around zombies 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.150
 kill at the television must work it's unbelievable how weird how 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.680
 simple 3 that has confirmed 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.510
 DSB was incredibly cool so I really didn't wait for 4 and late signs 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.950
 are all watching this to parents jerry lee what they have announced so 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.859
 to release the first images according to a strip of the celebrates 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.300
 9 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.470
 it is certainly not childish in the meantime it is always one 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.899
 deep striker certainly not 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.980
 we are going to get something new namely the us and the four-wheelers one 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.889
 video game and it will rely on the first five parts we all know that 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:24.470
 claims that are based on films often do not do very well 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.980
 We often play an incredibly bad shame later hope that this one 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.600
 game 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.839
 that has not 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.960
 it is always something exciting, the mix between maybe gives yes and 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.599
 not for speed or something 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.739
 yes I say something or burn out maybe also a very nice recommendation but 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.519
 I have that it is not I want to leave monotonous that there is also more to it 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.239
 than a medical one and that is of course the intention 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.469
 of such a thing 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.469
 to make it nice and innovative and fears Alanya 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.889
 9 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.230
 our last item 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.200
 is about five choking finds offer more than ten days this game comes in 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.860
 stores 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.670
 and I didn't really have to wait until this game was already in my hands 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.679
 ends up 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.770
 therefore, and the makers have 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.269
 small video brought online 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.389
 small video 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.389
 we will now look at thirty seconds 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.040
 Closing the collapse but scattering says people listen like you 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.949
 dycker and fiction it from this game 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.150
 the playfulness does not get rid of it under water but from leaks in the air 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.270
 an entire city 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.270
 what path 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.909
 some lit up some 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.240
 I said that it is also to fix the buildings 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.849
 but because of those those buildings stay up 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.410
 this game offers 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.869
 so the violin exciting 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.869
 it is not only if you have to but it is also a bit and then only 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.399
 it is also just actually 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:14.819
 action voltage 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:15.920
 you come in 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.419
 certain areas rightly so but you think of it 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.720
 what should i do now it is incredible 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.720
 I want to play before this time 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.300
 the doors are open again this week 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.340
 cool videos uploaded to a performance 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.380
 and of course it is important that we do not dwell on that 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.750
 namely the spotlight from jasper about i have a few tons of line and and strategies 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.830
 by-molding 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.880
 so no map how to use but just nice 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.949
 Being able to play issue is also easily answered there 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.259
 check it in the video we of course have a battle song from kingdom 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.229
 linda from maikel made 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.120
 this year eighty a song 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.199
 and what is about the children 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.090
 how can lead 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.620
 also here we have not, we look reasonably recovered but it also 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.190
 great to know we also agree 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.100
 check five because it contains all the games in the picture 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.400
 marketing 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.830
 the viewer interview of milk is such a let see a number and also no members their 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.020
 a little bit the four come to sabotage 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.719
 always nice to watch 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.690
 m yes it was this week so check those videos of sailing incredibly 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.099
 and then we will start again next week 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.729
 the number of fish new videos so think carefully subscribe to and lg and 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.729
 it'll be fine I'll see you leave 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.330
 3i group 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
 it we sing 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.469
 i think i am 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:51.960
 it's simple 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.639
 about this
