00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.419
 go every day and at that moment in 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.399

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.729
 groups that many people do not have access to 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.030

 draw is solely and exclusively for 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.260
 people who love pokemon and 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.730
 also that you like super smash bros 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.709
 it does not matter if you like new one of 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.030
 the two games but the condition is that 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.440
 if you do not like any of those two 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.690
 games friends I do not know what you do in this 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.000
 video I think you missed or did not know 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.799
 you saw a video by mistake but 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.629
 You can close this window because this 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.340
 video is not for you depending on 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.920
 how many people participate in this 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.810
 video may increase the number of 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.660
 cards that I will give a maximum of 2 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.870
 and 2 or 2 is done for the first dynamic 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.950
 and another 2 for the next 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.200
 requirements to earn the second 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.109
 card the second card is a bit 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.180
 easier to win I think which is the 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.090
 card is going to be given to the person who 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.430
 most have supported the channel in all this 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.590
 time how will I know this very easy 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.319
 in my control panel of my channel 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.599
 youtube , I have access to see what the 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.060
 interaction between you in the videos 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.010
 so I can go in and see and tell me the 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.930
 participation that each person has 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.120
 that right now the one that is heading the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.709
 participation list is the beautiful one is 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.230
 koizumi time which does not surprise me 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.450
 because I always see a enjoys a comment 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.849
 in each video he always leaves his beautiful and 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.040
 nice like besides sharing every 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.750
 video of the channel so that's why I do not 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.090
 they surprise absolutely nothing that she 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.250
 top the list can still a 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.470
 person overcome their participation if 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.870
 Of course I can see it very difficult but 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.480
 if you still can the draw will be the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.250

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.750
 I give them the date once because if not 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.700

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.129
