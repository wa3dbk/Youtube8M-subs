 Those of you who are bored are going to 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.460
 start by picking up a jar and going to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.040
 put inside a plastic bag or 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.640
 hermetic or that can close well 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.070

 Like the proportions 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.370
 we closed the bag with this alam shine 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.770
 leaving it hermetically closed and 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.530
 we proceed to introduce the small bag 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.230
 in a large bag we will fill the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.780
 large bag with ice cubes a 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.960
 heap of ice cubes to the ice 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.850
 let's take plenty of salt this is what 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.860

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.260
 that the salt on the ice has a 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.040
 effect as well as the superhero and makes 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.440

 mixing little by little giving it a 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.440
 little spin so that it is done in 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.760
 the water and the chocolate that we had 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.420
