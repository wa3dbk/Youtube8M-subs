like that you know with this the rim on
the<00:00:27.460> that's<00:00:28.460> way<00:00:28.760> that<00:00:29.029> I<00:00:31.840> love<00:00:32.840> all<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.140> buck

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:21.350 

just<00:00:59.609> all<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> creases<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.700 

that's<00:01:22.360> how<00:01:22.510> you<00:01:22.540> draw<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.840> quick<00:01:23.080> which<00:01:23.470> is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
that's how you draw a quick which is

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.050 
that's how you draw a quick which is
half<00:01:23.920> what<00:01:24.160> other<00:01:24.460> hats<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.810> might<00:01:26.110> be<00:01:27.060> my

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
half what other hats there might be my

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.800 
half what other hats there might be my
calves<00:01:28.330> folded<00:01:28.900> over<00:01:29.760> you<00:01:30.760> know<00:01:30.910> like<00:01:31.210> top<00:01:31.510> to

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
calves folded over you know like top to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.530 
calves folded over you know like top to
it<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:33.250> will<00:01:33.370> stand<00:01:33.700> out<00:01:33.880> like<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.240> but

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
it so it will stand out like that but

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.790 
it so it will stand out like that but
then<00:01:34.750> it's<00:01:34.990> just<00:01:35.290> crumpled<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.300> until<00:01:37.300> weird

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
then it's just crumpled to until weird

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.360 
then it's just crumpled to until weird
almost<00:01:38.800> I<00:01:39.840> don't<00:01:40.840> know<00:01:41.020> Michael<00:01:41.710> visits<00:01:42.100> hat

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
almost I don't know Michael visits hat

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.470 
almost I don't know Michael visits hat
or<00:01:42.850> something<00:01:43.090> like<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.030> bum<00:01:46.330> hole

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
or something like that what a bum hole

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.310 
or something like that what a bum hole
like<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.160> so<00:01:48.520> similar<00:01:48.940> to<00:01:49.320> in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
like that which is so similar to in

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.070 
like that which is so similar to in
other<00:01:50.500> way<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:50.830> can<00:01:51.130> draw<00:01:51.430> them<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:52.780> you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
other way you can draw them like you

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.820 
other way you can draw them like you
know<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:56.110> just<00:01:56.170> will<00:01:56.500> be<00:01:56.620> more

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
know that so it just will be more

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:40.720 
know that so it just will be more
creases<00:01:57.160> their<00:01:57.990> drums<00:01:58.990> this<00:01:59.290> air

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.119 

yeah<00:02:41.300> sighs<00:02:41.780> similar<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:42.709> there's<00:02:42.920> two

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
yeah sighs similar so there's two

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.880 
yeah sighs similar so there's two
possible<00:02:43.550> ways<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.970> can<00:02:44.150> draw<00:02:44.390> which<00:02:44.659> hat<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
possible ways you can draw which hat the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.080 
possible ways you can draw which hat the
quite<00:02:46.129> straightforward<00:02:46.790> early<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:48.340> yeah<00:02:49.340> then

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
quite straightforward early so yeah then

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.850 
quite straightforward early so yeah then
the<00:02:50.209> next<00:02:50.360> lot<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.690> videos<00:02:50.959> on<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.230> try<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.680> draw

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
the next lot of videos on a try and draw

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.740 
the next lot of videos on a try and draw
which<00:02:52.930> idea<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.239> just<00:02:56.269> get<00:02:56.510> an<00:02:56.599> addy

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
which idea so you can just get an addy

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.710 
which idea so you can just get an addy
able<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.230> draw<00:02:57.440> proper<00:02:57.950> witch<00:02:58.599> wearing<00:02:59.599> these

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720
