inches of why travel this machine is in
great<00:00:42.390> shape

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.750 

we'll<00:00:56.960> go<00:00:57.170> through<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.620> calibration<00:00:58.520> process

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
we'll go through the calibration process

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:08.719 
we'll go through the calibration process
and<00:00:59.860> also<00:01:00.860> run<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.130> short<00:01:01.460> program

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 

so<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.840> machine<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.439> the
