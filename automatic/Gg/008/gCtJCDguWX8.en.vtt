London Marathon 1982 still my personal
best<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.030> 209<00:02:21.560> 24<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.769> don't<00:02:22.980> think<00:02:23.100> that's

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
best on 209 24 and I don't think that's

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640 
best on 209 24 and I don't think that's
going<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.519> prove<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.060> really<00:02:24.720> challenging<00:02:25.019> one

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
going to prove a really challenging one

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.590 
going to prove a really challenging one
because<00:02:26.190> if<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:26.430> about<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.940> even<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
because if you think about it even the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.350 
because if you think about it even the
seaside<00:02:28.079> so<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.829> wind<00:02:29.070> gets<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.579> we<00:02:30.060> get<00:02:30.209> some

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
seaside so the wind gets up we get some

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.150 
seaside so the wind gets up we get some
storms<00:02:30.870> coming<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.380> they'll<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.890> battle

it's<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> little<00:02:38.250> bit<00:02:38.370> tough<00:02:38.579> in<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> first

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
it's a little bit tough in the first

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.340 
it's a little bit tough in the first
mile<00:02:39.269> but<00:02:39.450> that's<00:02:39.570> probably<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> best<00:02:40.170> place

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
mile but that's probably the best place

to have have the challenge and then
around<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.650> 10<00:02:43.920> mile<00:02:44.100> point<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.610> up<00:02:44.910> and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
around the 10 mile point it's up and

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.940 
around the 10 mile point it's up and
down<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.269> little<00:02:45.510> bit<00:02:45.720> thus<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.260> great<00:02:46.620> beauty

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
down a little bit thus the great beauty
