00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
 this vehicle is exclusively intended for 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.470
 work on highway and expressway 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.910
 so the peculiarity it is equipped with a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.320
 variable message sign that we 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.179
 allows to communicate with users 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.299
 of the road 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.359
 it is equipped with two lights 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.609
 splinters behind generation to the one of a 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.859
 new generation of beacons which 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.400
 khaled turning is also at the front 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.800
 of the vehicle 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.970
 so we're also equipped with lights to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.380
 splinters at the base of the windshield 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.240
 which allows us to actually be 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.790
 visible during an interception ticket 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.649
 especially this Saturday morning he over on 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.969
 the highway a10 the flow of cars do not 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.520
 makes that increase in this day two 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.230
 first departures on vacation 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.750
 so here we will go to position ourselves in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.800
 a safe place for us we go 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.390
 carry out a speed control 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.770
 so here we work in this direction two 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.930
 that is to say the people who are going to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.579
 to go to paris 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 a sporty vehicle capable of reaching 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.989
 the 250 km time 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.570
 the goal to intervene as quickly as possible for 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.039
 stop the offense quickly on 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.359
 works exclusively at speed 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.219
 that's it but we can also work on it 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.600
 as part of a more general 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.670
 in flow control ie 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.020
 that even in the flow of traffic 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.909
 we can also note 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.049
 offenses that just people who 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.670
 will overtake by the right 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.159
 the people who will be going on the track 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.140
 left permanently with this radar 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.000
 called speedmeter the gendarmes can 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.040
 control cars over 800 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.409
 meters from their positions what 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.350
 interests speeds above 160 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.400
 kilometers / hour we go 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.630
 we lift series 3 cut the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.159
 patrollers take the road in 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.100
 their line of sight a German car 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.990
 controlled at 161 km time in a few 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.670
 seconds he positions himself alongside the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.780
 vehicle 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.580
 so here I'm going to operate the panel at 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.549
 variable messages and I'm going to ask 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.200
 the driver of our pipes in a 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.240
 secure place patrollers have 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.549
 stopped the car the driver is a 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.649
 emergency doctor who has just finished 36 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.670
 guard hours 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.740
 161 kilometers an hour is a speed 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.330
 recorded to which we apply 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.100
 a tolerance since it is intended as 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.550
 that by the law what makes a speed 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.259
 deduction of 152 km time ok so the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.909
 voracious and as part of a fine of 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.060
 fourth category ie 90 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.350
 euros laments lump sum minus and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.780
 you can lose points on your 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.819
 driving license in the vehicle 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.019
 the second gendarme between the data on 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.120
 a computer terminal 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.440
 my colleague is checking to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.319
 using the on-board computer terminal 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.540
 the validity of the driving license 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.290
 the situation of the vehicle is also 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.120
 if it is about 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.829
 a wanted person here is actually one 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.959
 query multiple files this is done 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.300
 so that's to know so if it's a 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.640
 stolen vehicle or not and 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.930
 the driver's license file in 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.970
 a week this driver is going 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.770
 receive his offense by mail 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.180
 gendarmes resume their journey in 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.380
 the unity of saint-arnoult-en-yvelines they 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.570
 are three to be trained at this 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.130
 fast driving in a morning they 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.220
 have verbalized three big excesses of 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.220
 speed
