00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
because otherwise girlfriend will be

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.379 
because otherwise girlfriend will be
able<00:05:30.849> to<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.389> hold<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.810> game<00:05:32.020> so<00:05:32.800> that<00:05:33.250> in<00:05:33.460> the

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
able to to hold the game so that in the

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.120 
able to to hold the game so that in the
following<00:05:34.810> sequences<00:05:35.440> there<00:05:35.710> are<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.889> lot<00:05:36.099> of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
following sequences there are a lot of

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.439 
following sequences there are a lot of
situations<00:05:36.849> where<00:05:37.599> an<00:05:38.440> art<00:05:38.710> could<00:05:39.300> trade<00:05:40.300> the

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
situations where an art could trade the

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.700 
situations where an art could trade the
bishop<00:05:40.810> but<00:05:42.750> but<00:05:43.750> where<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.080> timing<00:05:44.469> is<00:05:44.560> not

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
bishop but but where the timing is not

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.770 
bishop but but where the timing is not
right<00:05:46.530> here<00:05:47.530> for<00:05:47.680> example<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:48.759> 90<00:05:49.090> a<00:05:49.330> foreign

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
right here for example so 90 a foreign

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.100 
right here for example so 90 a foreign
state<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.490> of<00:05:51.490> course<00:05:52.090> rooks<00:05:52.360> should<00:05:52.750> not<00:05:52.960> be

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
state and of course rooks should not be

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.089 
state and of course rooks should not be
traded<00:05:53.560> at<00:05:53.740> any<00:05:55.469> condition<00:05:56.469> on<00:05:56.590> under<00:05:56.919> any

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
traded at any condition on under any

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.540 
traded at any condition on under any
conditions<00:05:59.069> but<00:06:00.069> now<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.460> seems<00:06:00.630> that<00:06:01.630> and

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
conditions but now it seems that and

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.990 
conditions but now it seems that and
here<00:06:03.550> again<00:06:04.080> now<00:06:05.080> comes<00:06:05.380> this<00:06:05.699> trade<00:06:06.699> here

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
here again now comes this trade here

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.520 
here again now comes this trade here
because<00:06:07.900> after<00:06:08.650> Luke<00:06:08.830> takes<00:06:09.099> then<00:06:09.490> King<00:06:09.940> b6
