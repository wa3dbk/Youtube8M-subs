00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.389
 I am persecuted is indisputably a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.389
 lethal 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.059
 but it's just one of the many 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.860
 wild canine species of the world that 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.990
 for his ability to hunt in such days 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.990
 it became a butcher's icon 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.250
 these are runner dogs bringing 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.250
 I get death in quantities 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.510
 It comes in many shapes and colors 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.520
 but what they have in common is in their 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.520
 big skulls and complex brains 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 i 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.360
 and big brains require a lot 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.210
 education 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.370
 and the wild dogs that live in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.940
 Packs are extremely dedicated to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.940
 your puppies 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.710
 as in the wolves, each pack is 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.470
 led by a couple and usually 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.150
 a unique one that pairs but all 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.620
 members of the pack help in the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:10.160
 feeding and educating 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:12.080
 puppies this may be because the 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.280
 level of prolactin a hormone that 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.710
 is found in nursing mothers 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.440
 rise in all the members of the pack 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.780
 males and females urging them to nourish 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.110
 at least this seems to be the case 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.110
 Wolves 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.689
 the game helps the puppies to 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.759
 strengthen members and develop 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.680
 coordination things that they will need to 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.680
 be physically effective in the house 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.290
 often parents and siblings 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.790
 older wild dogs bring to 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.070
 house live animals for puppies 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.400
 so that they practice their abilities of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.400
 hunting 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.880
 but the game also teaches them 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.070
 important social lessons 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.420
 helping them understand their place inside 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.420
 from the pack hierarchy 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.490
 It is a long period of growth and 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.670
 scenes of growing puppies are 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.920
 universally moving 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.800
 but all this family bond has a 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.840
 mortal end what is being done is a 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.030
 extraordinary killer who knows his 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.380
 place and its purpose in the machinery 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.380
 lethal of the hunt 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.659
 in southern Africa a river called 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.750
 okavango meanders through the desert of 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.750
 kalahari 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.379
 creating a huge delta 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.519
 and an extraordinary and almost intact 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.519
 haven for wildlife 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.800
 here inhabits one of the most predatory 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.800
 colorful of the world 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.319
 like most wild sailors 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.100
 a threat has also been cataloged 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.930
 something perverse 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.930
 a stain on the landscape 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.680
 his Latin name is stroke injury what 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.680
 means painted wolf 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.160
 It's not a wolf but colorful strawberry luce 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.870
 a spectacular coat itself 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.870
 cinnamon and chestnut 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.990
 no other wild road exhibits marks 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.400
 so obvious the majority gets confused with 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.380
 the surroundings 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.380
 The African wild dog stands out 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.730
 these dogs differ from others 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.800
 ways maybe they are the warm wild 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.450
 most sociable of all the wild dog 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.130
 Africa is known for taking care of 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.890
 wounded or sick members of the pack 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.990
 and every male and female member alike 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.990
 helps attract food for puppies 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.780
 the pack is led by a couple 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.230
 alpha that tends to remain monogamous 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.230
 for life 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.000
 they run a large family that can 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.710
 reach 30 or 40 individuals all 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.710
 closely linked to the group 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.260
 the hunt begins with a ritual form 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.130
 hoisted while the alpha male gathers 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.460
 troops 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.650
 then late 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.910
 about the size of the German shepherd 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.229
 in adulthood 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.600
 the wild dog has several 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.199
 distinctive characteristics witnesses of 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.199
 his lineage 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.939
 his middle fingers merged well 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.289
 that only have 4 in each leg also 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.729
 they have strong clavicles that 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.479
 disappeared in most of the 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.479
 modern dogs 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.320
 their strange marks very different from the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.699
 of other wild dogs maybe they are 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.990
 related to their need for 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.990
 cooperate while they tire 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.100
 apparently they should recognize and follow the 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.830
 trace of each far in the plains 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.420
 open and their boats without equal are 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.660
 as distinctive as the footprints 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.660
 digital 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.610
 the bed is a kind of antelope flees 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.270
 in front of the well-coordinated pack 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.520
 adapted to live in conditions 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.230
 marshy delta okavango the 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.360
 niche moves with speed and 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.360
 amazing thanks through the water 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.790
 but the dogs are relentless and they come out 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.790
 victorious 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.199
 it's time to bring the bacon home in 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.600
 this case the alpha female is raising 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.360
 two litters his and one that 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.729
 confiscated a subordinate female and 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.080
 feeding all these puppies is a 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.080
 full-time work 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.430
 has 14 nipples a record in the world 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.040
 canine emulated only by a small dog 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.700
 wild on top of the world the fox 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.700
 of the Arctic 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.020
 the alpha female demands to be fed and a 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.590
 hunter returns regurgitated a mouthful 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.590
 helpfully 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.550
 the wild dog is the ultimate hunter 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.650
 long-distance canine from africa 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.210
 in the open plains of serengeti 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.220
 where dogs attack companies so 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.680
 great as the 'new patience 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.550
 Resistance and cooperation are hallmarks of 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.550
 their ways of killing 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.870
 teamwork is required to 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.610
 knock down an animal so big that's why 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.500
 some wild dogs will try 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.510
 Attacking the animal from behind while 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.510
 others will do it for the sensitive nose 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.919
 some more will pounce on the 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.110
 belly of the animal trying to gut 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.430
 what is this is perhaps one of the reasons 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.020
 why the wild dog has been 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.479
 cataloged as a murderer and a 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.310
 abomination but it is not designed to 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.719
 suffocate his victim in the way 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.719
 it would make a big feline 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.180
 and once the prey is dead the 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.130
 dogs are very ordered to eat not 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.990
 there is no fight for the corpse the 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.330
 pack of painted wolves is a very group 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:29.070
 united each member knows his place in the 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.070
 food chain since he's a puppy 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:37.229
 with the African wild dog all for 

00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:41.209
 one and one for all is just another way 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:41.209
 to be designed to kill 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.280
 with a style
