couple parts of it I'm going to assume

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.190 
couple parts of it I'm going to assume
that<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.850> know<00:01:57.880> how<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.420> download<00:01:59.409> the<00:02:00.180> theme

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
onto your computer and when you do that

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.840 
onto your computer and when you do that
it's<00:02:05.979> going<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.280> ask<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:06.909> where<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.630> save<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:07.960> I

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
it's going to ask you where to save it I

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.080 
it's going to ask you where to save it I
always<00:02:09.850> save<00:02:10.300> my<00:02:10.750> themes<00:02:11.710> or<00:02:12.490> things<00:02:12.940> like

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
always save my themes or things like

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.130 
always save my themes or things like
that<00:02:13.380> directly<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> desktop

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
that directly to the desktop

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.830 
that directly to the desktop
then<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:17.040> move<00:02:17.310> them<00:02:17.610> wherever<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.180> want<00:02:18.569> to

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
then I can move them wherever I want to

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.250 
then I can move them wherever I want to
move<00:02:19.140> them<00:02:19.350> whenever<00:02:20.250> I'm<00:02:21.020> putting<00:02:22.020> things

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
move them whenever I'm putting things

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.559 
move them whenever I'm putting things
were<00:02:22.590> they<00:02:22.800> where<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.790> they<00:02:24.030> should<00:02:24.300> go

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
were they where I think they should go

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.559 
were they where I think they should go
so<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.230> find<00:02:25.709> them<00:02:25.920> later<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:27.300> first

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
so I can find them later but but first

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.630 
so I can find them later but but first
off<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.110> want<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.350> download<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.160> your

desktop that's just a rule that I use

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.070 
desktop that's just a rule that I use
