00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.799
 great friends with this family walker 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.330
 if you are sitting there and you are 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.429
 listening to this for the first time 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.769
 I just want to tell you a little bit about 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.900
 My name is Mario Triminio I am 22 years old 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.020
 I'm not the smartest person in the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.670
 world of which I have studied 5 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.010
 careers that are industrial engineering 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.260
 civil engineering communications 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.300
 marketing and international business 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.490
 because I really did not know what I wanted from 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.630
 my life or they say to you from small 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.730
 for school sacate good 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.760
 qualifications take a graduate 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.820
 expertise I am working 30-40 years of your 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.679
 life to retire that is not the plan 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.780
 I've had the other day reflecting 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.510
 after a leadership course 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.730
 and they were directors of 7-that de 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.050
 other companies of andreas directors 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.940
 generals who have worked all their lives 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.920
 but they have lost everything because they 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.659
 they spend work and work and work 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.579
 you can have a lot of money but not 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.690
 you enjoy your family do not have the 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.870
 freedom to go out and see something 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.460
 as these simply hours take a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.079
 decision and its what I want to come to 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.659
 to speak or they ran me for three 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.479
 universities of which why 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.670
 because at 16 he started smoking this 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.580
 and one thing took me the other I got like 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.100
 20 different substances I went wrong with 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.340
 the head but I feel lucky to 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.009
 be the 0 0 1 0 3 point to have left 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.899
 of that or many saw me as crazy 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.820
 that the plane went and many people 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.220
 they say hey what's up there are many 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.380
 people repel in their work repel 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.570
 of time repel in your life us today 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.550
 something different that you are doing there 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.240
 sitting doing what you're doing 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.890
 you 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.409
 right now to change your 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.330
 economic situation to change your 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.759
 situation of being free to change 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.289
 your situation or this is happening the 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.270
 white pear are what we represent 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.280
 forget about the tin or the can 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.289
 it is simply a means to 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.140
 we live the life we ​​want not 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.850
 so what I want to leave you is 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.210
 which reminded me of those three 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.010
 universities for consumption after one year 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.930
 and means can not mention electro mention 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.659
 nothing happened more brain x-rays 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.939
 as I told them 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.619
 and you can not just talk, imagine that 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.480
 are you sitting there tell your 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.400
 mom your dad who can not your son can not 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.750
 can speak for the rest of your life a 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.030
 decision changed everything I already wanted 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.010
 change my life and when it came to this the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.690
 cool opportunity, I was also 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.269
 sitting just like you said 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.860
 too good to be true thing in 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.780
 life if it was all too good 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.420
 to be true nobody would take the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.040
 life opportunities that's why 3% the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.319
 control 97 percent of the economy 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.730
 because they were the crazy they will be 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.620
 those who want to change the world they 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.629
 they will be the ones who told him they will all be 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.579
 too good to be true of the 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.959
 which 97% of the economy 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.879
 that means you 're fighting for 3% of 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.709
 the income that means that the 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.989
 most of our dads moms uncles 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.569
 diaz grandparents brother-in-law community what you 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.510
 you do not know that for income is 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.450
 amazing how education can 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.069
 change everything but if you think that the 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.560
 education is expensive you should see what 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.450
 so expensive how expensive is the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.849
 ignorance makes many people 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.889
 they misinterpret this they think you're going to be 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.260
 millionaire from one day to the other and not 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.560
 it is you have to 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.620
 this sacrifice is required 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.560
 but that I can tell you from 2 to 3 years 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.000
 in this in scrub all together not all 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.200
 You're alone because your team is there 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.640
 with you this is 23 years old 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.140
 today what many would not do to make the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.209
 day tomorrow may be what many do not 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.239
 can and with one more thing I'm going to 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.950
 leave this this was a survey in 1930 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.430
 that did it 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.290
 together with oppose I read the reason at 100 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.440
 people of whom all were 25 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.549
 years old that happens when they came to 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.980
 the one from 65 all to the 25 everyone has 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.599
 dreams everyone have goals all 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.209
 world wants to travel the world all the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.430
 the world wants to ride in those cars 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.989
 bind us to live life to have 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.780
 that's because they spend the 65 only one rich 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.430
 4 financially independent 5 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.220
 still working 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:16.079
 54 bankrupt and 36 dead 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.730
 I want to tell you to make a decision 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.010
 a decision to change your life takes a 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.949
 decision to move forward takes a 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.380
 decision to invest more time in this 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.180
 to prevent or sade out to you the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.979
 tomorrow I do not get used to walking with 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.590
 your family to walk enjoying your 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.860
 children to go enjoying already think to 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.350
 the long this will happen to you without you 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.620

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.330
 years and I have the car and technically and 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.550
 I'm retired when in Mexico 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.860
 there is retirement and what I want 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.070
 to tell people is this this is how it works 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.229
 yes yes yes the question works here if 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.560

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.540
 let them white your right camps take the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.940
 decision right now a decision takes 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.150
 a millisecond not a one hour not one 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.100
 week not a month a millisecond and 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.139

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.199
 blessing that they have just arrived and 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.199
