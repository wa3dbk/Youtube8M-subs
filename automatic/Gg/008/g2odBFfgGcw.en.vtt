end<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.320> shaking<00:01:07.620> and<00:01:07.920> messing<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.460> design

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
end up shaking and messing up the design

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.230 
end up shaking and messing up the design
so<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.049> pretty<00:01:10.320> easy<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.090> then<00:01:12.090> i'm<00:01:12.210> just

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
so it's pretty easy and then i'm just

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.030 
so it's pretty easy and then i'm just
going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.690> same<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.799> middle

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
finger and then i'm going to do

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.430 
finger and then i'm going to do
horizontal<00:01:17.940> line<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.479> I'm<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.200> one

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
horizontal line so I'm going to do one

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.170 
horizontal line so I'm going to do one
line<00:01:19.650> from<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.729> another

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
line from the right and then another

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.020 
line from the right and then another
line<00:01:21.479> from<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.810> left<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> connect<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:23.030> since

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
line from the left and connect it since

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.780 
line from the left and connect it since
for<00:01:24.299> me<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.720> harder<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.049> me<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> do

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
for me it's harder for me to do

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.520 
for me it's harder for me to do
horizontal<00:01:26.790> lines<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.840> straight<00:01:28.320> sweep

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.980 

so<00:01:33.369> for<00:01:33.549> this<00:01:33.640> nail<00:01:33.880> I'm<00:01:34.119> going<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.540> make<00:01:34.750> a

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
so for this nail I'm going to make a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.840 
so for this nail I'm going to make a
zigzag<00:01:35.619> design<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:36.369> don't<00:01:36.549> know<00:01:36.610> what<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.820> call

to<00:01:44.770> create<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.400> slanted<00:01:46.390> line<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:46.900> I'm<00:01:47.530> just

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
to create a slanted line and I'm just

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.719 
to create a slanted line and I'm just
going<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:48.040> keep<00:01:48.340> zigzagging<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.360> like<00:01:49.960> that

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.840 

and<00:01:55.440> then<00:01:56.440> I'm<00:01:56.740> going<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.159> work<00:01:57.460> from<00:01:57.729> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and then I'm going to work from the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.560 
and then I'm going to work from the
middle<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:59.140> work<00:01:59.530> my<00:01:59.560> way<00:01:59.710> out<00:02:00.570> since

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
middle and then work my way out since

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.940 
middle and then work my way out since
the<00:02:01.690> brush<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.020> pretty<00:02:02.259> long<00:02:02.440> it's<00:02:02.680> kind<00:02:02.890> of

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
the brush is pretty long it's kind of

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.529 
the brush is pretty long it's kind of
hard<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.190> control<00:02:03.490> what<00:02:03.729> you're<00:02:03.880> doing<00:02:04.270> but

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
hard to control what you're doing but

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:05.969 
hard to control what you're doing but
again<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.929> can<00:02:05.050> just<00:02:05.229> rest<00:02:05.440> your<00:02:05.590> hands

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
again you can just rest your hands

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.310 
again you can just rest your hands
somewhere<00:02:06.280> stable<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.119> it's<00:02:07.810> going<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.170> be<00:02:08.289> a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
somewhere stable and it's going to be a

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.229 
somewhere stable and it's going to be a
lot<00:02:08.530> easier<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:09.130> control<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:11.850> okay<00:02:12.850> because<00:02:13.209> I

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
lot easier to control it okay because I

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.840 
lot easier to control it okay because I
am<00:02:13.540> mean<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.170> pinky<00:02:14.590> didn't<00:02:14.890> get<00:02:15.040> filmed<00:02:15.550> but

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
am mean the pinky didn't get filmed but

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.630 
am mean the pinky didn't get filmed but
basically<00:02:16.390> all<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.780> did<00:02:17.140> was<00:02:17.489> dragged<00:02:18.489> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
basically all I did was dragged the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.270 
basically all I did was dragged the
brush<00:02:18.850> across<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.690> applied<00:02:20.260> pressure<00:02:20.590> more<00:02:21.130> to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
brush across I applied pressure more to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.800 
brush across I applied pressure more to
the<00:02:21.400> right<00:02:21.580> end<00:02:21.880> than<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.330> left<00:02:22.600> because

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the right end than to the left because

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.750 
the right end than to the left because
that's<00:02:23.110> when<00:02:23.350> I<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:24.100> flipped<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.519> brush

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
that's when I just flipped to the brush

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.170 
that's when I just flipped to the brush
off<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.160> can<00:02:27.280> tell<00:02:27.310> there's<00:02:27.790> more

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
off and as you can tell there's more

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.270 
off and as you can tell there's more
pressure<00:02:28.360> applied<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.560> right<00:02:29.709> side<00:02:29.980> than

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
pressure applied to the right side than

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.140 
pressure applied to the right side than
there<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.269> left<00:02:31.480> side

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.670 

okay<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.450> one's<00:02:36.659> my<00:02:36.780> favorite<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.379> and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
okay so this one's my favorite to do and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
I'm going to be using a sharpie for this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.569 
I'm going to be using a sharpie for this
because<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.079> a<00:02:40.139> lot<00:02:40.319> easier<00:02:40.469> to<00:02:40.829> control<00:02:41.010> and

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579
