 hello youtube partner what else and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.319
 Although a trifle as a custom 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.210
 recovery talk about a customized 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.800
 , restore mode are are 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.259
 pretty much every Android mobile phone so stop 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.210
 zwergs variant how to turn off the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.150
 plant variant I'll show you just once 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.480
 For example, the note 3 is a requirement 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.900
 device must be turned off bitterly so 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.230
 compensation who comes in is like that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.810
 pretty much all samsung devices the same 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.270
 Bear in mind that it's four here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 already out the 0 3 is still like us 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.110
 at the top of the led, if you can see that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.989
 want to accelerate haumann battery out 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.780
 and finished as I want to come in 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.700
 high home-button home button must there 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 sometimes do not just press with and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.079
 the power button saying home button 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.590
 and we'll press the power button 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.289
 just what is coming, why is it ? 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.300
 recovery butting is always 64 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.000
 turned off that 's the main thing 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.339
 at the top once home button and anna the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.510
 power button so jamal we have the same 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.080
 writing but he also makes clever 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.090
 putin 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.729
 what can we do in normal recovery 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.670
 make ron how can restart 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.979
 to import an update from a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 external source, the device on 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.390
 Reset the factory settings 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.799
 Delete cache or update 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.780
 from the cache 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.689
 we wish did not press me everything 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.530
 reboot food push out the note 3 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.030
 the picture is from england and wants that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.650
 It's four of which I actually show 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.229
 just did not want that is not 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:49.079
 Bad if you share adil with 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:52.640
 volume up home button power like you 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.079
 this custom rome custom recovery flasht 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.110
 you see in the video that I am down the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.590
 Link park there would have to 238 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.960
 and then that's what you want here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.939
 I do not think so again 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.829
 unsatisfactory is not bad 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.280
 take one again push out on 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.280
 Rhine 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.590
 jerome has for these next noises 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.990
 but that is unsatisfactory just like that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:28.150
 I makes the power button to rein 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:30.310
 pressed and again high right now 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:37.660
 but please proceed is the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:40.450
 same volume up above button so that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.670
 was practically the first time something 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.769
 you make before is an fs update before 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.989
 flashing your practical custom rom 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.670
 we are in recovery since we can 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.700
 do much more than this 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.290
 Samsung recovery also makes sense 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.730
 samsung now wants to return to 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.220
 you can get some running 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.220
 we just go to backup and 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.800
 restore now we can custom here 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.750
 backup to sd card sdk that in this 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.120
 case the internal sd card speaks the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.950
 integrated memory we want there 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.769
 just in backup have schola 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.970
 press by expressing the power button 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:19.950
 1 fs update in the afs file is 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.600
 saved as your opinion is and 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.010
 yes, if he does not like no one 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.310
 net reception more you will know 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.190
 What it takes for us to express as 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.950
 top start custom backup job as 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.810
 top priority made sure that 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.480
 just takes a little moment and with 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.170
 the free memory is displayed and ready 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.730
 is 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.079
 now defends sense the device just 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.780
 to connect a computer and this 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.840
 copy or copy file on the computer 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.120
 somewhere external secure 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.910
 so now with the case that we have this 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.709
 File now needs environment custom 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.959
 let's make a castor speak we have 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.709
 the bad case the bfs folder 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.609
 was deleted 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:09.390
 game of custom restore religious is the so 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:12.519
 not we just want a fs update 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.530
 sorry dfs restore the 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:21.600
 rest not at all 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:23.870
 i had so riester it says now 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.030
 top werder start custom restore job 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.710
 draufgehen he has restored the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.090
 went to ageing we still have to pick 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.710
 the time you can give yourself 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.930
 pinch because he does not know how later 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.260
 is in this recovery from going on 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.300
 yes really restore 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.460
 and whoever has you visible that already has 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.070
 so it ensures best in front of the 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.669
 each surface of a custom rom 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.620
 next door ifs memory is done with it 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.930
 was able to go to the next video in 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.210
 just go on with the SD card from 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.680
 the apology with the zip file the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.350
 areas want to build but knows everything 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.910
 not meaningful but is restarting 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.870
 secure it on the computer and then there's 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.110
 in the worst case still this 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.200
 Restore file from the ifs 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.650
 backup and then everything is fine again 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.650
 Thank you for watching
