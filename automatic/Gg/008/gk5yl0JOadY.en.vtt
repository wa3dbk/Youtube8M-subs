snug and that's all there is to it this
is<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.740> common<00:02:05.250> problem<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.759> these

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
is a common problem with these

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
is a common problem with these
carburetors<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.659> leak<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> base

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
carburetors they leak here at the base

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.889 
carburetors they leak here at the base
and<00:02:07.950> they<00:02:08.039> leak<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.599> cures

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and they leak up in here and this cures

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.890 
and they leak up in here and this cures
both<00:02:10.110> those<00:02:10.379> problems
