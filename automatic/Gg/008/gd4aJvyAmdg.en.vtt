00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.940
 Doing all means have become pleased to say that can glasses anyone using the miso in a hidden taste 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.880
 Please try 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.880
 20 pieces 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.900
 Well then I would like to make a a water first 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.570
 Soy sauce 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 Liquor 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.960
 It is sugar 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.539
 Onion 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.539
 This item is Yes and sliced into 3 mm width 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.900
 Ginger after 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.520
 We are focused washed with specified and water in shredded 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.329
 I put it in a bowl and put it on fire I have sugar. 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.450
 hey 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.570
 Mix quickly 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.910
 My fellow friends of Zhou will relax here a little 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.280
 Hey from today but it is delicious 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.480
 Let's put some beef 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.070
 today 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 I think it would be better to cut it a little if it seems to be too big using small pieces of meat 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.680
 I will 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 Ginseng should have some fat in Paris 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:13.230
 Here we have seen a little 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.200
 The onion is thinly sliced, but by heating it well here 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:22.820
 Because Amami comes out 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.790
 Amami from this Tama sister and vegetable soup are particularly good for being entangled with beef 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.230
 Because it will be soup stock 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.830
 If the beef is heated and it seems that a little bite comes out 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:36.100
 Please take it quickly 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.420
 If you notice beef and onions 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.950
 here 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.950
 Lift the hidden taste 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.810
 I'll put a schedule so that it's a little easy to melt, and let's lend it to Sapporo before giving it 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.990
 Not after all the Tteyuu miso 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.110
 It is a universal seasoning for Japanese food 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.950
 In particular 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.710
 I put it on top of the rice, so the compatibility between the rice and the miso is very good. 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.660
 It is a shop, but I think that anything that is really at home is fine 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.650
 A little Nde is a strong rain but it is white miso 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.280
 I don't think that's too good, but even red miso 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:24.950
 I think that Shinshu miso of that person is also good 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:28.720
 Yes If you put miso in this and simmer for a while, it's a cold. 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.080
 Taste becomes familiar and becomes more delicious as you go 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.200
 toni 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.200
