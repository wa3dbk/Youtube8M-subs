pretty good season I'll show you how to
light<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:20.430> today<00:00:20.990> so<00:00:21.990> fortunately<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
light this up today so fortunately the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.200 
light this up today so fortunately the
instructions<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.310> right<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.910> side

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
instructions are here right on the side

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.890 
instructions are here right on the side
and<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:25.019> pretty<00:00:25.199> easy<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.920> apply<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:27.180> fuel

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
and it's pretty easy just apply a fuel

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.200 
and it's pretty easy just apply a fuel
around<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.590> rim<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.099> couple<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.640> times<00:00:29.910> across

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
around the rim a couple of times across

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.020 
around the rim a couple of times across
you<00:00:30.630> put<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.949> start<00:00:32.250> setting<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.910> on

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you put it on the start setting here on

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.990 
you put it on the start setting here on
high<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.440> light<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.920> let<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.399> heat<00:00:35.969> up

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
high and you light it and let it heat up

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.510 
high and you light it and let it heat up
for<00:00:36.149> about<00:00:36.540> 15<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.950> 25<00:00:38.280> minutes<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:40.520> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
for about 15 to 25 minutes and then it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.310 
for about 15 to 25 minutes and then it
should<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.790> working<00:00:41.969> by<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.510> initially

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
should be working by then initially

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.930 
should be working by then initially
there<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.739> flame<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.430> comes<00:00:44.700> from

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
there will be a flame that comes from

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.819 
there will be a flame that comes from
the<00:00:45.030> top<00:00:45.239> basically<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:46.079> let<00:00:46.350> me<00:00:46.379> open<00:00:46.469> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the top basically here let me open it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.779 
the top basically here let me open it
for<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> heat<00:00:50.520> shield

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
for you and then just have a heat shield

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.700 
for you and then just have a heat shield
up<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.210> top<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.199> off<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
up on top which you can take off and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.100 
up on top which you can take off and
this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.030> light<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.510> helot

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
this is kind of light and helot

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.200 
this is kind of light and helot
so<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.980> you're<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> put<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so this is you're going to put the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.299 
so this is you're going to put the
Coleman<00:00:57.719> fuel<00:00:57.899> around<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> rim<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.710> couple<00:00:59.250> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
Coleman fuel around the rim a couple of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.779 
Coleman fuel around the rim a couple of
times<00:00:59.520> across<00:00:59.870> light<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.829> will<00:01:02.190> flame<00:01:02.609> up

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
times across light it it will flame up

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.310 
times across light it it will flame up
for<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> while<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:03.629> it'll<00:01:03.780> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.019> died

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
for a while and then it'll kind of died

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.219 
for a while and then it'll kind of died
down<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> fuel<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> tank

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
down and then all the fuel in the tank

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
down and then all the fuel in the tank
will<00:01:07.530> start<00:01:07.799> heating<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> result<00:01:09.150> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
will start heating up as a result of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
will start heating up as a result of
this<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.140> initial<00:01:10.650> lighting<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.250> it'll

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this this initial lighting and it'll

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090 
this this initial lighting and it'll
kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.000> vaporize<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.350> Coleman<00:01:13.680> fuel<00:01:13.860> in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
kind of vaporize all the Coleman fuel in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.310 
kind of vaporize all the Coleman fuel in
there<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:15.210> Coleman<00:01:15.570> fuel<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.229> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
there and if Coleman fuel will kind of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
there and if Coleman fuel will kind of
come<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.830> wick<00:01:17.159> part<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.659> burn

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
come to this wick part and just burn

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.410 
come to this wick part and just burn
nice<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> hot<00:01:19.710> without<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.189> flame<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.240> that's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
nice and hot without a flame so that's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.990 
nice and hot without a flame so that's
that's<00:01:22.080> how<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.560> done<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.369> let's<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.850> ahead

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that's how it's done so let's go ahead

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.109 
that's how it's done so let's go ahead
and<00:01:24.119> light<00:01:24.299> her<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.770> okay<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.100> already<00:01:26.520> added

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
and light her up okay so I already added

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.749 
and light her up okay so I already added
the<00:01:27.270> Coleman<00:01:27.630> fuel<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.490> just

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the Coleman fuel here and I will just

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.890 
the Coleman fuel here and I will just
carefully<00:01:30.740> put<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> around<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.280> rim<00:01:32.430> like

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
carefully put it around the rim like

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.670 
carefully put it around the rim like
instructions<00:01:35.570> I'm<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.780> doing<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.200> carefully

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
instructions I'm not doing so carefully

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.120 
instructions I'm not doing so carefully
but<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.880> like<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.240> couple<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.170> yeah

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
but just like that couple time yeah

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.789 
but just like that couple time yeah
that's<00:01:41.369> probably<00:01:41.520> okay<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.570> did<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
that's probably okay so I did that and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.130 
that's probably okay so I did that and
I'll<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.220> ahead<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.520> lighter

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.230 

be<00:01:50.650> careful<00:01:51.070> with<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.220> initial<00:01:51.730> light<00:01:51.940> and

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
be careful with that initial light and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.550 
be careful with that initial light and
will<00:01:52.360> flame<00:01:52.660> up<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:54.370> just<00:01:54.760> slowly<00:01:55.560> burn

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
will flame up and so just slowly burn

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.540 
will flame up and so just slowly burn
down<00:01:56.890> for<00:01:57.370> a<00:01:57.400> few<00:01:57.610> minutes<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.680> then<00:01:59.680> again<00:02:00.040> 15

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
down for a few minutes and then again 15

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.940 
down for a few minutes and then again 15
to<00:02:00.670> 25<00:02:01.090> minutes<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.630> should<00:02:01.960> be<00:02:02.080> already<00:02:02.410> this

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
to 25 minutes it should be already this

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.280 
to 25 minutes it should be already this
is<00:02:03.010> why<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.370> don't<00:02:03.580> do<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:03.910> inside<00:02:04.390> because

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
is why you don't do it inside because

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.140 
is why you don't do it inside because
you'll<00:02:05.440> burn<00:02:05.650> down<00:02:05.830> your<00:02:05.980> house<00:02:06.160> or<00:02:06.490> if<00:02:07.030> you're

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
you'll burn down your house or if you're

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.710 
you'll burn down your house or if you're
in<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.330> tent

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
in a tent

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.600 
in a tent
don't<00:02:07.930> don't<00:02:08.350> light<00:02:08.619> these<00:02:08.830> things<00:02:09.040> in<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.340> tent

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
don't don't light these things in a tent

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.150 
don't don't light these things in a tent
so<00:02:10.510> we'll<00:02:11.140> wait<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.410> few<00:02:11.590> minutes<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:11.980> come

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
so we'll wait a few minutes and come

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.330 
so we'll wait a few minutes and come
back<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.230> flame<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.590> already<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:15.040> down

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
back so the flame is already going down

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.510 
back so the flame is already going down
a<00:02:15.370> bit<00:02:15.640> we'll<00:02:16.360> wait<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.630> little<00:02:16.810> bit<00:02:16.930> more<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
a bit we'll wait a little bit more and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.690 
a bit we'll wait a little bit more and
see<00:02:18.520> how<00:02:18.550> toasty<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.240> can<00:02:19.480> get<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:21.370> fire<00:02:21.580> is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
see how toasty you can get the fire is

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.030 
see how toasty you can get the fire is
completely<00:02:21.880> down<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:23.260> starting<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.860> heat<00:02:24.010> up

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
completely down it's starting to heat up

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.470 
completely down it's starting to heat up
we'll<00:02:24.460> give<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.820> few<00:02:25.000> more<00:02:25.090> minutes

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
we'll give it a few more minutes

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.890 
we'll give it a few more minutes
we'll<00:02:25.960> go<00:02:26.140> ahead<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.380> put<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.900> detective

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
we'll go ahead and put the detective

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.100 
we'll go ahead and put the detective
ship<00:02:29.140> back<00:02:29.830> on<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.370> let's<00:02:31.240> just<00:02:31.480> sit<00:02:31.660> here<00:02:31.690> for

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
ship back on and let's just sit here for

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.460 
ship back on and let's just sit here for
a<00:02:32.350> few<00:02:33.010> minutes<00:02:33.540> okay<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.570> after<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:35.050> few<00:02:35.110> more

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
a few minutes okay so after a few more

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.410 
a few minutes okay so after a few more
minutes<00:02:35.709> I've<00:02:36.040> stuck<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.790> little<00:02:37.150> meat

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
minutes I've stuck in a little meat

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.880 
minutes I've stuck in a little meat
thermometer<00:02:37.990> here<00:02:38.230> I'm<00:02:38.380> not<00:02:38.500> sure<00:02:38.560> if<00:02:38.770> you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
thermometer here I'm not sure if you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.610 
thermometer here I'm not sure if you
could<00:02:39.040> tell<00:02:39.340> that's<00:02:39.610> already<00:02:39.910> about<00:02:40.120> 140<00:02:41.020> 150

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
could tell that's already about 140 150

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.030 
could tell that's already about 140 150
degrees<00:02:42.310> Fahrenheit<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.770> heating

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
degrees Fahrenheit and so it's heating

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.370 
degrees Fahrenheit and so it's heating
up<00:02:45.160> nicely<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.760> could<00:02:46.209> it's<00:02:46.870> getting<00:02:47.170> really

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
up nicely I could it's getting really

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.340 
up nicely I could it's getting really
hot<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.800> touch<00:02:48.100> here<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.690> works<00:02:50.140> pretty

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
hot to touch here and so it works pretty

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.160 
hot to touch here and so it works pretty
well<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.890> when<00:02:51.880> when<00:02:52.480> you're<00:02:52.660> done<00:02:52.870> you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
well and when when you're done you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.340 
well and when when you're done you
either<00:02:53.320> want<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.830> just<00:02:54.360> let<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.540> burn<00:02:55.810> out<00:02:56.050> its

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
either want to just let it burn out its

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.830 
either want to just let it burn out its
fuel<00:02:56.739> or<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.550> could<00:02:57.700> also<00:02:57.850> take<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.630> sheet

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
fuel or you could also take the sheet

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.440 
fuel or you could also take the sheet
shield<00:02:59.140> here<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.800> just<00:03:00.519> snuff<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.090> up<00:03:01.239> and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
shield here and just snuff it up and

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.420 
shield here and just snuff it up and
wait<00:03:02.019> for<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.440> whole<00:03:02.590> thing<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.980> cool<00:03:03.160> down

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
wait for the whole thing to cool down

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.600 
wait for the whole thing to cool down
