00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
switching technique you're gonna bring

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.400 
switching technique you're gonna bring
it<00:00:07.160> around<00:00:07.310> the<00:00:07.609> arm<00:00:07.990> similar<00:00:08.990> to<00:00:09.110> the<00:00:09.230> arm

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
it around the arm similar to the arm

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.590 
it around the arm similar to the arm
wrap<00:00:09.890> well<00:00:10.550> we're<00:00:10.790> not<00:00:10.880> gonna<00:00:11.000> have<00:00:11.300> it<00:00:11.330> so

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
wrap well we're not gonna have it so

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.300 
wrap well we're not gonna have it so
close<00:00:11.870> to<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.110> arm<00:00:12.320> we're<00:00:12.710> gonna<00:00:12.830> open<00:00:13.010> it<00:00:13.190> up

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.310 
close to the arm we're gonna open it up

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.010 
close to the arm we're gonna open it up
a<00:00:13.430> little<00:00:13.460> bit<00:00:13.760> so<00:00:14.120> we<00:00:14.210> can<00:00:14.240> grab<00:00:14.480> that<00:00:14.660> stick

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
a little bit so we can grab that stick

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.380 
a little bit so we can grab that stick
what<00:00:15.860> I<00:00:15.890> mean<00:00:16.070> by<00:00:16.219> opening<00:00:16.610> it<00:00:16.730> up<00:00:16.820> is<00:00:17.060> taking

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
what I mean by opening it up is taking

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.970 
what I mean by opening it up is taking
it<00:00:17.480> away<00:00:17.570> from<00:00:17.690> the<00:00:17.900> arm<00:00:18.080> just<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.590> little<00:00:18.830> bit

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
it away from the arm just a little bit

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.610 
it away from the arm just a little bit
so<00:00:19.880> it<00:00:20.030> comes<00:00:20.180> right<00:00:20.480> into<00:00:20.660> that<00:00:20.930> empty<00:00:21.890> hand

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
so it comes right into that empty hand

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.740 
so it comes right into that empty hand
we<00:00:24.620> then<00:00:24.800> let<00:00:24.980> go<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:25.490> we<00:00:26.270> can<00:00:26.390> switch<00:00:26.480> it<00:00:26.720> to

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
we then let go and we can switch it to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.410 
we then let go and we can switch it to
the<00:00:26.900> other<00:00:27.050> side<00:00:27.170> do<00:00:27.950> this<00:00:28.100> very<00:00:28.310> slow<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.270> let

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
the other side do this very slow so let

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.920 
the other side do this very slow so let
go<00:00:29.570> let<00:00:29.780> it<00:00:29.900> come<00:00:30.080> down<00:00:30.699> other<00:00:31.699> side<00:00:32.060> let<00:00:32.689> go

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
go let it come down other side let go

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.860 
go let it come down other side let go
let<00:00:33.620> it<00:00:33.680> come<00:00:33.980> down<00:00:34.010> other<00:00:35.000> side<00:00:35.030> once<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:35.720> get

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
let it come down other side once you get

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.000 
let it come down other side once you get
used<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:36.290> you're<00:00:36.470> actually<00:00:36.770> gonna<00:00:36.860> let<00:00:36.980> it

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
used to it you're actually gonna let it

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:45.220 
used to it you're actually gonna let it
flow<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.300> other<00:00:38.329> side<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:43.790> practice<00:00:44.329> start

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
flow to the other side to practice start

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.500 
flow to the other side to practice start
off<00:00:45.350> by<00:00:45.500> letting<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.130> stick<00:00:46.370> hang<00:00:46.579> down<00:00:46.790> bring

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
off by letting the stick hang down bring

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.459 
off by letting the stick hang down bring
it<00:00:47.630> up<00:00:47.780> grab<00:00:48.320> bring<00:00:49.130> it<00:00:49.220> back<00:00:49.340> down<00:00:49.520> up<00:00:50.270> grab

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.680 

make<00:00:57.469> sure<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:57.770> practice<00:00:57.950> it<00:00:58.300> on<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.600> other
