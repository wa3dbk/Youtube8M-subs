00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
tedious and it is definitely not the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390

the game not being supported at all so

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
speed is not a huge deal you will

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.039 
speed is not a huge deal you will
probably<00:02:56.610> find<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.239> experience<00:02:57.870> is

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
probably find that the experience is

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.170 
probably find that the experience is
good<00:02:58.290> enough<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.890> will<00:02:59.069> depend<00:02:59.310> on<00:02:59.760> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
good enough but it will depend on the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.220 
good enough but it will depend on the
local<00:03:00.989> connection<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.769> your<00:03:01.980> house<00:03:02.190> all<00:03:03.230> in

local connection in your house all in

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.080 
local connection in your house all in
all<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.380> would<00:03:04.530> probably<00:03:04.980> recommend<00:03:05.310> passing

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
all I would probably recommend passing

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.240

on<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.390> PlayStation<00:03:07.019> TV<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:08.010> eighty

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
on the PlayStation TV it is eighty

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.000 
on the PlayStation TV it is eighty
dollars<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.299> super<00:03:09.810> expensive<00:03:10.049> but

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
dollars so it's not super expensive but

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.590 
dollars so it's not super expensive but
there<00:03:11.190> are<00:03:11.280> better<00:03:11.340> devices<00:03:12.090> out<00:03:12.239> there<00:03:12.269> that

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
there are better devices out there that

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.539 
there are better devices out there that
