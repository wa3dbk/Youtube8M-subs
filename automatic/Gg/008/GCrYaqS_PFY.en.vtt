00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.320
 hello my name is arthur chopped 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.840
 and I would like to tell you about how 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.570
 to start playing the saxophone correctly 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.000
 the most important thing when you first contact 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.949
 this tool know how to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.539
 breathe how to put 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.609
 how to put your fingers correctly 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.039
 so that in the future when you meet 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.039
 teachers you no longer had any of their 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.840
 wrong movements and so is the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.269
 first i would like to talk about how 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 right lip really everything 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.920
 very simple, nothing complicated here 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.350
 you should know what you have here 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 should be smooth ploschadochka it 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.050
 achieved by 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.870
 wake up and do the corners of q 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.340
 movements and try first just 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:18.030
 mirror so thinking just 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.360
 just a house you have a lower lip slightly 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.510
 will be forward actually this 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.640
 natural 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.230
 as if the moment so here 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.140
 try and blow a sex-phone but there's more 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.440
 there is a nuance the fact is that we have a husband 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.670
 there is a cane 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.310
 and due to the fact that the lower lip is tight 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.160
 the news it starts to vibrate if you 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.300
 you can wait for her too far 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.300
 such a very strange sound if too 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.230
 close that is quite a bit if 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.230
 simply 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.710
 Naturally need to find some kind of gold 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.740
 the middle that is to say a little bit you donâ€™t 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.960
 be afraid to look always try like that 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.500
 it turns out no matter what the sound will be 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.500
 the initial stage 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.900
 why because forming a little bit 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.490
 you first need to work out later 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.160
 with some such training in order 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.350
 so that your hands in steel you get used to 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.739
 tool cans so that 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.850
 you had some kind of harmony and so what and how 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.550
 you need to breathe correctly 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.239
 we have a little bit here especially 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.640
 lower ryobi 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.320
 there is a diaphragm aperture this muscle 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.600
 notice i am showing you above the belly 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.600
 so you can try yourself 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.209
 put on push with your thumb 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.330
 just below the ribs and try 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.790
 push it out 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.110
 so you will feel this muscle 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.310
 now try to get air in here 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.170
 notice I do not live to animal 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.170
 it was inflated a little higher 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.610
 and its fin inflate the truth 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.650
 what it gives it gives it a very 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.890
 cool exercise that we are now 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.480
 show you take here by the way here 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.709
 this one 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.540
 gaytan very uncomfortable he helps 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.489
 time rests on this point to me very 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.290
 well her feelings oddly i'm not 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.090
 I know maybe the developers came up 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.620
 specifically this but maybe this 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.510
 This design is actually this 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.000
 very convenient to pay attention to everything 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.510
 I'll show you now here 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.510
 inflated 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.390
 the diaphragm does not allow you to exhale 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:56.880
 smooth i can control it i can 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.750
 do powerful can do little at all 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.450
 will be with pressure 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.580
 for the time being creates a full trunk 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.180
 air which is pro tip here 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.630
 sex phone 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.750
 and each note becomes very smooth and 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.750
 beautiful 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.560
 because I play not to strain but it is only 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.750
 only due to the fact that I do not breathe 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.570
 full breasts of course and be i taking 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.550
 a little air but the main nodes and take 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.910
 the diaphragm is thus not very comfortable 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.370
 I also wanted to play 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.160
 about a very important point and from this 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.900
 the problem is probably facing the most 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.880
 important when playing an instrument especially 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.070
 the first time you take it 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.870
 calm you have to worry about 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.850
 you will fail or you will succeed 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.940
 it will turn out if you will correctly it 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.680
 do this 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.030
 finger saxophone fingers need 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.770
 put such a round moment 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.600
 that is, as if the apple is like the same 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.110
 the most that on the piano why 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.460
 what is considered to be the most logical 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.800
 finger movement is a common principle as 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.420
 some mechanics there laid it like 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:31.820
 man and in the same way here 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:34.260
 see if you see on record 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.630
 could a broker or something else 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.610
 luring superstar super famous on 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.210
 the whole world who play so straight 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.060
 fingers 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.890
 then you must understand that this 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.590
 super professional he can play and 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.630
 straight fingers and anything but 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.160
 super professional but he did everything 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.130
 equal initially just like me 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.880
 I show everyone I wish you good luck in mastering 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.880
 would you
