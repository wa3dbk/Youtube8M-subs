00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
really quick to do and once i reach the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.270 
length i guess you could use a rubber
band<00:01:26.549> i<00:01:26.759> prefer<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.630> use<00:01:27.900> bobby<00:01:28.380> pins<00:01:28.560> to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
and that's a little more challenging to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.080 
and that's a little more challenging to
do<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:45.520> your<00:02:45.670> hair<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:45.880> not<00:02:46.150> fully<00:02:46.450> detangled<00:02:47.200> I

do if your hair is not fully detangled I
simply<00:02:49.090> grab<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> piece<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.990> hair<00:02:50.850> twist<00:02:51.850> it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
simply grab a piece of hair twist it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.560 
simply grab a piece of hair twist it
over<00:02:52.390> another<00:02:52.810> piece<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.940> continue<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.330> do

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
over another piece and continue to do

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.470 
over another piece and continue to do
that<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:56.140> like<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.830> make<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.430> twist<00:02:57.970> pretty

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
that I like to make this twist pretty

tight<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:34.470> typically<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.620> would<00:03:35.830> do<00:03:36.190> this<00:03:36.430> hair

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
tight and typically I would do this hair

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
this video my hair was previously flat

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.610 
this video my hair was previously flat
iron<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.220> starting<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.610> revert<00:03:46.150> and

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
iron and it's starting to revert and

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.520 
iron and it's starting to revert and
detangle<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.910> do<00:03:48.910> not<00:03:49.299> try<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.690> do<00:03:49.989> this<00:03:50.200> for<00:03:50.470> a

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
detangle I do not try to do this for a

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.970 
detangle I do not try to do this for a
hair<00:03:51.660> that's<00:03:52.660> been<00:03:52.930> in<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.140> tight<00:03:53.470> braids<00:03:53.950> out

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
hair that's been in a tight braids out

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.890 
hair that's been in a tight braids out
or<00:03:54.430> twist<00:03:54.760> out<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.180> find<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.690> a<00:03:55.750> little

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
or twist out I find it a little

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.720 
or twist out I find it a little
challenging<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.740> do<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.160> flats

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
challenging to do the flats

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:07.850 
challenging to do the flats
with<00:03:57.879> my<00:03:58.239> hair<00:03:58.480> that's<00:03:58.720> not<00:03:58.959> fully<00:03:59.440> tangled

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.430 

okay<00:04:08.860> now<00:04:09.040> as<00:04:09.280> i<00:04:09.640> begin<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.120> go<00:04:10.510> around<00:04:11.110> the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
okay now as i begin to go around the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.460 
okay now as i begin to go around the
side<00:04:11.799> of<00:04:11.860> my<00:04:12.129> head<00:04:12.849> i<00:04:13.239> pick<00:04:13.510> up<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.959> little<00:04:14.260> bit

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
side of my head i pick up a little bit

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:27.420 
side of my head i pick up a little bit
more<00:04:14.769> hair<00:04:15.870> at<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:17.709> point<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.860> you'll

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
more hair at that point and you'll

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.920 
more hair at that point and you'll
notice<00:04:27.669> i'm<00:04:28.030> trying<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:29.130> keep<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.340> sections

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
notice i'm trying to keep the sections

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.430 
notice i'm trying to keep the sections
fairly<00:04:32.010> even<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.570> then<00:04:34.570> when<00:04:34.780> i<00:04:34.810> get<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.289> this

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
fairly even and then when i get to this

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.189 
fairly even and then when i get to this
end<00:04:35.710> part<00:04:36.160> right<00:04:36.460> there<00:04:36.490> on<00:04:37.120> this<00:04:37.389> side<00:04:37.720> i

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
end part right there on this side i

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.610 
end part right there on this side i
usually<00:04:38.530> actually<00:04:39.250> begin<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:39.910> braid<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:41.590> hair

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
usually actually begin to braid the hair

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.170 
usually actually begin to braid the hair
so<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:43.000> twist<00:04:43.389> can<00:04:43.780> hold<00:04:44.669> now<00:04:45.669> it's<00:04:45.970> up

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
so that the twist can hold now it's up

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.360 
so that the twist can hold now it's up

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.820 
to secure you can also use a rubber band
if<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.610> use<00:05:00.789> rubber<00:05:01.090> bands<00:05:01.630> for<00:05:02.200> your<00:05:02.560> hair

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
if you use rubber bands for your hair

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.920 
if you use rubber bands for your hair
and<00:05:03.130> you<00:05:03.250> can<00:05:03.460> see<00:05:03.639> i<00:05:03.669> braid<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.240> further<00:05:04.539> down

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
and you can see i braid it further down

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.830 
and you can see i braid it further down
all<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.349> way<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.919> end<00:05:06.450> but<00:05:07.450> that<00:05:07.660> would

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
all the way to the end but that would

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:19.830 
all the way to the end but that would
depend<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.560> length<00:05:09.070> of<00:05:09.340> your<00:05:09.820> hair

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.650 

then<00:05:20.830> I<00:05:20.860> just<00:05:21.220> gathered<00:05:21.699> the<00:05:21.850> hair<00:05:22.120> from<00:05:22.449> the

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
then I just gathered the hair from the

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.890 
then I just gathered the hair from the
other<00:05:22.870> side<00:05:23.290> and<00:05:23.680> pull<00:05:23.919> it<00:05:23.949> into<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.520> ponytail

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
other side and pull it into a ponytail

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.900 
other side and pull it into a ponytail
now<00:05:25.900> I<00:05:25.960> know<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.290> see<00:05:26.680> frizzies<00:05:27.280> but<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.699> don't

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.750 
now I know you see frizzies but I don't
worry<00:05:28.180> about<00:05:28.540> that<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.110> tie<00:05:29.380> that<00:05:29.650> down<00:05:29.760> later

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
worry about that I tie that down later

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.659 
worry about that I tie that down later
using<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.660> scarf<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.410> maybe<00:05:32.889> a<00:05:33.010> little<00:05:33.250> bit<00:05:33.550> of

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
using a scarf and maybe a little bit of

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.689 
using a scarf and maybe a little bit of
jail<00:05:34.350> to<00:05:35.350> hold<00:05:35.590> it<00:05:35.770> down<00:05:35.800> and<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.550> will

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
jail to hold it down and that will

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.150 
jail to hold it down and that will
smooth<00:05:37.000> out<00:05:37.180> those<00:05:37.449> frizzies<00:05:38.110> now<00:05:38.800> sometimes
