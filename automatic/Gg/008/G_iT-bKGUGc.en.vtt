00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
can make arrows and bows you can add a
thin<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.009> it'll<00:01:53.130> fly<00:01:53.460> better<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.210> can

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
thin to it so it'll fly better you can

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.270 
thin to it so it'll fly better you can
add<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> rock<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.110> was<00:01:55.229> talking<00:01:55.530> about<00:01:55.590> on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
add the rock like I was talking about on

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.240 
add the rock like I was talking about on
the<00:01:56.430> front<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.329> since<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:58.159> we<00:01:59.159> don't

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the front there but since we we don't

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.440 
the front there but since we we don't
have<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.579> time<00:01:59.729> we're<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> do

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
have the time we're just going to do

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.010 
have the time we're just going to do
this<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.649> our<00:02:01.770> ball<00:02:02.009> right<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:03.020> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
this so we have our ball right here the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.310 
this so we have our ball right here the
back<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.409> arrow<00:02:04.560> fits<00:02:05.490> nicely<00:02:06.079> right<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
back of the arrow fits nicely right in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.730 
back of the arrow fits nicely right in
the<00:02:07.680> bowstring<00:02:08.390> now

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
the bowstring now

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.420 
the bowstring now
just<00:02:10.400> like<00:02:10.550> archery<00:02:10.910> class<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.920> pull<00:02:13.190> back

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
just like archery class you pull back

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.040 
just like archery class you pull back
and<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.650> shoot<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.540> that's<00:02:17.690> how<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.870> make

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
and you shoot it and that's how you make

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.500 
and you shoot it and that's how you make
a<00:02:18.110> bow<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.320> arrow
