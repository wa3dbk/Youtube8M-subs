00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.490
 so today a little exercise that 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.810
 is very interesting to work the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.000
 arm so especially the biceps 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.320
 the back of the shoulders and strengthen the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.789
 upper back so it's especially 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.310
 the exercise which is very interesting 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.779
 when you are used to forgiveness 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.220
 practice the pumps which is an exercise 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.499
 to push so we'll do a 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.780
 exercise of general draw had 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.730
 used a dumbbell in each hand for 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.379
 these so at the placement level at 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.449
 width basin knees slightly 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.190
 unlock you will bend the bust 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.890
 perfect forward so the buttocks 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.239
 parts a little bit backwards the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.859
 mourning well it's perfect so we 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.750
 maintains a slight camber in the 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.489
 low back is so you'll go up the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.320
 elbows bring the dumbbells to the level 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.480
 ribs and u control the descent 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.850
 so here we serve well the shoulder blades 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.440
 perfect on the climb always in 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.920
 respecting one as I said a good 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.109
 posture 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.120
 so the two main mistakes are going 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.210
 to be two slacked back and to have the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.490
 round back so there no good at all so I 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.170
 straighten me I go out the chest and I 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.000
 keep a good candor 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.159
 straighten a little bit of gerling so 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.630
 second mistake is to have your back a 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.520
 little bit too vertical so there the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.650
 work will be less efficient and we will 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.740
 more work on the biceps so have 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.759
 a good working angle the back well 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.500
 law 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.210
 we control the descent well we breathe 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.520
 deeply and release everything 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.799
 gently so very interesting exercise 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.170
 for the upper back and to thwart 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.170
 a little bit the work of the pumps
