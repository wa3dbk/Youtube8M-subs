00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.980
 who went out exclusively to the duel cei 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.420
 so this is the animated binder bugs and that's it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.860
 she and not yet end not out yet 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.989

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.400
 in France anyway for now 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.980
 is not expected that she will 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.269
