00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.210 
I think when you see the goalkeeper
cannot<00:01:58.820> see<00:01:59.030> which<00:01:59.210> side<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.570> coming<00:02:00.220> there's

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
cannot see which side is coming there's

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.860 
cannot see which side is coming there's
enough<00:02:01.430> pace<00:02:01.640> on<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.880> ball<00:02:01.910> or<00:02:02.210> take<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.540> into
