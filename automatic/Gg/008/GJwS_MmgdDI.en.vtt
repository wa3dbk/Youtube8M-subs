process<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.720> we'll<00:01:26.260> see<00:01:26.440> how<00:01:26.560> that<00:01:26.680> one<00:01:26.890> works

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
process so we'll see how that one works

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.150 
process so we'll see how that one works
next<00:01:28.510> we'll<00:01:28.960> apply<00:01:29.170> some<00:01:29.470> bar<00:01:29.770> keeper's
