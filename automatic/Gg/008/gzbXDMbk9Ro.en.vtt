00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.970
 so many coefficients above the 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.490
 150 and still nobody has had the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.050
 Why tell me why on Sundays 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.690
 It gives us to miss and open us 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.850
 Freeze inside 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.410
 little bitch that of wanting so much already 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.539
 time so bad 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.520
 with a bitch to be so fanatical about 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.930
 heights when the wings fail you every 3 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.060
 by 2 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.290
 and little bitch know that my next 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.290
 scar I'm going to take your name 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.289
 the wise have always said that in the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.300
 ruins are a sign that a great empire 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.850
 a long time ago 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.589
 I suppose that love is that happening 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.079
 oxygenates you to rust and does nothing 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.460
 because the reddish color of the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.710
 How sure of your skin reminds you of a 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.629
 little to his lips 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.120
 nail with blade conscience in 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.940
 master the wound because the sensation of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 itching takes half of its name or 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.720
 lose all the trains in the world by 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.720
 stay by his side only a while longer 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.590
 he has been wearing clothes for too long 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:18.159
 At least we are under the same sky 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.960
 but it is no longer useful 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.329
 not when I'm dying to read in 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 Braille every night and not when I decide 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.329
 with all my might be rome and that 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.329
 all the roads will take you to me 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.040
 it will come farewell and I tell you that it has been 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.980
 a pleasure to hurt you 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.690
 the damage is mine you answer me and shoot 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.670
 100 bullets per word that ends 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.090
 developing my chest 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.329
 then it 's when I give the most to love you 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.859
 in sixteen ninths in four thirds 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.030
 with binary rhythm and dancing a waltz 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.350
 developing the madrid blouse and is 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.380
 helping barcelona to get the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.380
 jacket 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.880
 and that is now 2 and 43 of the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.640
 tomorrow I have a camp set up under 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.020
 my own sheets a margo book 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.530
 although he is asking me to take him out 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.450
 dance and sabina singing mile killed 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.450
 out of jealousy and you die for me
