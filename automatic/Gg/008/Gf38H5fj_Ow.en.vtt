00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.090
 Hello dear friends with you happy 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.580
 Zerg is a review on heroes of the storm 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 today we will consider the most 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.359
 effective and basic build to fill up and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.789
 dc-dc et t as its only players do not 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:26.980
 generally referred to as a melee fighter 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:29.650
 from the warcraft universe after 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.219
 top tank ponerfili it instantly 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.860
 became one of his best possible increasingly 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.110
 and more often see the quick boy and the league 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.140
 heroes so let's consider the most 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.420
 popular and effective build on the first 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.180
 level is best to take a block 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.910
 after all this c is a tank and the smaller 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.090
 author so it goes with the longer 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.770
 he lives and is therefore better on 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.290
 level four is best to take 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.420
 effects pedal she turns every 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.879
 our ability such a flash drive on the seventh 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.149
 level we take a born guitarist 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.180
 because we get creed by these kretov 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:14.049
 we are not only very painful to beat the enemy 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.650
 but also recline ourselves on the tenth 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.250
 level 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.470
 take the ability according to the situation can 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.810
 of course our main ability 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.689
 if we are very good at dancing in 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.150
 several enemy heroes then our 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.930
 teammates just shoot everyone and we 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.850
 very easy to win in timfayte 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.119
 jump from the stage we take in that case 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 if it is a very large number 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.180
 control in the enemy team and we 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.670
 just can not dance properly 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.220
 play then we take the jump from the stage 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.950
 besides the jump with the scene is good on 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.890
 such big maps where very important 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.009
 mobility and also a jump from the stage 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.960
 good to break into enemy 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.509
 riders here for example sergeant sledgehammer 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.210
 such sits in the layout and you in it 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.259
 jump off push and paint 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.260
 and the fight begins at level 13 we take 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.359
 super star adds 20 percent 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.550
 speed of movement is what we 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:18.910
 need we run away we catch up 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.240
 In general, everything in the world will do on 16 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.120
 level we have two options 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.980
 if we live very well not on me 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.980
 need to have extra 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.680
 this we take adding presence 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.270
 also we take it against big 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.610
 number of auto attackers 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.610
 they respectively attack speed 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.770
 will go down and so much the better for us but 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.680
 if we need to survive some such 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.760
 boost damage and a lot of damage on us 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.150
 passes then we take the stone skin 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.660
 at level 20 we take a storm charge 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.270
 this is a great general talent for initiation 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.430
 we can both just jump and 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.470
 to push the enemy heroes also we 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.370
 we can and jump into the crowd of enemy 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.650
 heroes and pro play and if we are fine this 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.040
 do that we just win the teamfight 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.650
 Well, for our teammates, thank you for 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.580
 attention with you was happy verb good luck and 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.580
 to new meetings
