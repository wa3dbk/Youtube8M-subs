00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.719
 here we are going to draw the character 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.639
 chinese fu which means blessing 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.340
 just behind the flower pattern that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.410
 we have just finished 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.030
 to prepare the character I draw it 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.130
 already with a pen to some graphics 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.119
 like this this type of gear that can be 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.119
 pulled easily into the water 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.260
 start with the outlines 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.940
 pay attention to the pressure you 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.940
 put on the blade and with your hand 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.890
 all 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 e 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.650
 when the contours are finished it is necessary 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.440
 well follows and throws with a cloth 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.990
 wet to finalize it is necessary to correct 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.130
 the defects on the contours still a 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.840
 time you always have to remember that 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.800
 afld is very fragile so you do not have to 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.800
 do not press too hard on it 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.469
 all 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.840
 m 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.350
