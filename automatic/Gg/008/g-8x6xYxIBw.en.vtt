00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.370
 edition and this map I created it 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.930
 half the time and made them a map is the 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.010
 second map that I do to them because I already 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.860

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.260

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.360

 projects to apm 30 apocalypse projects 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.410
 minecraft is because it follows 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:02.040
 continuously updating the map 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.340
