00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:22.350
 Maybe you are, you do not know, but I am. 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.480
 having the opportunity to take the one who 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.609
 a little of what I know about 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.960
 Tell me, something works. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.760
 People, it's cool, it was cool then. 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.840

 and personal symbol and make this video myself 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.050
 Last week I made a video 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.010
 in fact I made a sauce with this 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.350
 same personal goal we have at home I 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 I like this way only the one who ate ate the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.899
 sound is a natural born 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.129
 I said I'll do it if I immortal the person. 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.739
 How did it happen ended up doing 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.000
 success is like music the personal or 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.420
 I wrote a song that suddenly 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.590
 music does not succeed in the voice that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.390
 face that contest 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 then suddenly it becomes the mouth of another 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.830
 The same thing made still I made a mole that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.479
 happened this rode two commented 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.869
 for you to get an idea even who does not eat 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.460
 goal make the move is and so the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.320
 first person we know we have the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.500
 its beneficial properties 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.689
 I like coffee as onion like to have 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.299
 a video on the channel on my other channel 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.280
 explaining how to make a preserve and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.170
 onion that's there folks here in case 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.979
 and know goal that the staff calls finger 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.299
 of girl 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.610
 I do not know what it has to do with the finger of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.060
 girl why the love of God is like this 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.570
 A very fear made the joke with the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.859
 her name 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.600
 vinegar 9 is not eliminated and red has 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.789
 an oil 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.909
 you can continue scoring the goal of the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.969
 team of the lowest price and the olive oil you 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:15.209
 You can use the staff here as well. 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:18.090
 It is chives and have to put Ilsinho 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.840
 It's a personal thing. 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.440
 we need to have a blender the same 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.069
 it was the person has nothing here too 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.230
 pint 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.940
 I always talk, people are to work. 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.220
 with food is very important 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.829
 terms of hygiene and this is fundamental 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.959
 understood the food is my thing 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.879
 joking a thing is a very thing 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.670
 I would be very young on personal staff 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.170
 the quantity in the relative lane is 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.269
 that goal amount I have here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.129
 I'm going to put more or less half 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:57.209
 seminar that gave why to see in life 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:04.260
 and what happens is that in addition to 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:08.750
 take a little of what happens it goes 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.720
 tuning a little and goes to the final the only 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.579
 what happens here in the personal case 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.280
 oil is important because it looks goes 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.829
 do what you will save and your eye is 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.130
 this brat , remembering this 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.560
 world bet of prepared you can see 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.040
 I repeat life is not anything 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.690
 plastic because it is not legal and it has q 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.060
 gotta be stored in the refrigerator right 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.850
 so I live what he did to you 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.810
 with him it 's a cookie in the test food only 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.020
 OK 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.150
 and so it is not meant for you to leave 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.750
 food to have as it is seasoned 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.830
 it can not be out of breath or 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.320
 be the refrigerator 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.790
 we put the vinegar a little oil to 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:09.000
 amount of oil more or less 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:13.550
 a cup a final cup you can put 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.549
 the half here in the case we have 750 ml 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.230
 so here is a little more than half 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.130
 There you go the goals to which stalin 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:28.640
 let her come her state there comes rain 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.640
 all of them and gradually 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:38.240
 and with the eye very personal health until 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.590
 So I did it like this when we 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.360
 kitchen with people 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.099
 we often do not have that 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.979
 notion of how the staff said 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.629
 So you cook, you make one. 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.669
 food thing so the person speaks our 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:53.300
 good right then has not changed people 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.550
 Speech, then it's cool. 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:03.439
 after done that the guys do not close here 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:05.590
 the blender and let's beat the beat 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.590
 on here 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:36.400
 Good now we'll open again that 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.900
 play the green smell with chives 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:44.710
 including having already washed person having 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.659
 washed in nava day 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.370
 here you can do that plays everything here 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.370
 within Brazil 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:08.159
 if you close again the work of 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.159
 hit a 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:42.380
 good staff there now is as I said in 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.790
 top containers then used in 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.860
 glasses 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.100
 here in the sport and glass mayonnaise of 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.580
 olive 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.410
 anyway the case you want to do is 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.540
 I always keep with me bottle agency 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.380
 I bought a move to 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.650
 check vein 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:04.100
 I think it's cute, you take a funnel and 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:07.010
 put and you can see the personal will 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.760
 so there you are the homemade sauce of 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.010
 chili 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:14.150
 remembering the staff this sauce should 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:15.889
 stay in the fridge do not miss out 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.380
 that it can spoil from getting 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:21.680
 refrigerated used is not to freeze the 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.729
 person to leave in the refrigerator as 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.550
