00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
being destroyed in the impound lot

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.640 
being destroyed in the impound lot
fixing<00:02:54.420> exploit<00:02:54.780> where<00:02:54.959> players<00:02:55.200> were<00:02:55.380> able

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
fixing exploit where players were able

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.190 
fixing exploit where players were able
to<00:02:55.739> give<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.100> vehicles<00:02:56.550> nitrous<00:02:57.150> boosts<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.170> I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
to give the vehicles nitrous boosts so I

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.320 
to give the vehicles nitrous boosts so I
now<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.160> nitrous<00:02:59.550> boosts<00:02:59.970> are<00:03:00.120> gone

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
now and the nitrous boosts are gone

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.970 
now and the nitrous boosts are gone
you're<00:03:00.540> not<00:03:00.660> able<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:01.019> give<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.590> vehicle's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980

you're not able to give your vehicle's
nitrous<00:03:02.370> boost<00:03:02.640> anymore<00:03:03.030> apparently<00:03:03.239> so

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
nitrous boost anymore apparently so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.330 
nitrous boost anymore apparently so
apparently<00:03:03.930> they<00:03:04.290> fix<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.739> that's<00:03:05.069> very

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
apparently they fix that that's very

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.830 
apparently they fix that that's very
very<00:03:05.459> cool<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:05.910> we<00:03:05.970> won't<00:03:06.180> say<00:03:06.360> any<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:06.540> nos

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840

on<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.000> cars<00:03:09.239> i'm<00:03:09.450> guessing<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.410> next<00:03:11.010> we

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
on the cars i'm guessing but next we

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.100 
on the cars i'm guessing but next we
have<00:03:11.310> fixed<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.390> exploit<00:03:12.750> where<00:03:12.900> players
