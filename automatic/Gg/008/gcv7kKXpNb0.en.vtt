Subaru Legacy it's actually been parked

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.170 
Subaru Legacy it's actually been parked
right<00:00:21.300> where<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.660> now<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.080> two<00:00:22.200> weeks<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
right where it is now for two weeks I

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.279 
right where it is now for two weeks I
have<00:00:24.180> had<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.570> problems<00:00:24.990> which<00:00:25.290> I<00:00:25.560> believe

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
have had some problems which I believe

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.960 
have had some problems which I believe
originally<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.830> misfire<00:00:29.010> originally<00:00:29.760> thought

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
originally to misfire originally thought

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.670 
originally to misfire originally thought
it<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.180> an<00:00:30.360> ignition<00:00:30.600> issue<00:00:30.960> than<00:00:31.350> a<00:00:31.380> fuel

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
it was an ignition issue than a fuel

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.650 
it was an ignition issue than a fuel
issue<00:00:31.860> then<00:00:32.699> I<00:00:32.760> ran<00:00:32.940> compression<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
issue then I ran compression and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.939 
issue then I ran compression and
realized<00:00:34.650> it<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:36.050> actually<00:00:37.050> mechanical<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
realized it was actually mechanical and

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.450 
realized it was actually mechanical and
it's<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.790> cylinder<00:00:39.570> 2<00:00:39.840> which<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.460> front

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it's in cylinder 2 which is front

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.260 
it's in cylinder 2 which is front
cylinder<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.180> driver's<00:00:42.809> side<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.290> so

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
cylinder on the driver's side here so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.799 
cylinder on the driver's side here so
most<00:00:45.270> likely<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.050> burned<00:00:46.350> valve<00:00:46.680> or<00:00:47.809> some

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
most likely it's burned valve or some

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
most likely it's burned valve or some
kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> valve<00:00:49.230> guide<00:00:49.530> damaged<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.340> something

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
kind of valve guide damaged or something

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.590 
kind of valve guide damaged or something
to<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.090> effect<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.969> thought<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to that effect so I thought about it and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150 
to that effect so I thought about it and
it's<00:00:54.870> always<00:00:55.079> cheaper<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> fix

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's always cheaper to fix

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
it's always cheaper to fix
well<00:00:56.640> usually<00:00:56.820> cheaper<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.450> fix<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> car<00:00:57.960> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
well usually cheaper to fix the car you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.690 
well usually cheaper to fix the car you
have<00:00:58.820> then<00:00:59.820> go<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.390> buy<00:01:00.540> another<00:01:00.719> car<00:01:01.050> so

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
have then go out and buy another car so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.010 
have then go out and buy another car so
besides<00:01:02.700> since<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.270> three<00:01:03.570> cars<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
besides since I have three cars and I

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.499 
besides since I have three cars and I
can't<00:01:04.259> really<00:01:04.410> drive<00:01:04.860> any<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:06.860> I

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
can't really drive any one of them I

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.790 
can't really drive any one of them I
didn't<00:01:09.509> want<00:01:09.660> to<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.200> burden<00:01:10.560> myself

factory repair manual mostly just to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.240 
factory repair manual mostly just to
give<00:01:58.170> me<00:01:58.229> two<00:01:58.409> different<00:01:58.680> perspectives<00:01:59.159> on

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
give me two different perspectives on

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.090 
give me two different perspectives on
the<00:01:59.340> job<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.380> first<00:02:01.560> thing<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.829> need<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the job but the first thing you need to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
the job but the first thing you need to
do<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.429> I<00:02:02.490> either<00:02:03.000> cases<00:02:03.329> relieve<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> fuel

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
do and I either cases relieve the fuel

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.350 
do and I either cases relieve the fuel
pressure<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:05.429> you<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.820> I've<00:02:06.210> got<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
pressure so what you do is I've got a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.730 
pressure so what you do is I've got a
station<00:02:06.570> wagon<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.350> I'm<00:02:07.409> going<00:02:07.590> in

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
you crank the engine over and if it

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:36.710 
you crank the engine over and if it
fires<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:28.920> let<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.130> die<00:02:35.480> after<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> fuel

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
fires you just let it die after a fuel

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.509 
fires you just let it die after a fuel
system<00:02:36.870> pressure<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.500> relieved<00:02:37.860> next<00:02:38.430> you

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
system pressure is relieved next you

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.240 
system pressure is relieved next you
actually<00:02:38.910> have<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.739> drain<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.890> cooling

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
actually have to drain the cooling

bolt<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.560> do<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.510> kind<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.440> a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
bolt now what I do is this is kind of a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440 
bolt now what I do is this is kind of a
shade<00:03:19.829> tree<00:03:20.100> method<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:20.910> doing<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.209> but<00:03:21.359> I'm

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
shade tree method of doing it but I'm

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.910 
shade tree method of doing it but I'm
not<00:03:21.510> too<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.780> didn't<00:03:22.019> invent<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.410> not<00:03:22.590> by<00:03:22.709> far

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
not too I didn't invent it not by far

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.150 
not too I didn't invent it not by far
this<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:24.109> starter<00:03:25.109> bump<00:03:25.290> method<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:26.069> get

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
this is the starter bump method you get

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.610 
this is the starter bump method you get
a<00:03:26.220> 22<00:03:26.730> millimeter<00:03:27.150> socket<00:03:27.600> assuming<00:03:28.319> yours<00:03:28.530> is

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
a 22 millimeter socket assuming yours is

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.009 
a 22 millimeter socket assuming yours is
also<00:03:28.769> 22<00:03:29.220> millimeter<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.819> just<00:03:30.750> kind<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.900> take

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
also 22 millimeter I just kind of take

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.990 
also 22 millimeter I just kind of take
that<00:03:31.079> with<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.319> grain<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.500> salt<00:03:31.590> get<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:32.639> on<00:03:32.790> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
that with a grain of salt get it on the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.030 
that with a grain of salt get it on the
I've<00:03:33.510> got<00:03:33.660> an<00:03:33.750> impact<00:03:34.079> socket<00:03:34.440> here<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
I've got an impact socket here on the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.199 
I've got an impact socket here on the
pulley<00:03:35.730> bolt<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.319> I've<00:03:37.319> got<00:03:37.440> my<00:03:37.560> breaker<00:03:37.920> bar

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
pulley bolt and I've got my breaker bar

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.900 
pulley bolt and I've got my breaker bar
braced<00:03:39.209> against<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:40.579> driver's<00:03:41.579> side<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
braced against the driver's side of the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.940 
braced against the driver's side of the
body<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.510> what's<00:03:43.290> gonna<00:03:43.380> happen<00:03:43.470> some<00:03:43.799> of<00:03:43.889> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
body so what's gonna happen some of the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.940 
body so what's gonna happen some of the
bump<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.190> starter<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:46.349> starter<00:03:46.799> will

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
bump the starter and the starter will

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.009 
bump the starter and the starter will
turn<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.400> crankshaft<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> bolt<00:03:48.930> will

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
turn the crankshaft and the bolt will

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.870 
turn the crankshaft and the bolt will
stay<00:03:49.139> stationary<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.799> pop<00:03:49.950> itself<00:03:50.310> loose<00:03:50.489> so

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
stay stationary and pop itself loose so

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.259 
stay stationary and pop itself loose so
I'm<00:03:51.180> gonna<00:03:51.359> do<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.540> right<00:03:51.599> now<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:53.269> don't

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
I'm gonna do that right now I don't

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.819 
I'm gonna do that right now I don't
actually<00:03:54.569> have<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.019> clearance<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.440> get<00:03:55.650> the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
actually have the clearance to get the

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.640 
actually have the clearance to get the
head<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.730> head<00:03:56.880> bolts<00:03:57.209> out<00:03:57.359> and<00:03:57.690> then<00:03:58.380> take

off<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.170> engine<00:04:23.440> now<00:04:25.260> well<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.500> have<00:04:26.920> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
off the engine now well I have the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.430 
off the engine now well I have the
intake<00:04:27.430> manifold<00:04:28.000> off<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:28.690> I'm<00:04:28.960> nearly<00:04:29.200> at

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
intake manifold off and I'm nearly at

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.780 
intake manifold off and I'm nearly at
the<00:04:29.470> point<00:04:29.770> where<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:29.920> have<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.220> call<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.640> day

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
the point where I have to call it a day

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.370 
the point where I have to call it a day
because<00:04:31.180> it's<00:04:31.330> getting<00:04:31.510> late<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.810> then<00:04:32.170> lose

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
because it's getting late and then lose

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.530 
because it's getting late and then lose
light<00:04:32.650> probably<00:04:33.010> would<00:04:33.340> sometime<00:04:34.270> within<00:04:34.420> the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
light probably would sometime within the

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.730 
light probably would sometime within the
next<00:04:34.630> hour<00:04:36.120> probably<00:04:37.120> closer<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.690> drew<00:04:37.900> 1/2

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
next hour probably closer to drew 1/2

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.370 
next hour probably closer to drew 1/2
the<00:04:38.980> only<00:04:39.630> things<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:40.750> can<00:04:40.870> really<00:04:41.170> see

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
the only things that can really see

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.860

getting<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:41.710> my<00:04:41.800> way<00:04:41.830> now<00:04:42.160> or<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.870> AC

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
getting in my way now or the AC

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.340 
getting in my way now or the AC
compressor<00:04:44.730> I<00:04:45.730> think<00:04:46.660> I<00:04:46.720> just<00:04:46.870> have<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.080> remove
