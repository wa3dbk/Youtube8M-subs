00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.450 

number<00:00:03.149> five<00:00:03.300> goes<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:04.110> meowstic<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.310> my

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
number five goes to meowstic and in my

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.280 
number five goes to meowstic and in my
opinion<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:06.210> think<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.600> meowstic<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.170> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
opinion I think that meowstic is a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.780 
opinion I think that meowstic is a
pretty<00:00:07.529> decent<00:00:07.919> Pokemon<00:00:08.309> all<00:00:08.490> things

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
pretty decent Pokemon all things

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.060 
pretty decent Pokemon all things
considered<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:10.019> find<00:00:10.320> me<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.620> stick<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.950> be

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
considered and I find me on stick to be

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.919 
considered and I find me on stick to be
pretty<00:00:11.309> interesting<00:00:11.910> too<00:00:12.090> because<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
pretty interesting too because of the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.379 
pretty interesting too because of the
fact<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:13.950> design<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.580> split<00:00:14.969> into<00:00:15.089> two

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
fact that it's design is split into two

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.410 
fact that it's design is split into two
for<00:00:16.109> example<00:00:16.560> if<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.520> male<00:00:17.880> expert

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
for example if you have a male expert

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.269 
for example if you have a male expert
which<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> Pokemon<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.500> evolved<00:00:19.949> into

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
which is a Pokemon that evolved into

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.490 
which is a Pokemon that evolved into
meowstic<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:21.060> would<00:00:21.359> look<00:00:21.539> like<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> meowstic

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
meowstic it would look like the meowstic

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.550 
meowstic it would look like the meowstic
on<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.130> left<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.480> female<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.199> spare

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
on the left if you have a female a spare

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
on the left if you have a female a spare
the<00:00:25.710> net<00:00:25.859> would<00:00:25.980> evolve<00:00:26.250> into<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> mystic<00:00:27.119> on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the net would evolve into the mystic on

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.300 
the net would evolve into the mystic on
the<00:00:27.510> right<00:00:27.750> which<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.650> pretty<00:00:28.920> cool<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.279> my

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the right which is pretty cool in my

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
the right which is pretty cool in my
opinion<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:29.880> how<00:00:30.210> they're<00:00:30.390> splitting<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
opinion I like how they're splitting the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020 
opinion I like how they're splitting the
Pokemon<00:00:31.529> depending<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.700> gender<00:00:32.940> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
Pokemon depending on what gender you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.660 
Pokemon depending on what gender you
have<00:00:33.360> them<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.680> note<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.399> male

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
have them all so on that note the male

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.940 
have them all so on that note the male
meowstic<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.450> actually<00:00:36.899> more<00:00:37.050> defensive<00:00:37.649> for

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
meowstic is actually more defensive for

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430 
meowstic is actually more defensive for
as<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.520> female<00:00:38.820> meowstic<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.809> offensive

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
as the female meowstic is more offensive

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.709 
as the female meowstic is more offensive
and<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.430> my<00:00:41.579> opinion<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.360> which<00:00:42.540> one

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and if you want my opinion on which one

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.049 
and if you want my opinion on which one
I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.290> better<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.190> male<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.670> female

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
I think is better of the male or female

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.180 
I think is better of the male or female
I<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.570> definitely<00:00:45.840> go<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.770> female

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I will definitely go with the female

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.299 
I will definitely go with the female
because<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.230> female<00:00:49.440> meowstic<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
because I have a female meowstic and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.760 
because I have a female meowstic and
it's<00:00:50.460> actually<00:00:50.910> very<00:00:51.090> very<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:52.140> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it's actually very very good it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.369 
it's actually very very good it
definitely<00:00:53.399> stands<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.899> had<00:00:55.199> its

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
definitely stands out and it's had its

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.279

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
fair share of one hit KO s it's not a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.670 
fair share of one hit KO s it's not a
really<00:00:58.649> powerful<00:00:59.039> Pokemon<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
really powerful Pokemon but for what it

pokemon with that being said meowstic is
given<00:01:09.630> number<00:01:10.380> five<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.340> countdown

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.740 

number<00:01:16.650> four<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.850> pyroar<00:01:18.420> now

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
number four is going to be pyroar now

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.140 
number four is going to be pyroar now
just<00:01:19.050> like<00:01:19.200> meowstic<00:01:19.680> Pyro's<00:01:20.190> design<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.700> also

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
just like meowstic Pyro's design is also

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.090 
just like meowstic Pyro's design is also
split<00:01:21.390> into<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:21.720> depending<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:22.890> gender

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
split into two depending on the gender

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.090 
split into two depending on the gender
of<00:01:23.370> your<00:01:23.460> lit<00:01:23.880> leo<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.260> have<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.740> male

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
of your lit leo so if you have a male

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.130 
of your lit leo so if you have a male
litleo<00:01:26.550> then<00:01:26.910> it<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.240> eventually<00:01:27.510> evolved

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
litleo then it will eventually evolved

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.680 
litleo then it will eventually evolved
into<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.560> pirate<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> left<00:01:29.760> and<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.660> you

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
into the pirate on the left and if you

into the pirate on the left and if you
have<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> female<00:01:31.410> litleo<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> will

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
have a female litleo then it will

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
have a female litleo then it will
eventually<00:01:32.640> evolved<00:01:33.240> into<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.690> pirate<00:01:34.140> on

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.650 
eventually evolved into the pirate on
the<00:01:34.650> right<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.430> when<00:01:35.700> pyro<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.360> first

noivern<00:04:43.170> it<00:04:43.590> would<00:04:43.740> mainly<00:04:43.980> be<00:04:44.130> because<00:04:44.730> of

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
noivern it would mainly be because of

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.320 
noivern it would mainly be because of
its<00:04:45.180> design<00:04:45.420> it's<00:04:46.230> a<00:04:46.410> dragon<00:04:46.890> with<00:04:47.580> speakers
