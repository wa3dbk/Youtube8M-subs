00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
code just to represent that official

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760 
code just to represent that official
belt<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.329> doesn't<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.869> now

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770

belt but this one doesn't have that now
that's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.310> couple<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.880> black<00:01:57.240> ways<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that's a couple of black ways to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.270 
that's a couple of black ways to
actually<00:01:58.380> find<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> main<00:01:59.219> reason

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
actually find out but the main reason

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.889 
actually find out but the main reason
she'll<00:01:59.790> find<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.770> how<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.979> comes<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
she'll find out is how it comes to you
