what<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.980> do<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.370> dr.<00:02:52.239> day<00:02:52.420> what<00:02:52.780> are<00:02:52.810> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
what to do and dr. day what are the

treatment options available right now

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.210 
treatment options available right now
for<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:55.269> condition<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.800> sooner<00:02:57.190> we

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
for this condition so the sooner we

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.250 
for this condition so the sooner we
treat<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.330> greater<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.750> chance<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.170> we

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
treat it the greater the chance that we

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.199 
treat it the greater the chance that we
have<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.709> getting<00:03:00.160> some<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.730> pigment<00:03:00.940> to

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
have of getting some of the pigment to

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.750 
have of getting some of the pigment to
recover<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.290> idea<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.130> turn<00:03:03.550> off<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
recover so the idea is to turn off the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.000 
recover so the idea is to turn off the
immune<00:03:04.300> process<00:03:04.930> that's<00:03:05.200> making<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:05.620> happen

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
immune process that's making this happen

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.770 
immune process that's making this happen
it's<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.250> localized<00:03:06.700> thing<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.540> first

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
it's a localized thing so the first

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.360 
it's a localized thing so the first
thing<00:03:07.959> we'll<00:03:08.080> try<00:03:08.350> is<00:03:08.620> some<00:03:08.920> topical

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
thing we'll try is some topical

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.070 
thing we'll try is some topical
cortisone<00:03:09.750> prescription-strength

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
cortisone prescription-strength

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.440 
cortisone prescription-strength
topical<00:03:11.530> cortisone<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.220> then<00:03:13.060> on<00:03:13.180> top<00:03:13.390> of

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
topical cortisone and then on top of

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.880 
topical cortisone and then on top of
that<00:03:13.600> if<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:13.959> doesn't<00:03:14.019> work<00:03:14.410> by<00:03:14.620> itself

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
that if that doesn't work by itself

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.890 
that if that doesn't work by itself
there's<00:03:15.220> some<00:03:15.459> steroid<00:03:15.910> sparing<00:03:16.420> products

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
there's some steroid sparing products

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
just generalized stress can make this

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.210 
just generalized stress can make this
come<00:03:36.170> out<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.349> little<00:03:36.530> bit<00:03:36.650> more<00:03:36.829> so<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.040> have

side speaking of tanning sometimes we

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.190 
side speaking of tanning sometimes we
use<00:03:52.250> controlled<00:03:52.849> light<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.660> try<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.900> help

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
use controlled light to try to help

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.410 
use controlled light to try to help
stimulate<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.890> pigment<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.400> come<00:03:55.609> back<00:03:55.819> so

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
stimulate that pigment to come back so

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.910 
stimulate that pigment to come back so
while<00:03:56.629> those<00:03:56.870> areas<00:03:57.260> because<00:03:57.620> there's<00:03:57.799> no

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
while those areas because there's no

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.170 
while those areas because there's no
pigment<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.400> protect<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:58.879> from<00:03:59.000> the

pigment to protect you from the

pigment to protect you from the
ultraviolet<00:03:59.810> rays<00:03:59.989> are<00:04:00.410> more<00:04:00.769> sensitive<00:04:01.430> to

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
ultraviolet rays are more sensitive to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.130 
ultraviolet rays are more sensitive to
light<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:02.060> can<00:04:02.180> burn<00:04:02.390> more<00:04:02.629> easily<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.079> you

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
light and can burn more easily so you

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.539 
light and can burn more easily so you
have<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.470> be<00:04:03.590> careful<00:04:03.920> with<00:04:04.069> sun<00:04:04.220> exposure

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
have to be careful with sun exposure

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.099 
have to be careful with sun exposure
besides<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.390> fact<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.629> they<00:04:05.780> become<00:04:06.079> more

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
besides the fact that they become more

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.140 
besides the fact that they become more
visible<00:04:06.409> when<00:04:06.799> you<00:04:06.890> have<00:04:07.069> a<00:04:07.099> tan<00:04:07.400> we<00:04:07.940> can

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
visible when you have a tan we can

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.720 
visible when you have a tan we can

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
gently use light along with some topical

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.039 
gently use light along with some topical
creams<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.239> make<00:04:11.390> your<00:04:11.510> skin<00:04:11.780> even<00:04:11.900> more

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049

creams that make your skin even more
sensitive<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.829> light<00:04:12.859> to<00:04:13.400> try<00:04:13.609> to<00:04:13.670> encourage

sensitive to light to try to encourage

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.910 
sensitive to light to try to encourage
the<00:04:14.629> immune<00:04:14.930> system<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.379> turn<00:04:15.560> off<00:04:15.739> because

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
the immune system to turn off because

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.800 
the immune system to turn off because
sunlight<00:04:16.549> is<00:04:16.760> also<00:04:17.120> suppressing<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.780> immune

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
sunlight is also suppressing the immune

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.810 
sunlight is also suppressing the immune
system<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.859> can<00:04:18.889> help<00:04:19.160> we<00:04:19.370> stimulate

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
system and it can help we stimulate

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.460 
system and it can help we stimulate
those<00:04:19.970> pigment<00:04:20.389> cells<00:04:20.539> okay

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
those pigment cells okay
