00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.610
 this time the thing goes from jail to cartography you have to be with 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.229
 international plates 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.289
 election is a young man who had everything 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.129
 this I combined it with photography 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.129
 until there came a moment that sucks possible 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.150
 and it was already a serious possibility so 14 a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 precisely to accept 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.820
 this is how England got twisted called me from the United States 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.530
 his career will be announced with the area his house artistic inflation 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.180
 from all sides or is everything that eats what interested me at that time 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.280
 was to have a stay in the south 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.390
 i cohen was more in that at that time he was more fan than 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.870
 then what was crazy when you have until the end with the step 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.700
 of the times 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.100
 without a destination 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.730
 you are there, you are going to present tied hands 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.570
 what more clarity at the time of publishing monthly believes that it is something important 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.220
 in this work the elections like any other product that is sold is 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.550
 are 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 a company 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.400
 If there is not a production that can be maintained monthly, the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.580
 people who work within the north 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.800
 and in this case the beginnings have a leahy template a crucial series is that 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.060
 they read them monthly 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.840
 There are also other products that are thought to be 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.980
 monthly or semi-annual or 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.880
 as only what they opened 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.750
 the monthly comic has to go out 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.580
 it's not important but I joined 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.070
 let's see if you do not deliver your food 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.320
 and maybe they do not throw you that month but the editor does then 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.140
 Out of respect for the rest, people who work 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.140
 there is a character who likes to draw present 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.900
 I think all the characters have their that 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.840
 there are some who are more grateful already at the entrance as it is the case of dismissal 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.210
 brother yo2 that costs a little more neutral of grace but when it happens a 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.920
 couple of numbers that you have caught 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 the the final character and to all all pines 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.109
 and by going down and down to physical health is a real person 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.010
 yes recessive 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.479
 depends and sometimes there are proper characters in a certain way and the hawks 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.219
 believes that he considers that this profession requires 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.999
 which considers that it considered that it requires 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.269
 then another and cycling 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.769
 yes because you do not have a boss who is controlling you but tati phelan 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.099
 gave no delivery test to change 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.649
 and if you are not able to 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.109
 flagellating yourself when you do not feel like the course is like that 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.099
 imagine not working and sent me for a good put simple 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.099
 I think it's important to be clear about your profession 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.569
 It can not be done 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.409
 constant 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
 he anticipated the characters to choose 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.059
 because it always incorporates them is something of you 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.209
 then yes no if you do not get to have the character defined 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.169
 no no no escaped 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.049
 to be like to the collection 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.230
 let's see up characters who did not want to draw an owl 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.189
 olive tree and a few years ago and touched almost everything 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.189
 more widely some than others but really 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:03.809
 all pretty characters
