um<00:00:49.589> so<00:00:50.589> this<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.769> blue<00:00:51.219> which<00:00:51.670> means<00:00:51.940> it's<00:00:52.120> the

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
um so this is blue which means it's the

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.399 
um so this is blue which means it's the
VGA<00:00:52.600> cord<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:55.089> normally<00:00:55.390> would<00:00:55.899> connect

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
VGA cord and it normally would connect

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.729 
VGA cord and it normally would connect
right<00:00:57.190> in<00:00:57.339> here<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.199> looks<00:00:59.379> like<00:00:59.440> there's

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
right in here but it looks like there's

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.009 
right in here but it looks like there's
a<00:00:59.800> cap<00:01:00.069> there<00:01:00.399> which<00:01:00.729> means<00:01:01.479> it's<00:01:01.719> covering

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
a cap there which means it's covering

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.049 
a cap there which means it's covering
the<00:01:02.140> poor<00:01:02.409> and<00:01:02.679> it's<00:01:02.949> disabled<00:01:03.489> because<00:01:03.670> you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
the poor and it's disabled because you

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.000 
the poor and it's disabled because you
have<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.210> graphics<00:01:04.630> card<00:01:04.720> right<00:01:05.050> there<00:01:05.290> okay<00:01:05.800> so

have a graphics card right there okay so

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.800 
have a graphics card right there okay so
let's<00:01:06.310> use<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.640> graphics<00:01:07.000> card<00:01:07.270> yeah<00:01:07.540> well

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
let's use the graphics card yeah well

this is the DVI connector and yeah
exactly<00:01:12.550> it's<00:01:13.090> digital<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:15.130> could<00:01:15.280> go

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
exactly it's digital and it could go

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.750 
exactly it's digital and it could go
right<00:01:15.700> there<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.300> then<00:01:17.280> there's<00:01:18.280> actually<00:01:18.490> a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.910 
of connectors right so one type is a VGA
and<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:19.510> an<00:02:19.690> analog<00:02:20.080> signal<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.770> can

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
and that's an analog signal and you can

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
and that's an analog signal and you can
get<00:02:21.070> really<00:02:21.280> pretty<00:02:21.670> good<00:02:21.910> quality<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:22.570> that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
get really pretty good quality with that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.370 
get really pretty good quality with that
so<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.030> could<00:02:25.330> also<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> graphics<00:02:26.290> card

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
so you could also have a graphics card

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.750 
so you could also have a graphics card
in<00:02:26.710> your<00:02:26.830> PC<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.640> has<00:02:27.940> two<00:02:28.240> DVI<00:02:28.630> connectors

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
in your PC that has two DVI connectors

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.620 
in your PC that has two DVI connectors
or<00:02:30.760> another<00:02:31.660> one<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:33.220> exists<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.210> VGA

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
or another one that exists is like a VGA

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.120 
or another one that exists is like a VGA
and<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:35.170> DVI<00:02:35.470> connector<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:38.260> then<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.010> other

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
and a DVI connector and then the other

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.820 
and a DVI connector and then the other
type<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.340> graphics<00:02:39.730> card<00:02:40.000> has<00:02:40.090> HDMI<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.320> DVI

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
type of graphics card has HDMI and DVI

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.620 
type of graphics card has HDMI and DVI
connectors<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.650> ours<00:02:44.860> okay<00:02:45.700> yeah<00:02:45.940> no<00:02:46.210> VGA

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
connectors this is ours okay yeah no VGA

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.630 
connectors this is ours okay yeah no VGA
on<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.410> actual<00:02:47.830> computer<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:48.490> on<00:02:48.520> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
on the actual computer but on the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.910 
on the actual computer but on the
monitors<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:49.390> don't<00:02:49.570> have<00:02:49.720> HDMI<00:02:50.290> we<00:02:50.530> just<00:02:50.710> have

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
monitors we don't have HDMI we just have

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.979 
monitors we don't have HDMI we just have
VGA<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.580> DVI<00:02:51.790> okay<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.110> it's<00:02:53.440> clear<00:02:53.710> isn't<00:02:53.890> it

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
VGA and DVI okay so it's clear isn't it

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.020 
VGA and DVI okay so it's clear isn't it
VGA<00:02:55.989> has<00:02:56.410> really<00:02:56.920> good<00:02:57.070> signal<00:02:57.310> quality<00:02:57.580> for

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
VGA has really good signal quality for

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.210 
VGA has really good signal quality for
analog<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:59.080> one<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.440> really<00:02:59.739> nice<00:02:59.860> things

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
analog but one of the really nice things

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.050 
analog but one of the really nice things
about<00:03:00.690> HTMI<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.050> DVI<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.560> they're<00:03:02.830> both

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
about HTMI and DVI is they're both

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.790 
about HTMI and DVI is they're both
digital<00:03:04.060> video<00:03:04.570> signals<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.500> get<00:03:05.680> out

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
digital video signals that you get out

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.620 
digital video signals that you get out
so<00:03:06.130> you've<00:03:06.400> got<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> couple<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.910> alternatives

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
so you've got a couple of alternatives

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.750 
so you've got a couple of alternatives
we've<00:03:07.930> got<00:03:08.140> some<00:03:08.410> monitors<00:03:08.950> their<00:03:09.190> HDMI<00:03:09.580> like

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
we've got some monitors their HDMI like

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.390 
we've got some monitors their HDMI like
I've<00:03:09.910> got<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> 22<00:03:10.600> o7h<00:03:11.170> that's<00:03:11.530> right<00:03:11.739> here<00:03:12.190> and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
I've got a 22 o7h that's right here and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.300 
I've got a 22 o7h that's right here and
that's<00:03:12.880> got<00:03:13.060> an<00:03:13.150> HDMI<00:03:13.480> interface<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:15.070> could

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
that's got an HDMI interface you could

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.550 
that's got an HDMI interface you could
swap<00:03:15.700> out<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.030> graphics<00:03:16.450> card<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:17.080> can<00:03:17.350> just

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
swap out the graphics card you can just

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.280 
swap out the graphics card you can just
get<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.190> graphics<00:03:18.610> card<00:03:18.700> like<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.300> one<00:03:19.570> that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
get a graphics card like this one that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.790 
get a graphics card like this one that
has<00:03:20.350> both<00:03:21.010> DVI<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.820> VGA<00:03:22.680> probably<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
has both DVI and VGA probably the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.570 
has both DVI and VGA probably the
simplest<00:03:24.070> thing<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.760> get<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.780> converter<00:03:26.200> now

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
simplest thing is to get a converter now

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.010 
simplest thing is to get a converter now
HDMI<00:03:27.580> has<00:03:27.910> both<00:03:28.780> video<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:30.209> audio<00:03:31.209> signals<00:03:31.870> in

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
HDMI has both video and audio signals in

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.660 
HDMI has both video and audio signals in
it<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.410> when<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.680> use<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:32.860> converter<00:03:33.250> it'll

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
it and when you use a converter it'll

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.949 
it and when you use a converter it'll
strip<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.269> audio<00:03:34.300> out<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:36.600> signal<00:03:37.600> but

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
strip the audio out of the signal but

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.949 
strip the audio out of the signal but
that's<00:03:38.290> okay<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.100> yeah<00:03:39.610> you'll<00:03:40.540> be<00:03:40.570> able<00:03:40.750> to

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
that's okay is it yeah you'll be able to

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.720 
that's okay is it yeah you'll be able to
plug<00:03:41.140> in<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.320> separate<00:03:41.800> audio<00:03:41.950> cable<00:03:42.519> like<00:03:42.700> this

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
plug in a separate audio cable like this

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.650 
plug in a separate audio cable like this
from<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.750> PC<00:03:44.290> into<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.400> monitor<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.450> we'll

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
from the PC into the monitor so we'll

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.509 
from the PC into the monitor so we'll
still<00:03:46.930> be<00:03:47.050> able<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.290> get<00:03:47.440> audio<00:03:47.860> yeah<00:03:48.280> you'll

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
still be able to get audio yeah you'll

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.640 
still be able to get audio yeah you'll
still<00:03:48.730> be<00:03:48.820> able<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.030> get<00:03:49.150> audio<00:03:49.480> but<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
still be able to get audio but the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.140 
still be able to get audio but the
simplest<00:03:51.100> thing<00:03:51.280> for<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.550> video<00:03:51.760> signals

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
simplest thing for the video signals

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.520 
simplest thing for the video signals
probably<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.510> use<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.660> converter<00:03:52.750> like<00:03:53.260> this

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
probably to use a converter like this

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.420 
probably to use a converter like this
that'll<00:03:53.830> take<00:03:54.480> HDMI<00:03:55.480> video<00:03:55.930> signal<00:03:56.560> into<00:03:57.130> a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
that'll take HDMI video signal into a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.270 
that'll take HDMI video signal into a
DVI<00:03:58.420> video<00:03:58.870> signal<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.410> there's<00:03:59.709> no

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
DVI video signal and there's no

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.250 
DVI video signal and there's no
conversion<00:04:00.700> from<00:04:01.120> digital<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.510> analog<00:04:02.049> and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
conversion from digital to analog and

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.020 
conversion from digital to analog and
then<00:04:02.350> back<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.739> digital<00:04:02.890> as<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.340> go<00:04:03.459> into<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
then back to digital as you go into the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.820 
then back to digital as you go into the
yeah<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:04.990> just<00:04:05.020> give<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.680> like<00:04:05.800> a

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
yeah so just give that in like a

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.680 
yeah so just give that in like a
confused<00:04:06.220> oh<00:04:06.490> yeah<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.060> could<00:04:07.270> get<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.630> a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
confused oh yeah you could get that in a

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.590 
confused oh yeah you could get that in a
computer<00:04:07.930> store<00:04:08.110> or<00:04:08.560> take<00:04:09.160> this<00:04:09.250> one<00:04:09.600> you're

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
computer store or take this one you're

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.080 
computer store or take this one you're
really<00:04:10.720> nice

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
really nice

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:22.430 
really nice
