 particular of croquettes which is a 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.210
 chrome is what punctured what it dates 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.850
 of course escoffier it was 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.520
 the first bathe flowing in fact 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.830
 often it's a device we say in 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.140
 cooking flowing with as sometimes 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.450
 vegetables or products 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.600
 it can be seen where it can be and 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.340
 omar or a meat and there we stalled 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.380
 what with a mushroom juice the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.690
 skimmed sprouts and mushrooms 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.660
 but if I tell you if I'm wrong and 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.010
 usually we will work a 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.650
 device that will be cool year to temperature 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.880
 we will freeze it so 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.070
 to give shape there is the form 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.020
 spherical then the breakdown and to English 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.790
 for example and then took it for 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.920
 that he finds his warmth here it is there 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.900
 that the technique has evolved a lot because 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.820
 that the time of a escoffier 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.990
 new college angry by sticking on 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.400
 made sense a little thicker 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.560
 often called villeroy sauces 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.110
 with chicken broth or 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.030
 fish-based and one is cold weather 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.050
 for her to take a little and one is 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.380
 no halls anglet with white 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.970
 egg 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.160
 because it was much more 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.270
 crisp and a good bread crumbs but 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.610
 the pure purchase that we want but often 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.980
 a breadcrumb that has a lot of white rain and 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.990
 the frana sanaa the most beautiful effect here 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.350
 that it obviously wants to give a 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.610
 this is where the whole crust is down 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.960
 and where in breadcrumbs that will hold 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.370
 the whole while the inside 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.780
 flowing when the rooster is done 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.400
 attention generally from 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.530
 turns and by subscriber then there all 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.910
 the trick and it's actually frying them to 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.710
 very high temperature so that the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.880
 color take very quickly everything 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.770
 just so they do not lend 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.960
 the fat we quote it is put in the oven and 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.810
 the interior is warming up 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.000
