00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the 400,000 apartment now which is my

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.850 
friend's apartment but he done the ditch
that<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.430> was<00:02:30.580> talking<00:02:30.700> about<00:02:30.849> last<00:02:31.239> video<00:02:31.860> you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
that I was talking about last video you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.190 
that I was talking about last video you
can<00:02:33.099> google<00:02:33.489> if<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.849> want<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.239> he<00:02:34.630> has<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
can google if you want and he has the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.559 
can google if you want and he has the
four-inch<00:02:35.500> files<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.890> problem<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:37.300> once

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
four-inch files in the problem so once

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.850 
four-inch files in the problem so once
again<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> planning<00:02:38.650> room

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
again I think that's the planning room

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.140 
again I think that's the planning room
where<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.310> Planning<00:02:39.670> Board<00:02:39.700> will<00:02:40.030> be

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
where the Planning Board will be

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.900 
where the Planning Board will be
available<00:02:40.630> for<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.870> DRC<00:02:41.080> that's<00:02:42.040> what<00:02:42.280> my<00:02:42.610> I'm

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
available for the DRC that's what my I'm

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.940 
available for the DRC that's what my I'm
guessing<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.840> we<00:02:44.019> would<00:02:44.380> come<00:02:44.560> into<00:02:44.709> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
guessing so we would come into the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.100 
guessing so we would come into the
lounge<00:02:45.430> again<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:46.030> see<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.390> views<00:02:46.630> compared

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
lounge again you see the views compared

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.979 
lounge again you see the views compared
to<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.880> 210,000<00:02:48.880> apartment<00:02:49.299> now<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.690> views

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
to the 210,000 apartment now the views

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.390 
to the 210,000 apartment now the views
of<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.200> four<00:02:50.410> hundred<00:02:50.470> thousand<00:02:50.950> upon<00:02:51.160> me<00:02:51.310> are

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
of the four hundred thousand upon me are

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.009 
of the four hundred thousand upon me are
pretty<00:02:51.610> amazing<00:02:51.940> compared<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.630> my<00:02:52.810> apartment

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
pretty amazing compared to my apartment

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.910 
pretty amazing compared to my apartment
but<00:02:53.830> as<00:02:54.099> you<00:02:55.060> can<00:02:55.120> see<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:56.230> whole<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.769> whole

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
but as you can see the whole the whole

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.979 
but as you can see the whole the whole
apartment<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.670> exactly<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.390> same<00:02:58.599> as<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> two

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989

hundred ten thousand one and the only

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.420 
hundred ten thousand one and the only
