stop oak well for example in this case
if<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.280> got<00:00:47.489> enough<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> early<00:00:48.270> enough<00:00:48.300> we

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
if we got enough to it early enough we

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.209 
if we got enough to it early enough we
would<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.110> able<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.379> trench<00:00:49.680> down<00:00:50.010> in

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
would have be able to trench down in

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.979 
would have be able to trench down in
here<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.520> break<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> root<00:00:51.270> systems<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
here on break up the root systems to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.619 
here on break up the root systems to
stop<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.440> fungus<00:00:52.890> however<00:00:53.760> no<00:00:54.000> trenches<00:00:54.480> were

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
stop the fungus however no trenches were

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.540 
stop the fungus however no trenches were
laid<00:00:54.870> down<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
laid down in there so as you can see the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.450 
laid down in there so as you can see the
fungus<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.120> keeps<00:00:57.329> moving<00:00:57.570> along<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.129> right

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
fungus just keeps moving along and right

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
fungus just keeps moving along and right
here<00:00:59.489> we're<00:00:59.969> taking<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.359> look<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.629> example<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
here we're taking a look at example of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.110 
here we're taking a look at example of
where<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> trench<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.609> good<00:01:02.640> when

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
where a trench can do some good when

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.549 
where a trench can do some good when
they're<00:01:03.270> put<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.600> early<00:01:03.930> enough<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> they're

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
they're put in early enough and they're

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.450 
they're put in early enough and they're
placed<00:01:04.799> properly<00:01:05.450> right<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.170> right

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
placed properly right here on your right

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.690 
placed properly right here on your right
you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.820> healthy<00:01:09.240> trees<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.430> your

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you can see healthy trees and on on your

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.880 
you can see healthy trees and on on your
left<00:01:11.970> right<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.659> where<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.470> fungus

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
left right here is where the the fungus

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
left right here is where the the fungus
has<00:01:14.100> moved<00:01:14.460> through<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> root<00:01:15.210> systems<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
has moved through the root systems of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.780 
has moved through the root systems of
the<00:01:15.930> trees<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.560> killed<00:01:16.830> them<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.250> I'm

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the trees and killed them and I'm

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
the trees and killed them and I'm
standing<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.840> where<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> trench<00:01:19.500> was

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
standing just about where the trench was

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
standing just about where the trench was
laid<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> runs<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:20.939> through<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
laid and it runs back there through the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.679 
laid and it runs back there through the
woods<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.159> in<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.880> where<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> trench<00:01:24.479> was

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
woods and in this is where a trench was

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
woods and in this is where a trench was
properly<00:01:25.080> placed<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.850> far<00:01:27.119> has<00:01:27.299> been

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
properly placed and in so far has been

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
properly placed and in so far has been
holding<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:28.049> nicely<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.680> protecting<00:01:29.220> the

trees by breaking up the root system so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.340 
trees by breaking up the root system so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that the fungus cannot be transmitted

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
that the fungus cannot be transmitted
