 look more flat and rounded when 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.750
 this desktop icon design is not 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.750
 has changed 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.920
 The camera is worthy of a flagship smartphone 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.690

 In this apparatus samsung refused 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.010
 the rounded ends of the body shape has become 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.330
 more stringent like 03

 design did not receive all the elements 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.310
 interface however we hope that 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.000
 Samsung will continue to develop a new
