00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.190
 to look for the ball 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.400
 it's some girls that for me have a 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.379
 impressive predisposition that 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.860
 like to work we have been doing good 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.570
 work we have doing the job 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.500
 both the group and four people 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.500
 last 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.770
 change the truth is that the few months 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.740
 that I have here 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.770
 I found two girls of the level 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.350
 different but today I would say 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.620
 I would dare to say what they are at par 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.570
 at par and that they are working very 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.540
 well the girls who love to work 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.550
 have a predisposition to work 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.550
 awesome and I'm very happy now 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.990
 above 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.260
 the two 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.710
 I seek I would care and endure 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.200
 well I think we are lucky 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.250
 have a great sponsor like the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.860
 frisking we have the best brand of gloves 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.840
 possibly from Spain and Europe and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.300
 well let's hope they keep telling a lot 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.130
 time with us because for us 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.400
 it's better brand of gloves that I've had 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.500
 so far and good gives us the facility 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.960
 to give us a glove every time we ask 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.840
 and it 's a show does not have much 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.580
 security very much grip even when the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.420
 field is wet and good is a 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.420
 glove spectator 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.800
 more and more they are focusing every time 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.020
 more in the figure of the goalie and in giving it 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.910
 importance and in giving it benefits 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.250
 so you can do your job the best 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.390
 possible and I think it's one of the brands 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.900
 who is trying and especially in 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.900
 women's football 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.450
 I think we are working 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.829
 pretty good and I think this year it 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.959
 note in each separate game that the 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.760
 team is also defending very well 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.090
 is pressing up we're 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.150
 working because you can see that 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.150
 that we are working and every day and 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.920
 two equally 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.920
 then matches were reflected
