during<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> summertime<00:01:31.740> i<00:01:32.150> found<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.329> when

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
during the summertime i found that when

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.090 
during the summertime i found that when
i<00:01:33.479> first<00:01:33.780> bought<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.170> during<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> warmer

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
i first bought this during the warmer

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.469 
i first bought this during the warmer
months<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.960> didn't<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:38.310> too<00:01:38.340> much<00:01:39.119> for

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
months it didn't really do too much for

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.929 
months it didn't really do too much for
me<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
me and I think it's because when the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
me and I think it's because when the
temperatures<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.990> three<00:01:43.380> digits<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
temperatures get to be three digits a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.100 
temperatures get to be three digits a
lot<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.729> things<00:01:44.850> are<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.049> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
lot of things are really just going to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.950 
lot of things are really just going to
melt<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.850> went<00:01:48.000> towards<00:01:48.479> cooler

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
melt off but as it went towards cooler

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.310 
melt off but as it went towards cooler
fall<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.619> winter<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.850> foundation<00:01:51.600> really

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.890 
hand oh that reminds me i find the best
best<00:04:06.389> method<00:04:07.379> to<00:04:08.000> apply<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.449> with<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
best method to apply this is with a

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.530 
best method to apply this is with a
stippling<00:04:10.440> brush<00:04:10.799> i<00:04:11.159> tried<00:04:11.849> with<00:04:12.000> my<00:04:12.120> fingers

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
stippling brush i tried with my fingers

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.170 
stippling brush i tried with my fingers
and<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:13.139> have<00:04:13.319> tried<00:04:13.620> with<00:04:13.889> a<00:04:13.919> sponge

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
and I have tried with a sponge

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.080 
and I have tried with a sponge
and<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.719> find<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:17.009> sponge<00:04:17.340> makes<00:04:17.699> it<00:04:17.940> a

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
and I find that the sponge makes it a

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.319 
and I find that the sponge makes it a
little<00:04:18.329> too<00:04:18.660> heavy<00:04:18.930> for<00:04:19.259> this<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.940> my<00:04:20.940> fingers

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
little too heavy for this and my fingers

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.960 
little too heavy for this and my fingers
it<00:04:22.109> just<00:04:22.320> doesn't<00:04:22.500> seem<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:23.009> do<00:04:23.490> anything<00:04:23.789> but

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
it just doesn't seem to do anything but

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.779 
it just doesn't seem to do anything but
with<00:04:24.509> a<00:04:24.690> stippling<00:04:25.110> brush<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.800> think<00:04:26.550> this

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
with a stippling brush I think this

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.510 
with a stippling brush I think this
works<00:04:27.030> really<00:04:27.300> nicely<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.289> I<00:04:28.590> hope<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.220> was

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
works really nicely so I hope this was

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.510 
works really nicely so I hope this was
helpful<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:30.180> would<00:04:30.449> say<00:04:30.660> if<00:04:30.960> your<00:04:31.139> oily<00:04:31.830> to
