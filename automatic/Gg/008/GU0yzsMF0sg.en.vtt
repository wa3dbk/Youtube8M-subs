00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
put on the new one so I'll just go to

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.710

short<00:01:11.830> on<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:11.980> uh<00:01:15.060> flex<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.210> this<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:16.690> you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
short on that uh flex you this so you

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.800 
short on that uh flex you this so you
can<00:01:16.840> see<00:01:17.230> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.210 

we<00:01:22.140> insist

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.190 

so<00:01:28.730> I<00:01:28.760> pretty<00:01:29.120> much<00:01:29.210> just<00:01:29.330> cut<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:29.870> and<00:01:29.990> then

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
so I pretty much just cut it and then

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.670 
so I pretty much just cut it and then
just<00:01:30.230> had<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.650> sand<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.540> all<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:33.350> way<00:01:33.500> around

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
just had to sand it all the way around

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
just had to sand it all the way around
and<00:01:34.280> get<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.550> nicer<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:35.420> nice<00:01:36.050> edge<00:01:36.410> on<00:01:36.800> it<00:01:36.830> so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.429 

then<00:01:51.210> yeah<00:01:51.360> that's<00:01:51.539> pretty<00:01:51.689> much<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.320> then

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
then yeah that's pretty much it and then

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.310 
then yeah that's pretty much it and then
it<00:01:52.560> just

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
it just

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.760 
it just
closes<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.430> same<00:01:55.700> way<00:01:55.909> as<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.510> as<00:01:57.110> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
closes the same way as the as the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.550 
closes the same way as the as the
original<00:01:58.159> one<00:01:58.340> did
