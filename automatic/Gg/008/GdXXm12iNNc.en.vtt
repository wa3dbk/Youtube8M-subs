 accommodate for reason is not talent is not 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.119
 the skill simply boils down to 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.950
 How hungry are you? What's your hunger? 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.140
 hunger for improvement 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.310
 How big is your appetite for

 success 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.030
 What are you willing to do to 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.879

 the professionals are better than they are 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.280
 do they do not care for opinions of 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.540
 Third parties do not care how far 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.629
 have a does not take a day off them 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.609
 100% preparing their way in 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.400
 perfect what they do best 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.769
 because all for the much greater purpose 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.420
 than any spark of happiness that 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.540
 an immediate bonus can 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.169
 achieve your goals 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.739
 this is pure tension the greater the 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:57.040
 expectations the higher the goal but 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.150
 this feeling is then amplified 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.019
 it's the difference between you 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.269
 professionals are those who are 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:13.750
 wanting to knock on the door of 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:18.310
 exhausted poet every single day and left 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:22.060
 To define exhaustion for you exhaustion is 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.200
 that point where it's so painful that 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.299
 You can not force that one anymore. 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.180
 It hurts so much that you do not 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.840
 Can not even think about getting there. 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.069
 to that point you know you did 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.099
 absolutely everything in its power to 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.329
 there's nothing else you could have 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.920
 done 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:50.019
 So what's the difference between them and you? 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.099
 What are you doing at this stage of the 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.010
 your life 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.590
 ask if you are walking to 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.590
 closer to your goals or are you 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.980
 away from them you are hitting 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.829
 exhaust ports or is only 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.980
 uncomfortable know how to be uncomfortable 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.620
 it's not exhaustion being uncomfortable 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.010
 your mind giving up before the body 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.450
 being uncomfortable is giving up when 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.799
 should strive for excellence 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.169
 happens when you're going to do something 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.610
 thing that will end you 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:30.370
 just to make you better from here you are 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.560
 its own creator of this story and not 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.080
 there is this business called failure 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.910
 You just need to talk to yourself, no. 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.720
 not this time 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.180
 not with me but I'll try again and 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.610
 again and again and will look for 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.220
 eyes and talk to 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.500
 she and I am willing to do everything and 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.300
 any effort to reach my 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.180
 goals 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.760
 because there is never any effort 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.210
 progress 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.730
 it all boils down to how much you want it 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.040
 How big is your appetite for 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.470
 success 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.010
 you just what to make an angel or are 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:16.260
 starving to continue your 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.260
 continuous goal directed
