going to start off on the top floor

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.429 
going to start off on the top floor
which<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.910> way<00:00:24.170> this<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.230> my

which is just this way this is my

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.050 
which is just this way this is my
bedroom<00:00:25.710> which<00:00:26.369> as<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.730> might<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.000> noticed

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
bedroom which as you might have noticed

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
bedroom which as you might have noticed
is<00:00:27.750> substantially<00:00:28.529> less<00:00:28.650> interesting<00:00:29.340> than

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is substantially less interesting than

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.250 
is substantially less interesting than
previous<00:00:30.150> bedrooms<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.900> I've<00:00:31.050> had

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
previous bedrooms that I've had

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.780 
previous bedrooms that I've had
basically<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.250> more<00:00:32.399> space<00:00:32.640> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
basically now that we have more space I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
basically now that we have more space I
realized<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.329> could<00:00:33.480> use<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.870> bedroom

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
realized that I could use the bedroom

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.520 
realized that I could use the bedroom
just<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> room<00:00:35.940> where<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> bed<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
just to be the room where the bed is and

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.750 
just to be the room where the bed is and
not<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> room<00:00:38.129> where<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.340> make<00:00:38.489> all<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.670> videos

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
not the room where I make all the videos

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
not the room where I make all the videos
and<00:00:39.030> stuff<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.719> there's<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and stuff so there's not really that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.290 
and stuff so there's not really that
