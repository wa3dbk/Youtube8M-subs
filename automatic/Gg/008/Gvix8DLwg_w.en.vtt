00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
bit more in detail so to start off with

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.049 
bit more in detail so to start off with
this<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.990> x5<00:00:13.380> 35<00:00:14.099> D<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.820> our

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
this is the x5 35 D so this is our

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.510 
this is the x5 35 D so this is our

diesel<00:00:18.170> it's<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> new<00:00:19.680> power<00:00:19.890> plant<00:00:19.980> for

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
diesel it's a it's a new power plant for

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.740 
diesel it's a it's a new power plant for
us<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.580> 2009<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.199> generates<00:00:23.420> 265<00:00:24.420> brake

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
us in 2009 and this generates 265 brake

horsepower<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:26.060> 425<00:00:27.060> pounds<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.599> torque<00:00:27.779> it's

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
horsepower but 425 pounds of torque it's

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.599 
horsepower but 425 pounds of torque it's
actually<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.769> eight<00:00:28.949> more<00:00:29.160> than<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.429> Dodge

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
actually what eight more than a Dodge

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.910 
actually what eight more than a Dodge
Hemi<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.510> uh<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.500> appreciate<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
Hemi so it's uh you can appreciate the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.979 
Hemi so it's uh you can appreciate the
amount<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> performance<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.780> crammed

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
amount of performance they get crammed

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.260 
amount of performance they get crammed
into<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.320> x5<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.040> 5200<00:00:35.790> pound<00:00:35.969> vehicle

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
into this x5 it's a 5200 pound vehicle

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.650 
into this x5 it's a 5200 pound vehicle
it's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.380> zero<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> 60<00:00:38.640> time<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.000> under<00:00:39.300> seven

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it's a zero to 60 time is under seven

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.270 
it's a zero to 60 time is under seven
seconds<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.320> yields<00:00:40.620> back<00:00:40.739> thirty<00:00:41.160> eight

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
seconds and yields back thirty eight

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.580 
seconds and yields back thirty eight
miles<00:00:41.489> per<00:00:41.640> gallon<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.110> perfect<00:00:43.440> blend

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
miles per gallon so just a perfect blend

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100 
miles per gallon so just a perfect blend
of<00:00:43.860> economy<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.910> performance<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:45.780> into<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
of economy and performance into into a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930 
of economy and performance into into a
one<00:00:46.350> vehicle<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.250> available<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
one vehicle and it's now available as a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.420 
one vehicle and it's now available as a
seven<00:00:48.180> passenger<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.739> doesn't<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.160> more

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
seven passenger so it doesn't get more

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.220 
seven passenger so it doesn't get more
more<00:00:50.969> practical<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.539> user-friendly<00:00:51.840> than

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
more practical or user-friendly than

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.340 
more practical or user-friendly than
this<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.420> as<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:54.719> those<00:00:55.020> standard

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
this so as you can see those standard

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.650 
this so as you can see those standard

are<00:01:26.580> also<00:01:26.700> important<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> note<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> bi-xenon

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
are also important to note as a bi-xenon

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
are also important to note as a bi-xenon
headlights<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.040> high<00:01:29.280> beam<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.670> low<00:01:29.970> beam

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

both Xenon's fog lights down below and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.469 
both Xenon's fog lights down below and
from<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> front<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> design

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
from the front some of the design

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
from the front some of the design
characteristics<00:01:37.079> ace<00:01:37.200> body<00:01:37.439> style<00:01:37.680> changed
