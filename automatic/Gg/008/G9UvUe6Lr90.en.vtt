00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.210

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.809
 be well I am buzek and bring you a 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.970
 new video of the viking island is already the 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.780
 third part of the part of the loqui and 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.370
 well let's press it 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.890
 and let's see what it asks and asks 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.080
 food that's nothing to explain 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.960
 it simply has simply the has 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.960
 to fill in and I 'm going to fill it 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.450
 asks hammers or hammers that 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.040
 you get every 12 hours and as you already know 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.250
 they turned 12 o'clock I'm going to collect 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.780
 others will already have 6 and the horne will 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.670
 they get when they send gifts they squeeze 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.970
 here and they simply send them to their 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.970
 friends 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.390
 they put you select all so that you 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.190
 accept us all as I already have 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.460
 enough resources I will complete 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.440
 this this event of loc and good in the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.840
 part of what I'm going to fill in these 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.730
 hammer 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.730
 this this 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.500
 and since I no longer have a hammer and I do not want 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.870
 wait another 12 hours rather more than 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.930
 12 hours to collect 3 promissory notes 13 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.180
 gems this way if the bind here 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.400
 I will attend, I will have to fight with 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.030
 what but if I squeeze you here I will not have 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030
 to fight with him 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.240
 and well I do not know what to do because if 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.610
 I do not want to invest more gems for 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.610
 that's what I'm going to buy for 13 gems 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.780
 so as not to have to fight with what 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.780
 if I get to lose 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.710
 and well here is the dragon as you can 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.299
 see they say that you can find it in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.299
 warehouse and we give in ok 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.900
 and now we have to see our warehouse 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.900
 to see if we really have it 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.400
 as you can see here is the crazy dragon 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.290
 it sells for 100,000 and then we're going to 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.230
 place it 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.230
 and this egg will be solved in 16 hours 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.370
 and then practically this would almost be 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.140
 the whole event I would only miss the part 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.250
 from audouin asking for helmet horne 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.250
 and food 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.890
 This I think will be the easiest 1 2 3 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.420
 two 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.580
 in fact I could already complete this 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.760
 right now 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.880
 and pay the gelman that fast but 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.910
 well this will happen in the next video 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.130
 to subscribe to my channel 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.500
 If you want to know more about these 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.010
 dragon city events want to know 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.210
 how to do what has to be done in 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.430
 the events and things like that and also not 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.750
 forget to give the fanpage scale of the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.620
 page that comes being bonds on youtube 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.800
 that can be found in the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.890
 description I'll leave you link and then 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.380
 simply this has been all guys we 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.290
 we see in an upcoming video of the island 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.470
 Viking or maybe another I do not know what 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.070
 because of the dragon hammer there is no video 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.010
 I do not like that dragon, I do not know why 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.560
 but I'm going to close it and just 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.510
 this has been everything and we see ourselves in a 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.510
 next video guys bye
