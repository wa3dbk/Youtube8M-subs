in<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.770> last<00:00:01.949> couple<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.340> tutorials<00:00:02.490> we<00:00:03.030> were

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
in the last couple of tutorials we were

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.749 
in the last couple of tutorials we were
looking<00:00:03.540> at<00:00:03.689> armatures<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.650> bones<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.580> their

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
looking at armatures and bones and their

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.730 
looking at armatures and bones and their
objects<00:00:06.240> attached<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.839> them<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.379> we<00:00:07.620> were

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
objects attached to them and we were

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.500 
objects attached to them and we were
making<00:00:08.250> nice<00:00:08.400> curved<00:00:08.790> objects<00:00:09.210> like<00:00:09.360> for

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
making nice curved objects like for

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.450 
making nice curved objects like for
instance<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.840> could<00:00:09.990> just<00:00:10.170> have<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.219> bone

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
instance I could just have this bone

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.610 
instance I could just have this bone
selected<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.120> pose<00:00:12.360> mode<00:00:12.389> right<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.170> and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
selected in pose mode right here and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.890 
selected in pose mode right here and
press<00:00:14.610> my<00:00:14.790> shift<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.420> I've<00:00:15.570> done<00:00:15.780> before

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
press my shift I like I've done before

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.109 
press my shift I like I've done before
and<00:00:16.350> get<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> new<00:00:16.710> empty<00:00:16.949> target<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.850> and

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and get a new empty target like that and

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.390 
and get a new empty target like that and
then<00:00:19.109> go<00:00:19.260> select<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.680> target<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> right

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
then go select the target with the right

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.300 
then go select the target with the right
mouse<00:00:20.609> button<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.240> then<00:00:22.050> press<00:00:22.080> G<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.980> I'm

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
mouse button and then press G and I'm

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.490 
mouse button and then press G and I'm
instantly<00:00:23.699> controlling<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> object<00:00:25.140> like

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
instantly controlling the object like

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.349 
instantly controlling the object like
this<00:00:25.769> alright<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.000> way<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.300> were

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
this alright so that was one way we were

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
this alright so that was one way we were
doing<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.199> another<00:00:28.439> way<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.890> we

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
doing it and then another way is we

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.730 
doing it and then another way is we
could<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.640> come<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.300> maybe<00:00:31.050> selected

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
could have come in and maybe selected

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.709 
could have come in and maybe selected
this<00:00:31.859> bone<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.340> well<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.730> pressed<00:00:33.030> shift<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
this bone as well and pressed shift I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.870 
this bone as well and pressed shift I
and<00:00:34.050> added<00:00:34.590> another<00:00:34.860> empty<00:00:35.130> at<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.430> location

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and added another empty at that location

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.500 
and added another empty at that location
and<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.440> would<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.640> press<00:00:38.940> G<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and this this would if I press G it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.040 
and this this would if I press G it
would<00:00:39.750> control<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.790> bone<00:00:41.790> back<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.570> except

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
would control the bone back there except

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.910 
would control the bone back there except
for<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.469> target<00:00:44.100> never<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.920> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
for this target never go and do that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
for this target never go and do that
bone<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> spine<00:00:48.210> notice<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
bone and go to the spine notice the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.060 
bone and go to the spine notice the
chain<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.260> down<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.920> make

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
chain is down there so I'm gonna make

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.970 
chain is down there so I'm gonna make
the<00:00:50.219> chain<00:00:50.489> length<00:00:51.500> it's<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.770> couple

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the chain length it's just a couple

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.299 
the chain length it's just a couple
bones<00:00:53.760> back<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.840> target<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:56.190> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
bones back so now this target here if I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.819 
bones back so now this target here if I
press<00:00:56.579> G<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.870> control<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
press G this can control the back of the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.180 
press G this can control the back of the
target<00:00:59.250> there<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.989> control<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
target there and this can control the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.600 
target there and this can control the
front<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.189> here

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
front of it like up in here

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.359 
front of it like up in here
alright<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.420> based<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.799> well<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.189> can

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
alright so based on do that well we can

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.820 
alright so based on do that well we can
make<00:01:08.490> these<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.540> curvy<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> shapes

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
make these you know curvy kind of shapes

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.039 
make these you know curvy kind of shapes
as<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.280> want<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.299> alright<00:01:12.780> well<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
as we want like that alright well so

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.780 
as we want like that alright well so
that's<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.189> or<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.580> could<00:01:14.670> have

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that's that's one way or you could have

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
that's that's one way or you could have
used<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.210> regular<00:01:15.659> detached<00:01:16.020> bones<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
used just regular detached bones and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.539 
used just regular detached bones and
gave<00:01:17.189> those<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.970> constraints<00:01:19.009> okay<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.430> but

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
gave those I can constraints okay so but

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.690 
gave those I can constraints okay so but
let's<00:01:20.850> control<00:01:21.180> Z<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.659> those<00:01:22.520> get<00:01:23.520> rid<00:01:23.640> of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
let's control Z out of those get rid of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
let's control Z out of those get rid of
those<00:01:23.790> bones<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.659> mean<00:01:25.290> I'll<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.470> rid<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> those

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
those bones I mean I'll get rid of those

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.609 
those bones I mean I'll get rid of those
empties<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:26.960> okay<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.290> back<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
empties for now okay there it is back to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.560 
empties for now okay there it is back to
there<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.460> we'll<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
there so now what we'll do is here is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
there so now what we'll do is here is
the<00:01:30.720> same<00:01:30.930> armature<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the same armature and now I have the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.480 
the same armature and now I have the
last<00:01:32.759> bone<00:01:33.200> if<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.470> armature<00:01:34.860> selected<00:01:35.310> bone

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
last bone if the armature selected bone

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.510 
last bone if the armature selected bone
0:09<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.860> case<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.100> want<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.460> get

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
0:09 and in this case I want to just get

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.100 
0:09 and in this case I want to just get
a<00:01:38.579> different<00:01:39.000> constraint<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.750> want<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> try

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
a different constraint and I want to try

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.830 
a different constraint and I want to try
and<00:01:40.229> make<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:41.040> armature<00:01:41.610> conform<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and make the armature conform to the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.300 
and make the armature conform to the
shape<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.409> curve<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
shape of a curve and this is just a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.330 
shape of a curve and this is just a
regular<00:01:44.460> NURBS<00:01:44.939> path<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.229> come<00:01:47.220> over

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
regular NURBS path it was just come over

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100 
regular NURBS path it was just come over
here<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:47.880> press<00:01:48.119> shift<00:01:48.390> day<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.840> went

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
here and you just press shift day I went

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.130 
here and you just press shift day I went
down<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.380> curve<00:01:49.619> curve<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> path

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
down and curve curve and I got a path

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.490 
down and curve curve and I got a path
like<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.649> or<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.920> could<00:01:53.159> use<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> Bezier<00:01:53.729> curve

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
like that or I could use a Bezier curve

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
like that or I could use a Bezier curve
but<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.009> NURBS<00:01:56.310> path<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
but I have it just a NURBS path for the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.240 
but I have it just a NURBS path for the
moment<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.500> then<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.770> bone<00:01:59.009> nine

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
moment and then with this bone nine

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
moment and then with this bone nine
selected<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.450> new<00:02:00.570> constraint

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
selected I just go get a new constraint

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
selected I just go get a new constraint
and<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.740> time<00:02:01.979> I'll<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> spline<00:02:02.850> Heike

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and this time I'll get it a spline Heike

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.840 
and this time I'll get it a spline Heike
constraint<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> easy<00:02:05.430> part<00:02:05.549> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
constraint and this is the easy part of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.399 
constraint and this is the easy part of
the<00:02:05.909> lesson<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.360> second<00:02:06.869> part<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.110> lessons<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the lesson the second part of lessons a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.779 
the lesson the second part of lessons a
little<00:02:07.590> trickier<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.069> I'll<00:02:08.459> probably<00:02:08.580> do

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
little trickier and I'll probably do

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.970 
little trickier and I'll probably do
this<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:08.970> two<00:02:09.209> parts<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> result

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
this in two parts as a result

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.930 
this in two parts as a result
so<00:02:12.879> now<00:02:13.000> with<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:14.099> can<00:02:15.099> spike<00:02:15.760> a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
so now with this I can spike a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.520 
so now with this I can spike a
constraint<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.810> simply<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> matter<00:02:17.379> of

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
constraint that is simply a matter of

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.380 
constraint that is simply a matter of
picking<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.519> name<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.910> curve<00:02:19.090> which<00:02:19.360> is

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
picking the name of the curve which is

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.960 
picking the name of the curve which is
in<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.230> case<00:02:20.379> NURBS<00:02:20.739> path<00:02:21.129> which<00:02:21.580> I'll<00:02:21.760> do

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
in this case NURBS path which I'll do

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.350 
in this case NURBS path which I'll do
and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:24.040> when<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.370> do<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:24.849> well

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
and then when you do it it's like well

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.020 
and then when you do it it's like well
that<00:02:25.390> looks<00:02:25.690> goofy<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:27.040> know<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.430> doesn't

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
that looks goofy you know that doesn't

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.550 
that looks goofy you know that doesn't
seem<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.269> work<00:02:28.390> out<00:02:28.599> right<00:02:28.840> but<00:02:29.080> it's<00:02:29.230> it's

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
seem to work out right but it's it's

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.240 
seem to work out right but it's it's
working

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
working

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.509 
working
what's<00:02:30.610> doing<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.209> basically<00:02:32.099> for<00:02:33.099> that<00:02:33.220> first

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
what's doing is basically for that first

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.250 
what's doing is basically for that first
bone<00:02:33.819> it's<00:02:34.120> trying<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.450> match<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.870> entire

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
bone it's trying to match the entire

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.830 
bone it's trying to match the entire
curve<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.610> first<00:02:36.880> bone<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.450> that's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
curve to that first bone and that's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.539 
curve to that first bone and that's
because<00:02:38.019> this<00:02:38.200> chain<00:02:38.530> length<00:02:38.799> is<00:02:39.010> set<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.340> 1

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
because this chain length is set to 1

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.119 
because this chain length is set to 1
but<00:02:40.060> if<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.299> send<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:40.690> for<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.319> all<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.950> the

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
but if I send it for that all of the

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.339 
but if I send it for that all of the
lengths<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.849> chain<00:02:43.120> you'll<00:02:43.569> see<00:02:43.780> as<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.049> add

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
lengths of the chain you'll see as I add

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.110 
lengths of the chain you'll see as I add
each<00:02:45.040> one<00:02:45.099> into<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:46.410> starts<00:02:47.410> picking<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.860> up

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
each one into it starts picking it up

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.589 
each one into it starts picking it up
and<00:02:49.319> there<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.349> is<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:50.860> it's<00:02:51.099> attached<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.819> the

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
and there it is now it's attached to the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.020 
and there it is now it's attached to the
curve<00:02:52.810> like<00:02:53.079> that<00:02:53.380> alright<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.160> then<00:02:54.819> once

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
curve like that alright and then once

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.050 
curve like that alright and then once
you<00:02:55.209> have<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.630> there<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:57.280> could<00:02:57.579> for

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
you have it in there so you could for

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.300 
you have it in there so you could for
instance<00:02:58.290> come<00:02:59.290> down<00:02:59.470> here<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.829> change<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
instance come down here and change the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.220 
instance come down here and change the
influence<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.150> curve<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:01.630> if<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.019> go<00:03:02.170> to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
influence of the curve so if I go to

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.140 
influence of the curve so if I go to
zero<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:02.920> will<00:03:03.069> be<00:03:03.099> no<00:03:03.340> influence<00:03:03.910> and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
zero there will be no influence and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.850 
zero there will be no influence and
you'll<00:03:04.239> see<00:03:04.420> it'll<00:03:04.569> just<00:03:04.810> step<00:03:05.140> back<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.650> here

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
you'll see it'll just step back to here

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.860 
you'll see it'll just step back to here
like<00:03:06.099> this<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:09.120> with<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.329> being<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.840> case

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
like this and with that being the case

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.750 
like this and with that being the case
like<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.650> could<00:03:12.010> come<00:03:12.160> out<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.579> and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
like that I could come out of here and

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.140 
like that I could come out of here and
just<00:03:12.819> select<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:14.079> curve<00:03:14.500> object<00:03:15.099> and<00:03:15.340> go<00:03:15.880> I

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
just select this curve object and go I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.970 
just select this curve object and go I
could<00:03:16.480> edit<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:17.049> curve<00:03:17.350> object<00:03:17.739> like<00:03:17.859> I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
could edit this curve object like I

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.220 
could edit this curve object like I
would<00:03:18.130> normally<00:03:18.310> edit<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.970> curve<00:03:19.269> for<00:03:19.810> instance

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
would normally edit a curve for instance

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.099 
would normally edit a curve for instance
they're<00:03:20.980> going<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.340> edit<00:03:21.760> mode<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.480> here<00:03:23.049> are

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
they're going to edit mode and here are

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.569 
they're going to edit mode and here are
the<00:03:23.200> control<00:03:23.560> points<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:23.980> my<00:03:24.250> particular

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
the control points for my particular

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.330 
the control points for my particular
curve<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.930> maybe<00:03:26.319> I<00:03:26.410> grabbed<00:03:26.739> this<00:03:26.950> control

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
curve and maybe I grabbed this control

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.110 
curve and maybe I grabbed this control
point<00:03:27.549> here<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:27.940> move<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.269> back<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:29.139> this<00:03:29.530> so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
point here and move it back like this so

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.309 
point here and move it back like this so
maybe<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:31.299> one<00:03:31.510> here<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:31.810> move<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.079> even

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
maybe this one here and I move it even

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.110 
maybe this one here and I move it even
further<00:03:32.769> like<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.519> I've<00:03:33.639> changed<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
further like that so I've changed the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000 
further like that so I've changed the
shape<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.480> curve<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.900> then<00:03:35.200> when<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:35.799> come

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
shape of the curve and then when I come

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.180 
shape of the curve and then when I come
back<00:03:36.160> here<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.519> grab<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:37.590> armature<00:03:38.590> here

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
back here and grab this armature here

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.400 
back here and grab this armature here
that<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.519> can<00:03:39.760> reach<00:03:40.030> ange<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.569> influence<00:03:41.200> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
that I can reach ange the influence and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.009 
that I can reach ange the influence and
you<00:03:41.739> can<00:03:41.859> see<00:03:42.069> it<00:03:42.220> will<00:03:42.400> immediately<00:03:42.670> adapt<00:03:43.299> to

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
you can see it will immediately adapt to

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.449 
you can see it will immediately adapt to
the<00:03:44.139> curve<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:45.100> that

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
the curve like that

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.490 
the curve like that
alright<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:45.850> that's<00:03:45.970> one<00:03:46.329> way<00:03:46.569> but<00:03:47.079> that's<00:03:47.260> not

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
alright so that's one way but that's not

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.280 
alright so that's one way but that's not
really<00:03:47.920> an<00:03:48.160> ideal<00:03:49.000> way<00:03:49.239> because<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:49.690> saw<00:03:50.230> the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
really an ideal way because you saw the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.710 
really an ideal way because you saw the
number<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.709> steps<00:03:51.040> required<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.670> had<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:52.000> leave

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
number of steps required I had to leave

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.390 
number of steps required I had to leave
here<00:03:52.959> get<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.440> going<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.799> edit<00:03:53.980> mode<00:03:54.069> grab

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
here get that going to edit mode grab

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.759 
here get that going to edit mode grab
the<00:03:54.519> point<00:03:54.790> do<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.359> so<00:03:55.780> there's<00:03:55.989> there's<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.470> way

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
the point do it so there's there's a way

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.390 
the point do it so there's there's a way
to<00:03:57.209> do<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:58.510> what<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:58.750> do<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.049> you<00:03:59.230> you<00:04:00.099> set

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
to do it so what you do is you you set

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.280 
to do it so what you do is you you set
up<00:04:00.750> control<00:04:01.750> points<00:04:02.230> with<00:04:02.620> hooks<00:04:03.900> onto<00:04:04.900> this

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
up control points with hooks onto this

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.440 
up control points with hooks onto this
curve<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.609> you<00:04:06.760> have<00:04:06.849> to<00:04:06.970> do<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.209> with<00:04:07.420> a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
curve and you have to do that with a

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.759 
curve and you have to do that with a
separate<00:04:07.810> armature<00:04:08.230> like<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.680> would

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
separate armature like this you would

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.059 
separate armature like this you would
attach<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.190> separate<00:04:09.489> armature<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.650> then<00:04:11.650> once

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
attach a separate armature and then once

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.830 
attach a separate armature and then once
you've<00:04:12.250> done<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:13.060> then<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.660> can

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
you've done that and then you can

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.830 
you've done that and then you can
control<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.410> hooks<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:14.980> then<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.400> hooks

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
control the hooks and then the hooks

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.940 
control the hooks and then the hooks
control<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.989> curve<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.530> then<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.709> curve

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
control the curve and then the curve

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.029 
control the curve and then the curve
controls<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:19.120> shape<00:04:19.389> of<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:20.409> object<00:04:20.650> and

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
controls the shape of that object and

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.920 
controls the shape of that object and
that's<00:04:21.400> why<00:04:21.519> I<00:04:21.549> said<00:04:21.849> it's<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.000> little<00:04:22.210> tricky

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
that's why I said it's a little tricky

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.250 
that's why I said it's a little tricky
so<00:04:23.320> what<00:04:23.530> we'll<00:04:23.650> do<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:24.070> know<00:04:24.159> what

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
so what we'll do you know what

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.660 
so what we'll do you know what
do<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.560> in<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.770> next<00:04:25.920> lesson<00:04:26.070> just<00:04:26.370> practice

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
do that in the next lesson just practice

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.250 
do that in the next lesson just practice
that<00:04:26.790> for<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.000> bit<00:04:27.180> kind<00:04:27.420> of<00:04:27.450> get<00:04:27.630> used<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.020> if

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
that for a bit kind of get used to it if

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.750 
that for a bit kind of get used to it if
you're<00:04:28.410> not<00:04:28.530> familiar<00:04:28.740> with<00:04:28.980> curves<00:04:29.340> maybe

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
you're not familiar with curves maybe

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.340 
you're not familiar with curves maybe
experiment<00:04:30.390> with<00:04:30.480> different<00:04:30.690> kind<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.140> curves

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
experiment with different kind of curves

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.210 
experiment with different kind of curves
and<00:04:31.710> see<00:04:32.340> what<00:04:32.460> kind<00:04:32.640> of<00:04:32.670> effects<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.030> can<00:04:33.180> get

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
and see what kind of effects you can get

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.220 
and see what kind of effects you can get
and<00:04:35.220> but<00:04:35.670> better<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.060> key<00:04:36.240> for<00:04:36.540> doing<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:36.930> is

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
and but better the key for doing this is

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.080 
and but better the key for doing this is
the<00:04:37.530> last<00:04:37.740> bone<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.340> chain<00:04:38.580> has<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.910> be

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
the last bone and the chain has to be

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.810 
the last bone and the chain has to be
the<00:04:39.330> one<00:04:39.450> that's<00:04:39.680> selected<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.860> order<00:04:41.460> for<00:04:41.730> it

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
the one that's selected in order for it

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.060 
the one that's selected in order for it
to<00:04:41.850> map<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.960> curve<00:04:43.170> all<00:04:43.440> right<00:04:43.650> well

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
to map to the curve all right well

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.900 
to map to the curve all right well
that's<00:04:44.130> it<00:04:44.310> for<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.520> lesson

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
that's it for this lesson

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.170 
that's it for this lesson
and<00:04:45.030> I'll<00:04:45.330> see<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.540> in<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.690> next<00:04:45.900> lesson
