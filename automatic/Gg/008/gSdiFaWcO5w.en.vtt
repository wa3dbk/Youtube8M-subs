00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.300
 missing one thanks 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:14.400
 what agile 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.260
 I like chaves laugh and you make stefan 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.160
 smile I had not seen that a long time ago 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.160
 weather 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.910
 Hey, you were talking about catering 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.100
 and how he died 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.420
 he died in a tragic fire at 50 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.420
 he says it was yesterday 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 like she was 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.870
 she was beautiful she looked like you in that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.790
 it was also complicated and selfish at times 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.220
 I was not friendly but very sexy and seductive 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.220
 and with good of both to you raise 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.980
 good reduction 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.670
 ask stefan your answer is 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.670
 different from mine 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.640
 because you do not stop being for this one 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.410
 because he says it by practicing you saw yourself 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.410
 miserable what notes 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.929
 I liked it was fun but everything has 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.630
 changed what was important no longer what 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.079
 I'm quit, do it, advance, there's no 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.079
 problem 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.860
 maybe I'll care again maybe but 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.860
 it seems unlikely 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.140
 lament 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.930
 what about qatar 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.729
 you lost it too 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.069
 the age 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.090
 I help you clean 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.090
