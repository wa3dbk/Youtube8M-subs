little thing but really not super far

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.990 
little thing but really not super far
behind<00:02:59.950> which<00:03:00.950> definitely<00:03:01.790> could<00:03:01.970> be

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
behind which definitely could be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.729 
behind which definitely could be
interesting<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.630> know<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.290> course<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.650> do

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
interesting to know and of course you do

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.220 
interesting to know and of course you do
ask<00:03:06.920> lag<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.280> course<00:03:07.910> when<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.360> boot<00:03:08.750> up<00:03:08.780> fully

ask lag of course when you boot up fully

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.470 
ask lag of course when you boot up fully
and<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:10.250> definitely<00:03:10.790> will<00:03:10.970> notice<00:03:11.450> a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
and you definitely will notice a

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.809 
and you definitely will notice a
difference<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.830> s4<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.489> much<00:03:13.640> much

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
difference that the s4 is much much

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.660 
difference that the s4 is much much
better<00:03:14.060> but<00:03:14.510> still<00:03:15.140> could<00:03:15.769> be<00:03:15.920> pretty<00:03:16.130> fun<00:03:16.310> to
