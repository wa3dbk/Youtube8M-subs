00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 how about friends thank you for this new 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.299
 play here again in this opportunity 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.150
 sharing a video that reaches 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.730
 many of your orders I decided to put together and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.179
 re-share what is the tactic 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.980
 with which I play and I feel comfortable 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.250
 I will also talk about an importance 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.039
 key to my understanding of the instructions 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.380
 that allow us to finish giving the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 team the identity that we want to 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.750
 time to play and indications that the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.360
 machine will have in certain 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.230
 positions during the game the tactics 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.570
 with which game is the 4-2-3-1 2 as 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.340
 they are seeing on the screen the reason 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.920
 basically it's because it's the one with me 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 I feel more comfortable after trying several 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.640
 and with which I understand that it can take 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 forward the game with which I 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.629
 I identify how they see the tactical account 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 with a 'double five' to which I consider 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.969
 key because it's the sector of the field that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.969
 gives us the balance right at the moment of 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.620
 attack or defend two players in that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.379
 sector of the field will allow us 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.570
 to exert more pressure so 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.550
 fast and with greater number of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 players in that sector with what 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.690
 regards the three players of the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.240
 midfield in the attack sector what 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.120
 I like it better and I feel that when attacking 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.550
 I exercise numerical majority against tactics 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.979
 equal to mine or much more 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.100
 against rivals who defend with a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.960
 only defensive center also to my liking 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.990
 I prefer to use m &amp; m from to extremes by 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.229
 just the fact that I want and need and I 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.590
 like the players are not so 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.810
 up to help recover the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.170
 moment to defend and at the moment of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.530
 attack can through indications that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.250
 now I'm going to teach to enter from behind 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 of the rivals and surprise in attack 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 these are the instructions that we are going to 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.340
 apply to our only man from area to 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.930
 our center forward let's tell 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.000
 that we need to stay in the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.670
 center and that is also man 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.209
 objective and always be in front of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.180
 center of the rival team to our my 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.080
 We are going to ask you to always cut 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.660
 race for him 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.970
 center generating new opportunities 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.400
 also that I always entered behind 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.700
 the rival players and that enters the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.280
 area before the possibility of centers what 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.150
 same we are going to apply to our m of 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.820
 cut through the center enter from the back 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.910
 of the rivals and enter the area before 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.550
 the possibility of centers to finish 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.370
 and the same for both defensive centers 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.850
 we are going to ask you to attack 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.340
 stay behind because because if we 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.860
 we want you to attack using the option 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.310
 of l1 we can make the player 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.400
 through a wall enter and start 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.430
 run in attack sense now well 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.850
 If you want to see how to make these 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.490
 instructions in common season the link 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.220
 of the video is in the description now 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.590
 friends I'm going to graph how are you 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.930
 instructions through plays in 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.940
 specific matches there we are with the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.120
 first play look like having the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.290
 ball looking for a good position 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.719
 attack 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.819
 to freeze the image and with the arrow them 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.129
 I'm going to show the movement that 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.920
 We previously gave Hazard how he is going to 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.500
 go through the back of the lateral goes to 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.799
 enter the center will be hand 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.250
 by hand and will nail the next to the stick and 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.769
 celebrate this goal a new move if 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.159
 well here also tiki tiki played 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.040
 we look for braking we look for the best 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.180
 possibility of touch and watch how to hunt 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.569
 again 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.659
 enter the center cutting through the middle 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.780
 as the instructions say and again 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.840
 is hand in hand in front of the goalkeeper and 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.959
 send a new one in here 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.900
 played also another player another band 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.230
 same instruction of cutting by the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.689
 center enters by the middle remains hand to 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.540
 hand and with a little bit more luck than 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.609
