let's<00:00:41.950> imagine<00:00:42.280> that<00:00:42.760> instead<00:00:43.239> of<00:00:43.660> eating

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
let's imagine that instead of eating

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.090 
let's imagine that instead of eating
around<00:00:44.590> those<00:00:45.390> 2500<00:00:46.390> per<00:00:46.570> day<00:00:46.750> you<00:00:47.500> only<00:00:47.860> eat

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
around those 2500 per day you only eat

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.350 
around those 2500 per day you only eat
300<00:00:48.969> at<00:00:49.570> 11pm<00:00:50.440> in<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.399> evening<00:00:51.789> and<00:00:51.969> you<00:00:52.000> keep

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
300 at 11pm in the evening and you keep

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.139 
300 at 11pm in the evening and you keep
that<00:00:52.629> up<00:00:52.690> for<00:00:53.230> two<00:00:53.710> weeks<00:00:53.980> what<00:00:54.700> you<00:00:54.850> think

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
that up for two weeks what you think

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.240 
that up for two weeks what you think
will<00:00:55.360> happen<00:00:55.390> with<00:00:55.960> your<00:00:56.110> weight<00:00:56.379> remain

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
will happen with your weight remain

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.510 
will happen with your weight remain
steady<00:00:57.910> or<00:00:58.510> will<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:58.870> even<00:00:59.110> increase<00:00:59.800> will<00:01:00.399> you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
steady or will it even increase will you

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.420 
steady or will it even increase will you
actually<00:01:00.969> lose<00:01:01.539> weight<00:01:01.930> I<00:01:02.170> can<00:01:02.980> guarantee<00:01:03.280> you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
actually lose weight I can guarantee you

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.420 
actually lose weight I can guarantee you
if<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.910> really<00:01:04.210> try<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.869> out<00:01:04.899> you<00:01:05.470> will<00:01:05.800> lose

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
if you really try that out you will lose

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.770 
if you really try that out you will lose
weight<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.690> energy<00:01:08.520> simply<00:01:09.520> can't<00:01:10.090> come

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
weight because energy simply can't come

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.000 
weight because energy simply can't come
out<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.170> nowhere<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.750> energy<00:01:13.960> density<00:01:14.500> of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
out of nowhere and the energy density of

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.270 
out of nowhere and the energy density of
food<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.030> how<00:01:16.540> much<00:01:16.750> energy<00:01:17.350> your<00:01:17.650> body<00:01:17.710> pulls

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
food and how much energy your body pulls

food and how much energy your body pulls
out<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.549> that<00:01:18.939> food<00:01:19.210> isn't<00:01:19.869> depends<00:01:20.470> on<00:01:20.619> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
out of that food isn't depends on the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.219 
out of that food isn't depends on the
time<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.310> eat<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.759> food<00:01:22.030> but<00:01:22.600> simply<00:01:23.020> on<00:01:23.200> the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
time you eat that food but simply on the

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.219 
time you eat that food but simply on the
simple<00:01:23.710> equation<00:01:24.369> more<00:01:25.030> calories<00:01:25.509> or<00:01:25.780> less

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
simple equation more calories or less

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.219 
simple equation more calories or less
calories<00:01:26.890> then<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.970> need<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.659> have<00:01:29.020> your

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
calories then you need to have your

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.560 
calories then you need to have your
weight<00:01:29.470> stay<00:01:30.130> steady

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.750 

but<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.440> sometimes<00:01:37.620> is<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.460> moves

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
but as it sometimes is with these moves

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.240 
but as it sometimes is with these moves
there<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.360> grain<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.870> truth<00:01:40.080> in<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.860> then

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
there is a grain of truth in them then

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.700 
there is a grain of truth in them then
it<00:01:41.370> just<00:01:41.580> comes<00:01:41.940> from<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.360> totally<00:01:43.229> different

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it just comes from a totally different

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.040 
it just comes from a totally different
corner<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> case<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.720> advice

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.620 

and<00:03:26.560> these<00:03:27.430> two<00:03:27.610> things<00:03:27.790> can<00:03:28.060> easily<00:03:28.120> be

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
and these two things can easily be

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.290 
and these two things can easily be
rectified<00:03:29.260> first<00:03:30.130> of<00:03:30.280> all<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.940> good<00:03:31.270> idea

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
rectified first of all it is a good idea

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.570 
rectified first of all it is a good idea
to<00:03:31.660> have<00:03:32.080> breakfast<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:32.950> doesn't<00:03:33.250> have<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.550> be

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
to have breakfast it doesn't have to be

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.130 
to have breakfast it doesn't have to be
the<00:03:33.790> first<00:03:34.060> thing<00:03:34.270> you<00:03:34.360> do<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.780> morning

the first thing you do in the morning

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.380 
the first thing you do in the morning
because<00:03:35.320> some<00:03:35.920> people<00:03:36.220> simply<00:03:36.490> don't<00:03:36.850> like<00:03:37.180> to

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
because some people simply don't like to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.480 
because some people simply don't like to
eat<00:03:37.450> right<00:03:37.840> after<00:03:38.050> getting<00:03:38.560> up<00:03:38.710> but<00:03:39.340> at<00:03:39.460> some

eat right after getting up but at some
time<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.270> morning<00:03:40.630> take<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.560> bit<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.860> time

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
time in the morning take a bit of time

time in the morning take a bit of time
to<00:03:42.970> eat<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:44.130> if<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.400> can<00:03:45.580> then<00:03:45.760> throw<00:03:46.150> in

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
to eat and if you can then throw in

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
lunch and also want to put in a small

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.960 
lunch and also want to put in a small
snack<00:03:50.350> in<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.530> afternoon<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:51.280> keep<00:03:51.610> that

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
snack in the afternoon to keep that

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.990 
snack in the afternoon to keep that
hunger<00:03:52.480> under<00:03:52.810> control<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:54.100> would<00:03:54.490> be<00:03:54.520> a

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
hunger under control and that would be a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.360 
hunger under control and that would be a
good<00:03:55.270> idea<00:03:55.330> because<00:03:55.960> then<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.830> hang<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.160> won't

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
good idea because then the hang of won't

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.850 
good idea because then the hang of won't
be<00:03:57.580> as<00:03:57.760> big<00:03:57.970> in<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.210> evenings<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.900> this<00:03:59.530> over

endowment most likely won't happen in
number<00:04:02.920> twos<00:04:03.130> instead<00:04:03.820> of<00:04:03.850> having<00:04:04.090> big<00:04:04.780> boards
