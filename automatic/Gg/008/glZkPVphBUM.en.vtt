00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
I'm feeling that day if I don't care

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.290 
I'm feeling that day if I don't care
about<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.950> goes<00:01:30.160> back<00:01:30.430> like<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.910> it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
about it and it goes back like that it

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.820 
about it and it goes back like that it
really<00:01:31.600> doesn't<00:01:31.840> matter<00:01:32.110> on<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.410> much

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
really doesn't matter on that much

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.250 
really doesn't matter on that much
because<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:33.460> dark<00:01:33.760> here<00:01:34.150> so<00:01:34.330> people<00:01:34.960> might

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
because it's dark here so people might

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.710 
because it's dark here so people might
assume<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.740> there's<00:01:36.550> you<00:01:37.000> know<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.180> the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
assume that there's you know that the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.600 
assume that there's you know that the
darkness<00:01:38.050> is<00:01:38.200> up<00:01:38.530> here<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:38.860> what<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.100> don't<00:01:39.280> know

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610

you<00:01:58.690> can<00:01:58.840> consider<00:01:59.290> she's<00:01:59.770> not<00:01:59.979> very<00:02:00.340> bright

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
you can consider she's not very bright

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.590 
you can consider she's not very bright
blonde<00:02:02.200> because<00:02:02.470> my<00:02:02.979> light<00:02:03.580> up<00:02:03.790> here<00:02:04.060> kind<00:02:04.510> of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
blonde because my light up here kind of

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.420 
blonde because my light up here kind of
mutes<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.410> color<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:05.920> really<00:02:06.190> can't

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
mutes the color so you really can't

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.820 
mutes the color so you really can't
really<00:02:06.700> see<00:02:07.000> just<00:02:07.300> how<00:02:07.869> blonde<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.530> it's

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
really see just how blonde it is it's

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.610 
really see just how blonde it is it's
really<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.250> chestnut<00:02:09.850> type<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.630> wheat<00:02:11.290> color

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
really a chestnut type of wheat color

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.580 
really a chestnut type of wheat color
blonde<00:02:12.100> okay<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.269> of<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.810> particular<00:02:14.320> skin

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
blonde okay and of this particular skin

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.070 
blonde okay and of this particular skin
tone<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.130> personally<00:02:16.060> think<00:02:16.269> that<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.870> wheat

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
tone I personally think that the wheat

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.930 
tone I personally think that the wheat
color<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.830> best<00:02:18.040> as<00:02:18.310> opposed<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.790> the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
color is the best as opposed to the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.970 
color is the best as opposed to the
platinum<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.750> haven't<00:02:20.440> tried<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.650> get<00:02:20.860> away

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
platinum I haven't tried to get away

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.920 
platinum I haven't tried to get away
with<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.310> Platinum<00:02:21.760> or<00:02:21.910> even<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.420> honey<00:02:22.600> gold

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
with the Platinum or even the honey gold

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.580 
with the Platinum or even the honey gold
