with your host John in this episode
we're<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.130> over<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> finer<00:00:05.850> points<00:00:06.180> of

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
we're going over the finer points of

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.200 
we're going over the finer points of
wiring<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.230> recording<00:00:07.740> studio<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.519> monitor

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
wiring a recording studio and monitor

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.600 
wiring a recording studio and monitor
room<00:00:09.389> I've<00:00:09.750> wired<00:00:10.139> five<00:00:10.500> recording<00:00:11.130> studios

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
room I've wired five recording studios

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.820 
room I've wired five recording studios
so<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.090> know<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.300> little<00:00:12.540> bit<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.410> let's

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
so I know a little bit about this let's

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.709 
so I know a little bit about this let's
start<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> source<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.059> work<00:00:15.299> our<00:00:15.509> way<00:00:15.690> out

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
start at the source and work our way out

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.810 
start at the source and work our way out
the<00:00:16.289> breaker<00:00:16.529> panel<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:17.220> where<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:17.670> get

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the breaker panel is where you can get

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
the breaker panel is where you can get
off<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.240> good<00:00:18.510> or<00:00:18.779> bad<00:00:19.050> start<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.800> good<00:00:20.010> start

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
off to a good or bad start a good start

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
off to a good or bad start a good start
is<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.150> panel<00:00:21.539> independently

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
is to have your panel independently

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.349
