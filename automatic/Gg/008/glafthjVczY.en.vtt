other people saying not all of the big
youtubers<00:04:59.060> are<00:04:59.300> girls<00:04:59.630> I<00:04:59.900> don't<00:05:00.229> really<00:05:00.530> think

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
youtubers are girls I don't really think

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.189 
youtubers are girls I don't really think
that<00:05:01.220> we<00:05:01.520> should<00:05:01.970> be<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.510> bigger<00:05:02.900> youtubers

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
that we should be a bigger youtubers

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.400 
that we should be a bigger youtubers
should<00:05:04.070> be<00:05:04.250> saying<00:05:04.669> girls<00:05:05.060> make<00:05:05.570> videos<00:05:06.080> I

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
should be saying girls make videos I

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.110 
should be saying girls make videos I
think<00:05:06.680> you<00:05:06.889> should<00:05:07.070> be<00:05:07.130> saying<00:05:07.310> everyone<00:05:07.729> make

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
think you should be saying everyone make

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.180 
think you should be saying everyone make
videos<00:05:08.479> if<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.229> makes<00:05:09.440> sense<00:05:09.560> obviously<00:05:09.800> in

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
videos if that makes sense obviously in

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.590 
videos if that makes sense obviously in
the<00:05:10.280> episode<00:05:10.550> was<00:05:10.729> concentrating<00:05:11.330> on<00:05:11.389> girls

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
the episode was concentrating on girls

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.480 
the episode was concentrating on girls
so<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.139> guess<00:05:12.380> that's<00:05:12.620> fair<00:05:12.710> enough<00:05:13.010> that<00:05:13.400> the

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
so I guess that's fair enough that the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.760 
so I guess that's fair enough that the
plea<00:05:13.729> was<00:05:14.240> coming<00:05:14.660> through<00:05:14.840> but<00:05:15.110> yeah<00:05:15.560> that's

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
plea was coming through but yeah that's

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.379 
plea was coming through but yeah that's
kind<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.100> just<00:05:16.280> my<00:05:16.430> thoughts<00:05:16.699> on<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:17.000> thank<00:05:17.240> you
