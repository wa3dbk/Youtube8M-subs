if<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.810> don't<00:04:36.110> do<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:37.040> can<00:04:37.610> just<00:04:37.790> look<00:04:37.910> a

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
if you don't do this it can just look a

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.210 
if you don't do this it can just look a
little<00:04:38.060> sloppy<00:04:38.419> in<00:04:38.750> my<00:04:38.990> opinion<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:39.710> that's

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
little sloppy in my opinion so that's

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
little sloppy in my opinion so that's
why<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.430> do<00:04:40.640> make<00:04:40.970> sure<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.330> do<00:04:41.419> this<00:04:41.690> step

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.090 

and<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.020> see<00:04:48.199> that's<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.650> wrong<00:04:48.800> way<00:04:48.949> to<00:04:48.979> use

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
and you see that's the wrong way to use

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.920 
and you see that's the wrong way to use
a<00:04:49.220> brush<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.669> right<00:04:49.880> way<00:04:50.060> is<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.360> hold<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
a brush the right way is to hold the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.469 
a brush the right way is to hold the
brush<00:04:51.080> and<00:04:51.289> actually<00:04:51.680> use<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.370> straight<00:04:53.060> flat

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
brush and actually use the straight flat

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.469 
brush and actually use the straight flat
angle<00:04:53.960> of<00:04:54.199> it<00:04:54.350> right<00:04:55.250> onto<00:04:55.639> your<00:04:55.669> outside<00:04:56.360> of

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
angle of it right onto your outside of

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.450 
angle of it right onto your outside of
the<00:04:56.539> lip<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:56.960> then<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:57.650> really<00:04:57.949> gives<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.340> nice

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
the lip and then it really gives a nice

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.749 
the lip and then it really gives a nice
straight<00:04:58.849> line<00:05:03.099> then<00:05:04.099> I'm<00:05:04.220> gonna<00:05:04.310> put<00:05:04.520> on<00:05:04.610> this

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759
