 as it may be that there are in Seville will be times whatever 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.570
 sometimes we say that it became adults is that you ask 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:10.850
 where he was admitted 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.839
 where are the dreams 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.999
 away from childhood 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.130
 that innocence 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.460
 There is so much a little adult that will be 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.210
 screen and a small adult who was growing up is to stop playing a game 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.449
 to move on to play others 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.229
 to grow is to forget about the imss issste 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.120
 famous boy 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.760
 the game is very serious 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.960
 with those big the game is very serious 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.660
 when we are kids we go to the mom and dad on alert 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
 to the office andÃºjar 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.510
 mccain actually we play three big 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.250
 they teach us to play a game 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.430
 but each one 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.430
 rehn sales with him 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.810
 those childhood games 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 they are something like the three instances of the future life 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.960
 when we are big 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.190
 because playing is something 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.190
 because we look bad allen who plays with the other person 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.290
 with those guy 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.600
 the stoppages have no consequences 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.400
 had to play it was they go back to the box and that's the idea that he died in a 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.040
 home 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.090
 tomorrow serves to bring 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.400
 but with those big 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.670
 the result of the game the definitive 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.700
 I let play a game that seems known 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.750
 but is not 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.390
 in game there are rules there is always a game without rules is impossible to play without 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.920
 they 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.360
 but when the fire stops being a boys game 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 you may play them with the same rules 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 Well, that would be childish 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.440
 but it is convenient to play in Russia to dream 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.850
 but an adult has decided 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.850
 is obsessed with the way it is as he pointed 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.369
 the baby you can train 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.269
 can resolve conflicts 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.779
 accumulate resources 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.359
 arm your toolbox 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.089
 play is scarce 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.519
 that exceeds the limits 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.519
 the possibilities of what we will do is 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.199
 Paris is a boy and the game ends 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.199
 all the soldiers return to the box and tomorrow yes 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.229
 the soberand 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.829
 If I can not 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:35.599
 it means
