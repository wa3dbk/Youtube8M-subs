00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
don't really know what the story is you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.820 
don't really know what the story is you
can't<00:00:42.059> really<00:00:42.600> tell<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.320> showing<00:00:43.559> off

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
can't really tell it's just showing off

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.080 
can't really tell it's just showing off
the<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> interesting<00:00:45.870> cutscenes<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.090> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the the interesting cutscenes and the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.770 
the the interesting cutscenes and the
nice<00:00:48.270> music<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.140> such<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.400> I<00:00:50.670> mean<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.510> really

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
nice music in such so I mean I really

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.510 
nice music in such so I mean I really
think<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.739> trailer<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.370> they

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
think that this is the trailer that they

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060 
think that this is the trailer that they
should<00:00:53.790> have<00:00:53.970> used<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.900> begin<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.470> it<00:00:55.769> so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
should have used to begin with it so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.619 
should have used to begin with it so
when<00:00:56.159> watching<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.610> trailer<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:57.420> just

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
when watching this trailer I really just

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
when watching this trailer I really just
want<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.900> play<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.110> again<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.339> played

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
want to play it again and I just played

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.390 
want to play it again and I just played
not<00:01:00.089> so<00:01:00.239> long<00:01:00.420> ago<00:01:00.479> but<00:01:01.140> um<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.890> did<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.220> really

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
not so long ago but um so did a really

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.910 
not so long ago but um so did a really
good<00:01:02.550> job<00:01:02.610> i<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.780> downside<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.589> it's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
good job i think the downside is it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.860 
good job i think the downside is it's
pretty<00:01:05.309> boring<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.120> remember<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.630> it's

interesting ideas going on about how to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.090 
interesting ideas going on about how to
use<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.210> we<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.570> control<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.740> pattern

use that we you control the pattern

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.170 
use that we you control the pattern
shows<00:03:33.630> basically<00:03:34.630> how<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.530> would<00:03:35.860> go<00:03:36.040> about

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
shows basically how you would go about

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.670 
shows basically how you would go about
using<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.420> controller<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.110> manipulate

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
using the controller to manipulate

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.760 
using the controller to manipulate
objects<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.060> 3d<00:03:40.450> space<00:03:40.930> from<00:03:41.470> what<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.709> can

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
objects in a 3d space from what I can

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.040 
objects in a 3d space from what I can
tell<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.120> know<00:03:43.240> expert<00:03:43.810> at<00:03:43.930> Reading

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
tell now I know expert at Reading

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.260 
tell now I know expert at Reading
patents<00:03:44.620> but<00:03:44.680> for<00:03:45.010> what<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.190> can<00:03:45.550> tell<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.970> shows

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
patents but for what I can tell it shows

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.620 
patents but for what I can tell it shows
them<00:03:46.600> drawing<00:03:47.020> an<00:03:47.290> object<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.190> then<00:03:48.820> using

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
them drawing an object and then using

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.290 
them drawing an object and then using
that<00:03:49.660> controller<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:51.030> manipulate<00:03:52.030> that

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
that controller to manipulate that

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.630 
that controller to manipulate that
drawing<00:03:52.660> object<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.280> that's<00:03:54.430> pretty

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
drawing object so that's pretty

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.090 
drawing object so that's pretty
interesting<00:03:55.000> how<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:56.020> would<00:03:56.320> actually<00:03:56.590> work

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
interesting how this would actually work

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.020 
interesting how this would actually work
in<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.370> Zelda<00:03:57.760> game<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:58.270> not<00:03:59.020> quite<00:03:59.500> sure<00:03:59.530> but<00:04:00.220> i'm

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
brilliant set of ideas for doing so what

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.210 
brilliant set of ideas for doing so what
do<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.240> think<00:04:07.540> go<00:04:08.200> ahead<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.590> let<00:04:08.709> us<00:04:08.830> know<00:04:09.070> in

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
do you think go ahead and let us know in

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.340 
do you think go ahead and let us know in
