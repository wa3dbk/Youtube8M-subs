new<00:00:07.770> serious<00:00:08.370> thing<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.580> kind<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.820> thought

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
new serious thing I kind of thought

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.040 
new serious thing I kind of thought
about<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.300> because<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.480> was<00:00:09.599> actually<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:09.900> to

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
about it because I was actually about to

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.870 
about it because I was actually about to
use<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.679> was<00:00:10.740> like<00:00:10.920> whom<00:00:11.160> never<00:00:11.639> used

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
use this and I was like whom never used

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.060 
use this and I was like whom never used
it<00:00:11.969> before<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.420> thought<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.719> would<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
it before and I thought it would be a

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.070 
it before and I thought it would be a
good<00:00:14.070> chance<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.120> do<00:00:15.210> like<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.570> first

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.660 
but as far as a first impression goes
I'll<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.570> I'll<00:01:43.229> say<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.460> think

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
I'll like it I'll say that and I think

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.280 
I'll like it I'll say that and I think
the<00:01:44.759> little<00:01:44.880> egg<00:01:45.210> shape<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:45.899> cute<00:01:46.079> too

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the little egg shape is really cute too

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
the little egg shape is really cute too
I'm<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> put<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:47.939> because

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
I'm not going to put this one on because

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.370 
I'm not going to put this one on because
I<00:01:48.180> went<00:01:48.329> ahead<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.509> put<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> summer<00:01:49.020> fruit<00:01:49.259> on

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I went ahead and put the summer fruit on

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.560 
I went ahead and put the summer fruit on
but<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.610> too<00:01:50.820> just

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
but I really like this one too just

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.499 
but I really like this one too just

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.069 
smell if it's really good those just
like<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> other<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:56.119> again<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.869> my

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
but I really like the idea of sometimes

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.559 
but I really like the idea of sometimes
I<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:11.489> watching<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.180> or<00:02:12.300> two

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
I just like watching like a one or two

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.229 
I just like watching like a one or two
video<00:02:13.340> what<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.430> somebody<00:02:14.609> like<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.969> product

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
video what if somebody like the product

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.459 
video what if somebody like the product
or<00:02:15.329> doesn't<00:02:15.569> like<00:02:15.659> a<00:02:15.689> product<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.319> thought

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
or doesn't like a product so I thought

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.080 
or doesn't like a product so I thought
maybe<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.859> would<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.189> good<00:02:17.400> chance<00:02:17.639> to<00:02:17.939> do

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
maybe this would be a good chance to do

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.699 
maybe this would be a good chance to do
something<00:02:18.299> like<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.629> so<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.319> really<00:02:19.499> hope<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
something like that so I really hope you

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.660 
something like that so I really hope you
