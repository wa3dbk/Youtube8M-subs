00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
cosplay partner and i and so start to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.070 
cosplay partner and i and so start to
finish<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.539> these<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.619> are<00:00:19.890> pieces<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
finish we have these these are pieces of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.929 
finish we have these these are pieces of
cardstock<00:00:22.080> which<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> heavier<00:00:23.519> version<00:00:23.550> of

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
cardstock which is a heavier version of

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.480 
cardstock which is a heavier version of
printer<00:00:24.240> paper<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.260> put<00:00:25.529> templates<00:00:26.310> on

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
printer paper that we put templates on

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.179 
printer paper that we put templates on
that<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.849> drew<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:28.500> print<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:28.980> off

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
that we drew out and then print it off

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.420 
that we drew out and then print it off
and<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:29.730> cut<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.720> they're<00:00:31.140> actually

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
and then cut out and so they're actually

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.729 
and then cut out and so they're actually
identical<00:00:32.430> these<00:00:32.910> little<00:00:33.239> guys<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.660> then<00:00:33.960> we

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
identical these little guys and then we

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.580 
identical these little guys and then we
made<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.969> eyelet<00:00:36.390> forum<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.140> back

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
made a little eyelet forum which is back

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.889 
made a little eyelet forum which is back
you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.399> back<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:39.750> almost

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
you can see back here these are almost

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.110 
you can see back here these are almost
like<00:00:40.079> little<00:00:40.440> origami<00:00:40.800> cootie<00:00:41.460> catchers<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
like little origami cootie catchers and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.630 
like little origami cootie catchers and
how<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.960> together<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.649> once<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> glue

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
how they go together but once you glue

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
how they go together but once you glue
them<00:00:44.789> together<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.390> held<00:00:45.690> together<00:00:45.840> by

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
them together these are held together by

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
them together these are held together by
a<00:00:46.440> multitude<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.129> hot<00:00:47.309> glue<00:00:47.489> again<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:47.969> of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
a multitude of hot glue again all of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
a multitude of hot glue again all of
those<00:00:48.239> seams<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> inside<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
those seams are from the inside out so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
those seams are from the inside out so
that<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> looks<00:00:50.280> much<00:00:50.430> cleaner<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
that it looks much cleaner on the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.549 
that it looks much cleaner on the
outside<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:52.879> inside<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.110> layering

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
outside now inside we have this layering

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
outside now inside we have this layering
of<00:00:55.920> tape<00:00:56.219> through<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.030> lens<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:58.020> create<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
of tape through the lens to create a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.650 
of tape through the lens to create a
little<00:00:59.039> see-through<00:00:59.430> portal<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> guys

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
little see-through portal for the guys

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.560 
little see-through portal for the guys
and<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.949> back<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.609> kind<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.270> hilarious

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and then the back is kind of hilarious

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
and then the back is kind of hilarious
this<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.229> Easter<00:01:04.589> egg<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.129> vinyl<00:01:05.519> dyed

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
this is an Easter egg that we vinyl dyed

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.380 
this is an Easter egg that we vinyl dyed
black<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.340> Easter<00:01:08.340> egg<00:01:08.490> back<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
black and so Easter egg back here and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.530 
black and so Easter egg back here and
then<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.080> paper<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.939> cardstock<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
then this is paper or cardstock in the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.359 
then this is paper or cardstock in the
front<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.890> gives<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> little

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
front and that just gives you a little

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
front and that just gives you a little
compartment<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.509> circuit<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
compartment to put your circuit in to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.190 
compartment to put your circuit in to
where<00:01:17.009> it'll<00:01:17.159> shine<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.759> through<00:01:18.180> into<00:01:18.810> this

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
where it'll shine out through into this

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.830 
where it'll shine out through into this
now<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.850> pretty<00:01:21.210> stupid<00:01:21.479> proof

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
now that is all pretty stupid proof

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.109 
now that is all pretty stupid proof
everything<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.860> kind<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.700> touch-and-go

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
everything is kind of touch-and-go

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
everything is kind of touch-and-go
figuring<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.470> pattern<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
figuring out what kind of pattern and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
figuring out what kind of pattern and
sizing<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> want<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.210> make<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.570> ghost

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
sizing you want to do to make your ghost

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.480 
sizing you want to do to make your ghost
but<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:29.040> bring<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.460> little

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
but then to really bring these little

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.179 
but then to really bring these little
guys<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.119> life<00:01:30.329> quite<00:01:30.750> literally<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.470> made<00:01:31.950> this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
guys to life quite literally I made this

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.420 
guys to life quite literally I made this
this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.939> ultra<00:01:33.600> fire<00:01:33.840> wrapped<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.040> then

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this is in ultra fire wrapped and then

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.700 
this is in ultra fire wrapped and then
circuited<00:01:36.270> through<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.259> wrapped<00:01:37.470> with

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
circuited through it's just wrapped with

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
circuited through it's just wrapped with
electrical<00:01:38.250> tape<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.060> there's<00:01:39.240> an<00:01:39.360> LED

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
electrical tape and then there's an LED

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.410 
electrical tape and then there's an LED
between<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.799> eat<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.340> prep<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.210> outer

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
between this eat a prep and the outer

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
between this eat a prep and the outer
part<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> positive<00:01:43.770> lead<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
part of the positive lead so when I

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.490 
part of the positive lead so when I
touch<00:01:44.579> these<00:01:44.850> two<00:01:45.149> leads<00:01:45.390> together<00:01:45.630> there

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
touch these two leads together there

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.789 
touch these two leads together there
will<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.860> light<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:49.110> these

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
will be light and it was good so these

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
will be light and it was good so these
are<00:01:50.220> ultra<00:01:50.579> bright<00:01:50.759> blue<00:01:51.090> LEDs<00:01:51.570> being<00:01:51.899> powered

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
are ultra bright blue LEDs being powered

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.990

off<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.590> 3<00:01:52.829> volt<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.250> much<00:01:53.430> larger<00:01:53.670> which

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
off of a 3 volt that's much larger which

off of a 3 volt that's much larger which
means<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.390> should<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.600> plenty<00:01:54.780> of

and then connecting those like this goes

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.330 
and then connecting those like this goes
inside<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.110> rather<00:02:01.500> than<00:02:01.710> show<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:01.979> how<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
inside but rather than show you how to

think we're planning on hanging these
from<00:02:36.240> galvanized<00:02:36.780> steel<00:02:37.080> wire<00:02:37.200> off<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:38.340> our

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
from galvanized steel wire off of our

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.550 
from galvanized steel wire off of our
