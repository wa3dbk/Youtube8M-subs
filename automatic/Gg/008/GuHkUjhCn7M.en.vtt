bad there's actually been honey found in
Egyptian<00:00:36.000> tombs<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.870> jars<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.649> couple<00:00:37.890> thousand

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
Egyptian tombs in jars a couple thousand

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.649 
Egyptian tombs in jars a couple thousand
years<00:00:38.370> old<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.030> was<00:00:39.120> still<00:00:39.329> perfectly

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:39.659 
years old and it was still perfectly

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.989 
years old and it was still perfectly
edible<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.219> been<00:00:41.399> crystallized

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:41.999 
edible it's just been crystallized

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.180 
edible it's just been crystallized
that's<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.079> happens<00:00:43.379> when<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> natural

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that's what happens when the natural

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.099 
that's what happens when the natural
sugars<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> honey

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
sugars that are in the honey

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.450 
sugars that are in the honey
essentially<00:00:49.109> just<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.499> dark<00:00:49.979> they<00:00:50.129> turn<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
essentially just they dark they turn to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.950 
essentially just they dark they turn to
crystals<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.969> makes<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.210> honey<00:00:51.390> thick<00:00:51.719> like

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
crystals and makes your honey thick like

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.130 
crystals and makes your honey thick like
that<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:53.429> you're<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.729> do

that so this is what you're going to do

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.259 
that so this is what you're going to do
something<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.789> everybody<00:00:56.789> loves<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> do

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
while until all those crystals turn back

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.570 
while until all those crystals turn back
to<00:01:34.950> liquid<00:01:37.040> we'll<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.370> in<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.550> little

a lot of the flavor that's in it from
the<00:02:34.680> pollen<00:02:35.010> things<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.400> haven't<00:02:35.670> been

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the pollen things that haven't been

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.850 
the pollen things that haven't been
heavily<00:02:36.600> processed<00:02:36.810> stuff<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.620> find<00:02:37.650> in

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
heavily processed stuff that you find in

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.580 
heavily processed stuff that you find in
commercial<00:02:38.280> honey's<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.790> too<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.530> to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
commercial honey's and too it's going to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.440 
commercial honey's and too it's going to
create<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.130> uneven<00:02:41.400> heat<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.090> probably

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
create really uneven heat it's probably

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.420 
create really uneven heat it's probably
not<00:02:42.570> going<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> work<00:02:42.959> as<00:02:43.260> well<00:02:43.650> as<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.400> should

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
not going to work as well as it should

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.430 
not going to work as well as it should
without<00:02:45.060> burning<00:02:45.930> it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
without burning it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.110 
without burning it
you're<00:02:46.620> probably<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:47.010> boil<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.670> honey<00:02:47.880> before

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
you're probably to boil the honey before

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.530 
you're probably to boil the honey before
you<00:02:48.360> actually<00:02:49.340> just<00:02:50.340> crystallize<00:02:50.880> all<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.239> it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
you actually just crystallize all of it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.509 
you actually just crystallize all of it
so<00:02:52.020> promise<00:02:52.980> me<00:02:53.100> don't<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.959> do<00:02:54.959> this

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
so promise me don't do that do this

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.400 
so promise me don't do that do this
stick<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:56.760> some<00:02:56.910> water<00:02:57.120> let<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:57.930> sit<00:02:58.050> for<00:02:58.380> a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
stick it in some water let it sit for a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.670 
stick it in some water let it sit for a
while

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.860 

that's<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:02.360> then<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.480> end<00:03:03.570> up<00:03:03.600> with<00:03:03.690> some

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
that's it then you end up with some

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.270 
that's it then you end up with some
liquid<00:03:04.110> honey<00:03:04.200> tada

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
liquid honey tada

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.120 
liquid honey tada
looks<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.580> magic<00:03:06.470> all<00:03:07.470> right<00:03:07.530> have<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> great
