you my experience whenever you take the
clip<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.830> always<00:01:08.010> makes<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> knife<00:01:08.610> more

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
comfortable now I've made a couple other

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.050 
comfortable now I've made a couple other
ones<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.510> these<00:01:12.710> but<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.490> actually

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
ones of these but this one I actually

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.789 
ones of these but this one I actually
tried<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.259> different<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.619> didn't

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
tried some little different I didn't

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.280 
tried some little different I didn't
even<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.159> any<00:01:17.189> rivets<00:01:17.790> even<00:01:18.750> where<00:01:18.869> these<00:01:19.080> go

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
even use any rivets even where these go

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
even use any rivets even where these go
through<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:21.080> even

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
through I don't know if you can see even

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.390 
through I don't know if you can see even
where<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.320> goes<00:01:22.560> through<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:25.400> there's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
where this goes through there's there's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.120 
where this goes through there's there's
no<00:01:26.549> rivets<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.150> holes<00:01:27.360> drilled<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.920> think

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
no rivets just holes drilled and I think

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.890 
no rivets just holes drilled and I think
I'll<00:01:29.250> pray<00:01:29.430> end<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.700> using<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.090> hole<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
I'll pray end up using this hole and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.770 
I'll pray end up using this hole and
kind<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> shape<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.430> little<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:33.090> but

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
kind of shape this a little more but

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.810 
kind of shape this a little more but
that's<00:01:33.900> neither<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.259> nor<00:01:34.409> there

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that's neither here nor there

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.510 
that's neither here nor there
and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.530> wear<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.920> an<00:01:38.070> echo<00:01:38.280> which

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and then you can wear like an echo which

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.310 
and then you can wear like an echo which
is<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.939> which<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.180> honestly<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.049> more

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
is it which is honestly it is more

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.770 
is it which is honestly it is more
appropriate<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> winter<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.600> can

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
appropriate in the winter because it can

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
appropriate in the winter because it can
print<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:43.799> too<00:01:44.009> bad<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.460> mean<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.000> know

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
print but not too bad I mean you know

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.980 
print but not too bad I mean you know
it's<00:01:45.990> printing<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.950> too<00:01:47.159> bad<00:01:47.990> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it's printing but it's not too bad and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.359 
it's printing but it's not too bad and
in<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> winter<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:50.009> wouldn't<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.340> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
in the winter it really wouldn't be a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
in the winter it really wouldn't be a
problem<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.210> even<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.110> you're<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
problem but even if you're just out and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.539 
problem but even if you're just out and
about<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> yard<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.920> know<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.189> doing

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
about in the yard you know or doing

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.090 
about in the yard you know or doing
whatever<00:01:58.700> hiking<00:02:00.259> makes<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:01.530> easy

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
whatever hiking makes for very easy

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.719 
whatever hiking makes for very easy
access<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.790> pops<00:02:03.299> out<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.869> got<00:02:04.020> your<00:02:04.229> knife

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.889 
access just pops out you got your knife
and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.899> can

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
and then you can

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.380 
and then you can
pop<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.080> right<00:02:09.110> back<00:02:09.440> in<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:11.030> thought<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.300> was

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
pop it right back in so I thought it was

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
of interesting it'll even it'll go in

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.869 
of interesting it'll even it'll go in
either<00:03:38.829> way<00:03:40.409> we're<00:03:41.409> going<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.860> way<00:03:44.879> order

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
either way we're going that way order

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:52.319 
either way we're going that way order
let's<00:03:46.420> see<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.790> one<00:03:50.730> see<00:03:51.730> we're<00:03:51.910> going<00:03:52.060> this

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
let's see that one see we're going this

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.289 
let's see that one see we're going this
way

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
way

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.720 
way
or<00:03:55.299> it'll<00:03:55.599> go<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:55.959> there<00:03:56.560> we<00:03:56.650> go<00:03:56.799> this<00:03:57.220> way

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
or it'll go in there we go this way

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.420 
or it'll go in there we go this way
so<00:03:58.060> we'll<00:03:58.180> go<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:58.420> two<00:03:58.599> ways<00:03:59.129> putting<00:04:00.129> in<00:04:00.250> just

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
so we'll go in two ways putting in just

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.449 
so we'll go in two ways putting in just
a<00:04:00.519> neat<00:04:00.700> little<00:04:00.849> idea<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.659> then<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.799> put

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
a neat little idea and then you can put

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.630 
a neat little idea and then you can put
it<00:04:03.549> on<00:04:03.670> here<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:05.319> diet<00:04:05.560> jr.<00:04:06.099> doesn't<00:04:06.310> have<00:04:06.609> a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
it on here the diet jr. doesn't have a

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.530 
it on here the diet jr. doesn't have a
clip<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:09.459> it's<00:04:09.609> a<00:04:09.670> really<00:04:09.879> good<00:04:09.970> solution<00:04:10.510> for

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
clip so it's a really good solution for

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.030 
clip so it's a really good solution for
that<00:04:12.359> diet<00:04:13.359> Jr's<00:04:13.810> we<00:04:14.230> I'll<00:04:14.620> probably<00:04:14.859> do<00:04:15.010> a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
that diet Jr's we I'll probably do a

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.740 
that diet Jr's we I'll probably do a
review<00:04:15.400> on<00:04:15.459> this<00:04:15.730> at<00:04:15.909> some<00:04:16.090> point<00:04:16.359> this<00:04:16.510> knife
