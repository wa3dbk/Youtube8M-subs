Arlington's<00:00:02.970> leaf<00:00:03.330> collection<00:00:03.659> program<00:00:04.049> is

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
Arlington's leaf collection program is

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.260 
Arlington's leaf collection program is
an<00:00:04.230> annual<00:00:04.440> event<00:00:04.710> where<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.400> provide<00:00:05.819> the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
an annual event where we provide the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.000 
an annual event where we provide the
residents<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.899> county<00:00:07.049> opportunities<00:00:07.830> to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
residents of the county opportunities to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.259 
residents of the county opportunities to
get<00:00:08.370> rid<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.610> their<00:00:08.760> leaves<00:00:08.970> in<00:00:09.179> an

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
get rid of their leaves in an

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.450 
get rid of their leaves in an
environmentally<00:00:09.660> responsible<00:00:10.320> way<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:11.280> offer

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
environmentally responsible way we offer

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.799 
environmentally responsible way we offer
really<00:00:11.790> two<00:00:11.969> aspects<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.599> program

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
really two aspects of the program

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.660 
really two aspects of the program
there's<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.410> bag<00:00:13.620> collection<00:00:13.860> program<00:00:14.490> it's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
there's the bag collection program it's

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.330 
there's the bag collection program it's
on<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> weekly<00:00:15.240> basis<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.100> day<00:00:17.310> after

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
on a weekly basis and it's the day after

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.310 
on a weekly basis and it's the day after
your<00:00:17.820> scheduled<00:00:18.240> trash<00:00:18.539> collection<00:00:18.990> days

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
your scheduled trash collection days

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.650 
your scheduled trash collection days
it's<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:19.920> reliable<00:00:20.279> program<00:00:21.000> there<00:00:21.510> are

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it's a very reliable program there are

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.240 
it's a very reliable program there are
eight<00:00:21.810> distribution<00:00:22.590> centers<00:00:22.980> throughout

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
eight distribution centers throughout

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.340 
eight distribution centers throughout
the<00:00:23.490> county<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.000> get<00:00:24.180> bags<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.840> also<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the county to get bags and also the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.259 
the county to get bags and also the
vacuum<00:00:25.769> collection<00:00:26.220> program<00:00:26.550> basically<00:00:26.880> it's

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
vacuum collection program basically it's

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.029 
vacuum collection program basically it's
a<00:00:27.359> huge<00:00:27.660> vacuum<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.230> collects<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> leaves

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
a huge vacuum that collects the leaves

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.099 
a huge vacuum that collects the leaves
we<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:29.789> when<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.150> come<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> pile<00:00:30.840> that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
we think when we come to a pile that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.959 
we think when we come to a pile that
it's<00:00:31.289> purely<00:00:31.740> leaves<00:00:32.130> if<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.700> other

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it's purely leaves if you have other

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.120 
it's purely leaves if you have other
material<00:00:33.510> mixed<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.170> those<00:00:34.320> leaves<00:00:34.710> it's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
material mixed in with those leaves it's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.500 
material mixed in with those leaves it's
going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> get<00:00:35.399> sucked<00:00:35.760> into<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> vacuum<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
going to get sucked into the vacuum and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.450 
going to get sucked into the vacuum and
potentially<00:00:36.899> damage<00:00:37.260> our<00:00:37.380> equipment<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:38.280> also

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
potentially damage our equipment we also

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280 
potentially damage our equipment we also
ask<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> separate<00:00:39.480> them<00:00:39.690> from<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.989> park

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
ask you to separate them from a park

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
ask you to separate them from a park
vehicle<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.890> need<00:00:41.040> about<00:00:41.250> ten<00:00:41.730> feet<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
vehicle and we need about ten feet of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.790 
vehicle and we need about ten feet of
clearance<00:00:42.420> because<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
clearance because we have to get the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.319 
clearance because we have to get the
hose<00:00:43.950> relatively<00:00:44.550> close<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> curb<00:00:45.210> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
hose relatively close to the curb and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
hose relatively close to the curb and
gutter<00:00:45.390> line<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.379> truck<00:00:46.710> needed<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
gutter line and then the truck needed to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
gutter line and then the truck needed to
negotiate<00:00:47.850> around<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.539> park<00:00:48.809> car<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.680> also

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
negotiate around the park car we also

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.770 
negotiate around the park car we also
asked<00:00:50.250> residents<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> put<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.300> close<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
asked residents not to put them close to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
asked residents not to put them close to
storm<00:00:52.079> sewers<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:53.100> again<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
storm sewers because again they have a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
storm sewers because again they have a
tendency<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> blow<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.449> migrate<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.930> don't

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
tendency to blow and migrate we don't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.869 
tendency to blow and migrate we don't
want<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> leaves<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:56.280> into<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> storm

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
want the leaves going into the storm

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
want the leaves going into the storm
sewers<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.390> possible<00:00:57.960> every<00:00:58.649> year<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> leaves

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
sewers if possible every year the leaves

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.000 
sewers if possible every year the leaves
fall<00:00:59.670> but<00:01:00.329> when<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:01.289> does<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
fall but when how does all into the

know<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.439> begin<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.949> program<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.549> where

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
know when to begin the program and where

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.359 
know when to begin the program and where
to<00:01:06.090> go<00:01:06.210> first<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> science<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
to go first it's all in the science and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.000 
to go first it's all in the science and
analysis<00:01:09.000> historical<00:01:09.750> data<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> your

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
analysis historical data and your

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.640 
analysis historical data and your
feedback<00:01:11.810> there<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:12.900> many<00:01:13.080> factors<00:01:13.380> that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
feedback there are many factors that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
feedback there are many factors that
actually<00:01:14.130> impact<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.180> Lee's<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:16.080> fall

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
actually impact when Lee's actually fall

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
actually impact when Lee's actually fall
off<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> trees<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.310> has<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
off the trees it has to do with the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.060 
off the trees it has to do with the
amount<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.659> photosynthesis<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
amount of photosynthesis so it's the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
amount of photosynthesis so it's the
daylight<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.820> shortening<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> days<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
daylight the shortening of the days it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.020 
daylight the shortening of the days it
has<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:22.979> frost<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.790> there's<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
has to do with frost and when there's a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
has to do with frost and when there's a
first<00:01:24.299> frost<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> year<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.100> are

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
first frost of the year and so there are

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590 
first frost of the year and so there are
a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.369> variables<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.150> actually

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
a lot of variables that actually

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.060 
a lot of variables that actually
indicate<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> leaves<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
indicate when the leaves are going to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.310 
indicate when the leaves are going to
fall<00:01:29.280> off<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.670> trees<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.299> did<00:01:30.450> an<00:01:30.570> analysis<00:01:31.140> of

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
fall off the trees we did an analysis of

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080 
fall off the trees we did an analysis of
the<00:01:31.470> types<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.920> trees<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> county<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the types of trees in the county and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.870 
the types of trees in the county and
also<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.780> tree<00:01:34.049> densities<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> various

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
also the tree densities and various

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
also the tree densities and various
types<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.299> trees<00:01:36.600> will<00:01:36.869> fall<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.350> different

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
types of trees will fall at different

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
types of trees will fall at different
times<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.430> revamped<00:01:39.000> our<00:01:39.240> schedule<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
times so we revamped our schedule to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.170 
times so we revamped our schedule to
actually<00:01:40.409> go<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.829> those<00:01:41.009> neighborhoods<00:01:41.220> which

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
actually go in those neighborhoods which

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
actually go in those neighborhoods which
have<00:01:42.420> lighter<00:01:42.720> canopies<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.530> also<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.009> types

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
have lighter canopies but also the types

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.859 
have lighter canopies but also the types
of<00:01:44.399> trees<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.820> fall<00:01:44.970> early<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.720> we're

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
of trees that fall early so we're

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.240 
of trees that fall early so we're
vacuuming<00:01:46.290> when<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> leaves<00:01:47.100> are

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
vacuuming when actually the leaves are

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.520 
vacuuming when actually the leaves are
on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> ground<00:01:47.610> we've<00:01:48.360> tweaked<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.960> schedule

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
on the ground we've tweaked the schedule

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.870 
on the ground we've tweaked the schedule
a<00:01:49.619> little<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.490> we've<00:01:50.700> actually

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
a little bit so we think we've actually

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.060 
a little bit so we think we've actually
now<00:01:51.210> optimized<00:01:51.899> our<00:01:52.049> collection<00:01:52.500> program<00:01:52.860> for

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
now optimized our collection program for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710 
now optimized our collection program for
vacuuming<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> we're<00:01:54.000> hoping<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.420> year<00:01:54.630> as

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
vacuuming and we're hoping this year as

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840 
vacuuming and we're hoping this year as
as<00:01:54.869> successful<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.470> last<00:01:55.710> year<00:01:55.979> once<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
as successful as last year once the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
as successful as last year once the
leaves<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.450> collected<00:01:57.990> they're<00:01:58.290> brought

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
leaves are collected they're brought

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.080 
leaves are collected they're brought
back<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.159> again<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> earth<00:01:59.700> products

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
back to again the earth products

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.030 
back to again the earth products
recycling<00:02:00.600> yard<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.110> they're<00:02:01.229> staged<00:02:01.560> here

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
recycling yard and they're staged here

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.590 
recycling yard and they're staged here
until<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.759> actually<00:02:02.880> process<00:02:03.270> them

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
until we can actually process them

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.209 
until we can actually process them
through<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.810> tub<00:02:04.049> grinder<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:05.040> we'll

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
through a tub grinder and then we'll

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.520 
through a tub grinder and then we'll
static<00:02:05.729> store<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.240> leaf<00:02:06.420> mulch<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
static store the leaf mulch and as it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.830 
static store the leaf mulch and as it
decomposes<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.220> gets<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.520> richer<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.239> far

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
decomposes it gets to be richer as far

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.449 
decomposes it gets to be richer as far
as<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> quality<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> mulch<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.069> then

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
as the quality of the mulch and then

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.280 
as the quality of the mulch and then
again<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.819> make<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.150> available<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.660> the

update the map to show people where we

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.990 
update the map to show people where we
have<00:02:45.870> been<00:02:46.109> it's<00:02:46.530> not<00:02:46.769> real<00:02:47.069> time<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.819> day
