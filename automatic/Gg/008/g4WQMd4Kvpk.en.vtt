speak these come in a box of 20 um and
they<00:00:17.190> were<00:00:17.220> about<00:00:18.060> five-ish<00:00:18.570> dollars<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.410> think

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
they were about five-ish dollars I think

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.380 
they were about five-ish dollars I think
when<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.770> bought<00:00:19.980> them<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.310> actually<00:00:20.880> bought

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
when I bought them I actually bought

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.420 
when I bought them I actually bought
them<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:21.990> long<00:00:22.170> time<00:00:22.380> ago<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.250> like

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
them a really long time ago this is like

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.230 
them a really long time ago this is like
a<00:00:23.460> long<00:00:23.789> long<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.600> leftover<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.350> so

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
a long long like leftover one so

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.620 
a long long like leftover one so
basically<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.490> it's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.609> compact<00:00:30.000> tampon<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
basically it is it's a compact tampon so

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.299 
basically it is it's a compact tampon so
it's<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> small<00:00:31.170> applicator<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.160> it

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it's like a small applicator but it

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.000 
it's like a small applicator but it
extends<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.149> bigger<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.010> basically

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
extends to a bigger one and basically

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.990 
extends to a bigger one and basically
these<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.930> light<00:00:36.930> flow<00:00:37.850> these<00:00:38.850> are

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
these are the light flow these are

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.270 
these are the light flow these are
purple<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.870> regular<00:00:40.290> flow<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.649> yellow<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
purple the regular flow is yellow and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
purple the regular flow is yellow and
the<00:00:41.610> heavy<00:00:42.180> flow<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.540> green<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.960> basically

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the heavy flow is green and so basically

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920 
the heavy flow is green and so basically
these<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:47.120> individually<00:00:48.120> wrapped<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.450> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
these are individually wrapped and you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.180 
these are individually wrapped and you
can<00:00:49.170> use<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> wrapper<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> wrap<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> up

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can use the wrapper to wrap it up

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.500 
can use the wrapper to wrap it up
afterwards<00:00:50.670> although<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> little

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
afterwards although it is a little

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.610 
afterwards although it is a little
harder<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> than<00:00:52.350> most<00:00:52.920> tampons<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.430> think

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
harder to than most tampons I think

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.529 
harder to than most tampons I think
these<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.789> said<00:00:56.969> before<00:00:57.090> these<00:00:57.360> are<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
these as I said before these are the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.200 
these as I said before these are the
light<00:00:57.840> flow<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> wrapper<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> purple

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
light flow and so the wrapper is purple

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
light flow and so the wrapper is purple
and<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> pretty<00:01:01.260> wrapper<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> mean<00:01:02.010> like

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and it is a pretty wrapper I mean like

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.770 
and it is a pretty wrapper I mean like
it's<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> nice<00:01:02.699> pattern<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.629> don't

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it's got a nice pattern on it I don't

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.090 
it's got a nice pattern on it I don't
know<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:04.979> an

know if you can see that it's like an

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.130 
know if you can see that it's like an
infinity<00:01:05.640> sign<00:01:05.850> over<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.390> over<00:01:06.570> again<00:01:06.630> it's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
infinity sign over and over again it's

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.039 
infinity sign over and over again it's
cute<00:01:07.350> ish<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.330> cute<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.630> u<00:01:09.780> by<00:01:09.900> Kotex

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:29.009 
up and then now you have to just push

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.159 
up and then now you have to just push
the<00:03:29.159> plunger<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.729> thing<00:03:30.389> is<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.750> would

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
the plunger and the thing is I would

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.170 
the plunger and the thing is I would
sometimes<00:03:31.349> then<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.400> kind<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.669> draw<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.120> out

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
sometimes then just kind of draw it out

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.670 
sometimes then just kind of draw it out
like<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.449> but<00:03:34.169> sometimes<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.620> doesn't

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
like that but sometimes that doesn't

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.830 
like that but sometimes that doesn't
always<00:03:34.919> work<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.879> sometimes<00:03:36.060> well<00:03:36.479> worked<00:03:36.689> out

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
always work so sometimes well worked out

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.210 
always work so sometimes well worked out
but<00:03:37.019> sometimes<00:03:37.229> you<00:03:37.470> have<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.650> make<00:03:37.829> sure<00:03:37.889> you

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
but sometimes you have to make sure you

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.789 
but sometimes you have to make sure you
click<00:03:38.909> that<00:03:39.389> part<00:03:39.689> like<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.409> then<00:03:40.620> it's

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
click that part like that so then it's

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.550 
click that part like that so then it's
fully<00:03:41.069> out<00:03:41.810> here's<00:03:42.810> what<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.049> tampon<00:03:43.349> looks

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
see that this tampon absorbs really fast

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.560

um<00:04:50.900> actually<00:04:51.900> Wow<00:04:52.889> look<00:04:53.130> it's<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:54.120> absorbed

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
um actually Wow look it's it absorbed

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.379 
um actually Wow look it's it absorbed
all<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:55.130> was<00:04:56.130> that<00:04:56.250> really<00:04:56.550> six<00:04:56.850> grams

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
all of that was that really six grams

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.300 
all of that was that really six grams
that<00:04:57.690> was<00:04:57.810> six<00:04:58.050> yeah<00:04:58.289> that<00:04:58.470> was<00:04:58.560> six<00:04:58.770> grams<00:04:59.039> I

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
that was six yeah that was six grams I

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.730 
that was six yeah that was six grams I
was<00:04:59.460> definitely<00:04:59.849> six<00:05:00.300> grams<00:05:00.539> but<00:05:01.349> see<00:05:01.560> now

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
was definitely six grams but see now

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.860 
was definitely six grams but see now
it's<00:05:01.979> all<00:05:02.130> absorbing<00:05:02.699> him<00:05:02.849> so<00:05:03.330> if<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:03.539> just<00:05:03.750> hold

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
it's all absorbing him so if I just hold

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.480 
it's all absorbing him so if I just hold
it<00:05:04.020> upside<00:05:04.139> down<00:05:04.320> which<00:05:04.979> is<00:05:05.099> how<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:05.280> would<00:05:05.400> be

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
it upside down which is how it would be

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.920 
it upside down which is how it would be
in<00:05:05.580> your<00:05:05.729> body<00:05:05.910> it's<00:05:06.180> all<00:05:06.330> kind<00:05:06.509> of<00:05:06.570> like<00:05:06.750> run

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
in your body it's all kind of like run

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.650 
in your body it's all kind of like run
down<00:05:07.110> ah<00:05:07.669> basically<00:05:08.669> so<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.210> absorbs<00:05:09.509> really

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
down ah basically so it absorbs really

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.070 
down ah basically so it absorbs really
fast<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:12.330> know<00:05:12.449> it's<00:05:12.630> it's<00:05:12.900> great

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
fast and you know it's it's great

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.510 
fast and you know it's it's great
because<00:05:13.199> it's<00:05:13.380> a<00:05:13.470> tampon<00:05:13.800> so<00:05:13.979> it's<00:05:14.099> inside<00:05:14.340> of

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
because it's a tampon so it's inside of

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.469 
because it's a tampon so it's inside of
you<00:05:14.610> um<00:05:16.070> you<00:05:17.070> would<00:05:17.250> be<00:05:17.400> fine<00:05:17.729> there's<00:05:18.180> no

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
you um you would be fine there's no

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.839 
you um you would be fine there's no
chance<00:05:18.720> of<00:05:18.870> leaking<00:05:19.280> you<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.400> you're<00:05:20.669> good

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
chance of leaking you know you're good

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.550 
chance of leaking you know you're good
you're<00:05:21.270> good

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
you're good

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.740 
you're good
and<00:05:22.919> so<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:25.349> expands<00:05:26.099> in<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:27.000> rectangular

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
and so the it expands in a rectangular

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.350 
and so the it expands in a rectangular
shape<00:05:28.199> which<00:05:28.699> personally<00:05:29.699> I<00:05:29.820> don't<00:05:29.880> like<00:05:30.000> and

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
shape which personally I don't like and

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.750 
shape which personally I don't like and
also<00:05:30.599> this<00:05:30.900> one<00:05:31.080> actually<00:05:31.760> expands

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
also this one actually expands

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.020 
also this one actually expands
lengthwise<00:05:33.419> like<00:05:33.810> like<00:05:34.620> it<00:05:35.039> gets<00:05:35.250> longer<00:05:35.669> as

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
lengthwise like like it gets longer as

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.100 
lengthwise like like it gets longer as
opposed<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.419> wider<00:05:36.750> and<00:05:37.220> as<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.699> and<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.720> you

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
opposed to wider and as a and so you

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.450 
opposed to wider and as a and so you
know<00:05:40.199> so<00:05:40.380> it<00:05:40.500> gets<00:05:40.650> longer<00:05:40.979> as<00:05:41.159> opposed<00:05:41.400> to

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
know so it gets longer as opposed to

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.589 
know so it gets longer as opposed to
wider<00:05:41.669> it<00:05:42.120> also<00:05:43.310> it<00:05:44.310> doesn't<00:05:44.639> really<00:05:44.729> I<00:05:45.180> mean

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
wider it also it doesn't really I mean

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.689 
wider it also it doesn't really I mean
just<00:05:45.840> really<00:05:45.930> expand<00:05:46.530> that<00:05:46.800> much<00:05:47.099> like<00:05:47.400> wide

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
just really expand that much like wide

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.700 
just really expand that much like wide
so<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.030> found<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:48.419> had<00:05:48.449> a<00:05:48.599> lot<00:05:48.960> of<00:05:48.990> leaks<00:05:49.470> with

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
so I found I had a lot of leaks with

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.240 
so I found I had a lot of leaks with
this<00:05:49.860> tampon<00:05:50.240> um<00:05:51.240> it<00:05:52.169> doesn't<00:05:52.440> come<00:05:52.710> apart<00:05:52.830> if

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250
