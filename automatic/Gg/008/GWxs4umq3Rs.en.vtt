00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 there is a sentence there is a self interview you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.180
 you have become a man of communication 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.580
 then maybe I'll ask you if why 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.040
 in the sense how come I like this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.300
 but of course you must do it 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.099
 also some other possibilities instead 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.330
 preferred to launch yourself exclusively 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.270
 in the field of communication 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.850
 said this tool already in a big one 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.430
 many things as a player communicator 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.340
 beautiful tough guys who gave the newspapers headlines 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.750
 maybe how to say you didn't always do the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.279
 good for yourself you did not do good 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 for the world he says they founded from 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.690
 this world of media but I was looking for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.190
 speak little and those few times there 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.440
 I talked about saying things I was doing 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.540
 print silences that never ended e 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 then I ran away so many 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.489
 nonsense then I have to sky the keyboard 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.309
 of interviews in which he was a voice was 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.449
 boring I had a voice that seemed to say 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.870
 I don't want to say it and so I was 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.660
 me too 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.910
 maybe I guessed conjunctiva here 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.680
 Almond almonds and people thought 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.090
 mom this smart instead why 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 actually, and you asked me a question 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.130
 because I do this job that it also does 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.960
 marco made it then in the end there 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.790
 we all finish look I did the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.200
 player that I did the coach is 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.270
 made two things together he made me 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.369
 two things together yes I enjoyed it 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.200
 I very much understood what I tried 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.119
 this experience then I had a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.439
 problem with the watson had to stop a 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.299
 year because we have all the usual 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.640
 lawsuit he didn't want me to make 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.350
 pay and in the meantime called me 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.180
 sky I knew from the ladder 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.150
 in short, because I lived in London I saw 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.710
 who saw sky and I said that is I have 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.210
 played and trained they paid me 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.220
 now I want to pay for quality 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.240
 of football matches I said why 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.210
 no she and then I thought it could be 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.040
 a mission that is trying to talk about 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.350
 football in a certain way and in one place 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.830
 like Italy where football is always 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.330
 in short, it must be treated with great care and then 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.310
 I enjoy 100 seeds a lot 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.229
 mission same butterflies in the stomach 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.240
 when turning the camera on compared 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.810
 when I took penalty kicks no 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.000
 but it's a really nice job that I do 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.400
 leave time to do other things in the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.830
 life including education deal 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.900
 so i'm and i don't like the kind of 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.459
 for heaven I like becomes a person 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.500
 when I do the coach that I do n't 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.630
 like don't like at least risk testing 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.880
 expressed about statements 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.370
 feel that voice when you do this 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.330
 declaration a tired voice because not 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.310
 could be otherwise 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.220
 and I would say decidedly moved 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.900

 sense of belonging of spoke to me but 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.880
 there is one thing if I consider myself a reason 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.890
 tell for that game 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.870
 the adventure 0 to the first leg we lose 2 to 0 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.840
 return 40 minutes as I was 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.420
 doing below but not for fear for a 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.480
 his own physiological discourse therefore 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.709
 you will go bandai the new line you always make me 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.090
 go to the bathroom for a moment before 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.260
 start extra in the act watched 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.120
 from two minutes 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.580
 then a birth with buso that undermine 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.709
 in the tunnel where new municipal cleats 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.170
 they told us in the long run 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.150
 from the shores of jazz luca pilgrims 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.959
 lying on the couch with an ankle 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:09.410
 bandaged briger I also go to the bathroom and 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.120
 from the top of myself however it is there not 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.660
 I was so sick that I said last 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.950
 both from india 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.660

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.690
 thai 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.220
 then I go up and then go as the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.190
 truth later if you passed me 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.270
 from the forum being from the forum 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.600
 slide and fall on the step turns a 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.350
 old turin fan who asks me 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.170
 but how come then then after leaving the 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:42.150
 gate from behind the benches and arrival 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:44.280
 in the field, it's all about having her 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.980
