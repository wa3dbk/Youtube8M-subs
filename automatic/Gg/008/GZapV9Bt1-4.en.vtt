here again this is just kind of for show
is<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> show<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.300> slight

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
is to show you that we have a slight

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.039 
is to show you that we have a slight
discrepancy<00:01:04.409> between<00:01:05.010> two<00:01:05.610> paths<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.270> these

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
discrepancy between two paths and these

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
discrepancy between two paths and these
two<00:01:07.380> ice<00:01:07.560> age<00:01:07.860> packs<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.790> looking<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.360> like

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
two ice age packs just looking at like

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.170 
two ice age packs just looking at like
that<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.260> oh<00:01:10.880> there's<00:01:11.880> something

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that you think oh there's something

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.600 
that you think oh there's something
slightly<00:01:12.659> different<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:14.549> two

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
slightly different here and these two

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.270 
slightly different here and these two
packs<00:01:15.330> came<00:01:15.750> from<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> exact<00:01:16.409> same<00:01:16.650> box<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
packs came from the exact same box and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120 
packs came from the exact same box and
this<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> pack<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.990> probably<00:01:19.500> has<00:01:19.770> I'm

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
this is a pack that probably has I'm

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
this is a pack that probably has I'm
gonna<00:01:20.310> guess<00:01:20.580> three<00:01:21.000> cards<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.290> pack

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
gonna guess three cards and this pack

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.940 
gonna guess three cards and this pack
here<00:01:22.920> has<00:01:23.130> probably<00:01:23.820> about<00:01:24.080> 25<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.320> 30<00:01:25.560> cards

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
here has probably about 25 to 30 cards

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.510 
here has probably about 25 to 30 cards
per<00:01:26.130> pack<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.100> pack<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
per pack and you know the pack in the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700 
per pack and you know the pack in the
middle<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.939> presumably<00:01:30.479> okay<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.439> just

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
middle is presumably okay and I'm just

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.109 
middle is presumably okay and I'm just
kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> showing<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.790> probably

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
kind of showing that that's probably

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.060 
kind of showing that that's probably
what<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> 15-car<00:01:34.170> pack<00:01:34.409> should<00:01:34.710> look<00:01:34.890> like

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
what a 15-car pack should look like

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.300 
what a 15-car pack should look like
right<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> middle<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:38.189> know

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
right here in the middle so you know

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.859 
right here in the middle so you know
maybe<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> heck<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.329> will<00:01:39.540> open<00:01:39.630> up

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
maybe for the heck of it will open up

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.429 
maybe for the heck of it will open up
the<00:01:40.280> 2011<00:01:41.280> pack<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.479> reason<00:01:42.840> why<00:01:42.990> we're

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the 2011 pack but the reason why we're

this is fake it is kind of surprising
that<00:01:55.740> every<00:01:56.070> once<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.399> while<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> still<00:01:57.240> get

accusations of things that I have are
fake<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:00.990> I'm<00:02:01.229> sure<00:02:01.590> most<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.070> know

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.999 
fake but I'm sure most of you know
better<00:02:02.490> than<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.939> by<00:02:03.119> now<00:02:03.590> every<00:02:04.590> single<00:02:04.799> one

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
better than that by now every single one

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.370 
better than that by now every single one
of<00:02:05.159> these<00:02:05.310> packs<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:06.180> or<00:02:06.570> both<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.170> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
of these packs well or both then this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.589 
of these packs well or both then this
probably<00:02:07.770> better<00:02:08.039> terminology<00:02:08.599> everything

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
probably better terminology everything

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.600 
probably better terminology everything
is<00:02:09.720> fine<00:02:09.959> everything<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.649> sealed<00:02:10.860> properly<00:02:10.979> it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
is fine everything is sealed properly it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.180 
is fine everything is sealed properly it
is<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> bit<00:02:12.030> surprising<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.870> see

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
is a bit surprising to see

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.070

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
you know the corners are probably going

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.300 
you know the corners are probably going
to<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.530> rough<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.920> some<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.250> these

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
to be a little rough on some of these

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.130 
to be a little rough on some of these
cars<00:02:17.610> because<00:02:17.940> they're<00:02:18.120> really<00:02:18.510> tacked<00:02:18.900> in

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
double check on the rarities of all the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.949 
double check on the rarities of all the
cards<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.170> open<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.359> you<00:04:03.359> know<00:04:03.480> I'll<00:04:03.750> put

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
cards that I open and you know I'll put

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.080 
cards that I open and you know I'll put
that<00:04:04.109> in<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.350> description<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.160> was<00:04:05.819> at<00:04:05.940> this

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
that in the description I it was at this

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.000 
that in the description I it was at this
point<00:04:06.359> really<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.720> was<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:06.900> guessing<00:04:07.440> there's

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
point really I was just guessing there's

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.199 
point really I was just guessing there's
so<00:04:08.220> many<00:04:08.340> cards<00:04:08.760> they're<00:04:08.880> not<00:04:09.000> worth

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
so many cards they're not worth

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.750 
so many cards they're not worth
remembering<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.290> said<00:04:10.670> all<00:04:11.670> right<00:04:12.079> so<00:04:13.760> this

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
remembering and I said all right so this

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.979 
remembering and I said all right so this
pack<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.870> really<00:04:16.200> large<00:04:16.380> pack

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
interesting look we actually got did we

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.830 
interesting look we actually got did we
get<00:05:02.690> yeah<00:05:03.690> we<00:05:04.320> got<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.740> counterspell<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.849> then

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
get yeah we got a counterspell and then

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.170 
get yeah we got a counterspell and then
we<00:05:06.960> got<00:05:08.419> another<00:05:09.710> counterspell<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.699> let's<00:05:11.940> see

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
we got another counterspell so let's see

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.200 
we got another counterspell so let's see
with<00:05:12.479> three<00:05:12.870> here<00:05:15.020> we<00:05:16.020> have<00:05:16.199> a<00:05:16.229> total<00:05:16.710> of<00:05:16.889> 1<00:05:17.190> 2<00:05:17.669> 3

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
with three here we have a total of 1 2 3

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:27.680 
with three here we have a total of 1 2 3
4<00:05:18.780> 5<00:05:19.320> 6<00:05:20.070> 7<00:05:20.610> 8<00:05:21.030> 9<00:05:21.870> 10<00:05:22.440> 11<00:05:22.860> 12<00:05:23.520> 13<00:05:24.060> 14<00:05:24.720> 15<00:05:25.320> 16<00:05:25.979> 17<00:05:26.690> 18

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.520 
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19<00:05:28.289> 20<00:05:28.650> 21<00:05:29.070> 22<00:05:29.750> 23<00:05:30.750> 24<00:05:30.960> 25<00:05:31.620> 26<00:05:33.050> so<00:05:34.050> that's<00:05:34.260> kind

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 so that's kind

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.339 
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 so that's kind
of<00:05:34.590> interesting<00:05:34.849> my<00:05:35.849> theory<00:05:36.690> was<00:05:36.870> that<00:05:36.930> we

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
of interesting my theory was that we

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.219 
of interesting my theory was that we
were<00:05:37.500> gonna<00:05:37.620> have<00:05:37.919> two<00:05:38.909> packs<00:05:39.270> worth<00:05:39.659> of<00:05:39.930> cards

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
were gonna have two packs worth of cards

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.320 
were gonna have two packs worth of cards
distributed<00:05:41.070> amongst<00:05:41.400> these<00:05:41.490> two<00:05:41.760> packs<00:05:42.030> and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
distributed amongst these two packs and

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.659 
distributed amongst these two packs and
that<00:05:42.449> didn't<00:05:42.750> exactly<00:05:43.110> happen<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:44.010> think<00:05:44.550> I

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
that didn't exactly happen I think I

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.779 
that didn't exactly happen I think I
said<00:05:44.880> what<00:05:45.120> 26<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:47.120> we<00:05:48.120> didn't<00:05:48.360> quite<00:05:49.130> get<00:05:50.130> two

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
said what 26 so we didn't quite get two

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.330 
said what 26 so we didn't quite get two
packs<00:05:51.060> worth<00:05:51.389> and<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:52.320> don't<00:05:52.530> know<00:05:52.740> these<00:05:53.099> two

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
packs worth and I don't know these two

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.760 
packs worth and I don't know these two
are<00:05:53.490> rare<00:05:53.759> but<00:05:54.599> yeah<00:05:54.900> I<00:05:54.930> will<00:05:55.199> have<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.620> look

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
are rare but yeah I will have to look

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.290 
are rare but yeah I will have to look
into<00:05:55.979> this<00:05:56.190> because<00:05:56.460> like<00:05:56.610> I<00:05:56.729> said<00:05:56.940> I'm<00:05:57.150> doing

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
into this because like I said I'm doing

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.469 
into this because like I said I'm doing
this<00:05:57.479> on<00:05:57.659> the<00:05:57.780> fly<00:05:58.070> ice<00:05:59.070> age<00:05:59.370> doesn't<00:05:59.820> have<00:06:00.150> the

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
this on the fly ice age doesn't have the

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.360 
this on the fly ice age doesn't have the
rarity<00:06:00.780> symbols<00:06:01.199> I<00:06:01.380> have<00:06:01.710> so<00:06:01.919> many<00:06:02.039> people

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
rarity symbols I have so many people

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.159 
rarity symbols I have so many people
look<00:06:02.520> at<00:06:02.639> isolated<00:06:03.030> cards<00:06:03.360> and<00:06:03.570> think<00:06:03.750> oh<00:06:03.930> it's

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
look at isolated cards and think oh it's

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.980 
look at isolated cards and think oh it's
an<00:06:04.289> uncommon<00:06:04.800> no<00:06:05.759> they<00:06:06.000> just<00:06:06.210> all<00:06:06.389> have<00:06:06.750> that

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
an uncommon no they just all have that

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.129 
an uncommon no they just all have that
snowflake<00:06:07.560> so<00:06:08.370> there's<00:06:08.639> nothing<00:06:09.090> all<00:06:09.270> that

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
snowflake so there's nothing all that

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.230 
snowflake so there's nothing all that
spectacular<00:06:10.650> in<00:06:11.340> these<00:06:11.490> packs<00:06:11.789> there<00:06:12.180> are

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
spectacular in these packs there are

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.990 
spectacular in these packs there are
some<00:06:12.419> very<00:06:12.659> usable<00:06:13.139> Commons<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:13.979> okay<00:06:14.870> anyhow

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
some very usable Commons and okay anyhow

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.540 
some very usable Commons and okay anyhow
and<00:06:18.000> why<00:06:18.180> not<00:06:18.770> let<00:06:19.770> me<00:06:19.800> prove<00:06:20.159> to<00:06:20.370> you<00:06:20.490> that

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
and why not let me prove to you that

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.450 
and why not let me prove to you that
this<00:06:20.970> is<00:06:21.240> a<00:06:21.270> regular<00:06:21.870> pack<00:06:22.080> this<00:06:22.470> was<00:06:22.740> not<00:06:23.039> sent

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
this is a regular pack this was not sent

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.129 
this is a regular pack this was not sent
to<00:06:23.520> me<00:06:23.729> this<00:06:23.970> is<00:06:24.180> just<00:06:24.449> something<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:24.870> was

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
to me this is just something that was

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:26.250
