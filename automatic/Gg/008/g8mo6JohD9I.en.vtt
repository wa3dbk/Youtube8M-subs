for<00:00:37.699> what<00:00:37.850> walk<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:38.870> what<00:00:39.109> we<00:00:39.230> gonna<00:00:39.410> only

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
for what walk so what we gonna only

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.250 
for what walk so what we gonna only
dueling<00:00:40.519> doing<00:00:41.090> one<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:41.660> that's<00:00:41.840> a<00:00:41.930> forward

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
dueling doing one and that's a forward

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.759 
dueling doing one and that's a forward
walk<00:00:42.609> so<00:00:43.609> my<00:00:43.850> body<00:00:44.090> is<00:00:44.300> falling<00:00:44.629> forward<00:00:45.140> and

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
walk so my body is falling forward and

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:53.500 
walk so my body is falling forward and
my<00:00:45.949> foot<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.219> coming<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:48.260> my<00:00:48.440> foot<00:00:52.239> support<00:00:53.239> my

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
my foot is coming so my foot support my

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.310 
my foot is coming so my foot support my
body<00:00:53.780> here<00:00:54.699> so<00:00:55.699> my<00:00:55.910> body<00:00:56.179> is<00:00:56.359> falling<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.140> my

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
body here so my body is falling but my

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.829 
body here so my body is falling but my
foot<00:00:57.620> catch<00:00:58.129> my<00:00:58.460> body<00:00:58.699> weight<00:00:58.940> what<00:00:59.420> my<00:00:59.570> foot

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
foot catch my body weight what my foot

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.500 
foot catch my body weight what my foot
must<00:01:00.079> be<00:01:00.199> flowing<00:01:00.850> going<00:01:01.850> through<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.300> foot

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
must be flowing going through the foot

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.210 
must be flowing going through the foot
so<00:01:03.379> this<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.309> my<00:01:04.690> body<00:01:05.690> weight<00:01:06.220> transfer

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
so this is my body weight transfer

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.720 
so this is my body weight transfer
action<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.420> my<00:01:08.750> next<00:01:08.990> step<00:01:09.080> OOP<00:01:09.740> my<00:01:10.280> body<00:01:10.550> is

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
action so my next step OOP my body is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.140 
action so my next step OOP my body is
falling<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.860> my<00:01:12.860> foot<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:13.340> quicker<00:01:13.760> than<00:01:14.000> my

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
falling and my foot it's quicker than my

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.920 
falling and my foot it's quicker than my
body<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.350> on<00:01:15.440> all<00:01:15.710> action<00:01:16.310> starts<00:01:16.760> again<00:01:17.210> the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
body so on all action starts again the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.800 
body so on all action starts again the
same<00:01:18.260> time<00:01:18.940> only<00:01:19.940> we're<00:01:20.330> going<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.600> add

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
same time only we're going to add

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.120 
same time only we're going to add
someone<00:01:22.150> we<00:01:23.150> put<00:01:23.450> our<00:01:23.660> shoulder<00:01:24.290> onto<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.160> hip

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
someone we put our shoulder onto the hip

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.570 
someone we put our shoulder onto the hip
onto<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.250> hip<00:01:28.370> on<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:29.060> hip<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:29.720> we<00:01:30.110> pressure

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
onto the hip on the hip so we pressure

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.140 
onto the hip on the hip so we pressure
we<00:01:31.580> turn<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.330> we<00:01:33.110> bring<00:01:33.320> down<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.950> we<00:01:34.940> get

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
we turn and we bring down and we get

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.880 
we turn and we bring down and we get
this<00:01:35.330> movement<00:01:35.630> because<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.230> shoulder<00:01:36.650> works

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
this movement because the shoulder works

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.190 
this movement because the shoulder works
against<00:01:37.280> all<00:01:37.660> actions<00:01:38.660> working<00:01:39.050> together

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
against all actions working together

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.930 
against all actions working together
working<00:01:39.980> together<00:01:40.160> working<00:01:40.610> together

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940
