00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.000
 hello welcome to improved of month we are going to 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.619
 begin our analysis as it comes 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.360
 being habitual with the content of the 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.610
 box and the box itself is a box of 30 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.230
 x 30 normal cardboard and inside 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.900
 curiously it does not bring any kind of a 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.490
 mini plastic or cardboard even 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.500
 that black thing that he brought together in 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.899
 silver city simply comes lined 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.530
 inside with a cardboard of the reins 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.390
 of love 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.920
 this is also typical of living and 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.180
 it is also true that although it does not bring 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.100
 those spacers does not bring that crib 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.690
 he always brings us in games 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.910
 weak very typical and I thank you 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.260
 very much about bringing the sachets to 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.179
 put all the content once state 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.039
 created then without more let's see then 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.570
 which contains the box of course what 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.160
 more calls attention inside the box 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.739
 of the cookies from Andorra is the 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.809
 super board and huge is a board 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.749
 of six wings that also has two sides 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.219
 comes very well illustrated is very beautiful 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.300
 of very cool illustrations what 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.640
 shows that its creator was a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.830
 illustrator and the good ones and for one of 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.870
 the sides that you see here represents the 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.370
 land of andoni the castle and you see that 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.930
 towards the right side it derives from a 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.640
 mountain on the other side we have 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.500
 precisely the interior of that mountain 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 and a mine that we make a signal and with more 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.840
 care 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.580
 we also have two books of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.350
 instructions to call them books is a lot 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.480
 to call them are two leaflets one of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.210
 they are what is called the new shirt 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.710
 rules supplement that has the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.050
 written rules no image is something 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.700
 with the contents that you see there and that of 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.800
 down larger is a kind of guide 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.670
 introductory to play legend 1 and 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.710
 also learn to play 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.479
 On the other hand we have a board 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.770
 double side that is the team board 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.689
 that I know we will use in all 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.100
 legends except in the first one since in 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.350
 the first one we will use it on the other side 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.180
 which has the combat board we 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.740
 simply explains how to fight is a 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.380
 good way to undertake the rules 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.869
 We have four boards for the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.100
 players for the servers one in blue 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.690
 which represents a gentleman a the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.549
 yellow that represents a dwarf one in 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.020
 violet that represents a magician and one in 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.640
 green that represents an explorer the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.720
 boards also have double sides already 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.130
 that on the one hand well the character 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.330
 male and on the other side of the character 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.220
 female 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.650
 these boards are accompanied by 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.690
 of miniatures or thumbnails 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.310

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.530
 they represent the lords there are two 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.020
 decades because they have like I say hero 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.380
 male and female but logically 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.400
 we can only play with one at a time 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.230
 they are represented with the legs of 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.360
 color and we also have a figure 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.160

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.200
 we will develop the story is a 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.260

 in total they make a total of 12 12 letters 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.450
 silver and we have letters from now 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.040
 34 golden cards of the event that will go 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.420
 marking the course of the game the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.890
 plated in principle are used in the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.440
 first legend and in some other 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.440

 total that include some blank and 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.910
 we will talk about them these letters we 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.250
 they will develop the adventures of 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.230
 game 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.750

 15 that represent areas that are 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.930
 hidden by fog and that part of 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.190
 down has surprises are different 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.930
 we also have four well chips 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.790
 so that beings can drink during 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.470

 narrator this is for some legends 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.180
 in which that last box moves with 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.800
 we will comment 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.389

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.620
 used in almost all legends with 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.960
 all the legends now we will have 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.280
 some that are used in very legends 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.740

 we have four peasant tokens that 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.139
 they also represent a little 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.380
 possibility of monsters to enter

 eight landslide tokens that 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.660
 will use as I say in certain 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.900
 certain heights a little bit more 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.940
 big are the creature tokens are 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.990

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.280
 initial chips for the legend some 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.860
 they are simply to learn to play 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.720
