 There are many customers and the price is more expensive than Gandhi . 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.770
 So I thought this was the real thing . 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.490

 There are many cases of making the best selling country for sale

 When the pork belly that is good at English is the pungent and imports from foreign countries 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.420

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 The press and the press Oh, so wrong that eoneuse 6:00 on the case itself

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:35.200
