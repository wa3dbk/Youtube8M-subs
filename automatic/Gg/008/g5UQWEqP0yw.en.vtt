00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:20.420
 Motion capture is called a marker on each part of the factor 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:25.960
 A technology to turn on a grateful sphere and display its movement as data 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.960
 Markers are attached to the actor's body and heavy equipment zone etc. 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:36.610
 It is not real to use a model gun although it is actually used in the game such as heavy equipment 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:41.290
 Staff made models of Fortune's rail guns, etc. 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:45.650
 Also record the position of the actor's initial marker before taking action 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:50.150
 Perform calibration for initial setting 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.910
 The motion capture is the man in motion Han'ya by including Kojima Hiroshikyoku 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:57.290
 It was done witnessed 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:02.120
 To confirm the actor and the scene in front of the motion capture 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:07.160
 While checking the actual game screen which also brings a storyboard and a massive 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.750
 Contrast of character Explain how to move standing position in the scene 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:15.990
 Detailed meetings will be held 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:20.180
 I think that it is a field with a very sense of tension and doing a stroke of the actor who is a walking man 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.480
 It was quite difficult to get an ok take, and it was repeatedly retaking many times 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:30.100
 Actually , the rack distance was further needed above 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.100
 Or to edit about 10m words other capture data on the tool 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:44.930
 Bump lifts the president and cooperates with the big vote that is initially fallen in the sesar scene 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.250
 It isnt nicely come and I've tried capture in the form of increasing ask them to win 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.630
 Never been 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.630
 So the next shot was hanging with the president wire can be lifted 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.200
 Motions that are difficult to shoot in practice are various equipment and devices 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.440
 Captured data was taken 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.560
 In order to capture the movement of the Harrier or the helicopter to the desired place 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.050
 Camphor was using a die made sets and casters on the Chong 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.270
 Because it works 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.230
 I elaborate the working time of the recording at a later date in a large studio in the large-scale set by using the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.860
 Retake Yoko 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.780
 Oh 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.850
 You can check on the screen of the tool, but after you get in sync with the movement of the driver or the edge of the driver. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.650
 Let me shake it the same way 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:38.440
 When the motion capture data is delivered to production staff in the motion version 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.850
 A subtle facial expression play, etc., in which the data was finely modified and matched to the movement of the body 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.530
 Fine has not been cured in the sensor 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.880
 Characters up to six times that contains the movement at that and Les 6-size to modify the data and movement 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.880
 We pack camera work 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.310
 There is one such example, but slowly 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.310
 Rain stopped 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.530
 I'm not a person in this country too 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.530
 It's so slow to go around with that one 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:24.470
 For voice recording who in the Metal Gear predisposition and a number are also represented such as the open character of the facial expressions and mouth 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:28.910
 Bought a record about the facial expressions and mouth movements of the voice actor 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:33.500
 In addition, in order to put in a function that is automatically performed in response to the voice 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:38.650
 It was also asked to perform, such as reading the bending to sample so of speech recognition in voice actor 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.650
 Opportunity to use the p in Japanese is much One in the real 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.020
 snake 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.550
 I bought Ne got a handgun 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.030
 It usp 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.060
 Let's meet Tiajiro round fly 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.560
 The situation has changed 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.099
 Simply not going to go 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.099
 It was
