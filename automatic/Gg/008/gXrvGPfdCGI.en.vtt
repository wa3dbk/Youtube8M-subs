00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.020
 all right hello and welcome 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.020
 on my channel 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:16.830
 today it's about things you definitely do 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.869
 should not do beijing on one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.640
 live tiger you know what was pinkl 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.230
 in principle one has one of oneself 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.240
 picture shot or someone has of the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.980
 Big shot while you are stiff as one 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.599
 board have drangehÃ¤ngt you somewhere 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.699
 then then the funny places between 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.500
 two railings or what I between two 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.140
 cars or no idea 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.590
 between the breasts of two women 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.110
 or something like that and yes it's not good 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.640
 Idea what to do in my opinion 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.550
 a live tiger on any one 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.170
 dangerous animal because these trends is 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.660
 it always was a central station 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.700
 exactly because you make trends 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 and the question was then who will 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.680
 be first or the first one 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.059
 This trend is dying and I'm sure 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.949
 that it is completely harmless 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.930
 if you start you then stiff as one 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.049
 could put a board on a tiger could 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.960
 I'm sure I'll think too 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.799
 you so if you are planning a bank 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.810
 rob 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.790
 I would advise you to do this one dirk 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.350
 pantyhose or something else 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.210
 which ensures that your face 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.560
 is hidden so if you are not 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.350
 I have the pantyhose ready 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.689
 Do not recommend that you tape now 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.850
 Take really hard tape 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.530
 and the one that wraps my head because of me 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.680
 think the biggest punishment will be later 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.450
 if you get caught by the police 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.640
 when you tape the off take 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.570
 to identify if you are at all 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.460
 and I mean which bandit which 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.320
 Robber is so stupid and clicks his 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.920
 whole face with duct tape with 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.659
 Adhesive tape to think of ok you have too 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.579
 already consider the painful later 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.799
 is from the straight and in the region 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.329
 and at the nape of the neck and around the fraction 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.149
 when the beautiful your skin 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.009
 The glue has been eaten clean, you know 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.590
 what a flex is a flex in looks like that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.430
 a chainsaw so a hand chainsaw 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.049
 which one can use 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.600
 You know you have to cut something if it is 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.189
 metalist steel or wood 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.750
 and usually you have one 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.490
 accordingly a table on the man 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.530
 that then turns around nicely then 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.690
 see what you should not do is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.730
 if you do not have a table hey buddy can 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.739
 you give me help then 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.510
 He makes the beautiful bridge next 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.120
 piece of wood on his back and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.280
 then try in principle what you do 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.680
 Do you hit with a circular saw? 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.569
 to kill on the back of the other 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.239
 do 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.250
 yes, do that ten times and the eleventh time 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.709
 have you killed anyone so 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.510
 but if I mean one learns 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.220
 make mistakes a few more times and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.380
 then you have it behind you 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.640
 hey why not really up 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.330
 any weird things 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.489
 balance 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.310
 hey you're drunk why not on the 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.410
 porch on top of the railing 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.910
 balance your fucking idea if you get drunk 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.209
 I would not be something like that at all 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.010
 make or between two mountains is one 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.200
 huge part why are you running up on the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.709
 rope from a to b and then swing 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.860
 about it is likely 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.019
 I think I have to admit that money 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.230
 So it has really stupid tattoos 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.860
 where you in the aftermath really blatant 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.959
 I regret what happens to me spontaneously 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.209
 is a woman who is quite fat and 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.310
 fat gang on style makes it possible yes 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.739
 because she thinks gave style know 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.720
 even the crass part-time like that was 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.250
 You could sing the song ten times a day 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.739
 higher one I found horny and everyone found 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.859
 I change cool 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.630
 and then comes some role and 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.820
 Tattoos like the style somehow 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.730
 on the name thinks so now I can 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.920
 the purpose even further on the wagon with it 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.000
 then five weeks later 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.769
 and that she can be glad that it 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.440
 a little five weeks old has it all 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.450
 is uncool and then the role is simple 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.010
 Play games on your arms 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.510
 they stand for eternity 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.820
 unless it will become it then 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.670
 most likely painful way 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.900
 let lasers or where someone then 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.760
 something writes something great 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.630
 is self-deprecating here if there is 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.090
 Do not regret anything after that and then too 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.410
 still misspelled I mean 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.760
 there has to admit I was already like that 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.040
 stupid a ladder 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.810
 as insecure as possible to use like 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.180
 keep going like a ladder somewhere 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.299
 to put down where you say ey old let 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.650
 the dear is uncertain but if that time 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.970
 that's really wrong 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.560
 Dangerous pose the head 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.210
 Get up the ladder and climb 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.160
 on the ladder still a second ladder 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.479
 Exhibits when you die there 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.760
 but do not you wonder why? 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.560
 Dasein that quietly expect it 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.639
 First, a ladder on a ladder 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.610
 many result in many meters and secondly 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.510
 have a lot of mud buckles trouble 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.979
 you also ever such an idiot 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.350
 he experienced his bike from close on 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.180
 the place where you just closed 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.430
 can easily pull up 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.220
 Do you know if the weather is right what I am 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.440
 The head of the master of the pier only 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.120
 knows white that I'm five feet high 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.220
 just go out okay if you can 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.930
 it concludes there is no one that in part 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.669
 living so high that the above again 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.979
 But if it can then pull out 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.930
 Here we are until we reach yours 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.789
 waist and you go with your bike 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.220
 Hey there someone just needs to go that way 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.860
 must do and then you have the lock 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.199
 about it leveraged this state is 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.750
 what is going on with it is always 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.060
 No good idea to exaggerate no matter 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.220
 what it is like if there is too much water on the 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.810
 chicken wings too much drugs drugs 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.910
 Generally there is not too much that is 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.650
 all too much but cigarettes with the 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.270
 mouth takes you however by 2 through 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.310
 the nose and the ears what can 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.139
 Too much nicotine is wrong 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.460
 not deadly that's just on it 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.130
 that's just a deterrent 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.810
 Well in the video description you come 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.539
 to the next video and indeed to the video 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.520
 you already have glaring gta facts gta 5 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.110
 played or knows the gta is watching you 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.280
 the facts on walls are facts of 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.630
 whom you may and still cherish 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.300
 has not heard is actually like that 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.889
 and the haws you partially clicks 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.330
 in freiburg the video and I are watching 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.870

 Thank you for turning on until tomorrow 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:10.790
