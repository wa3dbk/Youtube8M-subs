melody<00:03:44.120> together<00:03:45.079> those<00:03:45.470> two<00:03:45.680> things<00:03:45.799> can<00:03:46.040> be

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
melody together those two things can be

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.250 
melody together those two things can be
very<00:03:46.190> powerful<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.239> without<00:03:47.660> one<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.019> them

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
very powerful and without one of them

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.509 
very powerful and without one of them
use<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.799> sort<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.099> falls<00:03:49.400> apart<00:03:49.609> so<00:03:51.400> let<00:03:52.400> me

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
use it sort of falls apart so let me

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.059 
use it sort of falls apart so let me
just<00:03:52.669> say<00:03:52.849> this<00:03:53.230> if<00:03:54.230> nothing<00:03:54.530> else<00:03:54.859> be

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
just say this if nothing else be

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.830 
just say this if nothing else be
focusing<00:03:55.639> on<00:03:55.790> your<00:03:55.940> breathing<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.419> be<00:03:56.599> aware

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
focusing on your breathing and be aware

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.839 
focusing on your breathing and be aware
of<00:03:56.900> how<00:03:57.200> you're<00:03:57.440> breathing<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:58.099> is<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.459> improve

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
of how you're breathing to is to improve

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.120 
of how you're breathing to is to improve
it<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.900> means<00:04:00.139> you<00:04:00.380> don't<00:04:00.620> always<00:04:00.859> have

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
it so that means you don't always have

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.460 
it so that means you don't always have
to<00:04:01.310> know<00:04:02.030> exactly<00:04:02.150> what<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.900> what<00:04:03.319> you're

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
to know exactly what you what you're

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.009 
to know exactly what you what you're
trying<00:04:03.799> to<00:04:03.889> accomplish<00:04:04.220> but<00:04:04.669> with<00:04:05.510> breathing

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
trying to accomplish but with breathing

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.280 
trying to accomplish but with breathing
I<00:04:06.260> you<00:04:07.069> just<00:04:07.310> need<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.519> be<00:04:07.639> aware<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.290> it's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
I you just need to be aware that it's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.870 
I you just need to be aware that it's
coming<00:04:09.709> from<00:04:09.919> your<00:04:10.459> gut

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
coming from your gut

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.280 
coming from your gut
and<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.060> think<00:04:11.329> if<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.540> start<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.989> do<00:04:12.139> this

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
and I think if you start to do this

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.280 
and I think if you start to do this
you'll<00:04:12.530> find<00:04:12.769> that<00:04:13.540> your<00:04:14.540> plane<00:04:14.810> will<00:04:15.079> just

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
you'll find that your plane will just

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.800 
you'll find that your plane will just
exponentially<00:04:15.919> get<00:04:16.280> better<00:04:16.630> just<00:04:17.630> the

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
exponentially get better just the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.110 
exponentially get better just the
awareness<00:04:17.900> alone<00:04:18.590> of<00:04:18.859> hey<00:04:19.430> breathing<00:04:20.000> is

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
awareness alone of hey breathing is

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.969 
awareness alone of hey breathing is
important<00:04:20.599> people<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.380> don't<00:04:21.650> think<00:04:21.739> about

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
important people that don't think about

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.540 
important people that don't think about
it<00:04:22.280> just<00:04:22.430> sort<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:22.849> never<00:04:23.750> really<00:04:24.050> get

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
it just sort of never really get

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.790 
it just sort of never really get
a<00:04:24.580> certain<00:04:25.060> level<00:04:25.229> just<00:04:26.229> know<00:04:26.409> that<00:04:26.620> it's

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
a certain level just know that it's

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800 
a certain level just know that it's
relaxed<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.699> comes<00:04:28.000> from<00:04:28.270> your<00:04:28.419> diaphragm

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
relaxed it comes from your diaphragm

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.770 
relaxed it comes from your diaphragm
from<00:04:29.289> way<00:04:29.500> down<00:04:29.740> in<00:04:29.949> your<00:04:29.979> gut<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.780> it's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
from way down in your gut and it's

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.309 
from way down in your gut and it's
controlled<00:04:32.409> and<00:04:32.680> regulated<00:04:33.990> for<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.110> sake<00:04:35.289> of

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
controlled and regulated for the sake of

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.260 
controlled and regulated for the sake of
creating<00:04:35.830> really<00:04:36.129> good<00:04:36.310> tone<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.849> stretching

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
creating really good tone and stretching

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:48.610 
creating really good tone and stretching
out<00:04:37.419> notes

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.939 

I<00:04:52.160> think<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.220> large<00:04:53.759> part<00:04:53.819> of<00:04:54.120> tone<00:04:54.740> comes<00:04:55.740> from

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
I think a large part of tone comes from

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.620 
I think a large part of tone comes from
just<00:04:56.190> being<00:04:56.580> aware<00:04:56.849> of<00:04:56.910> how<00:04:57.120> your<00:04:57.300> breathing

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
just being aware of how your breathing

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.990 
just being aware of how your breathing
banging<00:04:58.410> just<00:04:59.009> know<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.370> there's<00:04:59.550> a<00:04:59.610> lot<00:04:59.729> to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
banging just know that there's a lot to

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.300 
banging just know that there's a lot to
it<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.330> it's<00:05:00.479> gonna<00:05:00.599> take<00:05:00.840> years<00:05:01.139> to<00:05:01.310> to

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
it and it's gonna take years to to

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.879 
it and it's gonna take years to to
perfect<00:05:02.819> it<00:05:03.030> or<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.930> try<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.139> master<00:05:04.650> it<00:05:04.740> can

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
perfect it or to try to master it can

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.920 
perfect it or to try to master it can
take<00:05:05.039> a<00:05:05.069> lifetime<00:05:05.340> it's<00:05:06.240> it's<00:05:06.509> not<00:05:06.630> something

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
take a lifetime it's it's not something

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.050 
take a lifetime it's it's not something
that<00:05:07.080> happens<00:05:07.470> overnight<00:05:07.789> don't<00:05:08.789> it<00:05:08.910> don't

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
that happens overnight don't it don't

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.719 
that happens overnight don't it don't
get<00:05:09.240> frustrated<00:05:09.870> when<00:05:09.990> you<00:05:10.110> can't<00:05:10.380> control

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
get frustrated when you can't control

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.980 
get frustrated when you can't control
the<00:05:11.729> different<00:05:12.060> levels<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.419> things<00:05:12.630> on<00:05:12.870> the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
the different levels of things on the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.689 
the different levels of things on the
3-hole<00:05:13.410> for<00:05:13.620> example<00:05:17.810> does<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.960> just<00:05:19.139> draw

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
3-hole for example does it just draw

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.430 
3-hole for example does it just draw
half-step<00:05:20.699> whole-step<00:05:21.000> them<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.930> triple

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
half-step whole-step them and triple

half-step whole-step them and triple
bend<00:05:22.650> right<00:05:22.860> there<00:05:23.569> took<00:05:24.569> a<00:05:24.599> long<00:05:24.810> time<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:25.169> get

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
bend right there took a long time to get

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:26.960 
bend right there took a long time to get
to<00:05:25.349> that<00:05:25.500> point<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:25.949> don't<00:05:26.039> get<00:05:26.220> frustrated

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
to that point so don't get frustrated

to that point so don't get frustrated

about the exact note choice just the
