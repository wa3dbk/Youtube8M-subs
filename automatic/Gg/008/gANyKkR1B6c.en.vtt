you know also growing tomatoes as you
can<00:01:41.909> see<00:01:42.530> but<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:44.159> very<00:01:44.430> small<00:01:44.759> in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
can see but it's very small in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.090 
can see but it's very small in
comparison<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.440> big<00:01:46.800> that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
comparison to the one that's big that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.940

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
here for the cucumbers so it can climb

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.210 
here for the cucumbers so it can climb
up<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.740> receiving<00:02:05.130> holder<00:02:06.320> as<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.590> no<00:02:07.740> efforts
