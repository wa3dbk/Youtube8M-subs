00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 I speak about the Mexican team and today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.280
 I have the information that his or miguel 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:11.099
 juanpa on this tour that started with that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.990
 they opened later he was in doing 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.820
 roads or because this does not lend this 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.070
 I think in fact other technicians but we do not 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.920
 the price for what they did or if it swells 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.439
 what is going to go on information as it is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.769
 for example yesterday as I talk with 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.090
 torrado can not summon torrado to spend 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.789
 in the good 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.700
 but you also have to know how to differentiate 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.710
 no or not everything you see for that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.489
 He also talked with the owner of the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.489
 better selection 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 in the same way they have to be like 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.920
 americas not like yesterday in crossing of but 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.140
 yesterday that for me it's better than 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.530
 medically mediatic that with 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.109
 would have liked to see that image of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
 matosas and miguel saluting be yes 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.469
 there is a press release after 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.120
 they greet you then with a statement 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.100
 press in which the photos have to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.390
 technical actions yes but there were errors and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.390
 newspaper flowers us 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.140
 avoid that excuse of not having exhibited 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.990
 but there returning to the same thing those are 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.310
 it's too early to say what I was going to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.280
 mention the adjective that is going to put 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.430
 those are mental only from the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.229
 reporter or editor thinks he is 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.660
 also responsibility and the midwife 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.440
 draw a conclusion from the one that 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.440
 said vargas 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.410
 is the reporter and it's excuse me it's the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.660
 reporter when they ask cow there 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.400
 I talk with you, I do not talk, as I said 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.220
 I had the Spanish accent and said this guy 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.080
 is Catalan or is from Valencia but 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.100
 contour plastic then 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.070
 torrado and they start the reporter to create 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.760
 that story I decree as I talk with 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.410
 torrado 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.800
 may be to reach the selection 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.930
 national could be now it makes me a 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.080
 ridiculous is that from a talk 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.250
 yes I guess on the phone and what can 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.220
 invite her home and talk with the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.080
 people on a daily basis means that they can not 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.770
 go without us noticing to look 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.650
 some player and do that now this 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.980
 this many people applaud what Miguel is 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.350
 maybe media applauds without exaggerating 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.600
 do not appreciate it exaggerates but when you 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.140
 Toast too much with hong and nothing else 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.420
 Miguel said something of torrado were not 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:55.410
 the media that started to take that 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:58.630
 conclusion is that as they have the 33 33 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.450
 33 has a regular tournament for the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.040
 outline anything else you are 112 for the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.660
 scheme that uses miguel to the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.480
 selection serves you torrado we have said 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.360
 two names of guys who are going to fight 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.489
 of headlines in the first team this 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.709
 selection in the gold cup the rooster 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.330
 vázquez and jonathan dos santos jonathan 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.209
 two saints may cost you more work and 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.680
 he is better playing as a steering wheel 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.239
 saved jonathan from the other side then 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.180
 the speculations on that subject are 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.000
 even the purchases to tureportero yesterday not 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.040
 not notice that I learned not so for 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.569
 all for the shade as they say now 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.680
 to rubén 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.319
 yesterday I listened in the afternoon 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.989
 the radio program on tv w and 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.629
 they interviewed torrado and they asked him 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.549
 hey I talk to you but it did not go beyond 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:54.599
 of not journalistically he has something but 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.019
 you just have to turn around to see how 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.090
 plays the selection and ccoo and what is the 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.650
 working of towers spoken with 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.680
 martín zúñiga your wind for your mouth 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.859
 because the call is going to get you going to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.340
 reach the selection at some point 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.340
 being a spouse 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.569
 the group that we are working for 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.880
 arrive for now be in 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.549
 Olympic Pan American Games and will reach the 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.130
 Olympic only idea and bring it is 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.259
 tried to negotiate his group for Spain 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.720
 the omen go the valence at least 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.720
 and I speak paul aguilar of the selection 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.639
 not that every tornado starts the goals 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.979
 It is always to be in the selection 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.770
 a good tournament here to be taken 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.069
 into account by the directors of the the 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.750
 technical body of selection but but the 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.460
 I think this view is very good 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.789
 speaks of the closeness they have with the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.250
 player with the clubs so how good 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.319
 what each player has to do is follow 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.630
 working in their clubs to go 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.580
 there I only want to contribute 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.889
 granite sand 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.509
 from the soul inside the court to 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.849
 try to give my best in each 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.770
 party since the one who decides who goes or 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.030
 who does not go is miguel so let's leave the 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.030
 responsibility of not being here we have
