00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:06.758
Hi, I am Francis, 

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:09.581
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.547
First, season the boneless chicken thighs 

00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:24.819
with the white pepper thoroughly.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.478
Sprinkle on the salt 

00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:34.916
and lightly pat the seasonings onto both sides.

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.769
Let the chicken sit for about 10 minutes.

00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:44.490
Meanwhile, let’s cut the vegetables.

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:48.233
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise.

00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:52.218
Chop it into thick half moons.

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:02.692
Cut the half onion into 4 wedges 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.757
and then cut them in half crosswise.

00:01:11.817 --> 00:01:14.222
Peel the lotus root with a peeler.

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:20.805
Cut it in half lengthwise 

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:24.766
and then cut the root into wedges 

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:29.025
by turning it after each cut as chef is doing here.

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:34.989
Remove the root end of the turnip.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.304
Quarter the turnip 

00:01:43.064 --> 00:01:46.904
and rinse the stem ends thoroughly using a bamboo stick.

00:01:55.784 --> 00:01:57.745
Peel the satoimo taro.

00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:08.322
If it is a large root cut it in half.

00:02:13.387 --> 00:02:16.295
Remove the firm stringy parts of the celery.

00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:22.124
And then cut into bite-size pieces.

00:02:29.372 --> 00:02:32.459
With your hands, separate the maitake mushrooms 

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:36.960
and then chop them into fine pieces.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.692
Likewise, chop the shiitake mushrooms 

00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:46.667
and the shimeji mushrooms into fine pieces.

00:02:47.253 --> 00:02:51.279
You can also use enoki and king oyster mushrooms 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.871
but be careful not to use too much maitake mushrooms 

00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.328
to maintain the white color of the stew.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.928
Now, lightly remove the excess moisture 

00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:07.403
from the surface of the chicken using a paper towel.

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:16.624
Dust both sides of the chicken with any type of flour.

00:03:22.508 --> 00:03:24.993
Add the vegetable oil to a heated pot.

00:03:28.223 --> 00:03:32.733
Place the chicken pieces into the pot with the skin side facing down.

00:03:44.112 --> 00:03:47.387
When they are lightly browned, flip them over.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.394
Lightly cook the other side, 

00:03:58.394 --> 00:03:59.847
remove the chicken 

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:02.824
and reserve them on a plate.

00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:10.845
Remove the remaining oil with a paper towel.

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:15.049
Add the olive oil 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.052
and turn on the burner.

00:04:18.356 --> 00:04:19.845
To the heated pot, 

00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:21.014
add the carrot, 

00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:21.817
onion, 

00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:22.857
lotus root, 

00:04:22.857 --> 00:04:24.271
satoimo taro, 

00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:25.241
turnip 

00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.428
and celery. 

00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:34.329
Lightly stir-fry the vegetables with a pair of tongs.

00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:45.222
Place the reserved chicken into the pot 

00:04:47.944 --> 00:04:49.990
and pour on the white wine.

00:04:52.973 --> 00:04:57.051
Continue to stir-fry, evaporating the alcohol completely.

00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:03.049
Now, sprinkle on the salt 

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.728
and add the water to the pot.

00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:12.822
Cover with a lid 

00:05:12.822 --> 00:05:17.226
and simmer the vegetables on medium low heat for 20 minutes.

00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:22.708
Meanwhile, let’s make the white roux with the mushrooms.

00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:26.317
First, add the olive oil to a pan 

00:05:27.103 --> 00:05:29.859
and drop in the sliced garlic and onion.

00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:32.583
Turn on the burner 

00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:36.844
and stir-fry them on low heat.

00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:41.490
When the aroma grows stronger 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.588
and the onion and garlic turn golden brown, 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.185
add the bay leaf 

00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:49.987
and the chopped mushrooms.

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:53.305
Distribute them evenly 

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:57.579
and sprinkle on the salt 

00:05:58.798 --> 00:06:00.557
and the white pepper.

00:06:02.947 --> 00:06:05.654
Stir-fry until the mushrooms are browned, 

00:06:05.654 --> 00:06:08.612
making them more fragrant and savory.

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:12.805
Add the cake flour 

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:16.306
and stir-fry the mixture thoroughly on low heat.

00:06:17.737 --> 00:06:19.593
Be careful not to burn it.

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:28.214
Now, gradually pour the milk into the pan 

00:06:28.214 --> 00:06:30.135
while stirring the mixture.

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:37.829
Mix until smooth, 

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:39.679
bring it to a boil 

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:41.966
and now the white roux is ready.

00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:48.130
And now, the vegetables and chicken are ready.

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:56.370
Add the white roux to the pot.

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:04.641
Gently mix the ingredients, distributing the roux evenly.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.800
Simmer it for a couple of minutes.

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:15.051
Test the flavor of the stew 

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.037
and adjust to taste with salt 

00:07:17.657 --> 00:07:19.043
and pepper.

00:07:25.076 --> 00:07:27.381
Now, it is ready to serve.

00:07:29.604 --> 00:07:32.225
Ladle the cream stew into a bowl.

00:07:39.763 --> 00:07:42.749
Finally, sprinkle on the parsley leaves.

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:48.082
You can substitute pork, beef or salmon for the chicken.

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:52.993
Potatos, cabbage, broccoli, green peas and corn 

00:07:52.993 --> 00:07:55.532
also go great with this recipe.

00:08:00.597 --> 00:08:03.040
You can adjust the consistency of the stew 

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.466
by diluting it with chicken stock.

00:08:06.466 --> 00:08:08.553
Good luck in the kitchen!
