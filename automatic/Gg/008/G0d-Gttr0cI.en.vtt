hello and welcome to another episode of
common<00:00:02.429> fusion<00:00:02.790> this<00:00:03.300> week<00:00:03.540> we're<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.810> to

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
common fusion this week we're going to

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.520 
common fusion this week we're going to
look<00:00:04.049> at<00:00:04.200> how<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.589> pour<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> classic<00:00:05.430> Rosetta<00:00:09.530> so

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
look at how to pour a classic Rosetta so

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.930 
look at how to pour a classic Rosetta so
guys<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.820> those

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
guys this really is one of those

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.400 
guys this really is one of those
patterns<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.509> should<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.900> your<00:00:13.049> arsenal

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
patterns that should be in your arsenal

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.499 
patterns that should be in your arsenal
when<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.920> comes<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.219> free<00:00:14.400> pour<00:00:14.580> latte<00:00:14.969> art<00:00:15.120> so

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
when it comes to free pour latte art so

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
when it comes to free pour latte art so
let's<00:00:15.929> take<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> look<00:00:16.379> at<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> steps<00:00:16.830> support

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
let's take a look at the steps support

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.650 
let's take a look at the steps support
the<00:00:17.520> perfect<00:00:17.880> Rosetta

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the perfect Rosetta

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.330 
the perfect Rosetta
first<00:00:19.109> things<00:00:19.320> first<00:00:19.410> guys<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.949> want<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> set

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
first things first guys you want to set

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.220 
first things first guys you want to set
the<00:00:20.430> crema<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> really<00:00:21.390> good<00:00:21.480> face<00:00:21.720> for

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
the crema and get a really good face for

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.660 
the crema and get a really good face for
your<00:00:22.320> pattern<00:00:25.099> now<00:00:26.099> we're<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> move<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
your pattern now we're going to move the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.000 
your pattern now we're going to move the
choke<00:00:26.820> closer<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> cup<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:28.380> back<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
choke closer to the cup just back in the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.170 
choke closer to the cup just back in the
center<00:00:30.890> okay<00:00:31.890> guys<00:00:32.070> now<00:00:32.309> very<00:00:32.550> slowly<00:00:32.910> we're

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
center okay guys now very slowly we're

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.180 
center okay guys now very slowly we're
gonna<00:00:33.300> move<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.719> jug<00:00:34.020> left<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> right<00:00:34.680> back

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
gonna move that jug left to right back

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.310 
gonna move that jug left to right back
and<00:00:35.399> forth<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.180> very<00:00:36.360> symmetrical<00:00:37.020> looking

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and forth in a very symmetrical looking

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
and forth in a very symmetrical looking
pattern<00:00:39.290> now<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.739> face<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> Rosetta

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
pattern now as that face of the Rosetta

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.250 
pattern now as that face of the Rosetta
start<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.420> wrap<00:00:42.600> around<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.230> itself

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
start to wrap around it in on itself

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
start to wrap around it in on itself
we're<00:00:43.890> gonna<00:00:44.070> slowly<00:00:44.550> move<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> jug<00:00:45.420> back

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
we're gonna slowly move the jug back

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.389 
we're gonna slowly move the jug back
while<00:00:46.050> continuing<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> pour<00:00:46.950> left<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.579> right

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
while continuing to pour left to right

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.799 
while continuing to pour left to right
now<00:00:50.399> guys<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:50.940> we've<00:00:51.120> reached<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> top<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
now guys as we've reached the top of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.080 
now guys as we've reached the top of
that<00:00:51.870> Rosetta<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> cups<00:00:52.890> almost<00:00:53.250> full<00:00:53.520> we

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that Rosetta and the cups almost full we

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.240 
that Rosetta and the cups almost full we
want<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> push<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> heart<00:00:55.020> lift<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> jug

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
want to push in a heart lift up the jug

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.830 
want to push in a heart lift up the jug
and<00:00:56.489> pull<00:00:56.850> through

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.960 

so<00:01:01.840> that's<00:01:02.590> how<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.800> pull<00:01:03.070> your<00:01:03.250> Rosetta<00:01:03.640> now

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
so that's how you pull your Rosetta now

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:36.700 
so that's how you pull your Rosetta now
let's<00:01:04.210> have<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.390> look<00:01:04.540> at<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.720> few<00:01:04.900> more<00:01:05.050> examples

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.810 

okay<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.950> hope<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.220> guys<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> figure<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
okay so I hope you guys to figure that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
okay so I hope you guys to figure that
out<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.060> outside<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.780> practice<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
out the outside for you to practice and

this week on free ball Friday we're
gonna<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.960> Rosetta's<00:01:43.500> only<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.280> who<00:01:44.430> can

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
gonna have Rosetta's only to see who can

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.690 
gonna have Rosetta's only to see who can
pull<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.910> best<00:01:45.090> Rosetta's<00:01:49.640> speaking<00:01:50.640> of
