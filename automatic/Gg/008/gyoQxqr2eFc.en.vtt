Mauri as well as the Kamui this is my
first<00:00:19.430> installation<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.880> tip<00:00:21.150> we're

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
first installation of this tip we're

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.730 
first installation of this tip we're
gonna<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.350> how<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.470> goes

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
gonna see how it goes

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.310 
gonna see how it goes
it's<00:00:23.130> quite<00:00:23.400> unique<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.320> single

layer tan leather along with the black

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839 
layer tan leather along with the black
leather<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.439> distinguish<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.609> tip

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
leather so you can distinguish this tip

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.580 
leather so you can distinguish this tip
from<00:00:30.599> any<00:00:30.810> other<00:00:30.990> ones<00:00:31.199> once<00:00:31.439> they're

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
installed good it just sounded up scuff

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:54.090 
installed good it just sounded up scuff
it<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.809> same<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.200> any<00:00:37.770> other<00:00:37.860> chip

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.139 

certainly<00:01:32.060> doesn't<00:01:32.270> take<00:01:32.509> too<00:01:32.689> long<00:01:32.719> to<00:01:33.079> dry

on<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.359> tip<00:01:36.159> obviously<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.249> longer<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:38.630> have

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
on the tip obviously the longer you have

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.539 
on the tip obviously the longer you have
to<00:01:39.109> let<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.380> set<00:01:39.560> up<00:01:39.679> the<00:01:39.859> better<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:40.369> going

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
to let it set up the better it's going
