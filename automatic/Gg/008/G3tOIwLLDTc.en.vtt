we start off real slow but I think it

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
we start off real slow but I think it

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
it's been great you know I think a lot

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.190 
it's been great you know I think a lot
of<00:01:44.700> people<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.090> question<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.660> you<00:01:46.110> know

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
of people of question that you know

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.030 
of people of question that you know
whether<00:01:46.380> we're<00:01:46.530> gonna<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.740> able<00:01:46.800> to<00:01:46.920> play

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
whether we're gonna be able to play

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590 
whether we're gonna be able to play
together<00:01:47.150> because<00:01:48.150> of<00:01:48.240> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.450> same

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
together because of kind of same

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
together because of kind of same
position<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.410> think<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.040> far<00:01:50.190> we've<00:01:50.370> been

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
position but I think so far we've been

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.740 
position but I think so far we've been
showing<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.760> you<00:01:50.910> know<00:01:51.000> we're<00:01:51.360> able<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.630> make

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
showing that you know we're able to make

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
showing that you know we're able to make
that<00:01:51.780> happen<00:01:51.900> they're<00:01:52.740> gonna<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.950> fine<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that happen they're gonna be fine to the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.560 
that happen they're gonna be fine to the
transition<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.850> defensive<00:01:54.330> end<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
transition of the defensive end of the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.290 
transition of the defensive end of the
floor<00:01:54.660> here<00:01:55.080> with<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> oh<00:01:55.910> it's<00:01:56.910> been<00:01:57.090> it's

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
floor here with you oh it's been it's

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.610 
floor here with you oh it's been it's
been<00:01:57.390> tough<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:57.870> I<00:01:58.050> think<00:01:58.230> the<00:01:58.290> main<00:01:58.410> thing<00:01:58.470> is

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.890 
been tough and I think the main thing is
is<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.160> physicality<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.760> that<00:01:59.970> part<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.810> know
