00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.620 
and I finally started getting hungry
around<00:04:16.560> two<00:04:16.890> o'clock<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.970> that's<00:04:18.390> what<00:04:18.600> that

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
around two o'clock so that's what that

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.480 
around two o'clock so that's what that
looks<00:04:18.989> like<00:04:20.030> then<00:04:21.030> later<00:04:21.359> on<00:04:21.510> in<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.840> day<00:04:22.490> this

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
looks like then later on in the day this

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.870 
looks like then later on in the day this
is<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:23.820> rest<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.240> my<00:04:24.390> consumption<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.670> know

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
is the rest of my consumption and I know

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.090 
is the rest of my consumption and I know
I<00:04:26.910> shouldn't<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.300> had<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:27.540> last<00:04:27.720> one<00:04:28.200> but

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
