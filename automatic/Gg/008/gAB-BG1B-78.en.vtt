the<00:01:42.610> center<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:43.090> gravity<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.540> line

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
the center of gravity the line

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.480 
the center of gravity the line
indicating<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.800> center<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.220> his<00:01:45.310> body

knee is slightly bent but it's not mushy

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.750 
knee is slightly bent but it's not mushy
remember<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.470> leg<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.830> not<00:01:54.010> spaghetti<00:01:54.340> it's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
remember the leg is not spaghetti it's

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.640 
remember the leg is not spaghetti it's

forwards<00:02:34.030> left<00:02:34.360> right<00:02:34.720> everything<00:02:35.320> will<00:02:35.709> come

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
forwards left right everything will come

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.560 
forwards left right everything will come
out<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.370> position<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.180> where<00:02:37.390> he

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
out of this position this is where he

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.940 
out of this position this is where he
can<00:02:37.720> maintain<00:02:37.870> his<00:02:38.230> stance

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
can maintain his stance

so<00:02:41.140> when<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.320> get<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.620> kid<00:02:41.890> coming<00:02:42.220> into<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.520> gym

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
so when I get a kid coming into the gym

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.070 
so when I get a kid coming into the gym
this<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.150> first<00:02:43.390> thing<00:02:43.630> will<00:02:43.840> shoulder

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
this is the first thing will shoulder

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.700 
this is the first thing will shoulder
from<00:02:44.890> there<00:02:45.160> from<00:02:45.850> what

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
from there from what

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.950 
from there from what
wanted<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.310> now<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:47.910> able<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.390> move<00:02:48.570> now

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
wanted to do now is be able to move now

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.500 
wanted to do now is be able to move now
if<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.650> move<00:02:49.860> forward<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.730> very<00:02:50.970> important

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
if you move forward it's very important

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.630 
if you move forward it's very important
to<00:02:51.570> remember<00:02:51.810> when<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.230> go<00:02:52.380> forward<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.310> foot

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
to remember when you go forward the foot

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.670 
to remember when you go forward the foot
that<00:02:53.880> moves<00:02:54.180> first<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.900> front<00:02:55.200> foot<00:02:55.500> and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
that moves first is the front foot and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.590 
that moves first is the front foot and
we<00:02:55.770> like<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.160> do<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.820> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.330> rhythmic

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
we like to do this in kind of a rhythmic

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.050 
we like to do this in kind of a rhythmic
motion<00:02:58.110> don't<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.220> into<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.550> habit<00:02:59.970> of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
motion don't think into the habit of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.630 
motion don't think into the habit of
stepping<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.010> doing<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.370> start

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
stepping and doing this you start

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.240 
stepping and doing this you start
stepping<00:03:03.260> backwards<00:03:04.260> or<00:03:04.410> forwards<00:03:04.890> left<00:03:05.100> and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
stepping backwards or forwards left and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.440 
stepping backwards or forwards left and
right<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.640> you're<00:03:05.820> not<00:03:06.000> going<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.240> develop

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
right and you're not going to develop

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.300 
right and you're not going to develop
any<00:03:06.750> kind<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.170> rhythm<00:03:07.350> your<00:03:07.830> weight<00:03:08.070> will

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
any kind of rhythm your weight will

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.400 
any kind of rhythm your weight will
never<00:03:08.460> be<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.940> right<00:03:09.090> place<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.110> won't

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
never be in the right place so you won't

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.080 
never be in the right place so you won't
be<00:03:10.500> able<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.770> hit<00:03:10.890> your<00:03:10.980> punches<00:03:11.550> off<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.940> what

yellow room here so we're going to go

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.510 
yellow room here so we're going to go
backwards<00:03:19.440> damage<00:03:19.770> at<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.070> point<00:03:20.370> remember

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
backwards damage at this point remember

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.460 
backwards damage at this point remember
backwards<00:03:21.060> let's<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:21.660> slide<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:22.230> back

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
backwards let's just slide on back

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.710 
backwards let's just slide on back
that's<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.250> nice<00:03:23.490> little<00:03:23.730> bit<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.180> anyone<00:03:24.540> use

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
and then go forward you do the same

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.280 
and then go forward you do the same
thing<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.360> just<00:03:27.540> get<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.810> nice<00:03:28.020> little

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
thing and just get that nice little

thing and just get that nice little
rhythm<00:03:28.530> coming<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.160> during<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.060> time

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
rhythm coming in during that and time

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.900 
rhythm coming in during that and time
time<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:31.110> position<00:03:31.740> never<00:03:31.980> changes<00:03:32.610> we<00:03:32.760> do

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
time this position never changes we do

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.240 
time this position never changes we do
it<00:03:33.000> again<00:03:33.210> Google<00:03:33.900> fiber's<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.770> position

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
it again Google fiber's the position

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.700 
it again Google fiber's the position
never<00:03:35.490> changes<00:03:36.000> ready<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.420> go<00:03:36.570> drop<00:03:37.260> your<00:03:37.470> hand

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
again and backwards and then all that's

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.730 
again and backwards and then all that's
that<00:03:44.610> nice<00:03:44.880> little<00:03:45.180> rhythmic<00:03:45.660> action<00:03:45.840> now<00:03:46.410> if

that kind of rhythm happening this is
the<00:04:13.440> first<00:04:13.740> thing<00:04:13.950> we<00:04:14.190> will<00:04:14.340> do<00:04:14.550> what<00:04:14.760> we<00:04:14.910> work

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
the first thing we will do what we work

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.180

the first thing we'll teach them that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.350 
the first thing we'll teach them that
nice<00:04:21.360> movement<00:04:21.630> forwards<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.740> backwards

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
nice movement forwards and backwards

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.590 
nice movement forwards and backwards
nicely

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
nicely

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.180

keep moving and keep doing it and
backwards<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.560> got<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.340> keep<00:04:35.520> repeating<00:04:35.940> this

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
backwards you got to keep repeating this

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.120 
backwards you got to keep repeating this
at<00:04:36.390> first<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.870> gets<00:04:37.050> kind<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.440> keep<00:04:37.620> on<00:04:37.800> at

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
at first it gets kind of keep on at

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.310 
at first it gets kind of keep on at
first<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.670> get<00:04:38.790> somewhat<00:04:39.330> monotonous<00:04:39.660> for<00:04:39.960> you
