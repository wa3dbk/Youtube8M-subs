next friday night she's she's getting up
a<00:05:05.320> bit<00:05:05.440> earlier<00:05:05.740> than<00:05:05.830> what<00:05:05.980> i<00:05:06.010> am<00:05:06.220> at<00:05:06.310> the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
a bit earlier than what i am at the

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.640 
a bit earlier than what i am at the
moment<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:06.910> she's<00:05:07.720> driving<00:05:08.080> very<00:05:08.260> well<00:05:08.500> and

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
moment so she's driving very well and

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.230 
moment so she's driving very well and
it's<00:05:08.770> going<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.920> be<00:05:09.070> another<00:05:09.520> awesome<00:05:09.820> jewel<00:05:10.210> i

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
it's going to be another awesome jewel i

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.430 
it's going to be another awesome jewel i
think<00:05:10.570> with<00:05:10.690> another<00:05:10.930> couple<00:05:11.170> of<00:05:11.260> guys

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
think with another couple of guys

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.680 
think with another couple of guys
probably<00:05:12.030> going<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.120> step<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.390> up<00:05:13.450> a<00:05:13.570> little

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
probably going to step it up a little

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.120 
probably going to step it up a little
bit<00:05:13.840> more<00:05:13.990> as<00:05:14.140> well<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:14.560> there's<00:05:14.740> no<00:05:14.860> reason

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
bit more as well so there's no reason

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.890 
bit more as well so there's no reason
why<00:05:15.400> all<00:05:15.790> we<00:05:15.970> might<00:05:16.120> be<00:05:16.270> an<00:05:16.570> absolutely

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
why all we might be an absolutely

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.200 
why all we might be an absolutely
fantastic<00:05:17.140> event<00:05:17.920> earlier<00:05:18.760> in<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:18.970> show<00:05:19.000> we

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
fantastic event earlier in the show we

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.810 
fantastic event earlier in the show we
saw<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.690> super<00:05:20.200> boat<00:05:20.380> semi-finals<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.430> the
