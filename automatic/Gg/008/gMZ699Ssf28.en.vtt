00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
I've been reviewing transformers for

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.470 
I've been reviewing transformers for
over<00:00:40.120> three<00:00:40.450> years<00:00:40.720> now<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.090> said<00:00:43.149> before

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
over three years now like I said before

I<00:00:43.720> didn't<00:00:44.440> think<00:00:44.620> I'd<00:00:44.829> last<00:00:45.160> this<00:00:45.430> long

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
I didn't think I'd last this long

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.600 
I didn't think I'd last this long
and<00:00:47.290> I<00:00:47.500> started<00:00:48.010> with<00:00:48.160> some<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.490> the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
and I started with some of the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.150 
and I started with some of the
alternators<00:00:49.270> which<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.410> still<00:00:50.740> one<00:00:50.980> of<00:00:51.010> my

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
alternators which is still one of my

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.430

considered<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.650> be<00:01:02.800> an<00:01:03.390> alternator<00:01:04.390> successor

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
considered to be an alternator successor

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
he fits snugly once inside but as you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.350 
he fits snugly once inside but as you
just<00:03:27.290> seen<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:28.340> not<00:03:28.370> easy<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.970> get<00:03:29.120> him<00:03:29.240> in

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
just seen it's not easy to get him in

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.000 
just seen it's not easy to get him in
there<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.690> first<00:03:29.720> place<00:03:30.080> unless<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.830> have

really small fingers if I were to

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.620 
really small fingers if I were to
complain<00:03:36.350> about<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.770> car<00:03:37.010> at<00:03:37.190> all<00:03:37.400> I'd<00:03:38.090> say

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
complain about the car at all I'd say

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.050

the robot's feet were visible from the
back<00:03:41.560> but<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:42.830> was<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.460> first<00:03:43.730> attempt<00:03:44.180> at<00:03:44.270> a

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
back but this was the first attempt at a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.080 
back but this was the first attempt at a
human<00:03:44.690> alliance<00:03:44.960> figure<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.760> easily

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
human alliance figure so it's easily

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.260

like<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.110> alts<00:05:11.560> it's<00:05:11.800> fairly<00:05:12.310> involved

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
like the alts it's fairly involved

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.189

frustrating<00:05:18.069> once<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:18.400> get<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.669> hang<00:05:18.849> of<00:05:18.970> it

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.529 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.819 

there<00:06:26.129> are<00:06:26.309> a<00:06:26.339> few<00:06:26.519> tricks<00:06:26.999> such<00:06:27.989> as<00:06:28.019> the<00:06:28.649> way

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:28.829 
there are a few tricks such as the way

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:30.649 
there are a few tricks such as the way
the<00:06:29.009> arm<00:06:29.189> is<00:06:29.399> fold<00:06:29.639> out<00:06:29.819> and<00:06:30.059> the<00:06:30.119> way<00:06:30.269> the<00:06:30.449> legs

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659 
the arm is fold out and the way the legs

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:53.030 
the arm is fold out and the way the legs
fold<00:06:30.989> out<00:06:31.229> like<00:06:31.949> the<00:06:32.129> deluxe

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.880 

but<00:06:53.640> it<00:06:53.760> still<00:06:54.060> manages<00:06:54.240> to<00:06:54.600> be<00:06:54.750> both<00:06:55.020> complex

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
but it still manages to be both complex

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:28.450 
but it still manages to be both complex
and<00:06:56.310> fun<00:06:57.150> at<00:06:57.570> the<00:06:57.630> same<00:06:57.810> time

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.220 

that's<00:07:29.460> it<00:07:29.670> I<00:07:29.880> don't<00:07:29.940> seem<00:07:30.510> to<00:07:30.660> have<00:07:30.780> forgotten

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230 
that's it I don't seem to have forgotten

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.290 
that's it I don't seem to have forgotten
anything<00:07:31.710> here

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
anything here
