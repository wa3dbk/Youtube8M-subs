video series for my tropical fruit trees
but<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.370> just<00:00:14.670> noticed<00:00:15.059> here<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.299> my<00:00:17.300> Carolina

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
but I just noticed here that my Carolina

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.349 
but I just noticed here that my Carolina

rest Carolina's raspberry root raspberry
bush<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.710> looks<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.699> coming<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:24.060> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
bush it looks like it's coming out of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.900 
bush it looks like it's coming out of
its<00:00:24.330> dormancy<00:00:24.750> for<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> year<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.880> just

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
its dormancy for the year and I just

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.050 
its dormancy for the year and I just
wanted<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.510> go<00:00:27.660> ahead<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.939> start<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
wanted to go ahead and know and start it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.479 
wanted to go ahead and know and start it

Carolina raspberry bush last year this

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.990 
Carolina raspberry bush last year this
did<00:00:40.290> probably<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.370> probably<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.790> best

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
did probably this was probably my best

did probably this was probably my best
fruiting<00:00:42.680> plant<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.489> garden<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
fruiting plant in my garden and I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
fruiting plant in my garden and I
remember<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> couple<00:00:46.710> years<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.460> went

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
remember a couple years back when I went

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.310 
remember a couple years back when I went
to<00:00:47.700> go<00:00:47.820> pick<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.680> raspberry<00:00:50.570> plant<00:00:51.570> from<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
to go pick up a raspberry plant from a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
to go pick up a raspberry plant from a
local<00:00:52.620> nursery<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.100> they<00:00:53.219> had<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> guy<00:00:54.120> walked

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
local nursery and they had a guy walked

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.200 
local nursery and they had a guy walked
by<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> he<00:00:54.930> told<00:00:55.350> me<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> time<00:00:55.969> they<00:00:56.969> really

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
by and he told me that time they really

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.930 
by and he told me that time they really
don't<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.480> well<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.230> Central<00:00:58.859> Florida<00:00:58.980> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
don't do well here in Central Florida so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
don't do well here in Central Florida so
I<00:00:59.969> left<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.390> alone<00:01:00.480> picked<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.649> some<00:01:01.800> other

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
I left it alone picked up some other

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.899 
I left it alone picked up some other
plants<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.730> didn't<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:03.390> well<00:01:04.909> but

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
plants and they didn't do very well but

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.359 
plants and they didn't do very well but
this<00:01:06.360> raspberry<00:01:06.630> yet<00:01:07.049> put<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.100> pot

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
this raspberry yet put it in this pot

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.940 
this raspberry yet put it in this pot
this<00:01:08.610> 15<00:01:08.939> gallon<00:01:09.270> pot<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.600> has<00:01:09.720> been<00:01:09.950> doing

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
this 15 gallon pot and has been doing

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190 
this 15 gallon pot and has been doing
great<00:01:11.460> ever<00:01:11.700> since

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
great ever since

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.470 
great ever since
so<00:01:14.040> I'm<00:01:14.520> still<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> learning<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
so I'm still kind of learning how to

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.770 
so I'm still kind of learning how to
prune<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.730> happened<00:01:18.120> here<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.420> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
prune and so what happened here is I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.970 
prune and so what happened here is I
have<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.620> bunch<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:21.260> these

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
have a bunch of these

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.700 
have a bunch of these
I<00:01:23.450> guess<00:01:24.450> these<00:01:24.660> dead

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
I guess these dead

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.780 
I guess these dead
fines<00:01:27.430> here<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:29.770> put<00:01:29.799> out<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.190> bunch<00:01:30.700> of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
fines here and they put out a bunch of

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.240 
fines here and they put out a bunch of
fruit<00:01:31.030> last<00:01:31.270> year<00:01:31.510> and<00:01:31.930> my<00:01:32.380> understanding<00:01:32.590> is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
fruit last year and my understanding is

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.430 
fruit last year and my understanding is
that<00:01:33.510> those<00:01:34.510> are<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.780> ones<00:01:34.930> that<00:01:35.050> will<00:01:35.290> need

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
that those are the ones that will need

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.160 
that those are the ones that will need
to<00:01:35.500> be<00:01:35.650> pruned<00:01:36.010> away<00:01:36.190> here<00:01:37.060> but<00:01:38.050> it's

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
to be pruned away here but it's

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.390 
to be pruned away here but it's
interesting<00:01:38.380> because<00:01:38.650> now<00:01:39.159> I<00:01:40.140> noticed<00:01:41.140> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
interesting because now I noticed that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.070 
interesting because now I noticed that
this<00:01:42.400> one<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:43.090> looked<00:01:43.330> like<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.690> put<00:01:43.900> it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
this one that looked like it put it

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.620 
this one that looked like it put it
produced<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:45.040> bunch<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.340> fruit<00:01:45.550> last<00:01:45.790> year<00:01:46.000> it's

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
produced a bunch of fruit last year it's

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.100 
produced a bunch of fruit last year it's
no<00:01:46.899> sending<00:01:47.830> out<00:01:47.950> these<00:01:48.220> little<00:01:48.810> green<00:01:49.810> shoots

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
no sending out these little green shoots

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.149 
no sending out these little green shoots
here<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.869> apparently<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.020> still<00:01:53.290> still<00:01:54.009> got

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
here so apparently it still still got

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.570 
here so apparently it still still got
life<00:01:54.369> in<00:01:54.580> it

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
life in it

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.150 
life in it
but<00:01:57.580> I<00:01:57.610> think<00:01:57.820> probably<00:01:58.210> this<00:01:58.540> one<00:01:58.780> here<00:01:59.160> it's

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
but I think probably this one here it's

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.650 
but I think probably this one here it's
probably<00:02:00.550> probably<00:02:00.700> need<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.149> go<00:02:01.330> ahead<00:02:01.420> and

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
probably probably need to go ahead and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.560 
probably probably need to go ahead and
um<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:03.160> know<00:02:03.190> because<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.729> was<00:02:03.880> fruit<00:02:04.210> you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
um you know because that was fruit you

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.540 
um you know because that was fruit you
know<00:02:04.630> this<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.050> all<00:02:05.350> fruit<00:02:05.679> those<00:02:06.310> are<00:02:06.429> all

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
know this is all fruit those are all

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.219 
know this is all fruit those are all
fruit<00:02:06.820> there<00:02:07.360> probably<00:02:07.570> need<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.810> prune<00:02:07.990> knows

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
fruit there probably need to prune knows

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.949 
fruit there probably need to prune knows
a<00:02:08.259> way<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.950> maintain<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.820> life<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.780> the

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
a way to maintain the life in the in the

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.710 
a way to maintain the life in the in the
plant<00:02:11.489> well<00:02:12.489> yeah<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.510> has<00:02:13.600> been

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
plant well yeah this is this has been

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.100 
plant well yeah this is this has been
doing<00:02:13.870> real<00:02:14.140> well<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.269> I'm<00:02:16.269> gonna<00:02:16.600> try<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.930> too

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
doing real well and I'm gonna try it too
