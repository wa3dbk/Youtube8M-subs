00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.890
 hi everyone and if you watched last 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.820
 issue about race car then this 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.089
 release will be about excavator excavator 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 It looks exactly like this 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.699
 bucket why we look at it with a mind 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.070
 and then we will see how it works 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:31.230
 Koshak start with we have some great 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 inside everything is plastic, everything is tight 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.190
 in fact everything keeps nothing 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.340
 breaks over by this black we 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.120
 runs all the wires you can 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.700
 quietly give to children and they will not hit them 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.440
 current nothing beads move on 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.230
 This mechanism allows you to manage 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.280
 all part ashraf bucket 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.200
 that is, not only here it is 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.600
 what are you shit and all the big and 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.180
 move on here you see this 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.180
 stain because i have the same old and 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.320
 a long time ago that I was lying to them not 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 enjoyed further we see here so here 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.220
 everything looks further we have such 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:28.080
 here they are called forgot in general wheels 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:37.800
 more accurately he remembered the caterpillars they have 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:45.540
 called everything is removed also all so 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:48.470
 same back here and move on here 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 we will try 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.060
 video over the wire and come to our 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.619
 control panel and let's see 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.520
 how our excavator is driven 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.250
 if we click on this lever here 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 turns 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.080
 controlled only by the left side here we are 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.330
 push forward 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:19.380
 then he goes back then he must of course 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.800
 will be a little quieter than our past 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.310
 jeep which we showed past 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.090
 review 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.720
 and let's press further if I press 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.540
 here we all go up on this button 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.890
 shoulder 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.890
 also but also goes down 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.610
 but 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.819
 that's it in this place when we 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.849
 controlled by the whole shoulder it exceeds the sound 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.069
 past our jeep only in 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.340
 in this place, everything else is wrong 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:00.160
 well noisy and speed also works 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:03.910
 like the real excavator itself let's us 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.600
 Now check this button's click 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:13.959
 up here and here rises above 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:19.450
 centuries ago, so that's something we are not afraid 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:22.840
 we can omit our everything came 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.340
 when here we reach the minimum either 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.500
 maximum value it starts 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.740
 bang and it happens like this 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.380
 here 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:39.420
 let's take it a little bit, we still raise 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:42.210
 legs raised and the last club lever is 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.930
 we manage this one 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.930
 caterpillar 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.120
 Here I also recharged the batteries well 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.800
 and 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.840
 I just have a bag now 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.690
 incredible speed if here we hold 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.900
 here are these two side buttons will go 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.900
 forward here if back then back 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.770
 That 's the same if we just charge you 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.770
 So 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.440
 we can raise everything at the same time 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:26.270
 our shoulder and manage from this separate 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.300
 part also here we can twist 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.380
 our lesson from our excavator 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.380
 that's it 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.090
 Well, of course, asks for 360 but precisely 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.040
 I can't do it now with one hand 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.430
 rise and because the other i hold 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.430
 the camera 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.220
 let's return to the starting position 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.040
 if we turn over, we'll take so 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.640
 there are also inserted inside 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.340
 batteries but these batteries i no longer 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:05.140
 changed 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:07.870
 more than ten years old grandfather that's it in 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.800
 the remote from me broke more precisely 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.690
 I broke off somewhere I lost this cover 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.940
 4 batteries are put up here from me 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:21.520
 Of course, 4 different taxi slats 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:23.620
 but no one works so i sold 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.330
 battery sets do not fall out 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.540
 right now they chose okay if 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.860
 nice from the fact that he is on the wire 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.630
 and the wire is not quite long it is well in 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.810
 area 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.190
 meters here is such a house 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.160
 Well, yes, in the metro area with us 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.330
 is up 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.690
 and of course I would like him to be with us 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.620
 Still, the remote with the antenna would be so 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.380
 much cooler but it doesn't allow it 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.150
 power and then control it because 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.900
 he really needs a lot 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:10.330
 batteries for each use 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:14.590
 his part so that he earned in general on 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:18.430
 This finished our review of 2 cars 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:22.300
 we had this excavator thanks to all 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:26.500
 put big likes such services in 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.490
 last release and subscribe to all 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.490
 until
