00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.870
 hello friends I hope it's okay this is 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.850
 the second video in which we are 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.430
 describing some elements of the 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.560
 energy reform all these data are 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.900
 public and verifiable may be 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.390
 find in pemex documents of 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.359
 Mexican Institute of Competitiveness 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.119
 the link or comexi that is the council 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.339
 mexican international affairs 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.199
 also from the energy secretariat of 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.380
 the national feel of the industry 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.060
 chemistry aniq and the coparmex that is the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.210
 patronal confederation of the republic 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.550
 Mexican in the end all are available 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.559
 and whoever may check in 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.649
 this video I will talk about some ironies 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.530
 Mexican energy sector 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.719
 first and it's about refining or 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.940
 be the production of pemex gasoline 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.190
 has six refineries at a level 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.820
 national and with one more in houston texas 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.640
 which is called new park or pemex 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.530
 it also has a refinery in usa in 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.589
 the partnership with a company so 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.930
 I know where Mexican oil is refined 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.220
 It turns out that this refinery is the most 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.010
 efficient pemex 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.320
 a refinery that is in the USA where 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.440
 pemex and can be associated with companies 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.780
 private companies in other countries when comparing 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.660
 pemex refineries that are in mexico 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.660
 against deer park we see that dir 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.090
 park is much more efficient for each 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.090
 barrel of oil that is processed and 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.030
 earns a profit of 7.3 dollars 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.450
 instead half of the refineries in 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.070
 Mexico is not only inefficient but 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.280
 that instead of profits have 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.890
 losses the wood refinery by 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.060
 example for every barrel of oil that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.270
 process loses $ 1.1 in saline 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.240
 cross is lost at 80 cents and 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.360
 the minatitlan 30 cents per 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.820
 every barrel of oil processed as much 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.979
 ironic is that we do not allow pemex 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.530
 Partnering in Mexico with other companies 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.810
 but if you can do it abroad 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.330
 if pemex would like to build a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.649
 associated refinery consell instead of 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.450
 put it in houston 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.290
 I would like to put it in veracruz or the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.299
 gentleman 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.480
 I could not do it because the law does not 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.450
 allows the current legal framework the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.689
 investments, jobs and taxes 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.569
 generated are left in the USA instead of 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.900
 that investment jobs and taxes are 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.879
 stay in Mexico at the same time we are 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.390
 importing gasoline from abroad 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.030
 mainly from the USA in total today 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.909
 we import 49 percent of the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.859
 gasolines that we consume we arrived at this 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.500
 ironic situation because we have a 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.780
 very closed legal framework or pemex 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.150
 can associate and let other 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.819
 companies can produce gasoline for their 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.129
 account in Mexico and how we do not produce 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.069
 everything we need we have to 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.260
 import more and more with a reform 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.109
 energy at the constitutional level 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.569
 pemex associated with private companies u 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.510
 other companies by themselves could 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.700
 produce gasolines in Mexico like this 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.760
 would build new refineries and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.250
 would guarantee the national supply and all 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 that investment would translate into higher 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.110
 jobs 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.480
 resources for the country the second irony 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.849
 is that we are a country that has many 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.700
 natural gas resources but not pemex 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.760
 explodes them today we are importing a 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.370
 third of the natural gas that we consume 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.400
 how is it that this happens pemex has to 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.069
 choose between two things to pemex produce 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.950
 a barrel of oil costs between 15 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.959
 and $ 20 and sell it for $ 100 or 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.530
 it has a gain of about 80 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.590
 Dollars 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.530
 instead, producing them costs about 3 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.930
 dollars and you can sell it to 350 or 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.799
 he's only earning him 50 cents 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.750
 dollar 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.879
 obviously pemex goes to the business that 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.489
 leaves more money than is the produce 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.769
 oil the problem is that the gas that 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.420
 we need no one else can produce it 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.430
 because of what our 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.680
 constitution and the law what 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.109
 supposedly protects our sovereignty 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.410
 However, because of the prohibition 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.830
 we end up importing from abroad what 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.830
 that makes us more dependent 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.690
 It is also illogical that Mexican companies 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.090
 that can not produce gas in mexico 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.600
 have to do it outside of our country 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.460
 for example the newpek company that is 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.670
 subsidiary of the Mexican conglomerate 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.280
 Alfa has 300 extraction wells 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.370
 of shale gas and oil in texas 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.280
 with a production of 7 thousand 100 barrels 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.190
 of oil daily in fact in the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.340
 second quarter of 2013 this company 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.160
 announced an investment of 17 million 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.350
 dollars in the us this investment could 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.230
 be in Mexico today if the constitution 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.600
 allow it that's why we need a 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.820
 energy reform at the 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.800
 constitutional the third irony also 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.080
 it has to do with the fall of production 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.330
 of natural gas but focus on the 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.330
 way this affects the rates 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.820
 electricity to generate electricity 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.280
 you need a primary fuel some 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.220
 hydrocarbon eg natural gas 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.440
 fuel oil or diesel as we do not count 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.810
 with enough natural gas we have 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.470
 that generate the electric 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.110
 with fuel oil or they say they are four and 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.900
 Six times more expensive than natural gas 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.240
 In addition, fuel oil and diesel are 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.180
 less clean fuels as their 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.580
 greenhouse gas emissions 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.800
 The use of fuel oil and 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.840
 diesel increases generation costs 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.110
 of electricity what finally 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.389
 increases the price of the light receipt is 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.550
 ironic that being a country with a lot of gas 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.370
 natural, we are not producing it or 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.889
 we allow nobody else to produce it with 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.620
 the energy reform there would be multiple 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.540
 natural gas producers in mexico well 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.479
 we could generate electricity more 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.669
 clean and cheaper and reduce the price 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.669
 of the light receipts the fourth 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.889
 irony is the transport of gasolines the 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.840
 legal framework that we have today not 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.660
 It allows private companies to 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.030
 transport this gasoline products without 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.040
 However, if we allow these companies 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.620
 private do the transport with 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.800
 trucks the ironic thing is that transportation 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.159
 by trucks it costs up to 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.949
 13 points 5 times more than product and it's 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:31.349
 more insecure how is it possible that our 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.840
 legal framework does allow investment 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.330
 in a riskier and more expensive transport 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.970
 but does not allow investment in new 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.370
 pipeline infrastructure that would give us 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.460
 much more competitive more 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.530
 efficient and much safer the 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.629
 energy reform seeks that those 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.669
 companies that are already transporting 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.490
 trucks can also do this 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.560
 transportation through ducts friends 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.199
 these were some of the ironies of 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.449
 our energy sector in conclusion 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.819
 our system is very closed and it is 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:06.629
 closed with pretty and logical criteria 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:09.330
 we do not let pemex associate here but 

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:12.270
 yes that is associated in the USA to generate 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.240
 investment jobs and paying taxes there 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.590
 instead of doing it here in mexico 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.629
 neither do we let companies 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.389
 private companies produce natural gas and 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:23.789
 gasolines in Mexico supposedly to 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.740
 protect sovereignty but we end 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:29.889
 buying these energetics in the extra 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.319
 returning to the most dependent ones either 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.780
 we allow private companies that 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.729
 they already do transport by trucks what 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.660
 do in the safest and cheapest way 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:42.190
 by pipelines or our system 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.800
 encourages private investment in a 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.560
 more expensive and more dangerous transport 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.169
 also being Mexico a country with a lot 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.970
 natural gas by not allowing anyone to 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:54.789
 extract we are producing 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.190
 electricity with fuel oil and they say that 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:59.380
 they are much more expensive and less clean than 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.750
 the natural gas to finish with these 

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.139
 ironies is that we need a reform 

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:08.880
 constitutional on energy matters 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:08.880
 good friends until the next bye
