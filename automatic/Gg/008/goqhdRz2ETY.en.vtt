00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
got okay we got fluff on top right here

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.120 
got okay we got fluff on top right here
unless<00:03:45.050> we<00:03:45.349> got<00:03:45.590> fluff<00:03:45.920> up<00:03:46.190> here<00:03:47.560> on<00:03:48.560> top<00:03:48.860> and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
unless we got fluff up here on top and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.660 
unless we got fluff up here on top and
then<00:03:49.370> we<00:03:49.489> got<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> hard<00:03:49.970> crust<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:51.580> bring<00:03:52.580> in

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
then we got a hard crust and bring in

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.199 
then we got a hard crust and bring in
sugar<00:03:52.970> snow<00:03:53.390> underneath<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.760> have<00:03:55.970> no

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
sugar snow underneath so you have no

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.710 
sugar snow underneath so you have no
traction<00:03:56.630> at<00:03:56.989> all<00:04:01.060> but<00:04:02.060> we'll<00:04:02.330> see<00:04:02.480> how<00:04:02.600> it

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
traction at all but we'll see how it

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.539 
traction at all but we'll see how it
goes

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
goes

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.289 
goes
hopefully<00:04:04.549> we<00:04:04.670> don't<00:04:04.760> have<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:05.090> winch

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
hopefully we don't have to winch

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.759 
hopefully we don't have to winch
ourselves<00:04:05.780> all<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:05.930> way<00:04:06.080> back<00:04:06.410> to<00:04:06.650> the
