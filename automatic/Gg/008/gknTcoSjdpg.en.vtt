plasmid<00:00:13.330> up<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.860> I've<00:00:15.099> got

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
plasmid up like I've got

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.439 
plasmid up like I've got
she<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> boy<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.220> stagger<00:00:17.609> half<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.970> sheet<00:00:18.240> it

she a boy we stagger half a sheet it

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.660 
she a boy we stagger half a sheet it
just<00:00:18.689> keeps<00:00:18.840> things<00:00:19.110> a<00:00:19.199> lot<00:00:19.349> square<00:00:19.680> as<00:00:20.279> you

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
just keeps things a lot square as you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.100 
just keeps things a lot square as you
work<00:00:20.849> your<00:00:21.000> way<00:00:21.029> along<00:00:21.270> especially<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.990> your

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
longer runs I'm doing this on my own at

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.279 
longer runs I'm doing this on my own at
height<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.829> I<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:28.410> tower<00:00:29.570> props<00:00:30.570> Michael

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
height so I got the tower props Michael

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.820 
height so I got the tower props Michael
and<00:00:31.410> Edmund<00:00:32.239> white<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.629> Dedmon<00:00:34.019> it

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
and Edmund white do with the Dedmon it

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.460 
and Edmund white do with the Dedmon it
was<00:00:34.949> on<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.699> them<00:00:35.970> I<00:00:36.180> take<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:37.350> little

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
was on one of them I take just a little

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.640 
was on one of them I take just a little
notch<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.250> there<00:00:38.720> and<00:00:39.720> I<00:00:39.870> position<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
notch out just there and I position that

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.970 
notch out just there and I position that
to<00:00:41.460> take<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> board<00:00:42.000> when<00:00:42.150> I<00:00:42.239> lift<00:00:42.449> it<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.980> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
to take the board when I lift it up and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860 
to take the board when I lift it up and
then<00:00:44.489> once<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.120> maneuver<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.420> into<00:00:45.570> place

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
then once I can maneuver it into place

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.390 
then once I can maneuver it into place
I'll<00:00:46.079> put<00:00:46.199> the<00:00:46.290> other<00:00:46.379> prop<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.920> make<00:00:47.280> sure

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
I'll put the other prop in make sure

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.880 
I'll put the other prop in make sure
it's<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.670> square<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.720> then<00:00:49.080> screw<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it's all square and then screw it up I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
it's all square and then screw it up I
got<00:00:50.369> like<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> put<00:00:50.970> in<00:00:51.089> as<00:00:51.210> well<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:51.540> makes

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
got like to put in as well which makes

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.259 
got like to put in as well which makes
it<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.110> bit<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.409> awkward<00:00:52.589> but<00:00:53.269> I've

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
it a little bit more awkward but I've

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.329 
it a little bit more awkward but I've
been<00:00:54.449> qualify<00:00:54.900> for<00:00:54.960> years<00:00:55.379> doing<00:00:55.589> it<00:00:55.830> so<00:00:56.159> I

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
been qualify for years doing it so I

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.799 
been qualify for years doing it so I
make<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.790> look<00:00:56.879> easy<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.449> wouldn't

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
make it look easy but I wouldn't

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.299 
make it look easy but I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:57.960> doing<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.710> sort<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.010> thing<00:00:59.070> on

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
recommend doing this sort of thing on

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.859 
recommend doing this sort of thing on
your<00:00:59.460> own<00:00:59.519> normally<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.150> a<00:01:00.210> two-man<00:01:00.570> job

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
your own normally it's a two-man job

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.410 
your own normally it's a two-man job
barbar<00:01:01.830> see<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.220> I<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:02.939> done<00:01:03.150> it<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.330> a<00:01:03.390> long

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
time I've got a technique down to a tree

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:21.260 
time I've got a technique down to a tree
so<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.119> too<00:01:06.360> much<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> struggle
