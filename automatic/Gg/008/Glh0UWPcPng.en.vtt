00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.260
 hello tells you Jorge to learn when 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.420
 it comes is a special video for 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.180
 guillermo one of my subscribers 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.420
 excuse me a little the good delay 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.550
 Guillermo, as I can understand, you have a 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.310
 garage where you can only drive in 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.789
 a sense within the set as lame 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.980
 thing a little bit a new one not very normal 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 but good being that way I also see that 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 some vehicles to stay 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.940
 in a front-to-front sense as 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.399
 that some of your neighbors are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.989
 parked so let's say it 's giving it 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.640
 the back to the exit 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.649
 if that is allowed but it is not the most 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.100
 recommended as you could also 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.780
 use because you have a corner that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.940
 it's definitely very uncomfortable to be 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.120
 is the corner is very uncomfortable for you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.980
 to leave the parking lot that I would do 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.329
 Guillermo, I could do two things 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.600
 the first 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 this arrived parking lot you enter and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.890
 you do 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.010
 a front-facing income that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 you have to open up high if your neighbors 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.030
 they are not then you could take advantage of this 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.420
 space to reverse and put your car 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.670
 yes because I would do it head on because to the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 time to leave is much easier 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.710
 correct in your case to get out of doing 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.990
 It is much easier, so the method of 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.600
 front 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.009
 I'm going to throw reverse remember when I pass 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.009
 half of the car I start to turn 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 and I go to that sidewalk 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.619
 that's what I would do if I put it in 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.710
 front and I leave here being careful with 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.210
 the cars of the neighbors correct that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.950
 is one of the ways you can do 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.090
 knowing that you have to go out to that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.109
 felt the other is 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.090
 You enter your parking lot so that 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.179
 most people do that it is 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.300
 park in reverse that would be you come 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.820
 here you stick to this wall 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.880
 and you start to turn it 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.530
 and starts spinning remember that you 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.140
 have in this mirror 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.860
 you must have this corner of the wall 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.680
 when you do not have there you start to put it 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.020
 ready and try not to hit as much to the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.880
 couple and the exit in your case will be 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.880
 a little bit cumbersome because I live
