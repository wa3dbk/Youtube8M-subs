00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
if you tap it the icons bounce bound and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.839 
if you tap it the icons bounce bound and
then<00:02:13.959> display<00:02:14.560> after<00:02:14.739> 30<00:02:15.129> seconds<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.700> think

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
then display after 30 seconds I think

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.050 
then display after 30 seconds I think
that's<00:02:16.599> a<00:02:16.690> lot<00:02:16.840> clearer<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.530> nicer<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.580> course

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
that's a lot clearer and nicer of course

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.820 
that's a lot clearer and nicer of course
if<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.360> want<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.690> sort<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.049> on<00:02:20.290> all<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> time

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
if you want it sort of on all the time

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.600 
if you want it sort of on all the time
stabili<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:23.379> go<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.590> accessibility<00:02:24.220> in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
stabili you just go to accessibility in

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.420 
stabili you just go to accessibility in
a<00:02:24.670> notification<00:02:25.030> bit<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.780> turn<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.680> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
a notification bit and turn it on and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.160 
a notification bit and turn it on and
then<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:27.910> will<00:02:28.090> sort<00:02:28.269> of<00:02:28.329> down<00:02:28.540> all<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.959> time

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
then it will sort of down all the time

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.569 
then it will sort of down all the time
and<00:02:29.470> run<00:02:29.799> through<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.280> routes<00:02:30.700> or<00:02:31.319> settings

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
and run through and routes or settings

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.860 
and run through and routes or settings
which<00:02:33.579> is<00:02:33.760> quite<00:02:33.970> helpful<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.480> as<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.720> can

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
which is quite helpful and as you can

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.300 
which is quite helpful and as you can
see<00:02:34.959> already<00:02:35.079> it's<00:02:35.500> starting<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:35.860> look<00:02:35.980> really

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
see already it's starting to look really

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.420 
see already it's starting to look really
very<00:02:36.610> much<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.239> Windows<00:02:37.510> Phone<00:02:37.690> 7<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.250> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
very much like a Windows Phone 7 so the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.729 
very much like a Windows Phone 7 so the
next<00:02:39.610> thing<00:02:39.819> we<00:02:40.030> need<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.269> make<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.720> just<00:02:40.750> very

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
next thing we need to make it just very

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.250 
next thing we need to make it just very
much<00:02:41.829> like<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.180> Windows<00:02:43.629> Phone<00:02:43.780> 7<00:02:43.989> lock

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
much like it is the Windows Phone 7 lock

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.770 
much like it is the Windows Phone 7 lock
screen<00:02:44.890> there<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.940> pro<00:02:46.239> edition<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.660> this

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780

and the light addition the light
addition<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:48.579> find<00:02:48.849> is<00:02:48.940> actually<00:02:49.030> more<00:02:49.540> stable

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
addition I find is actually more stable

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.800 
addition I find is actually more stable
than<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.349> Pro<00:02:50.500> Edition<00:02:50.650> life<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:52.150> yes<00:02:52.569> so

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
start would be a bit slow there you go

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.640

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
pretty much the Windows Phone 7 lock

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.629 
pretty much the Windows Phone 7 lock
screen<00:03:43.750> which<00:03:44.739> sort<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.040> finishes<00:03:45.459> your

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
Windows Phone 7 sort of interface on

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.159 
Windows Phone 7 sort of interface on
your<00:03:47.919> Android<00:03:48.280> device<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.849> very<00:03:49.480> good<00:03:49.720> there

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
your Android device it's very good there

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.349 
your Android device it's very good there
are<00:03:50.290> many<00:03:50.650> more<00:03:50.859> actually<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.280> can<00:03:51.370> get<00:03:51.519> for

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
are many more actually you can get for

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.759 
are many more actually you can get for
it<00:03:52.389> to<00:03:52.599> make<00:03:52.720> even<00:03:52.959> better<00:03:53.079> but<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.440> think<00:03:53.680> I

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
it to make even better but I think I

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.800 
it to make even better but I think I
prefer<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.220> Android<00:03:54.819> store<00:03:55.060> application<00:03:55.329> so

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
prefer the Android store application so

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.809 
prefer the Android store application so
