00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello friends how are you I am Augustine and 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.049
 Well today I want to talk about a 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.790
 subject that many consider tedious but 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.090
 I'm going to show you in this video that it's 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.950
 very simple and that gives us the guarantees 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.469
 what we need to work in a 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.800
 company would be as libertarian is ok 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.539
 how to validate our accounts for this 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.600
 it's very simple is a process that 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.510
 any company 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.680
 would you be asked to identify yourself and 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.420
 for this we need some documents 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.110
 our identity document which is 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.290
 be our country in the front a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.790
 image of the front either the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.820
 part that contains the photo ok 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.740
 an image of the back the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.220
 part that in some cases contains the 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.220
 home 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.840
 and a service receipt in this case 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.900
 it can be light water phone an invoice 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.170
 of purchases or whatever it appears in 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.030
 our address and our name ok 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.830
 correctly and for the case of some 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.950
 people who have problems for 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.300
 guarantee your home because one does not 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.940
 they have an address they do not have a 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.920
 own home do not have a receipt 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.250
 of services in his name from the new 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.330
 address of where they currently receive 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.500
 then for them there is the 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.200
 sworn statement that can 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.900
 delicate our country or the declaration 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.230
 simple of domicile that can do it 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.780
 indicating where they live and attaching to 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.640
 This is a different receipt than the one 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.320
 present of house services where 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.490
 live from your landlord 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.829
 and they scan it ok in an image 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.030
 first they access your account you know 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.740
 and they go to the personal menu data ok 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.110
 once in the personal data menu they search 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.409
 the section where the boxes are 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.740
 sending documents are four and three of 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.899
 these are obligatory that are we have 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.909
 that send them correctly these 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.820
 images that I spoke to you previously 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.399
 should start less than 250 gbytes if they are 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.800
 very heavy images this will not be able to 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.260
 send them so advice reduce them 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.519
 of weight so that they can be sent 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.650
 correctly 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.880
 ok I'm going to show you three ways that 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.100
 you can have to send the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.530
 documents if they already have scanned 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.819
 let's put the document if you 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.709
 they live in the same direction as their 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.310
 document contained in your document 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.950
 identity as they put part of with 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.140
 photo of the document they send it in the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.569
 first box the back of the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.440
 document they put it in the second box 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.660
 and the third box 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.610
 repeat the same image in the com part 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.470
 in the back of your document 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.760
 this is for people who live in 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.740
 the same address that appears in your 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.000
 home 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.920
 the second way is then they go is for 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.020
 people who do not live their address 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.990
 is not updated in your document and 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.390
 because he lives in another in another receives 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.130
 his residence elsewhere than in this 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.740
 case they must also send their 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.420
 document in the part part with 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.610
 picture the back in the first and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.870
 second box respectively and in the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.819
 third box must put 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.769
 the receipt of services in your name that 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.120
 obviously indicates your new address 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.470
 true 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.400
 and that's all it sends very simple and the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.740
 third way is for people 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.290
 complicated in this case as I told you 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.270
 for those who have no way of 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.620
 check where they live 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.680
 then for these people should 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.150
 send your document anyway the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 part with photo in the first box in 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.000
 the second box on the back 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.000
 of your identity document 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.860
 the receipt of services from the house where 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.510
 obviously live from the landlord 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.430
 the third box and in the fourth 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.760
 box the affidavit of 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.320
 address or the statement without attached 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.140
 to another receipt of services as you 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.230
 I explained at the beginning ok that in the fourth 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.210
 box in the previous cases the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.490
 third box I 'm sorry the fourth box 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.900
 nothing is not sent, nothing is sent 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.310
 but in this case for people who 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.230
 they do not try they have no way to prove their 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.109
 address the fourth box for this 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.420
 document ok that's very simple now 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.650
 when these are already sent correctly 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.110
 they realize because they get a message 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.919
 of green where it indicates that they have 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.180
 sent the documents correctly and 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.710
 later in the box where they are 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.210
 Shipping boxes of documents you 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.860
 a yellow message will appear indicating them 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.919
 that have already been sent ok so 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.449
 this is a very simple process I see that 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.729
 Many I hope many do not 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.889
 understand and then nothing is going to 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.509
 guarantee that they can one when they have 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.000
 the funds and meet the requirements 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.620
 necessary to collect can charge your 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.930
 money and two go to work 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.870
 correctly ok so please to 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.460

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.960
