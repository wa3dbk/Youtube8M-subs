00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so we'll talk a little bit about

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.480 
so we'll talk a little bit about
centering<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:02.939> maybe<00:00:03.890> the<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:05.069> how<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.250> wheel

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
centering and maybe the we how the wheel

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.450 
centering and maybe the we how the wheel
could<00:00:05.819> be<00:00:05.940> set<00:00:06.150> up<00:00:06.299> or<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:07.350> way<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.890> set<00:00:08.429> up

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
could be set up or how the way I set up

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.830 
could be set up or how the way I set up
my<00:00:08.580> wheel<00:00:09.320> so<00:00:10.320> let's<00:00:10.590> start<00:00:10.769> with<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.920> stool

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
my wheel so let's start with the stool

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.020 
my wheel so let's start with the stool
I've<00:00:12.840> got<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> stool<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.860> has<00:00:14.519> adjustable

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I've got a stool that has adjustable

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.260 
I've got a stool that has adjustable
legs<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> back<00:00:16.830> legs<00:00:17.160> are<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.000> little

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
legs so the back legs are just a little

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.529 
legs so the back legs are just a little
bit<00:00:18.390> higher<00:00:18.660> than<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.800> front<00:00:20.039> legs<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bit higher than the front legs and the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.750 
bit higher than the front legs and the
legs<00:00:21.689> are<00:00:21.869> adjusted<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.130> when<00:00:23.640> I'm

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
legs are adjusted so that when I'm

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.330 
legs are adjusted so that when I'm
sitting<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:25.170> leg<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.890> pretty<00:00:26.099> much

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
sitting on it my leg is pretty much

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.000 
sitting on it my leg is pretty much
parallel<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> ground<00:00:27.769> reason<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.980> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
parallel to the ground reason I have it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.519 
parallel to the ground reason I have it
tilted<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.300> push<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.660> hips<00:00:30.900> forward<00:00:31.019> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
tilted is to push my hips forward so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.690 
tilted is to push my hips forward so
that<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.679> take<00:00:31.890> some<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.189> strain<00:00:32.430> off<00:00:32.550> my

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
that I take some of the strain off my

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.170 
that I take some of the strain off my
back

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
back

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.020 
back
some<00:00:33.809> people<00:00:34.050> push<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.739> lot<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.520> forward

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
some people push that a lot more forward

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.569 
some people push that a lot more forward
or<00:00:36.600> they're<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.070> works<00:00:38.309> too

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
or they're like this and that works too

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.119 
or they're like this and that works too
um<00:00:39.320> depending<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:40.980> of

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
um depending on you know what kind of

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.060 
um depending on you know what kind of
back<00:00:41.280> issues<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.850> um<00:00:42.290> I<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> lot<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
back issues you have um I know a lot of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.979 
back issues you have um I know a lot of
people<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.430> stools<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.910> wheels<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.629> like

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
people have stools with wheels and like

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.350 
people have stools with wheels and like
bully<00:00:46.200> stools<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.940> wouldn't<00:00:48.149> work<00:00:48.329> for

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
bully stools and that wouldn't work for

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.639 
bully stools and that wouldn't work for
the<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> center<00:00:49.230> part<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> how<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:51.379> press<00:00:52.379> is

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the way I center part of how I press is

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
the way I center part of how I press is
by<00:00:53.039> using<00:00:53.219> my<00:00:53.460> body<00:00:53.699> weight<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.420> body

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
by using my body weight and if my body

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.939 
by using my body weight and if my body
weight<00:00:54.809> would<00:00:55.020> happen<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.500> roll<00:00:55.680> away<00:00:55.800> from

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
weight would happen to roll away from

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.069 
weight would happen to roll away from
the<00:00:56.100> clay<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.640> wouldn't<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.690> putting<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:57.989> much

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the clay I wouldn't be putting as much

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.250 
the clay I wouldn't be putting as much
pressure<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.579> my<00:00:59.579> pedal<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.149> right<00:01:00.930> underneath

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
pressure on my pedal is right underneath

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.860 
pressure on my pedal is right underneath
the<00:01:01.590> corner<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.340> my<00:01:02.760> wheel<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.300> when<00:01:03.750> I'm

the corner of my wheel so that when I'm

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.160 
the corner of my wheel so that when I'm
sitting<00:01:04.350> down<00:01:04.470> my<00:01:05.309> knee<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:06.479> at<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.930> 45

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
sitting down my knee is at like a 45

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.969 
sitting down my knee is at like a 45
degree<00:01:07.619> angle<00:01:08.330> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> other<00:01:09.510> side<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.680> not

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
degree angle on the other side I do not

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.890 
degree angle on the other side I do not
have<00:01:11.189> anything<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.880> people<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> block<00:01:12.600> of

wood<00:01:13.220> here<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.939> footrest<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.850> just<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> way

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
wood here as a footrest but just the way

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.300 
wood here as a footrest but just the way
I<00:01:18.090> work<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.689> seems<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.040> an<00:01:20.159> issue

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I work it seems I don't have an issue

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
I work it seems I don't have an issue
with<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:21.150> getting<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.689> lopsided<00:01:22.680> fatigue

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.750 

so<00:01:28.960> this<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.260> my<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:29.770> get<00:01:30.190> as<00:01:30.310> close<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
so this is my I get as close to the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.790 
so this is my I get as close to the
wheel<00:01:30.940> as<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.210> can<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.830> have<00:01:33.210> my<00:01:34.210> pedal<00:01:34.660> so<00:01:35.620> that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
wheel as I can I have my pedal so that

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.070 
wheel as I can I have my pedal so that
my<00:01:35.980> knee<00:01:36.040> is<00:01:36.220> at<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> 45<00:01:36.550> degree<00:01:36.850> angle<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.990> I

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
my knee is at a 45 degree angle and I

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.030 
my knee is at a 45 degree angle and I
can<00:01:38.260> rotate<00:01:38.710> my<00:01:38.950> foot<00:01:39.430> without<00:01:40.150> having<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.600> go

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
can rotate my foot without having to go

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.290 
can rotate my foot without having to go
too<00:01:42.040> far<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.310> way<00:01:42.550> or<00:01:43.030> come<00:01:43.330> back<00:01:43.510> too<00:01:43.750> far

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
too far that way or come back too far

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.980 
too far that way or come back too far
my<00:01:46.300> leg<00:01:46.510> is<00:01:46.690> pretty<00:01:46.810> much<00:01:47.050> flat<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:49.330> my

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
my leg is pretty much flat and that my

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.940 
my leg is pretty much flat and that my
leg<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:50.350> above<00:01:50.710> my<00:01:51.580> splash<00:01:51.910> guard<00:01:52.300> on<00:01:52.950> this

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
leg is above my splash guard on this

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.280 
leg is above my splash guard on this
splash<00:01:54.280> guard<00:01:54.640> sets<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.510> little<00:01:55.720> bit<00:01:55.810> high<00:01:55.990> and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
splash guard sets a little bit high and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.710 
splash guard sets a little bit high and
we'll<00:01:56.500> head<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> little<00:01:56.920> bit<00:01:57.070> low<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.450> do<00:01:58.510> have

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
we'll head a little bit low so I do have

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.320 
we'll head a little bit low so I do have
an<00:01:58.870> issue<00:01:58.960> sometimes<00:01:59.410> with<00:01:59.770> getting<00:02:00.330> down

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
an issue sometimes with getting down

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.790 
an issue sometimes with getting down
against<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.810> wheel<00:02:01.960> head<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.350> way<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:02.470> like

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
against the wheel head the way I like

having wheels isn't good because when

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.690 
having wheels isn't good because when
I'm<00:05:30.690> pressing<00:05:31.020> against<00:05:31.320> here<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:31.740> I<00:05:32.520> can

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
I'm pressing against here and I can

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.800 
I'm pressing against here and I can
press<00:05:32.820> so<00:05:33.000> hard<00:05:33.030> that<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.390> would<00:05:33.480> move<00:05:33.630> my

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
press so hard that it would move my

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.950 
press so hard that it would move my
stool<00:05:34.110> with<00:05:34.320> a<00:05:34.350> larger<00:05:34.650> piece<00:05:34.830> of<00:05:34.980> clay

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
stool with a larger piece of clay

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.210 
stool with a larger piece of clay
because<00:05:36.960> it's<00:05:37.110> not<00:05:37.260> actually<00:05:37.560> using<00:05:37.740> muscle

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
because it's not actually using muscle

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.290 
because it's not actually using muscle
I'm<00:05:38.340> just<00:05:38.550> using<00:05:38.840> my<00:05:39.840> body<00:05:40.110> weight

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.240 

now<00:05:44.870> some<00:05:45.140> people<00:05:45.380> get<00:05:45.500> volcanoes<00:05:45.980> we'll<00:05:46.130> talk

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
now some people get volcanoes we'll talk

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.590 
now some people get volcanoes we'll talk
about<00:05:46.340> that<00:05:46.670> so<00:05:46.820> while<00:05:46.970> candles<00:05:47.270> are<00:05:47.390> when<00:05:47.510> you

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
about that so while candles are when you

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.220 
about that so while candles are when you
when<00:05:48.410> you<00:05:48.500> probably<00:05:48.860> push<00:05:49.130> down<00:05:49.340> too<00:05:49.550> far<00:05:50.230> when

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
when you probably push down too far when

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.080 
when you probably push down too far when
you<00:05:51.290> press<00:05:51.470> down<00:05:51.500> too<00:05:51.770> far<00:05:52.010> when<00:05:52.610> you<00:05:52.700> push<00:05:52.880> up

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
you press down too far when you push up

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.120 
you press down too far when you push up
see<00:05:53.900> how<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.020> center<00:05:54.290> the<00:05:54.380> clay<00:05:54.530> stays<00:05:54.800> still

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
see how the center the clay stays still

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.700 
see how the center the clay stays still
and<00:05:55.430> the<00:05:56.000> outside<00:05:56.360> goes<00:05:56.510> up<00:05:56.690> now<00:05:57.470> you<00:05:57.530> go<00:05:57.650> to

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
and the outside goes up now you go to

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.680 
and the outside goes up now you go to

hot and hot stuff burns if you don't

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.220 
hot and hot stuff burns if you don't
want<00:06:01.130> volcanoes<00:06:01.550> so<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.900> get<00:06:02.990> rid<00:06:03.080> of<00:06:03.140> the
