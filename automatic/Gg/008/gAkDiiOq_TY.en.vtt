00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.130
 the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 already allowing players in many cases 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.850
 be ripped off I believe that it 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.059
 it is wrong to claim there is only order 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 rip off 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.450
 it's actually about the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.690
 different business models 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.460
 every second decade of experience with 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.040
 play from 16 and 18 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.420
 and how do these games play the little ones? 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.770
 I know the first in children 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.110
 Germany indexed games views 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.269
 river raid da shot a black 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.949
 triangle on red squares and the 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.320
 Federal Audit Office at that time said that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.180
 creates realistic warfare 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.350
 after the question is what happens to the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.159
 data and how safe is this 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 communication 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.900
 there you can see that teenagers the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.120
 constantly play such games that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 the violent ones will be the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.030
 Consumers just have to know 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.030
 what they get involved with 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.160
 Customers ask for violence 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.930
 just be something in the direction of violence 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.790
 go on board but pay us 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.920
 Anyway, one thing is in demand 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.210
 development will come 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.410
 I did not understand that, I ask 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.970
 the people where a violent one 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.010
 that means you say that then 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.720
 Never say how strong my home 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.710
 Violent is back in nrw yes 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.360
 not the majority of the games 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.399
 the vast majority of games are not 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.190
 so waited as the customers want 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.510
 everything is not just happening everywhere 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.330
 that is a very narrowed perception 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.250
 So do not say that's not dangerous 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.020
 you need or see the danger 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.459
 that that was also nolte with Paul 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.820
 Flowers plant in your computer 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.520
 play for the then so a 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.550
 great feeling of the age groups 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.880
 and driving for young men is that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.730
 certainly something attractive on the market 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.570
 and what, of course, to be used 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.410
 since emotions negative emotions to 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.930
 to improve but to evolve 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.660
 if baganda is social as a propaganda though 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.519
 that you can of course be with everyone 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.370
 do not do something negative 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.049
 So you can say as well 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.840
 Computer games are the future of ours 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.090
 education in a certain way if they are accurate 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.549
 Do that school should do 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.650
 namely directly reinforce 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.570
 give immediate feedback if you can 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.030
 what if you do that positively? 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:20.239
 has a confidently do that 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:22.400
 Of course, there are only new ones 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.830
 direction the hot m pc games are 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.299
 america has been developed and it is 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.920
 been proven when children this 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.680
 play games because are are 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.420
 actually compassionate and social im 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.269
 real life though and there are those 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.150
 health games so if diabetics 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.519
 with a game of learning with her 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.130
 to handle diabetes appropriately 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.410
 proved that they are much rarer then 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.970
 in the situation come with cook 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.329
 Diabetes shock to the hospital too 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.549
 come 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.829
 So these players have the effect 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.480
 have the positive effect and of course 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.970
 the others also have an effect i think 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.510
 what they say is so scary there 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.090
 these 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.049
 with war to such an extent 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.340
 play 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.170
 I recently heard of World of Tanks 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.760
 So the developer is spoken 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.400
 very proud that he was the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.220
 moral claim so moral 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.870
 impeccable pay model has and 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.629
 then I look at this and then see 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.150
 I'm vintage 41 I'm packing the whole thing 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.180
 cold horror as the armor before the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.859
 ruins against each other 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.380
 I think it's just tremendous 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.870
 trivialization and bargaining that is 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.740
 an aspect of psycho-hygiene in certain 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.690
 wise yes, I think now 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.539
 Immediately see the big danger 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.280
 but it has to be clear somewhere 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.000
 that if you look at such 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.840
 thought worlds that gives that, so to speak 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.639
 mentally not being hygienic is permanent 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.130
 tell me they have been there and 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.050
 90 already excited to a single 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.710
 human with the otherwise no armor 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.570
 to see people there 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.910
 I want to say yes, but completely 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.849
 without people but you do not see them 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.190
 times did ok with years've had 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.080
 are all men here yes and they have 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.270
 getting so excited that I'm in as a woman 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.220
 my old me on the dimensions here 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.590
 games to learn what the great but 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.900
 I think perspective changes that 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.630
 what could be incredibly productive 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.120
 I think you could play as a player 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.530
 just perceive that I'm in as a woman 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.010
 my age and with my experience 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.020
 vintage 41 I am appalled because he 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.720
 this almost everyone on what so far was 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.449
 the problem is more that they than 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.990
 players do not play themselves they are 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.090
 Engaged that's when you give me one 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.060
 just watch the game then treat it 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:48.010
 it just lives on like a movie nine 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.010
 of interactivity already over it 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.560
 not up-to- date any longer and that's true 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.560
 me too 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.020
 So I'm sitting next to the player I 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.790
 watch me talk to him and he says 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.980
 For example, like us in this game 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.650
 heavy rain yes like this terrible one 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.100
 scene is probably someone drill at one 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.510
 Woman between the legs I was addressed 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:25.380
 absolutely horrified and wanted at all 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:25.980
 no more I have for me it is quite 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.080
 different 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.419
 yes the island school he has me 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.919
 I know that and still 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.960
 I'm horrified and yet you can 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.490
 that he explained that to me, I have to do that 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.050
 I only have a small controller 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.810
 time window where I can do that 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.700
 For me it looks different than wanted 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.350
 yes, not even I tear you yes 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.360
 but I can tell you that 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.580
 let's say we say the man of 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.470
 It's different for me and her 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.410
 but do not sit there to see 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.790
 That's exactly what I wanted because we have one 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.110
 peaceful exit yes we were 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.830
 it already in the all the positive 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.090
 effects 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.680
 if I still have the privacy 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:06.600
 ask may speak 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.120
 emotional things z that would be again 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.979
 Positive if we are something like that 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.120
 Body reacts and thereby becomes data 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.610
 passed on and then something again 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.919
 positive recommended that is quite 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.160
 wrong thought or you can not 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.080
 say 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.640
 to pass on the data voluntarily 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.710
 we even want her to work 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.280
 if we know that we will 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.280
 pass on
