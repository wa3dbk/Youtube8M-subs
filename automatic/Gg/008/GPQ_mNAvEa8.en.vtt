00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.910 
have to do this it's a common practice
you<00:04:39.240> know<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.420> kind<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:39.780> let<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.530> kernel

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
you know to kind of let the the kernel

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.570 
you know to kind of let the the kernel
set<00:04:41.190> settle<00:04:41.700> in<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:41.970> let<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.270> scripts<00:04:42.660> right

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
set settle in and let the scripts right

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.340 
set settle in and let the scripts right
is<00:04:44.580> something<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.030> like<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.390> do<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:46.020> it's

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
is something I like to do but it's

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.320 
is something I like to do but it's
totally<00:04:46.770> up<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:46.920> you<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:47.820> we're<00:04:48.030> going<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.210> go

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
totally up to you so we're going to go

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.300 
totally up to you so we're going to go
ahead<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:48.660> let<00:04:48.780> this<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.650> first<00:04:49.860> boot<00:04:50.160> up

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
ahead and let this and the first boot up

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.430 
ahead and let this and the first boot up
will<00:04:50.580> take<00:04:50.850> will<00:04:51.600> take<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.810> minute<00:04:52.169> or<00:04:52.290> two

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
will take will take a minute or two

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.050 
will take will take a minute or two
while<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.890> scripts<00:04:53.160> are<00:04:53.280> writing<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:53.850> what

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
while the scripts are writing and what

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.480 
while the scripts are writing and what
ROM<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.450> installing<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.290> don't<00:04:55.650> don't<00:04:56.100> don't

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
ROM is installing so don't don't don't

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.970 
ROM is installing so don't don't don't
be<00:04:56.640> afraid
