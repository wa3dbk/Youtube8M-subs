00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.399 
have one flap that is angling down and
on<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.460> other<00:01:39.670> side<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.329> flap<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.780> angling<00:01:41.229> up

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
on the other side the flap is angling up

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.139 
on the other side the flap is angling up
so<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.829> just<00:01:42.039> fits<00:01:42.189> together<00:01:42.460> like<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.850> puzzle

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
so it just fits together like a puzzle

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.370 
so it just fits together like a puzzle
and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:45.490> got<00:01:45.820> glue<00:01:46.060> everywhere<00:01:46.390> when<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.170> was

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
and I got glue everywhere when I was

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.899 
and I got glue everywhere when I was
done<00:01:47.590> with<00:01:47.710> this<00:01:47.829> project<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.369> had<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.579> take<00:01:48.759> my

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
done with this project I had to take my

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.940 
done with this project I had to take my
tweezers<00:01:49.359> and<00:01:49.630> pick<00:01:50.229> all<00:01:50.469> these<00:01:50.710> little

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
tweezers and pick all these little

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.830 
tweezers and pick all these little
strands<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.579> hot<00:01:51.729> glue<00:01:51.939> I<00:01:52.240> don't<00:01:52.450> know<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:52.810> just

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
strands of hot glue I don't know it just

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.959 
strands of hot glue I don't know it just
like<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.560> just<00:01:53.590> explodes<00:01:54.310> it's<00:01:54.579> everywhere

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
like it just explodes it's everywhere

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.059 
like it just explodes it's everywhere
it's<00:01:55.359> on<00:01:55.539> my<00:01:55.659> fingers<00:01:56.079> I'm<00:01:56.229> picking<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.710> off<00:01:56.859> my

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
it's on my fingers I'm picking it off my

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.219 
it's on my fingers I'm picking it off my
countertop<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.479> then<00:01:58.630> once<00:01:58.810> you've<00:01:58.929> got<00:01:59.079> this

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
countertop so then once you've got this

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.020 
countertop so then once you've got this
all<00:01:59.439> together<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.890> just<00:01:59.920> kind<00:02:00.249> of<00:02:00.310> crimp<00:02:00.909> it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
all together you just kind of crimp it

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.200 
all together you just kind of crimp it
down<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:02.350> makes<00:02:02.590> this<00:02:03.100> it's<00:02:03.579> like<00:02:03.700> magic

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
down and it makes this it's like magic

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.749 
down and it makes this it's like magic
look<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.630> rosette<00:02:05.140> heart<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:06.100> cool<00:02:06.460> now<00:02:06.670> I'm

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
look a rosette heart so cool now I'm

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
going to go on the back side and glue it

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.560 
going to go on the back side and glue it
together<00:02:09.400> this<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:09.880> little<00:02:10.210> tricky<00:02:10.450> you

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
you need somebody to hands to pinch it

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.000 
you need somebody to hands to pinch it
together<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.540> third<00:02:15.780> hand<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.080> glue<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.500> so

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
together and a third hand to glue it so

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.610 
together and a third hand to glue it so
I'm<00:02:17.070> doing<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.400> best<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:18.030> put<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> glob<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
hot glue on there and then I took one of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.990 
hot glue on there and then I took one of
the<00:02:21.570> little<00:02:21.810> circles<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.500> die<00:02:22.620> cut<00:02:23.040> from

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
the little circles that I die cut from

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.300 
the little circles that I die cut from
that<00:02:24.180> comes<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.920> collection<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.070> die

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
that comes in this collection this die

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.770 
that comes in this collection this die
set<00:02:26.420> hold<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.600> down<00:02:27.870> count<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.920> 30<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.780> just

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
set hold that down count to 30 and just

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.570 
set hold that down count to 30 and just
breathe<00:02:31.110> through<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.500> pain<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.160> hot<00:02:32.310> glue

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
breathe through the pain of the hot glue

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.730 
breathe through the pain of the hot glue
and<00:02:33.030> now<00:02:33.570> we've<00:02:33.750> got<00:02:33.930> I'm<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> went<00:02:34.500> ahead<00:02:34.620> I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
and now we've got I'm a I went ahead I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.890 
and now we've got I'm a I went ahead I
made<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> large<00:02:35.370> kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.180> rainbow<00:02:36.390> striped

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
made a large kind of rainbow striped

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.690 
made a large kind of rainbow striped
heart<00:02:37.260> rosette<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.800> then<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.070> made<00:02:38.310> one<00:02:38.520> with

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
heart rosette and then I made one with

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.950 
heart rosette and then I made one with
another<00:02:38.940> piece<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.300> pattern<00:02:39.570> paper<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:39.930> like

gonna kind of make a little bit of a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.430 
gonna kind of make a little bit of a
design<00:03:01.020> if<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:02.250> will<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.910> what<00:03:03.870> I'm<00:03:04.020> trying<00:03:04.200> to

design if you will is what I'm trying to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.530 
design if you will is what I'm trying to
do<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.890> then<00:03:05.580> now<00:03:05.850> if<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.270> would<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:06.480> thought

do and then now if I would have thought
this<00:03:06.870> through<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.200> would<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.590> stapled<00:03:08.100> these

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
this through I would have stapled these

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.860 
this through I would have stapled these
down<00:03:08.550> before<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:08.970> adhered<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.540> kind<00:03:09.810> of

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
down before I adhered that kind of

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.420 
down before I adhered that kind of
chalkboard<00:03:10.140> pattern<00:03:10.740> paper<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.250> had

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
chalkboard pattern paper but I had

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.700 
chalkboard pattern paper but I had
already<00:03:11.670> adhered<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.390> but<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> want<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.560> have

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
already adhered it but I want to have

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.920 
already adhered it but I want to have

know<00:05:07.740> what<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.010> should<00:05:08.250> be<00:05:08.280> going<00:05:08.550> down<00:05:08.810> but

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
know what it should be going down but

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.080 
know what it should be going down but
it's<00:05:09.960> growing<00:05:10.320> but<00:05:10.650> anyhow<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:11.220> I<00:05:11.250> cut<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.880> bunch
