00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.610
 Good day to all viewers 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.160
 my video blog my name is Alexander 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 gennady and today i will tell you about 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 red sweet wine 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.279
 this wine is about who della 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 valpolicella classic is very difficult 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.460
 the name would seem but in general we 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.510
 always called ricetta 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.609
 although it does something and white 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.010
 grapes from white 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.380
 white wine or three Che but more often in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.079
 consumer heads in their heads 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.710
 professionals talk about this red 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.350
 sweet what is so unusual about him 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.219
 sometime even customers 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.289
 Venetian merchants were amazed 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.289
 unusual taste chic taste of this 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.600
 wine because wine does it 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.590
 in an unusual way and some critics 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.850
 they even say it's an Italian answer 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.050
 move it 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.489
 wine is from Italy from the Veneto region and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.159
 unusual way is that grapes 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.720
 they cringe and he loses 40 percent 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.360
 moisture 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.820
 Sugar concentrates accordingly. 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.170
 the sugar inside the wine is surmised 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.520
 natural they are added what else can 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.479
 say about talking about Che round it 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 the pearl of winemaking 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.020
 Veneto Richards della region 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.040
 valpolicella is made in the same 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.680
 compliance and flew 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.320
 and this wine is specifically entering a dispute 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.340
 threatened by what they do in 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.799
 took grapes in it afterwards 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.850
 aged in oak barrels and before 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.570
 selling wonders 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.130
 bottled this wine gets gets 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.030
 more precisely 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.539
 great exposure potential for exposure to 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.149
 balls soak in a bottle that is it 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.119
 wine can be stored for a very long time and therefore 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.880
 if you look at prices and ricetta della 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.689
 valpolicella the older wine 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.030
 the body is more expensive for harvesting 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.489
 tattoo on the shoulder and make of the same varieties 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.239
 grape that and usually a minute shoulder here 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.920
 i.e. this is korvina randy dear lynar 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.690
 the wine is not as strong as 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.950
 some port wine ie everything here 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.950
 only 14 percent alcohol 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.110
 there are also 15 percent sometimes 13 with 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.220
 half can be met but again 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.230
 this wine is not strong unlike the same 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.110
 port wine 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.750
 what else would like to say such wines 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.239
 usually beat out of glasses for dessert 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.049
 wine for a digestif 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.730
 such a volume of approximately the same shape 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.819
 some beat out of glasses for red 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.380
 for white wine 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.180
 because they are smaller than red 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.090
 and finer flavor 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.510
 narrower directional flow goes 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.000
 I decided to compare this same wine 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.139
 pour two different glasses and try 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.579
 what will be different flavor here 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.720
 certainly more concentrated 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:17.220
 and some kind of acid is obtained 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.220
 some kind of yeast more 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.730
 here more more tender aroma more 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.600
 so light aroma is obtained therefore 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.460
 more pleasant so I say this from such a glass 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.790
 sniff this wine 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.910
 inhale it from such a glass too 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.290
 concentrated flavor is obtained 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.650
 I will taste this vocal will 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.650
 tastier 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.680
 such a wine tastes originally of course 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.440
 sweet but not as sweet as 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.959
 expected from lenses sweet but you see 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.690
 of course to the floor sweet even content 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.810
 sugar at least it seems to me 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.849
 in board language 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.790
 a lot of some candied fruit 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.790
 such dried fruits and everything is commonly called and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.320
 cherry smells very cherry cherry 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:23.830
 perry ripe cherry and very sweet 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:25.840
 try this plowed up from this glass 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.280
 a little bit different wine gets in your mouth 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.680
 on a wider area up the language at the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.289
 there is on the side and it seems that she 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.870
 a little more acid pouting acid 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.410
 it seems higher than not to blind from the glass 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.419
 because it is clear narrow stream immediately 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.260
 on the middle of such or on the root of the language 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.729
 hits minutes to really zita 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.190
 glasses when you hit a lot more interesting 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.380
 tastes better and here it is 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.330
 sweets acidity balance have 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.840
 much better than drinking it from 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.240
 some small wine glass with something wine 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.340
 they usually drink i think you can drink it 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.740
 the end of the meal when everything is eaten and 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.280
 with some small dessert snacks 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.470
 with the same 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.990
 nuts or dried fruits I think very 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:19.960
 well suited well and probably with 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.080
 fruit with fruit me citrus 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.060
 may also be nice too 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.880
 it was a speech about so head flew 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.240
 classic 2007 which may still 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.930
 lie down for a very long time any 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.120
 was your cellar in mine and it was 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.800
