there<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.229> world<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.700> map

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
there is a world right there on the map

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
there is a world right there on the map
now<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.689> not<00:02:03.840> nearly<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.200> detailed<00:02:04.649> as

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
now it's not nearly as detailed as

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.200 
now it's not nearly as detailed as
Minecraft<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.460> definitely<00:02:05.759> doesn't<00:02:05.880> look<00:02:06.060> as

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
Minecraft and definitely doesn't look as

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.900 
Minecraft and definitely doesn't look as
Minecraft<00:02:06.689> as<00:02:06.869> Minecraft<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.670> look

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
Minecraft as Minecraft but if you look

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.119 
Minecraft as Minecraft but if you look
closely<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:09.989> there's<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.560> character

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
closely you can see there's a character

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.880 
closely you can see there's a character
he's<00:02:11.340> red<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.959> grass<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.379> green<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
he's red the grass is green the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.650 
he's red the grass is green the
Goethe's<00:02:14.160> Brown<00:02:14.400> there's<00:02:14.670> some<00:02:14.819> sand<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.390> sky

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
Goethe's Brown there's some sand the sky

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.170 
Goethe's Brown there's some sand the sky
and<00:02:16.580> water<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.440> over<00:02:20.130> here<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:21.060> actually

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and water so over here you can actually

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.970 
and water so over here you can actually
see<00:02:21.480> what<00:02:21.630> blocks<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.110> selected<00:02:22.709> right

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
see what blocks you have selected right

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.110 
see what blocks you have selected right
now<00:02:23.160> he<00:02:23.220> currently<00:02:23.640> has<00:02:24.030> dirt<00:02:24.900> selected<00:02:25.530> and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
now he currently has dirt selected and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.580 
now he currently has dirt selected and
let's<00:02:27.120> go<00:02:27.300> over<00:02:27.330> him<00:02:27.720> now<00:02:27.930> these<00:02:28.380> are<00:02:28.560> your

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
let's go over him now these are your

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.940 
let's go over him now these are your
controls<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.510> upper<00:02:30.840> ones<00:02:31.110> control

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
controls the the upper ones control

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.980 
controls the the upper ones control
which<00:02:32.130> direction<00:02:32.520> you're<00:02:32.820> jumping<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
which direction you're jumping and the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.080 
which direction you're jumping and the
lower<00:02:34.200> ones<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.920> control<00:02:35.610> which<00:02:35.760> direction

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
lower ones can control which direction

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.000 
lower ones can control which direction
you're<00:02:36.390> going<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.380> no<00:02:37.590> idea<00:02:37.890> what

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
you're going and I have no idea what

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040 
you're going and I have no idea what
that<00:02:38.130> one<00:02:38.310> does<00:02:38.340> except<00:02:39.300> maybe<00:02:39.450> placing<00:02:40.020> a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
that one does except maybe placing a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.440 
that one does except maybe placing a
block<00:02:40.500> below<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.920> hey<00:02:41.820> well<00:02:42.030> let's<00:02:42.060> check<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
block below you hey well let's check the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.620 
block below you hey well let's check the
map<00:02:42.600> again<00:02:42.780> now<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.950> press<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:45.030> direction

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
map again now if I press this direction

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.550 
map again now if I press this direction
if<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.560> actually<00:02:46.800> hit<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.160> there<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.550> go

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
if I can actually hit it there we go

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.290 
if I can actually hit it there we go
eventually<00:02:49.560> my<00:02:49.739> character<00:02:50.250> will<00:02:50.520> slowly<00:02:50.880> move

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
eventually my character will slowly move

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.270 
eventually my character will slowly move
to<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.570> right<00:02:51.780> now<00:02:52.709> we<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:52.980> at<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.130> weight

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
to the right now we just at the weight

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.699 
to the right now we just at the weight

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
actually go into building mode by

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.370 
actually go into building mode by
stepping<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.570> pressure<00:03:06.870> plate<00:03:07.200> and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
stepping on this pressure plate and

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.400 
stepping on this pressure plate and
choosing<00:03:08.100> what<00:03:08.370> block<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.820> want<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.209> use<00:03:09.480> so

and water actually has the properties of
water<00:03:25.980> from<00:03:26.459> alpha<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.980> actually<00:03:29.640> has<00:03:29.790> spreads

from<00:03:30.810> where<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.079> place<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> most

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
from where you place it in the most

from where you place it in the most
annoying<00:03:32.430> way<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.910> floods<00:03:33.180> your<00:03:33.360> area<00:03:33.720> do

annoying way that floods your area do

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.110 
annoying way that floods your area do
you<00:03:34.019> remember<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.440> yeah<00:03:35.130> I'm<00:03:35.340> sure<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:35.730> do

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
you remember that yeah I'm sure you do

you remember that yeah I'm sure you do
anyway<00:03:36.840> let's<00:03:37.140> step<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> plate<00:03:37.860> again<00:03:38.160> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
anyway let's step on the plate again and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.000 
anyway let's step on the plate again and
as<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.360> know<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.959> have<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.530> water<00:03:40.739> block

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
as you know I have the water block

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.160 
as you know I have the water block
selected<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.390> feel<00:03:42.600> like<00:03:42.720> flooding

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
selected and I just feel like flooding

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.690 
selected and I just feel like flooding
everything<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.950> left<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.310> me<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:44.579> it's

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
everything to the left of me but it's

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.979 
everything to the left of me but it's
also<00:03:44.820> probably<00:03:45.180> willing<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.420> flood<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.810> area

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
also probably willing to flood the area

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.130 
also probably willing to flood the area
which<00:03:46.320> I'm<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.820> let's<00:03:47.820> do<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:49.190> watching

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
which I'm in let's do that watching

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.770 
which I'm in let's do that watching
eventually<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:54.239> have<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.420> hear<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.660> sometime

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
eventually you have to hear it sometime

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.470 
eventually you have to hear it sometime
it's<00:03:55.320> thinking<00:03:56.160> it's<00:03:56.790> thinking<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.209> what<00:03:57.360> it's

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
it's thinking it's thinking on what it's

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.850 
it's thinking it's thinking on what it's
supposed<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:59.959> there<00:04:00.959> we<00:04:01.140> go<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.470> place<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
water block and as you can see the whole

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.660 
water block and as you can see the whole
area<00:04:03.780> filled<00:04:04.110> up<00:04:04.230> with<00:04:04.320> water<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.890> just<00:04:05.519> have<00:04:05.610> to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
area filled up with water I just have to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.440 
area filled up with water I just have to
step<00:04:05.880> off<00:04:06.290> move<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.410> little<00:04:07.560> bit<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:08.420> hit<00:04:09.420> it

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
step off move a little bit I hit it

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.090 
step off move a little bit I hit it
twice<00:04:09.690> maybe<00:04:10.170> my<00:04:10.350> character<00:04:10.650> will<00:04:10.769> move<00:04:10.920> two

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
twice maybe my character will move two

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.310 
twice maybe my character will move two
spaces<00:04:11.400> maybe<00:04:11.790> not<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.090> don't<00:04:12.359> know<00:04:12.600> let's<00:04:13.049> see

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
spaces maybe not I don't know let's see

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.580 
spaces maybe not I don't know let's see
oh<00:04:15.590> he<00:04:16.590> moved<00:04:16.769> 102<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:18.060> now<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.019> feel<00:04:19.380> like<00:04:19.410> he

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
oh he moved 102 and now I feel like he

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.860 
oh he moved 102 and now I feel like he
needs<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.890> jump<00:04:20.130> diagonally<00:04:20.539> come<00:04:21.539> on

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
needs to jump diagonally come on

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.650 
needs to jump diagonally come on
let's<00:04:22.109> let's<00:04:22.590> do<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:22.919> little<00:04:23.070> red<00:04:23.310> guy<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:24.479> can

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
let's let's do it little red guy you can

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.910 
let's let's do it little red guy you can
do<00:04:24.810> it

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
do it

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.670 
do it
oh<00:04:26.180> man<00:04:27.180> he<00:04:27.630> jumped<00:04:29.210> up<00:04:33.200> what<00:04:34.200> you<00:04:34.320> doing<00:04:34.440> now

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
oh man he jumped up what you doing now

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.270 
oh man he jumped up what you doing now
oh<00:04:35.010> well<00:04:35.760> he's<00:04:35.910> he's<00:04:36.270> where<00:04:36.510> he<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:36.780> now<00:04:37.560> as<00:04:37.920> you

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
oh well he's he's where he is now as you

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.400 
oh well he's he's where he is now as you
can<00:04:38.370> see<00:04:38.430> it's<00:04:38.790> not<00:04:39.000> really<00:04:39.140> playable<00:04:40.140> but

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
can see it's not really playable but

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.840 
can see it's not really playable but
it's<00:04:40.830> just<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.310> idea<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.450> amazing<00:04:43.850> and

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
it's just the idea of it is amazing and

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.670 
it's just the idea of it is amazing and
also<00:04:45.120> generates<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.570> little<00:04:45.780> bit<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:45.990> lag<00:04:46.200> when

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
also generates a little bit of lag when

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.080 
also generates a little bit of lag when
you<00:04:47.520> know<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:48.720> actually<00:04:49.530> goes<00:04:49.890> off<00:04:50.130> of<00:04:50.430> course

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
you know it actually goes off of course

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.210 
you know it actually goes off of course
if<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.360> didn't<00:04:51.630> notice<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.110> mean<00:04:52.350> I'm<00:04:52.980> actually

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
if you didn't notice I mean I'm actually

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.430 
if you didn't notice I mean I'm actually
going<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.670> go<00:04:53.790> down<00:04:54.030> here<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:55.050> we're<00:04:55.200> going<00:04:55.320> to

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
going to go down here and we're going to

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.860 
going to go down here and we're going to
look<00:04:55.710> at<00:04:56.010> how<00:04:56.250> complex<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:57.120> circuitry<00:04:57.600> is

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
look at how complex the circuitry is

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.500 
look at how complex the circuitry is
just<00:04:58.770> for<00:04:58.980> this<00:04:59.160> little<00:04:59.220> game<00:04:59.820> that's<00:05:00.210> you

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
just for this little game that's you

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.100 
just for this little game that's you
know<00:05:00.980> completely<00:05:02.060> amazing<00:05:03.060> but<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.720> mean<00:05:03.960> look

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
at all this I mean that's where the game

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.860 
at all this I mean that's where the game
is<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.530> game<00:05:07.560> area<00:05:07.920> is<00:05:08.040> right<00:05:08.220> there<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.870> you

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
is the game area is right there and you

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.430 
is the game area is right there and you
just<00:05:09.930> go<00:05:10.080> in<00:05:10.380> here<00:05:10.710> now<00:05:10.920> I<00:05:11.900> mean<00:05:12.900> just<00:05:13.110> look<00:05:13.350> at

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
just go in here now I mean just look at

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.270 
just go in here now I mean just look at
all<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.920> this<00:05:15.110> but<00:05:16.110> really<00:05:16.440> this<00:05:16.890> is<00:05:16.950> just<00:05:17.190> a

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
all of this but really this is just a

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.400 
all of this but really this is just a
really<00:05:17.490> cool<00:05:17.760> map<00:05:18.030> oh<00:05:18.330> I<00:05:18.540> hear<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:18.870> hear<00:05:19.200> some

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
really cool map oh I hear I hear some

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.630 
really cool map oh I hear I hear some
spiders<00:05:19.950> going<00:05:20.310> on

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
spiders going on

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.460 
spiders going on
I<00:05:20.670> think<00:05:21.000> it's<00:05:21.120> using<00:05:21.360> some<00:05:21.510> spider<00:05:21.900> logic

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
I think it's using some spider logic

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.840 
I think it's using some spider logic
where<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.740> goes<00:05:22.890> on<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.220> pressure<00:05:23.520> plates

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
where it goes on the pressure plates

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.460 
where it goes on the pressure plates
maybe<00:05:24.060> I<00:05:24.210> don't<00:05:24.390> know<00:05:24.630> or<00:05:24.780> maybe<00:05:24.900> despawn

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
maybe I don't know or maybe despawn

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.440 
maybe I don't know or maybe despawn
because<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.920> felt<00:05:26.130> like<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:27.030> never<00:05:27.180> know

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
because it felt like it you never know

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.230 
because it felt like it you never know
what<00:05:27.630> spiders<00:05:28.110> they're<00:05:28.320> kind<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.650> weird<00:05:28.860> and

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240

mean all of this redstone contraption

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.770 
mean all of this redstone contraption
just<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.550> have<00:05:41.700> minecraft<00:05:41.940> running<00:05:42.540> with<00:05:42.660> in

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780

Minecraft vanilla mmm I love no flavor
okay<00:05:49.170> let's<00:05:49.380> see<00:05:49.560> this<00:05:50.100> actually<00:05:50.430> kind<00:05:50.550> of

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
okay let's see this actually kind of

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.190 
okay let's see this actually kind of
makes<00:05:50.820> like<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:50.970> cool<00:05:51.240> little<00:05:51.360> parkour<00:05:51.900> map<00:05:52.050> if

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
makes like a cool little parkour map if

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.740 
makes like a cool little parkour map if
you<00:05:52.260> fall<00:05:52.500> you<00:05:52.620> die<00:05:52.830> but<00:05:53.760> if<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.420> can<00:05:54.540> manage

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
you fall you die but if you can manage

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.750 
you fall you die but if you can manage
to<00:05:54.870> make<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.170> across<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.530> circuitry<00:05:55.980> you're

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
to make it across the circuitry you're

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.540 
to make it across the circuitry you're
perfectly<00:05:57.390> fine<00:05:57.920> also<00:05:58.920> I<00:05:59.250> noticed<00:06:00.000> that

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
perfectly fine also I noticed that

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.720 
perfectly fine also I noticed that
really<00:06:02.550> I'm<00:06:02.700> I<00:06:02.880> came<00:06:03.120> to<00:06:03.240> a<00:06:03.270> revelation

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
really I'm I came to a revelation

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.920 
really I'm I came to a revelation
computers<00:06:05.730> if<00:06:06.060> they're<00:06:06.300> but<00:06:06.480> they're<00:06:06.720> all

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
computers if they're but they're all

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.570 
computers if they're but they're all
computers<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.560> bit<00:06:07.800> kind<00:06:08.070> of<00:06:08.190> similar<00:06:08.550> to

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
computers a bit kind of similar to

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.450 
computers a bit kind of similar to
Minecraft<00:06:09.270> computers<00:06:09.930> right<00:06:10.080> you<00:06:10.320> know<00:06:10.470> this

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
Minecraft computers right you know this

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.830 
Minecraft computers right you know this
is<00:06:11.520> this<00:06:11.850> is<00:06:12.000> very<00:06:12.030> similar<00:06:12.390> to<00:06:12.510> a<00:06:12.660> regular

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
is this is very similar to a regular

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.610 
is this is very similar to a regular
circuit<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:13.920> you<00:06:14.550> know<00:06:15.180> circuitry<00:06:15.840> is<00:06:16.110> great

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
circuit and you know circuitry is great

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.560 
circuit and you know circuitry is great
and<00:06:16.830> all<00:06:16.950> but<00:06:17.330> oh<00:06:18.680> man<00:06:19.820> but<00:06:20.820> it's<00:06:21.060> similar<00:06:21.330> to

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
and all but oh man but it's similar to

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.000 
and all but oh man but it's similar to
this<00:06:21.690> you<00:06:21.750> know<00:06:21.930> you<00:06:21.990> have<00:06:22.080> wires<00:06:22.470> crossing

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
this you know you have wires crossing

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.760 
this you know you have wires crossing
and<00:06:23.550> overlapping<00:06:24.450> and<00:06:24.960> doing<00:06:25.470> things<00:06:25.710> like

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
and overlapping and doing things like

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.340 
and overlapping and doing things like
this<00:06:26.160> so<00:06:26.460> you're<00:06:26.610> like<00:06:26.820> oh<00:06:27.000> man<00:06:27.390> how<00:06:28.140> am<00:06:28.170> I

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
this so you're like oh man how am I

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.220 
this so you're like oh man how am I
going<00:06:28.500> to<00:06:28.650> make<00:06:28.770> it<00:06:28.890> across<00:06:29.330> well<00:06:30.330> I<00:06:30.840> mean

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
going to make it across well I mean

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.960 
going to make it across well I mean
there's<00:06:31.500> zombies<00:06:31.710> spawning<00:06:32.250> here<00:06:32.460> creepers

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
there's zombies spawning here creepers

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.810 
there's zombies spawning here creepers
spawn<00:06:33.300> here<00:06:33.600> so<00:06:33.780> I<00:06:33.810> was<00:06:34.230> thinking<00:06:34.790> what<00:06:35.790> about

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
spawn here so I was thinking what about

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.930 
spawn here so I was thinking what about
viruses<00:06:36.770> can<00:06:37.770> these<00:06:37.950> things<00:06:38.010> have<00:06:38.400> viruses

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
viruses can these things have viruses

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.860 
viruses can these things have viruses
and<00:06:39.060> I<00:06:39.150> thought

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
and I thought

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.650 
and I thought
things<00:06:41.870> that<00:06:42.080> have<00:06:42.260> viruses<00:06:43.270> maybe<00:06:44.270> they<00:06:44.540> just

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660 
things that have viruses maybe they just

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.330 
things that have viruses maybe they just
have<00:06:44.840> a<00:06:44.870> giant<00:06:45.170> creeper<00:06:45.530> inside<00:06:46.010> of<00:06:46.160> them<00:06:46.250> and

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
have a giant creeper inside of them and

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.560 
have a giant creeper inside of them and
it<00:06:46.430> blew<00:06:46.640> up<00:06:46.670> and<00:06:47.060> blew<00:06:47.600> up<00:06:47.690> a<00:06:47.780> section<00:06:48.080> out<00:06:48.980> of

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
it blew up and blew up a section out of

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.830 
it blew up and blew up a section out of
the<00:06:50.570> computer<00:06:50.930> mainframe<00:06:52.450> anyway<00:06:53.450> that's

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
the computer mainframe anyway that's

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.000 
the computer mainframe anyway that's
about<00:06:54.080> all<00:06:54.650> I<00:06:54.710> have<00:06:55.610> about<00:06:56.360> this<00:06:56.600> map<00:06:57.290> now<00:06:57.890> the

map<00:07:30.920> is<00:07:31.130> amazing<00:07:31.610> but<00:07:32.350> just<00:07:33.350> on<00:07:33.530> the<00:07:33.680> technical

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:33.830 
map is amazing but just on the technical

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.340

aspect unfortunately the game is kind of
unplayable<00:07:36.770> just<00:07:37.340> because<00:07:37.610> of<00:07:37.760> how<00:07:37.880> long<00:07:38.090> it

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300 
unplayable just because of how long it

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.910 
unplayable just because of how long it
takes<00:07:38.540> and<00:07:39.080> I'm<00:07:39.170> sure<00:07:39.380> if<00:07:39.470> you<00:07:39.590> had<00:07:39.710> like<00:07:39.860> a
