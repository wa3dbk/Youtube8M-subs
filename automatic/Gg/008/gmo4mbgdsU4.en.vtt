00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.280 
kind of hard to get the photo right but
it's<00:01:21.210> cool<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> bunch<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.110> little

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it's cool there are a bunch of little

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
it's cool there are a bunch of little
tweaks<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.710> operating<00:01:23.100> system<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.700> it's

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
tweaks to the operating system one it's

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
tweaks to the operating system one it's
called<00:01:23.970> slide<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.420> access<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.930> basically

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
called slide to access and basically

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.109 
called slide to access and basically
what<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.380> lets<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.890> store<00:01:26.310> apps<00:01:26.610> off<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
what it lets you do is store apps off to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
what it lets you do is store apps off to
the<00:01:27.240> left<00:01:27.450> side<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.810> screen<00:01:28.049> using<00:01:28.619> three

the left side of your screen using three
fingers<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.430> swipe<00:01:29.759> an<00:01:29.939> app<00:01:30.060> over<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
fingers just swipe an app over and it

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.450 
fingers just swipe an app over and it
just<00:01:31.290> lives<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:31.979> sort<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.280> own

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
just lives there and it's sort of own

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.640 
just lives there and it's sort of own

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
coolest weeks of the operating system is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.120 
coolest weeks of the operating system is
how<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> g2<00:01:36.810> handles<00:01:37.140> guest<00:01:37.380> mode<00:01:37.619> instead<00:01:37.950> of
