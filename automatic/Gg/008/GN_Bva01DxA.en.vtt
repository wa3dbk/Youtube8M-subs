00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.920
 and he talks and he's what I'm going to do 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.990
 plus a minecraft video in today's video 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.949
 I'll be showing you a template. 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.839
 calls smartmove and it adds several 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:30.380
 moves there I know minecraft right? 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:32.240
 and it's really cool that until the time that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.620
 You're swimming, it's going to be really cool. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.140
 more realistic 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.789
 the game becomes much more realistic as well 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.820
 Really cool 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:45.109
 then there is the hill demonstration 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.670
 You said people to put it on like this? 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.690
 third person who can stay longer 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.120
 easy you see when you have 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.090
 We need to climb up on a house one 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.629
 thing you click the middle mouse button 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:05.260
 he is going up 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:07.910
 the other is when you click to lower and 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.820
 click the middle mouse button 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.100
 he grabs well to crawl law gives 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.640
 to make some places only gives you 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.500
 enters into the furniture or anything 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:26.120
 So this is one of the most 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.830
 that there is another movement here 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.990
 you need to jump a fence 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.130
 one thing like that just come here with the button 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.130
 midfield as well 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.990
 so this is cool in this template 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.170
 that's the coolest part I've found 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:53.950
 this mold that is from it to stay 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:57.730
 swimming is watching is much more realistic 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.730
 much more realistic 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.380
 then this template that is quite legal the 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.690
 Guys, I highly recommend you guys. 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.120
 so the staff is this, it was the video and 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.050
 I hope you liked it today. 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.230
 way there and sign up for the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.150
 A light is helping and the motto is gone. 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.810

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.810
