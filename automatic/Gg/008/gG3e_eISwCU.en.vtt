00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.840
 Firmly this with the right hand 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.020
 The representation with the left hand while taking a store whether the cover 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.880
 Create and in the whole body 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.820
 I think that I want you to evoke excitement 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:53.710
 Consciousness is 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:57.040
 Though you may say Toka indicating the direction of coming asked the sound towards you 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:03.190
 And then let the performer feel good 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.840
 And I think that it is important that this to impress listeners is the important thing for that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 I think it might be a guide 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.050
 Hmm 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:17.290
 Do n't be afraid to get in front of your child and gain experience 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.290
 Why it was devised to allow a wide range of representation 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.770
 It is time to say here 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.430
 Please use everyone of this first technique glitter rays 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.610
 I understand you already 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.860
 Please try to appeal to Fu that sparkling Ikya wide open his woman OTA layer 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.780
 Then 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:51.490
 Choir also I think that's all also students and nature and name come thinking 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.240
 If you keep it more powerful 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.600
 Koufukai I think that is called tomorrow 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 1 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.420
 2345678 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.780
 Ne 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.720
 It will add strength this 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.720
 The way I say that keep pull 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.590
 Get up at 1 and get off at 23 123 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.590
 4 Nissan 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:29.349
 Waltz calls this the law 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.940
 Apply this waltz but split it into two 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.830
 People left 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.190
 12311 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.270
 11 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:44.050
 This is also the basic off the way how to get off the world of dream and where the rise is 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.050
 I will spread 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:53.040
 It's an important place, but I'm sure I 'll be by my side 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.430
 I wonder if that feeling will stand a little more with the ceremony 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.000
 what should I do 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.720
 Said Do as the height of this equation 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.470
 Takane Nishi, so let's go when entering the market 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.690
 I 'll raise it high source everyone has a high voice 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:18.900
 It's likely out I par in and do the next eight tails off, but there do 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:23.710
 surfer obtained it is to say where the flip-up saying I entered the side of Pyonto one 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:32.190
 Because here in the end worth note and we'll hit outgoing likely out 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:32.190
 I 'll come into the side, but I will go up a little and try to go up and support 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:51.459
 There is trouble from the teachers saying that children don't see the ceremony 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:56.319
 It's better to say if you let me see you 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:04:02.349
 Let's do a ceremony that children want to see 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:06.800
 In is called What if an expression is because its only want to become such a formula and also a change in the formula 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:12.080
 Well then there is a change in strength, and so on 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:15.710
 If you don't have this, it's just saying you're shaking it with 4 beats and 3 beats 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.670
 By all means sharp do not we seen children 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.660
 Keep in mind the changing command 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.660
 3 Please try a formula that you want to try
