00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.379
 and it's beauty or teaching or with chlorine 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.370
 blood beta 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.730
 the base is the following pet behind will stay 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.850
 well here it is boring out almost ob 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.670
 leaving tail and front foot on top of the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.029
 two first screw these two here is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.740
 the next we will reach the speed or 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.390
 when you have stopped more but if you have 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.369
 that being on the move should 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.009
 always do the following when you go 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.410
 do in the complex first of all that foot 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.489
 have to get out of thinking he's going to do 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:43.850
 this movement that hit the fox to do 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.850
 if you take out who will make a popular 180 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 always when you go to do the knot 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.000
 punctual first of all you have you have 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.920
 to take the Australians of the body and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.180
 when you turn the street before the body is 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180
 easier to climb up 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.909
 after you get my client already 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.610
 have on the base that you have easy for you 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.610
 you will be able to take in the complex 350 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.510
 by 360 something harder because 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.070
 360 is played from the shoulder when you 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.840
 start to 360 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.000
 the thigh will have a little side to 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.130
 you take because this reinforcement is the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.310
 I leave here a little bit for the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.200
 national side is down remember 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.810
 shoulder movement 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.700
 you will fall for example in the end you 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.950
 does not go completely the chance to stay 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.549
 with the little hands and turn ends turning 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.549
 with the routines 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.140
 now i will teach the new backside goes 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.679
 180 is the second time I left there with the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.690
 dad 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.670
 It will be difficult for you to catch him. 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.340
 totally different from the front site 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.710
 the basis is the following the popular backside 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.300
 your foot behind but myself only by 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.729
 front is going to stay a little further out 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.780
 because the following is the website if it goes 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.020
 hit you will put this foot 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.970
 out and just make it down 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.259
 this is more difficult because the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.780
 full speed movement 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.019
 different then will doing surgery will 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.019
 will go out and take to retreat
