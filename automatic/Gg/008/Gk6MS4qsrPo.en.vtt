 ung are people contaminated by the plague 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.090
 you can decide how best to deal with 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.219
 them and the way you are playing 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.640
 but only for them on the right then we will have 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.039

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.500
 first mission is not a little thing changed 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 some things to respawn other things 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.590
 are different you will notice a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.299
 for example is that now the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.920
 killers scattered over the map 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.110
 especially now it's day then 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.290
 stay tuned these guys have powers 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.540
 Just like you, I use your

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.460
 murderers plus one person inside case 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.430
 they have not killed yet certain that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 There's a good team in there and he's got it. 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.390
 scratch off 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.540
 As you saw here I found that 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.820
 I was glad I was alone with the guy. 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.620
 When you see they have appeared, then analyze 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.420
 well and have look for the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.970
 before entering the house for later 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:56.050

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:58.150
 this opening side closed was already good 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.670

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.820
 organization next flight key care 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 not enough and killing is just the old 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.800
 the one who helped us and also 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.420
 is an envoy of the entity that in God 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.300
 for them then let her find it right 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.470
 do not kill the screen and take what you 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.350
 came to get 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.100
 good seems to miss these heights is that the 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.150
 mission of the inkatha is there for 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.520

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.340
 right where poll is a bathhouse 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.980
 then murder a couple of right people 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.930
 there are several ways to do them 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.700
 being able to collect all items is 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.980

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.070
 items that is the clear intention of this series 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.570

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.360
 to the doctor's house where we 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.360
 then we take a wrong piece 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.100

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.750
