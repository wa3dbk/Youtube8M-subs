00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
you know what up you guys I want to talk

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.230 
you know what up you guys I want to talk
to<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.130> about<00:00:11.219> intra-abdominal<00:00:11.849> pressure

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
to you about intra-abdominal pressure

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.299 
to you about intra-abdominal pressure
this<00:00:12.960> race<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.320> thrown<00:00:13.710> around<00:00:13.860> all<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> time

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
this race is thrown around all the time

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.919 
this race is thrown around all the time
but<00:00:14.580> no<00:00:14.730> one<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.210> taking<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.599> time<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
but no one is really taking the time to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.590 
but no one is really taking the time to
explain<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.650> know<00:00:17.310> like<00:00:17.789> Omar<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.270> soft<00:00:18.480> did

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
explain it I know like Omar you soft did

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.210 
explain it I know like Omar you soft did
a<00:00:18.690> video<00:00:18.840> about<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> long<00:00:19.439> time<00:00:19.500> ago<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:20.039> I

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
a video about it a long time ago but I

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.550 
a video about it a long time ago but I
kind<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> revisit<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.330> because<00:00:21.689> there

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
kind of want to revisit it because there

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.200 
kind of want to revisit it because there
are<00:00:22.680> different<00:00:22.980> variations<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.670> breathing

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
are different variations of breathing

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.470 
are different variations of breathing
and<00:00:25.160> doing<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> wrong<00:00:27.029> way<00:00:27.090> can

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and doing this in the wrong way can

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.169 
and doing this in the wrong way can
significantly<00:00:27.810> affect<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.680> lift<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.609> when

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
significantly affect your lift so when

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
significantly affect your lift so when
someone<00:00:30.480> goes<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> deadlift<00:00:32.040> or

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
someone goes in to do like a deadlift or

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.240 
someone goes in to do like a deadlift or
squat<00:00:32.669> or<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.420> bench<00:00:33.690> press<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.469> even<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> bicep

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
squat or a bench press or even a bicep

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.030 
squat or a bench press or even a bicep
curl<00:00:35.719> they<00:00:36.719> could<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> four<00:00:37.770> things

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
curl they could do one of four things

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.780 
curl they could do one of four things
not<00:00:38.969> breathe<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.480> at<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:40.579> breathe<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.760> through

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
not breathe in at all breathe in through

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.630 
not breathe in at all breathe in through
their<00:00:42.120> nose<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.890> breathe<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.070> through<00:00:44.370> their

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
their nose or breathe in through their

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.229 
their nose or breathe in through their
mouth<00:00:44.820> using<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.989> small<00:00:46.350> mouth<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.520> big

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
mouth using a small mouth of or a big

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.959 
mouth using a small mouth of or a big
mouth<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> small<00:00:49.140> mouth<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.559> look<00:00:49.710> like

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
mouth so a small mouth would look like

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.080 
mouth so a small mouth would look like
the<00:00:50.969> big<00:00:51.210> mouth<00:00:51.360> would<00:00:51.600> look<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.940> my

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the big mouth would look like so in my

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.500 
the big mouth would look like so in my
opinion<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.539> best<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.640> breathing

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
opinion the best one to do is breathing

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.950 
opinion the best one to do is breathing
in<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> small<00:00:58.710> mouth<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.780> that<00:01:00.780> way

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
in with a small mouth like this that way

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
in with a small mouth like this that way
it<00:01:01.260> promotes<00:01:01.739> diaphragmatic<00:01:02.340> breathing

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it promotes diaphragmatic breathing

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
it promotes diaphragmatic breathing
breathing<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:04.049> balls<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.439> whatever<00:01:04.680> as

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
breathing your balls or whatever as

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.859 
breathing your balls or whatever as
Elliot<00:01:05.250> whole<00:01:05.430> host<00:01:05.820> likes<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> call<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> or

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
Elliot whole host likes to call it or

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.380 
Elliot whole host likes to call it or
breathing<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.880> creating<00:01:11.880> downward

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
breathing in and creating downward

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.260 
breathing in and creating downward
pressure<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.280> help<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.760> using

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
pressure this will really help for using

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
pressure this will really help for using
a<00:01:15.330> belt<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.950> even<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.009> you're<00:01:17.130> not<00:01:17.189> using<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
a belt and even if you're not using a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
a belt and even if you're not using a
belt<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> best<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> breathe<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
belt this is the best way to breathe in

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.520 
belt this is the best way to breathe in
in<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.250> opinion<00:01:20.810> if<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.960> were<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> breathe<00:01:22.380> in

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
in my opinion if you were to breathe in

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
in my opinion if you were to breathe in
with<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> big<00:01:23.009> mouth<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:24.229> promotes

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
with a big mouth like that promotes

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
with a big mouth like that promotes
diaphragmatic<00:01:25.710> breathing<00:01:26.189> however<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> also

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
diaphragmatic breathing however it also

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
diaphragmatic breathing however it also
promotes<00:01:27.479> chest<00:01:27.930> breathing<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.950> feel<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
promotes chest breathing so you feel a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
promotes chest breathing so you feel a
lot<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.729> air<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.659> down<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:30.990> which

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
lot of air up here and down here which

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.950 
lot of air up here and down here which
is<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:32.180> optimal<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.360> regards<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
is not very optimal in regards to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.350 
is not very optimal in regards to
keeping<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:35.009> core<00:01:35.220> tight<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> say

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
keeping your core tight and when I say

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
keeping your core tight and when I say
core<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> mean<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.200> abs<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:37.829> lower<00:01:37.979> back

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
core I mean your abs and your lower back

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.499 
core I mean your abs and your lower back
just<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.420> entire<00:01:39.810> cavity<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.710> um

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
just this entire cavity right here um

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.880 
just this entire cavity right here um
breathing<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.630> through<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:42.990> nose<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.439> okay

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
breathing in through your nose is okay

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
breathing in through your nose is okay
because<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.880> does<00:01:45.060> promote<00:01:45.299> diaphragmatic

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
because it does promote diaphragmatic

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.380 
because it does promote diaphragmatic
breathing<00:01:46.369> however<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> can't<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.240> much

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
breathing however you can't get as much

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.690 
breathing however you can't get as much
air<00:01:48.659> into<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:48.960> body<00:01:49.259> when<00:01:50.220> compared<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
air into your body when compared to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.020 
air into your body when compared to
breathing<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
breathing like like that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.700 
breathing like like that
um<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.960> when<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.170> said<00:01:54.350> breathing<00:01:54.590> through

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
um and when I said breathing through

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.580 
um and when I said breathing through
your<00:01:54.740> nose<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.010> mean<00:01:55.100> like<00:01:56.200> like<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.409> doesn't

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
your nose I mean like like that doesn't

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.870 
your nose I mean like like that doesn't
really<00:01:57.740> promote<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.220> much<00:01:58.340> chest<00:01:58.640> breathing

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
really promote that much chest breathing

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.030 
really promote that much chest breathing
but<00:01:59.720> you<00:01:59.869> can't<00:02:00.170> get<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.409> much<00:02:00.590> Aaron<00:02:00.979> to

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
but you can't get that much Aaron to

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.510 
but you can't get that much Aaron to
your<00:02:01.159> body<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.700> quickly<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.409> i<00:02:03.740> would<00:02:04.400> say

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
your body that quickly so i would say

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.249 
your body that quickly so i would say
that's<00:02:04.729> like<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.000> second<00:02:05.390> best<00:02:05.659> way<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.930> do<00:02:06.140> it

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
that's like the second best way to do it

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.719 
that's like the second best way to do it
but<00:02:08.050> that's<00:02:09.050> by<00:02:09.440> far<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.920> best<00:02:10.130> way<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.369> do<00:02:10.580> it

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
but that's by far the best way to do it

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.370 
but that's by far the best way to do it
and<00:02:10.910> if<00:02:11.360> you're<00:02:11.480> not<00:02:11.600> bringing<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:12.050> at<00:02:12.230> all

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
and if you're not bringing in at all

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.490 
and if you're not bringing in at all
then<00:02:12.890> you're<00:02:13.280> just<00:02:13.310> screwing<00:02:13.819> yourself<00:02:13.910> over

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
then you're just screwing yourself over

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.780 
then you're just screwing yourself over
just<00:02:15.500> want<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.250> throw<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.550> out<00:02:16.610> there

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
just want to throw that out there

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.660 
just want to throw that out there

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
because i was talking to Scott about

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.420 
because i was talking to Scott about
creating<00:02:19.670> intra-abdominal<00:02:20.000> pressure<00:02:21.430> you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430
