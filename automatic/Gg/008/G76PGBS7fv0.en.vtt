00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.850 
your template in this case here now this
is<00:05:50.729> just<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:51.060> scribe<00:05:51.419> but<00:05:51.840> you<00:05:52.110> know<00:05:52.199> a<00:05:52.380> pen<00:05:52.650> or<00:05:52.830> a

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
is just a scribe but you know a pen or a

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.800 
is just a scribe but you know a pen or a
pencil<00:05:52.889> would<00:05:53.430> probably<00:05:54.120> actually<00:05:54.330> work

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
pencil would probably actually work

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.490 
pencil would probably actually work
better<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:56.910> I'm<00:05:57.000> just<00:05:57.210> gonna<00:05:57.330> go<00:05:57.630> over<00:05:57.690> the

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
better so I'm just gonna go over the

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.150 
better so I'm just gonna go over the
outside<00:05:58.680> line<00:05:59.370> yeah<00:06:00.440> is<00:06:01.440> that<00:06:01.650> something<00:06:01.860> I'm

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
outside line yeah is that something I'm

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:10.810 
outside line yeah is that something I'm
making<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.669> window<00:06:03.150> so<00:06:08.270> on<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.449> inside<00:06:09.660> of

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
making the window so on the inside of

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.920 
making the window so on the inside of
the<00:06:11.820> window<00:06:13.460> that's<00:06:14.460> ultimately<00:06:15.210> how<00:06:15.510> big<00:06:15.810> the

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
the window that's ultimately how big the

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:33.550 
the window that's ultimately how big the
hole

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.980 

I'll<00:06:34.560> put<00:06:34.830> that<00:06:34.980> out<00:06:35.160> and<00:06:36.090> I<00:06:36.240> want<00:06:36.480> that<00:06:36.690> a<00:06:36.720> gap

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
I'll put that out and I want that a gap

00:06:36.990 --> 00:07:49.520 
I'll put that out and I want that a gap
in<00:06:37.199> between<00:06:37.320> and<00:06:37.949> it'll<00:07:16.280> be<00:07:17.280> two<00:07:17.550> windows<00:07:48.530> to

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.530 
in between and it'll be two windows to

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.650 
in between and it'll be two windows to
just<00:07:50.250> kind<00:07:50.460> of<00:07:50.490> leave<00:07:50.610> an<00:07:50.760> impression

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 
just kind of leave an impression

00:07:51.660 --> 00:08:13.639 
just kind of leave an impression
get<00:07:51.870> it<00:07:51.960> where<00:07:52.110> I<00:07:52.139> want<00:07:52.470> it<00:07:52.560> to<00:07:52.620> be

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:13.649 

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:17.610
