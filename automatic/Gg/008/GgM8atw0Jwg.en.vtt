00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.900
 Y 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.620
 days and welcome back to nine 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.740
 words today I bring you the purpose of the month 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.349
 of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.269
 July and the month of August so the two 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.670
 Together to finally get to the day 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.849
 total I think there are about 13 books 6 of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.710
 July and August 7 so let's go there 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.689
 the first book I read in July was if 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.700
 I could go back from Marc Levy is a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.500
 very entertaining story that good follows 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.240
 much that with the dynamics that follows 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.489
 the author for what little he has read of him 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.739
 and that is that they create very everyday stories 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.690
 very realistic but who has asked 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.059
 that supernatural that what in a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 valuable moral to teach us and good 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.480
 It was entertaining but a little more than 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.280
 We all left the review in the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.140
 information box between two worlds 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 from Jennifer to the good is the second part 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760
 of the saga the destination cards that 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 it's like the one called here the editorial of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.530
 alfaguara and bueno is a book that has 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.089
 liked but a rare feeling with 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.799
 him and this while he was reading 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.379
 completely lost and I was like that 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.699
 I was reading something foreign to what was 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.040
 read in the first book but it's good 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 true that towards the last third of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.240
 I enjoyed it a lot and I liked it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.100
 well three quite the third book that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.140
 I read in July was the beast daily screen 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.190
 It's a very cool book, very refreshing 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.410
 that reads nothing 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.850
 it's a beautiful retail and the time the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.350
 truth is that it surprised me for good 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 liked it a lot as it was raised and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.480
 although they do not have so I do not know a value 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.400
 literary very important since I 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.870
 Entertained and I did not have a good time 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.760
 reading this book and that's why it has a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.470
 score in quotes high to what 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.420
 better some will say 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 but I am a book that I enjoy 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.140
 liked and that Christ tell you I put the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.120
 scores is sure that I find a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.800
 book the next book I read was the 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.510
 happy world of Galician work is a 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.080
 book that I really wanted to read 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.790
 I have been reading for quite some time 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.280
 that I loved it has nothing is very 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.770
 simple but I liked it a lot I liked it 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.840
 much the ambience the theme that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.400
 raises how it looks about in the end it's not 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.030
 a reading that has made me enjoy 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.140
 a lot and it has made me well 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.070
 find that although laura gallego 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.070
 I was living 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.160
 but good under the eternal night is the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.200
 second part of the saga under the sun 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.880
 eternal of veronica rossi had many 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.069
 I want to read this book because first 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.750
 I liked it a lot I liked it so much 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.250
 the Italian approach is a pleasure not 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.330
 I liked it even more there is a 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.480
 very important evolution of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.160
 characters the love relationship and I think 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.170
 which is the best I've seen in the 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.220
 juvenile literature and I love myself 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.450
 they love Rick Perry are great 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.010
 and nothing the truth is that I am wishing 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.530
 read the third and last part that I think 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.030
 that until 2015 is not published in Spain and 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.400
 the last book I read in July was 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.920
 catches the moon of essen room is a 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.510
 very simple story that good has 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.160
 a pretty important moral that 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.840
 give me I liked it a lot 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.580
 Very refreshing very large reading 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.530
 come very sant room for those who the 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.730
 you know maybe it 's true that I'm missing 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.830
 a little development of some 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.120
 secondary characters is a reading 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.400
 which I recommend a lot if you want something 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.410
 so light to spend time or 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.330
 to rest from more complex readings 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.980
 we put now with the books that I read 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.959
 in August the first of the books that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.230
 I read it was part number 7 of the inah blau 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.780
 it's a romantic novel that thanks 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.670
 I was quite pleasantly surprised 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.830
 It seemed very entertaining and I became attached 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.840
 a lot with the characters thank you they are 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.370
 the following book is not very adorable 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.799
 that today was the crystal sleeve 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.140
 one is the first part of a trilogy 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.510
 fantastic written by two authors 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.760
 Spanish that will also be published in 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.410
 October of this year the truth is that 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.840
 I really wanted to read it because 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.970
 It deals with aquatic beings about 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.349
 sirens and it's a subject of which there was no 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.269
 read nothing so I had a lot 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.430
 curiosity the problem is that the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.260
 main character the protagonist does not 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.209
 I liked it, it has not set me 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.459
 nothing seems to me a very 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.200
 incongruous although the premise about the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.060
 that sits the whole novel has 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.470
 seemed very interesting and that has made 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.379
 to enjoy a little more of his reading 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.750
 I also read the resistance that is the 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.340
 first book of the saga memories of 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.160
 idhún or good trilogy of memories of 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.750
 idhún of the galician hour garcia is good 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.180
 is that about saying that book that I 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.890
 I love and I really enjoyed living 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.049
 I'll tell you anyway 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.579
 carefully this trilogy when 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.500
 I touched the next book I read was 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.600
 guardian of the dragons is a book that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.610
 it left me angry I think I already like it 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.020
 in a loop and the truth is that it has 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.250
 liked it very much it is true that 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.170
 develops a little slow but the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.989
 protagonist is a charm is a girl 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.819
 small and I thought 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.319
 I loved another one of the things that most 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:28.009
 like this book was the setting 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.840
 since the whole story unfolds in 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.280
 China and the truth is that I really liked 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.259
 that point of the book and I'm looking forward 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.580
 continue with the continuations because it is 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.080
 the first part of a trilogy the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.720
 next book is that man and bone 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.229
 of the eibar had is an introductory tad 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.630
 I believe in some points but it has not 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.370
 I know I do not know what I know what I like 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.340
 I like very much especially the subject of 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.660
 the crystals that are like straight lines I do not know 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.310
 how to call it they have different 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.470
 powers and the truth is that it is very 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.030
 interesting also there are some turns that do not 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.599
 I was expecting for nothing they surprised me 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.190
 very pleasantly that everything with such a final 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.900
 I need the second the penultimate of the 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.880
 The books I read in August was grapefruit and 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.680
 lemon a story that had many 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.800
 desire to read and how is a finite book 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.870
 and it seems and it seemed like very light 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.060
 so I decided to read it in summer now 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.800
 truth is that I liked not me 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.580
 I would dare to say more than I put it 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.949
 tasty whatsapp 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.240
 I do not know it's a very simple story but 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.800
 very tender and I have enjoyed a lot 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.690
 is that all of them are so tender 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.910
 characters and everything that happens louis 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.699
 I love the last book I've read in 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.319

 has liked a lot of results 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.610
 Lagrimilla is a very simple story 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.210
 but pretty pretty I have many 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.580
 eager to see the adaptation 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.900
