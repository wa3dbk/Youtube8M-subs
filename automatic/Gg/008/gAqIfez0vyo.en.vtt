Terra Cotta the split single crochet

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.080 
Terra Cotta the split single crochet
stitch<00:00:35.060> is<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.480> variation<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:37.190> traditional

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
single crochet stitch but instead it

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.160 
single crochet stitch but instead it
creates<00:00:41.690> a<00:00:42.460> knit<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.760> fabric<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:44.630> is<00:00:44.810> very

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
creates a knit like fabric that is very

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.710 
creates a knit like fabric that is very
dense<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.090> is<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.150> really<00:00:47.960> great<00:00:48.380> stitch<00:00:48.950> for

washcloths<00:00:50.720> or<00:00:51.140> fabric<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.100> want<00:00:52.310> to<00:00:52.430> be

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
washcloths or fabric that you want to be

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.770 
washcloths or fabric that you want to be
really<00:00:53.810> really<00:00:53.840> durable<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:55.400> it<00:00:55.820> has<00:00:56.570> these

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
really really durable but it has these

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.650 
really really durable but it has these
little<00:00:56.840> V's<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:57.980> are<00:00:58.100> kind<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.660> alternating

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
little V's that are kind of alternating

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.040 
little V's that are kind of alternating
that<00:01:00.440> look<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.739> lot<00:01:01.010> like<00:01:01.280> knitted<00:01:01.790> fabric<00:01:02.300> so

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.920 
that look a lot like knitted fabric so
it's<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.590> it's<00:01:04.159> a<00:01:04.339> very<00:01:04.579> clean<00:01:04.939> looking<00:01:05.390> fabric

compared<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.560> normal<00:01:06.800> single<00:01:07.640> crochet

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
compared to the normal single crochet

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.649 
compared to the normal single crochet
fabric<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.320> here's<00:01:09.500> how<00:01:09.620> we<00:01:09.740> do<00:01:09.860> it

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
fabric so here's how we do it

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.240 
fabric so here's how we do it
step<00:01:11.659> one<00:01:11.900> we're<00:01:12.080> going<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.320> take<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.860> tip<00:01:13.070> of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
step one we're going to take the tip of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.590 
step one we're going to take the tip of
our<00:01:13.370> crochet<00:01:13.640> hook<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.240> we're<00:01:14.360> going<00:01:14.540> to

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
our crochet hook and we're going to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.289 
our crochet hook and we're going to
insert<00:01:15.050> it<00:01:15.320> in<00:01:15.770> between<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.590> two<00:01:18.590> stitches

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
insert it in between the two stitches

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.500 
insert it in between the two stitches
here<00:01:20.299> where<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:20.720> little<00:01:21.049> V<00:01:21.290> is<00:01:21.760> so<00:01:22.760> instead

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
here where this little V is so instead

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.610 
here where this little V is so instead
of<00:01:23.659> going<00:01:24.020> into<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:25.100> pocket<00:01:25.690> underneath<00:01:26.690> the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
of going into the pocket underneath the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.350 
of going into the pocket underneath the
stitch<00:01:27.890> like<00:01:28.130> this<00:01:28.370> like<00:01:28.580> we<00:01:28.729> normally<00:01:28.909> would

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
stitch like this like we normally would

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.910 
stitch like this like we normally would
for<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.690> single<00:01:29.990> crochet<00:01:30.290> we're<00:01:30.500> going<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:30.740> go

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
for the single crochet we're going to go

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.210 
for the single crochet we're going to go
into<00:01:31.760> this<00:01:32.570> little<00:01:32.810> V<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:33.350> upside-down<00:01:33.740> V

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
into this little V this upside-down V

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.460 
into this little V this upside-down V
and<00:01:34.790> we're<00:01:34.909> going<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.119> push<00:01:36.080> right<00:01:36.380> through

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
and we're going to push right through

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.160 
and we're going to push right through
now<00:01:37.070> this<00:01:37.640> can<00:01:37.820> be<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.030> little<00:01:38.570> bit<00:01:38.900> difficult

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
now this can be a little bit difficult

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.340 
now this can be a little bit difficult
because<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:40.600> stitch<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.750> going<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.960> be<00:01:42.110> more

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
because that stitch is going to be more

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.609 
because that stitch is going to be more
tight<00:01:42.680> than<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:44.510> other<00:01:44.750> stitches<00:01:44.960> normally

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
tight than the other stitches normally

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.250 
tight than the other stitches normally
would<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.450> also<00:01:47.630> want<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.900> make<00:01:48.080> sure

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
would and you also want to make sure

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.460 
would and you also want to make sure
that<00:01:48.560> you're<00:01:48.710> coming<00:01:49.159> through<00:01:49.210> in<00:01:50.470> between

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
that you're coming through in between

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.149 
that you're coming through in between
the<00:01:52.130> V<00:01:52.430> as<00:01:52.780> well<00:01:53.780> it's<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.650> little<00:01:54.860> bit<00:01:54.950> hard<00:01:55.100> to

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
the V as well it's a little bit hard to

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.820 
the V as well it's a little bit hard to
see<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:55.729> if<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.750> don't<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.229> can<00:01:57.350> kind<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.680> mess

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
see but if you don't it can kind of mess

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.660 
see but if you don't it can kind of mess
up<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.490> way<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.790> pattern<00:01:59.180> looks<00:02:00.400> okay<00:02:01.400> step

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
up the way the pattern looks okay step

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.920 
up the way the pattern looks okay step
two<00:02:01.880> we're<00:02:02.150> just<00:02:02.270> going<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.420> wrap<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.900> yarn

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
two we're just going to wrap the yarn

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.570 
two we're just going to wrap the yarn
over<00:02:03.520> our<00:02:04.520> hook<00:02:04.790> like<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.390> normally<00:02:05.540> would

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
over our hook like we normally would

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.889 
over our hook like we normally would
step<00:02:07.580> three<00:02:07.880> we're<00:02:08.030> going<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.269> pull<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.869> yarn

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
step three we're going to pull the yarn

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.390 
step three we're going to pull the yarn
through<00:02:10.749> that<00:02:11.749> little<00:02:12.079> V<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.590> now<00:02:13.279> we're

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
through that little V and now we're

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.620 
through that little V and now we're
going<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.579> have<00:02:13.700> two<00:02:14.060> loops

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
going to have two loops

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.130 
going to have two loops
on<00:02:14.690> our<00:02:15.350> hook<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.940> step<00:02:17.150> four<00:02:17.390> will<00:02:17.570> yarn<00:02:17.840> over

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
on our hook so step four will yarn over

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.670 
on our hook so step four will yarn over
again<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.600> step<00:02:20.600> five<00:02:20.840> will<00:02:21.110> pull<00:02:21.380> through

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
again and step five will pull through

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.250 
again and step five will pull through
both<00:02:22.040> loops<00:02:22.460> on<00:02:23.030> our<00:02:23.090> hook<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.050> will

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
both loops on our hook and that will

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.380 
both loops on our hook and that will
leave<00:02:24.470> us<00:02:24.650> with<00:02:24.770> one<00:02:25.100> hook<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.550> that's<00:02:26.120> how<00:02:26.330> we

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
leave us with one hook and that's how we

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.170 
leave us with one hook and that's how we
do<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.590> split<00:02:28.310> single<00:02:28.460> crochet<00:02:28.880> let's<00:02:29.090> do

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180
