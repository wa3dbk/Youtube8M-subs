 We rub carrots on a large grater. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.400
 In a preheated pot pour 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable oil. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.733
 Fry lightly onions with carrots. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.400
 Do all this on medium heat, stirring occasionally. 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.200
 Cooking onion transparency. 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.700
 Carrots with onions are almost ready. 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.214
 Let them stand a little, and I will cut the potatoes.

 Add the peas. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.535

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:05.895
 Now sold some peas, which is quickly boiled soft. 

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:09.100
 Besides, I will cook under a pressure cooker. 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.500
 So the soup is cooked much faster. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.700
 Adding ribs. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.900
 Add bay leaf and sweet peas. 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.174
 All this is poured either broth or water. 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.593
 Pour no higher than these marks on the pan if cooked under a pressure cooker lid. 

00:02:45.593 --> 00:02:49.642
 Above - it is impossible, only up to the first bar. 

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:52.894

 We are closing. 

00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:08.848
 We put on the biggest fire and wait for the pressure indicator to appear. 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.054
 There is a pressure indicator. Reduce the fire to the minimum. 

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:18.168
 We continue to cook for another 15 minutes. 

00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:23.500
 We are looking for the thermo controller not to go beyond the green sector. 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.014
 It took 15 minutes. You can turn off the heat. 

00:03:28.014 --> 00:03:33.200
 We are waiting for the pressure indicator to go down so that the lid can be opened. 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.815
 Pea soup is ready. 

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.474
 Open the lid. 

00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:42.449
 We remove it to the side. 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:47.515
 Peas boiled well, the potatoes did not boil soft. 

00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:50.600
 Everything is in excellent condition.
