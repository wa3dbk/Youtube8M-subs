00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.850 
the second ones stabilized in there I'm
gonna<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.150> ahead<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.540> pull<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.680> that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
gonna go ahead and pull just like that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.039 
gonna go ahead and pull just like that
so<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.579> practice<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.150> move<00:01:36.360> start<00:01:36.930> by

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so you can practice this move start by

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.480 
so you can practice this move start by
just<00:01:37.229> stalling<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> back<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.310> hand

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
just stalling one in the back your hand

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.240 
just stalling one in the back your hand
get<00:01:39.090> comfortable<00:01:39.560> ideally<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.619> doing<00:01:41.040> one

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
get comfortable ideally just doing one

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
get comfortable ideally just doing one
flip<00:01:41.579> maybe<00:01:42.119> two<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.540> most

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
flip maybe two at most

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.139 
flip maybe two at most
and<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> can't<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> dead<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:44.939> because

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and you can't do a dead one because

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.370 
and you can't do a dead one because
there's<00:01:45.299> gonna<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.689> sitting<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.110> top<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
there's gonna be one sitting on top of

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
there's gonna be one sitting on top of
there<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.649> there's<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.159> no<00:01:47.340> need<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.729> get

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
there and there's really no need to get

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.300 
there and there's really no need to get
a<00:01:48.090> bunch<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.659> spins<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.890> one<00:01:50.070> good

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
a bunch of spins to it just get one good

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.020 
a bunch of spins to it just get one good
flip<00:01:51.140> one<00:01:52.140> more<00:01:52.320> than<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:53.579> good<00:01:53.790> flip

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
flip one more than that one good flip

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.600 
flip one more than that one good flip
out<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.720> catch<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:54.990> from<00:01:55.110> behind

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610
