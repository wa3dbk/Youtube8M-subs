whatever but it I hate using conditioner
because<00:01:36.859> it<00:01:37.219> always<00:01:37.459> always<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.509> flattens

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
because it always always just flattens

my<00:01:39.529> hair<00:01:39.889> down<00:01:40.099> and<00:01:40.459> if<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:41.090> don't<00:01:41.329> use<00:01:41.539> it<00:01:41.779> then

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
my hair down and if I don't use it then

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:47.949 
my hair down and if I don't use it then
it<00:01:44.029> gets<00:01:44.439> really<00:01:45.439> really<00:01:45.649> dry<00:01:46.069> so<00:01:46.459> I<00:01:46.959> thought

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
it gets really really dry so I thought

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.059
