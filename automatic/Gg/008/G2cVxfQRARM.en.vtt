00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
but looks complicated then we get into

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.799

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
clay this is called mikuni kanay it's

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
clay this is called mikuni kanay it's
from<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.170> ancient<00:01:01.350> Japanese<00:01:01.649> technique<00:01:02.579> where

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
from an ancient Japanese technique where

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
from an ancient Japanese technique where

they used to shave metals and put them

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
they used to shave metals and put them
together<00:01:04.500> into<00:01:04.799> different<00:01:05.159> shapes<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:06.119> now

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
together into different shapes we now

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.780 
together into different shapes we now
use<00:01:06.479> polymer<00:01:06.900> clay<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.439> some<00:01:07.740> 22<00:01:08.460> karat<00:01:08.760> gold

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
use polymer clay with some 22 karat gold

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.690 
use polymer clay with some 22 karat gold
mixed<00:01:09.240> into<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.680> end<00:01:10.860> result<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.369> very

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
mixed into it and the end result is very

that around all i have to do i'm going

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.340 
that around all i have to do i'm going
to<00:03:20.170> switch<00:03:20.290> again<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.880> can<00:03:21.940> see<00:03:22.360> i<00:03:22.570> have<00:03:23.110> a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
to switch again so you can see i have a

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.900 
to switch again so you can see i have a
thinner<00:03:23.709> piece<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:24.070> wire<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.550> put<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:24.880> the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
back to hold it tight and then I just

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.490 
back to hold it tight and then I just
open<00:03:29.800> it<00:03:29.860> up<00:03:30.300> that's<00:03:31.300> it

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
open it up that's it

class you need to know a little bit
about<00:03:39.850> wire<00:03:40.060> work<00:03:40.710> okay<00:03:41.710> then<00:03:42.580> i'm<00:03:42.670> going<00:03:42.760> to

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
about wire work okay then i'm going to

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.630 
about wire work okay then i'm going to
show<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.030> how<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.300> do<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:44.310> kumihimo<00:03:45.310> disk

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
show you how to do the kumihimo disk

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.120 
show you how to do the kumihimo disk
this<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:46.630> an<00:03:46.750> ancient<00:03:46.960> Japanese<00:03:47.200> technique

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
this is an ancient Japanese technique

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.940 
this is an ancient Japanese technique
and<00:03:48.430> we<00:03:49.300> do<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.600> with<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> lot<00:03:49.990> of<00:03:50.020> modern<00:03:50.470> fibers

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
and we do it with a lot of modern fibers

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.130 
and we do it with a lot of modern fibers
that<00:03:51.100> they<00:03:51.250> wouldn't<00:03:51.430> have<00:03:51.550> used<00:03:51.730> back<00:03:52.060> then

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
that they wouldn't have used back then

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.170 
that they wouldn't have used back then
we<00:03:53.140> have<00:03:53.350> this<00:03:53.560> disk<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.070> has<00:03:54.190> north<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:54.850> south

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
we have this disk it has north and south

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.449 
we have this disk it has north and south
and<00:03:55.420> east<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.780> west<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.170> it<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.500> we<00:03:57.100> start<00:03:57.370> out

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
and east and west on it and we start out

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.360 
and east and west on it and we start out
with<00:03:57.550> eight<00:03:57.790> strands<00:03:58.270> and<00:03:58.770> you<00:03:59.770> just<00:03:59.950> put<00:04:00.160> them

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
with eight strands and you just put them

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.830 
with eight strands and you just put them
into<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.850> disc<00:04:02.970> I'll<00:04:03.970> do<00:04:04.209> this<00:04:04.330> real<00:04:04.600> quickly

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
into the disc I'll do this real quickly

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.090 
into the disc I'll do this real quickly
so<00:04:05.380> they're<00:04:05.500> probably<00:04:05.530> going<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.920> be<00:04:05.980> all

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
so they're probably going to be all

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.420 
so they're probably going to be all
crooked<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:08.050> won't<00:04:08.350> take<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.100> time<00:04:09.130> to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
crooked and I won't take the time to

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.130 
crooked and I won't take the time to
show<00:04:09.580> you<00:04:09.640> how<00:04:09.940> long<00:04:10.239> because<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.690> takes<00:04:10.840> quite

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
show you how long because it takes quite

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.990 
show you how long because it takes quite
a<00:04:11.200> while<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.440> get<00:04:12.190> anything<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.790> get<00:04:12.880> the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
especially to do a long one like this so

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.460 
especially to do a long one like this so
here's<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.700> sample<00:05:13.120> of<00:05:13.240> what<00:05:13.450> this<00:05:13.870> particular
