00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.810
 Hey Tokyo 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.660
 It is a place in the middle of a lot of apartments 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.750
 It is a big sound window glass 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.210
 Somehow I can see a little luggage 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.949
 Here is a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.860
 If you put the film, I can not see the relationship at all, so by all means 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.860
 Good difference before and after construction 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.740
 Completely clear 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.980
 Take them 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.150
 Is it important? 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.630
 Upper front and the other 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.630
 Yes 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.400
 Because the color is darkest by this 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.080
 It Could you see from the last outside in paint 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.800
 I do say has become like a mirror 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.800
 I do not feel 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 And Tsu not a curtain 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.920
 Oh yeah Is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.250
 Is it nice to not have to buy the future also do it the curtain many Tteyuu best selling 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.250
 Really good 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 Well What Toka 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.810
 I think the room will be bright as you said 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.170
 But I do not Gawakan of being stuck on the whole, put would in more and more 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.460
 I and a little bright Who is I of about o'clock ne ne evening anymore 3 taking 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.460
 I'm in a room car 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.620
 Have a little electricity from that outside 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.550
 Maybe he looks like 3 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.550
 I think it has become 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.610
 I have turned off the electric now because not compared 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.610
 I put everything but 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.720
 I'll look at it from the outside but maybe it looks like a mirror 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.720
 eh 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.590
 From Sato 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.590
 It looks like a mirror 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.000
 I can hardly see this 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.240
 It is here not One connected have 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.720
 can enter 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.720
 Yup 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.000
 I think from a certain reason 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.200
 Do you have a look 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.850
 Is it a name by all means ? 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.460
 But it is not seen as 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.250
 I This is a film of the mirror type 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.250
 A high car is fine if it is 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.270
 I knew 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.730
 Reese Tsubaki-kun 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.850
 So that only electrical each do light bulb not you a little look can be seen that it about actor 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.850
 The 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.470
 I agree 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.760
 Yes 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.400
 I usually have a garden like this 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.739
 I can see that 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.739
 Really I think you know the sense that I do not need a curtain of race 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.760
 Do you look at it from the outside a little 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.290
 Hmm 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:55.069
 It has reflected it different views of the earlier witch 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.990
 It's almost impossible to see Nakane 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:02.780
 I am grateful to 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:06.520
