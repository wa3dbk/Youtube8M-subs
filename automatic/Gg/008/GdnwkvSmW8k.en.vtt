00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.580 
millimeter it's a hit tab the bend
allowance<00:01:35.060> will<00:01:35.210> be<00:01:35.300> calculated<00:01:36.050> based<00:01:36.260> on

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
allowance will be calculated based on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.060 
allowance will be calculated based on
the<00:01:36.800> k-factor<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:38.650> 0.5<00:01:40.990> now<00:01:41.990> let's<00:01:42.650> apply<00:01:42.800> the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
the k-factor of 0.5 now let's apply the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.070 
the k-factor of 0.5 now let's apply the
formula<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:43.910> learned<00:01:44.210> in<00:01:44.510> our<00:01:44.690> previous

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
formula we learned in our previous

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.210 
formula we learned in our previous
lesson<00:01:46.930> let's<00:01:47.930> review<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.500> formula<00:01:49.040> again

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
lesson let's review this formula again

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.600 
lesson let's review this formula again
bend<00:01:50.090> allowance<00:01:50.630> or<00:01:50.810> be<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.580> equals<00:01:52.750> 2pi<00:01:54.220> x<00:01:55.220> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.650 
bend allowance or be a equals 2pi x the
bend<00:01:56.030> angle<00:01:56.980> which<00:01:57.980> in<00:01:58.250> our<00:01:58.550> case<00:01:58.610> as<00:01:59.300> you<00:01:59.450> see

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
bend angle which in our case as you see

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.260 
bend angle which in our case as you see
here<00:01:59.900> is<00:01:59.990> 90<00:02:00.410> degrees<00:02:03.250> multiplied<00:02:04.250> by<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.820> sum

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
here is 90 degrees multiplied by the sum

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.710 
here is 90 degrees multiplied by the sum
of<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:06.020> bend<00:02:06.260> radius<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:08.060> inside<00:02:08.480> radius

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
of the bend radius the inside radius

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.949 
of the bend radius the inside radius
here<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.440> see<00:02:10.900> plus<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.170> k-factor<00:02:13.900> x<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
here you see plus the k-factor x the

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.190 
here you see plus the k-factor x the
