so on the subject of malfunctions or of

so on the subject of malfunctions or of
hard<00:00:15.740> day<00:00:15.950> we<00:00:16.880> haven't<00:00:17.330> talked<00:00:17.630> much<00:00:17.840> about

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
hard day we haven't talked much about

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.170 
hard day we haven't talked much about
malfunctions<00:00:18.800> above<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.430> hard<00:00:19.640> deck<00:00:19.849> and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
malfunctions above the hard deck and

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.060 
malfunctions above the hard deck and
those<00:00:20.779> are<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:20.990> more<00:00:21.110> common<00:00:21.170> situations

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
those are the more common situations

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.769 
those are the more common situations
that<00:00:22.250> we<00:00:22.400> that<00:00:22.640> we<00:00:22.670> all<00:00:22.910> encounter<00:00:23.240> from<00:00:23.570> time

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
that we that we all encounter from time

that we that we all encounter from time
to<00:00:23.930> time<00:00:25.420> and<00:00:26.420> I<00:00:26.570> think<00:00:26.630> it's<00:00:26.869> just<00:00:27.020> important

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
to time and I think it's just important

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.550 
to time and I think it's just important
or<00:00:27.739> it's<00:00:27.860> imperative<00:00:28.250> that<00:00:28.369> we<00:00:28.520> do<00:00:29.410> that<00:00:30.410> we

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
or it's imperative that we do that we

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.440 
or it's imperative that we do that we
agree<00:00:30.890> or<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:31.189> we<00:00:31.279> all<00:00:31.460> decide<00:00:32.419> to<00:00:34.450> improve

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
agree or that we all decide to improve

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.000 
agree or that we all decide to improve
the<00:00:35.600> outside<00:00:35.960> awareness<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:36.649> our<00:00:36.770> day-to-day

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
the outside awareness in our day-to-day

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.490 
the outside awareness in our day-to-day
jumping<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.600> more<00:00:38.809> current<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.350> more

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
jumping so the more current the more

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.500 
jumping so the more current the more
experience<00:00:39.920> we<00:00:40.070> get<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.460> easier<00:00:40.970> it<00:00:41.030> is<00:00:41.149> to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
experience we get the easier it is to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.029 
experience we get the easier it is to
start<00:00:42.140> thinking<00:00:42.440> I'm<00:00:42.559> not<00:00:42.710> gonna<00:00:42.829> have

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
start thinking I'm not gonna have

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.160 
start thinking I'm not gonna have

problems I'm not gonna have emergencies

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.349 
problems I'm not gonna have emergencies
and<00:00:45.410> just<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.190> become<00:00:46.309> complacent<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.300> think

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
and just to become complacent and think

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.900 
and just to become complacent and think
that<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:47.870> were<00:00:48.140> overqualified<00:00:48.769> or<00:00:49.550> that

that you were overqualified or that

that you were overqualified or that
we're<00:00:50.179> more<00:00:50.359> than<00:00:50.629> prepared<00:00:51.609> whatever<00:00:52.609> is

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
we're more than prepared whatever is

we're more than prepared whatever is

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
get away that you can get out of it then

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.170 
get away that you can get out of it then
it's<00:01:03.859> important<00:01:04.370> to<00:01:04.460> be<00:01:04.580> able<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:04.970> wherever

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
it's important to be able to wherever

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.700 
it's important to be able to wherever
we're<00:01:05.510> goggles<00:01:05.900> of<00:01:05.990> malfunction<00:01:06.560> it's

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
we're goggles of malfunction it's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.200 
we're goggles of malfunction it's
important<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.190> be<00:01:07.280> altitude<00:01:07.730> aware<00:01:07.940> so<00:01:08.120> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
important to be altitude aware so the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.970 
important to be altitude aware so the
first<00:01:08.600> thing<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:08.960> should<00:01:09.230> come<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.560> mind<00:01:09.770> if

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
first thing that should come to mind if

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.670 
first thing that should come to mind if
I<00:01:10.100> have<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.550> problem<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.900> check<00:01:12.140> my<00:01:12.320> altitude

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
I have a problem is to check my altitude

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.880 
I have a problem is to check my altitude
and<00:01:13.070> then<00:01:13.640> -<00:01:13.940> as<00:01:14.659> I'm<00:01:14.960> assessing<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.560> problem

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
and then - as I'm assessing the problem

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.910 
and then - as I'm assessing the problem
I'm<00:01:16.009> dealing<00:01:16.430> with<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.640> problem<00:01:17.060> to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
I'm dealing with the problem to

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.560 
I'm dealing with the problem to
repeatedly<00:01:18.920> check<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.430> altitude<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.210> to

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
repeatedly check the altitude and to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.200 
repeatedly check the altitude and to
somewhat<00:01:21.470> be<00:01:21.680> aware<00:01:21.950> with<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.729> speed<00:01:23.030> at

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
somewhat be aware with the speed at

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.330 
somewhat be aware with the speed at
which<00:01:23.240> I'm<00:01:23.570> descending<00:01:24.079> so<00:01:24.710> in<00:01:24.890> summary<00:01:25.250> I

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
which I'm descending so in summary I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.539 
which I'm descending so in summary I
guess<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:25.850> easier<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.240> say<00:01:26.479> that<00:01:27.310> if<00:01:28.310> we

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
guess it's just easier to say that if we

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.219 
guess it's just easier to say that if we
have<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.729> malfunction<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.780> above<00:01:29.990> our

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
have a malfunction of above our

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.160 
have a malfunction of above our
hard-deck<00:01:30.649> altitude<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:32.479> obvious<00:01:32.930> that

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
hard-deck altitude and it's obvious that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.499 
hard-deck altitude and it's obvious that
I<00:01:33.500> can<00:01:33.710> deal<00:01:33.920> with<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.250> it's<00:01:34.430> just<00:01:34.549> a<00:01:35.060> blind

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
I can deal with it it's just a blind

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.539 
I can deal with it it's just a blind
twist<00:01:35.899> or<00:01:36.200> something<00:01:36.560> simple<00:01:36.860> that<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.520> I

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
twist or something simple that I that I

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.380 
twist or something simple that I that I
believe<00:01:37.909> I<00:01:37.939> can<00:01:38.210> get<00:01:38.329> out<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:39.939> then<00:01:40.939> the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
believe I can get out of then the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.359 
believe I can get out of then the
altitude<00:01:41.780> awareness<00:01:42.170> will<00:01:42.380> allow<00:01:42.619> me<00:01:42.829> or<00:01:43.100> give

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
altitude awareness will allow me or give

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.749 
altitude awareness will allow me or give
me<00:01:43.549> that<00:01:43.700> time<00:01:44.030> afford<00:01:44.659> me<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.930> time<00:01:45.549> but<00:01:46.549> if

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
me that time afford me that time but if

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.999 
me that time afford me that time but if
it's<00:01:46.969> something<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.390> can't<00:01:47.689> deal<00:01:47.960> with<00:01:47.990> if<00:01:48.770> I

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
it's something I can't deal with if I

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.490 
it's something I can't deal with if I
know<00:01:49.100> it's<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.520> bad<00:01:50.210> luck<00:01:50.539> or<00:01:50.810> that's<00:01:51.079> something

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
know it's a bad luck or that's something

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.520 
know it's a bad luck or that's something
that<00:01:52.009> I'm<00:01:52.130> not<00:01:52.310> going<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.520> be<00:01:52.640> able<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.850> fix

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
that I'm not going to be able to fix

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.469 
that I'm not going to be able to fix
then<00:01:54.530> get<00:01:55.130> rid<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:55.729> allow<00:01:56.119> yourself

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
then get rid of it and allow yourself

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.870 
then get rid of it and allow yourself
extra<00:01:56.689> time<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.439> hard<00:01:57.649> deck<00:01:57.859> isn't<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.430> need

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
extra time so the hard deck isn't I need

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.789 
extra time so the hard deck isn't I need
to<00:01:59.090> fight<00:01:59.359> this<00:01:59.539> no<00:01:59.719> matter<00:01:59.960> what<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.409> until

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
to fight this no matter what it is until

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.889 
to fight this no matter what it is until
I<00:02:00.859> get<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.340> hard<00:02:01.549> deck<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.390> that's

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
I get to the hard deck and that's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.899 
I get to the hard deck and that's
important<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.469> we<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:04.100> we<00:02:04.130> differentiate

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
important that we that we differentiate

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.639 
important that we that we differentiate
between<00:02:04.939> those<00:02:05.420> two<00:02:06.789> so<00:02:08.110> another<00:02:09.110> big<00:02:09.410> topic

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
between those two so another big topic

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.100 
between those two so another big topic
that<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.220> wanted<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.700> address<00:02:11.030> before<00:02:11.240> we<00:02:11.570> in

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
that I wanted to address before we in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
that I wanted to address before we in
this<00:02:12.470> interviews<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:14.300> topic<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.870> high<00:02:15.830> speed

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
this interviews the topic of high speed

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.290 
this interviews the topic of high speed
malfunctions<00:02:16.820> or

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
malfunctions or

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.030 
malfunctions or
malfunctions<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:21.200> how<00:02:21.710> that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
malfunctions and and and how that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.820 
malfunctions and and and how that
affects<00:02:22.610> our<00:02:22.910> altitude<00:02:23.510> awareness<00:02:24.020> because

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
affects our altitude awareness because

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.880 
affects our altitude awareness because
suddenly<00:02:25.280> as<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:26.060> all<00:02:26.210> know<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.720> our<00:02:27.020> our

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
suddenly as we all know that our our

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.160 
suddenly as we all know that our our
time<00:02:28.250> clock<00:02:28.580> changes<00:02:29.150> we're<00:02:29.600> passing<00:02:30.050> through

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
time clock changes we're passing through

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.220 
time clock changes we're passing through
altitude<00:02:30.710> much<00:02:30.920> quicker<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.750> point

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
altitude much quicker and so the point

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.710 
altitude much quicker and so the point
being<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.890> what<00:02:34.820> seems<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> matter

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
being that is what seems like a matter

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.420 
being that is what seems like a matter
of<00:02:35.810> seconds<00:02:36.410> I've<00:02:36.620> passed<00:02:37.160> through<00:02:37.400> a

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
of seconds I've passed through a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.760 
of seconds I've passed through a
thousand<00:02:37.880> feet<00:02:38.030> then<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:39.020> a<00:02:39.050> high-speed

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
thousand feet then I have a high-speed

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.410 
thousand feet then I have a high-speed
malfunction<00:02:40.340> with<00:02:40.490> me<00:02:40.640> which<00:02:40.910> means<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.300> have

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
malfunction with me which means I have

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.830 
malfunction with me which means I have
no<00:02:41.570> fabric<00:02:42.020> out<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.890> slow<00:02:43.190> me<00:02:43.370> down<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.630> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
no fabric out to slow me down so the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.510 
no fabric out to slow me down so the
next<00:02:45.050> thousand<00:02:45.500> feet<00:02:45.680> are<00:02:45.920> gonna<00:02:46.040> happen<00:02:46.280> in

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
next thousand feet are gonna happen in

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.240 
next thousand feet are gonna happen in
the<00:02:46.640> blink<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.940> an<00:02:47.090> eye<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.710> guess<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
the blink of an eye and and I guess the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.970 
the blink of an eye and and I guess the
the<00:02:49.550> end<00:02:49.850> summary<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.290> just<00:02:51.710> need<00:02:51.950> to

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
the end summary is that I just need to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.860 
the end summary is that I just need to
recognize<00:02:52.490> if<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.820> have<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.030> malfunction<00:02:53.270> a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
recognize if I have a malfunction a

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.170 
recognize if I have a malfunction a
high-speed<00:02:54.800> malfunction<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.550> need<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.880> deal

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
high-speed malfunction I need to deal

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.690 
high-speed malfunction I need to deal
with<00:02:56.450> my<00:02:56.630> options<00:02:57.410> immediately<00:02:57.980> not<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.430> don't

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
with my options immediately not I don't

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.030 
with my options immediately not I don't
have<00:02:58.820> time<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.180> assess<00:02:59.480> altitude<00:03:00.110> assess<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
have time to assess altitude assess the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.500 
have time to assess altitude assess the
situation<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.000> volley<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.480> back<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.020> forth

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
situation and volley that back and forth

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.090 
situation and volley that back and forth
so<00:03:05.510> we've<00:03:05.690> talked<00:03:05.930> now<00:03:06.200> about<00:03:06.230> malfunctions

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
so we've talked now about malfunctions

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.640 
so we've talked now about malfunctions
hard-deck<00:03:07.960> malfunctions<00:03:08.960> above<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.410> hard

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
hard-deck malfunctions above the hard

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.360 
hard-deck malfunctions above the hard
day<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.160> then<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:11.890> think<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.190> less

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
day and then the I think the less

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.030 
day and then the I think the less
attractive<00:03:14.410> situation<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.680> malfunction

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
attractive situation is the malfunction

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.320 
attractive situation is the malfunction
below<00:03:16.610> your<00:03:16.910> hard<00:03:17.150> day<00:03:18.580> because<00:03:19.580> it's<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.850> it's

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
below your hard day because it's a it's

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.690 
below your hard day because it's a it's
a<00:03:20.450> situation<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:21.110> obviously<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.920> scary<00:03:22.250> in

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
a situation that obviously is scary in

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.400 
a situation that obviously is scary in
my<00:03:22.730> mind<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.450> how<00:03:23.540> I've<00:03:23.660> always<00:03:23.810> treated<00:03:24.320> it

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
my mind and how I've always treated it

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.790 
my mind and how I've always treated it
for<00:03:25.010> 20<00:03:25.280> years<00:03:25.520> is<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:26.170> once<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.350> passed<00:03:27.590> my

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
for 20 years is that once I passed my

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.699 
for 20 years is that once I passed my
hard<00:03:28.010> day<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.790> can<00:03:29.480> no<00:03:29.630> longer<00:03:29.660> cut<00:03:30.140> away<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:30.410> my

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
hard day I can no longer cut away so my

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.830 
hard day I can no longer cut away so my
right<00:03:30.950> hand<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.700> no<00:03:31.970> longer<00:03:32.150> involved<00:03:32.510> in<00:03:32.750> the
