00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
stronger than most people are but it is

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.830 
stronger than most people are but it is
still<00:04:50.440> very<00:04:50.500> hurtful<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.640> you<00:04:52.360> could<00:04:52.600> just

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
still very hurtful to you you could just

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.830 
still very hurtful to you you could just
kind<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.260> become<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.890> mother<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.670> sorry<00:04:55.570> I<00:04:55.660> keep

saying<00:04:55.900> mother<00:04:56.350> you<00:04:56.980> can<00:04:57.100> replace<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.490> wood

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
saying mother you can replace the wood

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.920

mother<00:04:59.230> has<00:04:59.590> more<00:04:59.860> meaning<00:05:00.070> because<00:05:00.550> fathers

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
mother has more meaning because fathers

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.470 
mother has more meaning because fathers
are<00:05:01.510> not<00:05:01.690> as<00:05:01.900> reliable<00:05:02.490> but<00:05:03.490> anyway<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.120> could
