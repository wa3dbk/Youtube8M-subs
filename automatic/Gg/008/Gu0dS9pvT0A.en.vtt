00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.400
 deflection in front mounting angles 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.109
 wheels can cause 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.500
 unwanted lateral forces can cause 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.029
 be the front wheel camber angles 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.920
 when the front wheel camber is zero 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.660
 there are no unwanted lateral forces 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.679
 from another country all wheels are spinning 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.120
 right but when on one of the wheels 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.640
 there is a collapse for example 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 positive on the right wheel 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.940
 it makes it spin to the right if 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.489
 add to this negative camber 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.190
 left wheel, it turns out that both 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 the wheels will spin to the right causing 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 with the shear force of the car 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 right as a rule of action of lateral forces 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.239
 shifting the wheel to the side 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.039
 positive camber more than 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.170
 the actions of the forces lying in the direction 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.120
 negative collapse since in 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.719
 cornering more loaded external 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.090
 wheel 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.520
 We now turn to the examples of the car 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 pulling left the car will pull 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 right in this case also the car 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:23.250
 will pull left and in this right for 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.920
 camber change warning 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.829
 manufacturers indicate 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 defecation for each side if the angle 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.520
 cannot be set exactly for 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 each side should be kept within 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.560
 manufacturer's permit with the plot 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.689
 cross corner camber if 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.460
 cross corner camber is not available 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.820
 use the value 0 25 degrees in 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.259
 according to the rules of thumb in 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.509
 exceptional cases manufacturers 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.119
 indicate various preferred 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.720
 settings for each wheel in 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.720
 separately
