00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
success and I think a lot of people

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.720

large<00:00:39.350> numbers<00:00:39.910> even<00:00:40.910> internally<00:00:41.329> I<00:00:41.449> think

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
large numbers even internally I think

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.139 
large numbers even internally I think
it's<00:00:41.809> been<00:00:41.929> quite<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:42.230> surprise<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.280> what<00:00:44.089> do

and<00:04:28.220> leveraging<00:04:28.910> platforms<00:04:29.479> for<00:04:29.690> each<00:04:29.840> other

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
and leveraging platforms for each other

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.860 
and leveraging platforms for each other
so<00:04:30.830> we<00:04:31.340> would<00:04:31.460> definitely<00:04:32.000> want<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.360> see<00:04:32.539> an

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
so we would definitely want to see an

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.189 
so we would definitely want to see an
effect<00:04:33.020> coming<00:04:33.530> in<00:04:33.650> our<00:04:33.800> complete<00:04:34.340> portfolio

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
effect coming in our complete portfolio

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.659 
effect coming in our complete portfolio
by<00:04:36.199> leveraging<00:04:36.470> things<00:04:36.919> together<00:04:37.160> we<00:04:37.490> see

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
by leveraging things together we see

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.629 
by leveraging things together we see
huge<00:04:38.180> energy<00:04:38.389> opportunities<00:04:39.199> and

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
huge energy opportunities and

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.640 
huge energy opportunities and
whether<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.360> would<00:04:41.479> be<00:04:41.509> able<00:04:41.659> to<00:04:41.840> come<00:04:42.620> down

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
whether it would be able to come down

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.950 
whether it would be able to come down
specifically<00:04:43.490> go<00:04:43.759> to<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.150> bolero<00:04:44.479> level

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
specifically go to a bolero level

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.679 
specifically go to a bolero level
without<00:04:45.919> really<00:04:46.310> affecting<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:47.210> strategy<00:04:47.659> I

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:47.689 
without really affecting the strategy I

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.409 
without really affecting the strategy I
just<00:04:47.900> spoke<00:04:48.050> about<00:04:48.110> which<00:04:48.590> is<00:04:48.710> maintaining<00:04:49.419> an

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
just spoke about which is maintaining an

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.149 
just spoke about which is maintaining an
affordable<00:04:50.960> price<00:04:51.199> point<00:04:51.530> is<00:04:51.740> something<00:04:52.069> that

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
affordable price point is something that

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.040 
affordable price point is something that
we<00:04:52.280> need<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.430> see<00:04:52.669> because<00:04:53.569> we<00:04:53.659> don't<00:04:53.840> want<00:04:54.020> to

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
we need to see because we don't want to

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.469 
we need to see because we don't want to
bring<00:04:54.319> in<00:04:54.500> our<00:04:54.800> technologies<00:04:55.400> which<00:04:55.789> upset<00:04:56.389> at

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
bring in our technologies which upset at

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.659 
bring in our technologies which upset at
the<00:04:56.539> price<00:04:56.750> point<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:57.710> Ssangyong<00:04:57.979> type<00:04:58.340> also

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
the price point the Ssangyong type also

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.339 
the price point the Ssangyong type also
means<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.360> have<00:04:59.569> access<00:04:59.780> to<00:05:00.020> now<00:05:00.319> a

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
means that you have access to now a

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.379 
means that you have access to now a
larger<00:05:00.949> distribution<00:05:01.580> network<00:05:01.969> I<00:05:02.090> think<00:05:02.300> that

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
larger distribution network I think that

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.520 
larger distribution network I think that
was<00:05:02.539> one<00:05:02.689> of<00:05:02.719> the<00:05:02.840> main<00:05:02.990> reasons<00:05:03.319> of<00:05:03.409> the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
was one of the main reasons of the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.830 
was one of the main reasons of the
acquisition<00:05:04.129> will<00:05:04.789> that<00:05:05.000> also<00:05:05.180> be<00:05:05.419> used<00:05:05.689> for

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
acquisition will that also be used for

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.659 
acquisition will that also be used for
the<00:05:06.020> bolero<00:05:06.319> using<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.830> bolero<00:05:07.129> will<00:05:07.340> now<00:05:07.460> see

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
the bolero using the bolero will now see

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.390 
the bolero using the bolero will now see
new<00:05:07.819> markets<00:05:08.300> we<00:05:08.750> can<00:05:08.900> export<00:05:09.229> below<00:05:09.500> in

reasonable chunk of our exports and
people<00:05:21.409> actually<00:05:21.560> like<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.219> Buller<00:05:22.400> would

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
people actually like the Buller would

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.070 
people actually like the Buller would
look<00:05:22.819> a<00:05:22.849> lot<00:05:23.120> because<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.629> has<00:05:23.659> that<00:05:23.930> retro

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
look a lot because it has that retro

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.200 
look a lot because it has that retro
look<00:05:24.319> in<00:05:24.710> international<00:05:25.280> markets<00:05:25.639> so

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
look in international markets so

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.080 
look in international markets so
we<00:05:27.690> do<00:05:27.840> say<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.200> bladder<00:05:28.440> yeah<00:05:29.100> but<00:05:29.310> now<00:05:29.640> like

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
we do say the bladder yeah but now like

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.640 
we do say the bladder yeah but now like
I'm<00:05:30.210> saying<00:05:30.420> with<00:05:30.930> with<00:05:31.230> the<00:05:31.410> Ssangyong

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
I'm saying with with the Ssangyong

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.980 
I'm saying with with the Ssangyong
diopters<00:05:32.610> also<00:05:32.910> going<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.300> be<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.390> lot<00:05:33.630> of<00:05:33.660> more

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
diopters also going to be a lot of more

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.320 
diopters also going to be a lot of more
scope<00:05:34.260> of<00:05:34.410> distribution<00:05:35.040> because<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:36.090> that

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
scope of distribution because that that

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.970 
scope of distribution because that that
allows<00:05:36.600> you<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.810> larger<00:05:37.200> playing<00:05:37.530> field<00:05:37.830> that

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
allows you a larger playing field that

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.680 
allows you a larger playing field that
allows<00:05:38.100> you<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:38.820> know<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:38.970> wider<00:05:39.240> reach<00:05:39.480> two

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690

but<00:06:08.530> it's<00:06:09.069> like<00:06:09.849> I<00:06:09.879> said<00:06:10.150> too<00:06:10.330> premature

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
but it's like I said too premature

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.589
