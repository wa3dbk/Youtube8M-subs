00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
exclamation point on there so there you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.819 
exclamation point on there so there you
go<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:39.389> was<00:02:39.569> no<00:02:39.780> other<00:02:39.959> stickers<00:02:40.590> or

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
go there was no other stickers or

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.849 
go there was no other stickers or
anything<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.599> to<00:02:42.599> decorate<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.620> one

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
anything like that to decorate this one

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.099 
anything like that to decorate this one
with<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.250> there<00:02:44.430> was<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.939> speed<00:02:45.569> shift<00:02:45.810> cars

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
with like there was the speed shift cars

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.250 
with like there was the speed shift cars
so<00:02:46.980> keep<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.180> mind<00:02:48.359> that<00:02:48.780> sticker<00:02:49.079> was

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so keep that in mind that sticker was

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.170 
so keep that in mind that sticker was
already<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.829> there<00:02:50.129> you<00:02:50.280> did<00:02:50.430> not<00:02:50.579> have<00:02:50.909> a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
already on there you did not have a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.270 
already on there you did not have a
choice<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.139> anyway<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:52.680> about<00:02:52.859> all<00:02:53.099> so

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
choice so anyway that's about all so

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.470 
choice so anyway that's about all so
let's<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.579> ahead<00:02:53.669> and<00:02:53.790> move<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.389> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
let's go ahead and move on to the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:04:40.260 
let's go ahead and move on to the
drivers

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.940 

so<00:04:41.270> overall<00:04:41.540> this<00:04:41.780> recommendation<00:04:42.200> is<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.680> lot

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
so overall this recommendation is a lot

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.180 
so overall this recommendation is a lot
like<00:04:43.280> shift<00:04:43.850> high<00:04:44.270> speed<00:04:44.870> it's<00:04:45.740> got<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.890> cool

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
like shift high speed it's got a cool

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.250 
like shift high speed it's got a cool
new<00:04:46.520> design<00:04:47.000> it's<00:04:47.360> technically<00:04:47.930> different

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
new design it's technically different

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.740 
new design it's technically different
shift<00:04:48.650> carving<00:04:49.100> megamax<00:04:49.670> flair<00:04:50.090> instead<00:04:50.480> of<00:04:50.600> a

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
shift carving megamax flair instead of a

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.890 
shift carving megamax flair instead of a
normal<00:04:51.020> max<00:04:51.890> Flair<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.580> get<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.210> new<00:04:53.420> mega

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
normal max Flair you get the new mega

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.990 
normal max Flair you get the new mega
max<00:04:54.200> Flair<00:04:54.500> sound<00:04:54.830> in<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.130> drive<00:04:55.370> driver<00:04:55.730> you

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
max Flair sound in the drive driver you

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.110 
max Flair sound in the drive driver you
get<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.300> Cho<00:04:56.630> part<00:04:57.530> before<00:04:57.830> it's<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:58.640> the<00:04:58.850> MOC

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
get the Cho part before it's in the MOC

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.230 
get the Cho part before it's in the MOC
driver<00:04:59.570> as<00:05:00.200> well<00:05:00.470> as<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:01.190> new<00:05:01.430> full<00:05:01.790> throttle

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
driver as well as the new full throttle

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.180 
driver as well as the new full throttle
sounds<00:05:02.570> for<00:05:02.750> both<00:05:02.900> drivers<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:03.860> it<00:05:04.070> is

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
sounds for both drivers so it is

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.310 
sounds for both drivers so it is
basically<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.710> tire<00:05:06.710> Co<00:05:07.040> conversion<00:05:07.790> of<00:05:08.320> type

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
basically a tire Co conversion of type

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.400 
basically a tire Co conversion of type
high-speed<00:05:09.890> basically<00:05:10.520> so<00:05:11.420> in<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:12.080> similar

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
high-speed basically so in the similar

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.530 
high-speed basically so in the similar
recommendation<00:05:13.340> if<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.640> are<00:05:13.850> an<00:05:14.030> absolute

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
recommendation if you are an absolute

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.630 
recommendation if you are an absolute
collector<00:05:14.930> for<00:05:15.170> sounds<00:05:15.650> this<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:16.070> must<00:05:16.340> get

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
collector for sounds this is a must get

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.420 
collector for sounds this is a must get
otherwise<00:05:17.630> it's<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.170> fairly<00:05:18.590> simple<00:05:19.010> pass

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
otherwise it's a fairly simple pass

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.720 
otherwise it's a fairly simple pass
unless<00:05:19.760> you<00:05:20.090> really<00:05:20.450> want<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:21.310> collect<00:05:22.310> every

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
unless you really want to collect every

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.460 
unless you really want to collect every
single<00:05:22.760> shift<00:05:23.390> car<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:23.810> considering<00:05:24.170> this<00:05:24.260> is

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
single shift car and considering this is

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.820 
single shift car and considering this is
a<00:05:24.500> tire<00:05:24.770> cocom<00:05:25.220> that<00:05:25.430> does<00:05:25.730> have<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.300> suit<00:05:26.660> in<00:05:27.620> my

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
a tire cocom that does have a suit in my

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.830 
a tire cocom that does have a suit in my
opinion<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.400> is<00:05:28.490> definitely<00:05:28.940> worth<00:05:29.090> checking

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
opinion it is definitely worth checking

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.580 
opinion it is definitely worth checking
out

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
out

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.100
