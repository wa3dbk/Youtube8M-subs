where I had no idea what I was doing but
it<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.790> basically<00:01:08.970> follow<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.840> corridor

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
sometimes it felt like some locations

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.280 
sometimes it felt like some locations
weren't<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.509> much<00:01:15.659> different<00:01:16.110> than<00:01:16.170> other

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
weren't that much different than other

oh look we're in another place there

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.280 
oh look we're in another place there
were<00:01:20.939> those<00:01:21.090> times<00:01:21.390> where<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> got<00:01:21.810> creative

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
were those times where it got creative

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.499 
were those times where it got creative
like<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.860> were<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> baseball<00:01:24.000> stadium

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
like when we were in a baseball stadium

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
like when we were in a baseball stadium
and<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.080> had<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.259> put<00:01:25.500> people<00:01:25.890> off<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.400> that

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and we had to put people off and that

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
and we had to put people off and that
was<00:01:26.700> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.000> cool<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> whole<00:01:28.350> town

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
was kind of cool or when the whole town

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
great but I did like all the ways that

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.440 
great but I did like all the ways that
it<00:01:43.740> would<00:01:43.860> show<00:01:44.130> off<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.700> levels<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.210> times

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it would show off the levels at times

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.749 
it would show off the levels at times
it's<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.170> single-player<00:01:46.649> game<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.399> fun<00:01:47.610> in

from any other shooters out there other
than<00:02:23.060> different<00:02:23.600> guns<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.590> community

than different guns it's the community
the<00:02:25.640> character<00:02:26.030> customization<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:26.810> probably

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
the character customization was probably

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.390 
the character customization was probably
the<00:02:27.260> best<00:02:27.470> part<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.860> game<00:02:28.040> because<00:02:28.190> that's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the best part of the game because that's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.890 
the best part of the game because that's
what<00:02:28.580> made<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.000> unique<00:02:29.300> from<00:02:29.660> other

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
what made it so unique from other

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.140 
what made it so unique from other
shooters<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.890> everybody<00:02:31.400> was<00:02:31.700> kind<00:02:32.000> of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
shooters is that everybody was kind of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150 
shooters is that everybody was kind of
different<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.720> other<00:02:33.200> ways<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.740> was<00:02:33.800> kind<00:02:34.070> of

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
different in other ways it was kind of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.920 
different in other ways it was kind of
unbalanced<00:02:34.820> because<00:02:35.120> there<00:02:35.300> was<00:02:35.420> always<00:02:35.570> one

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
unbalanced because there was always one

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.990 
unbalanced because there was always one
tactic<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.740> around<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:37.340> in<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.610> previous

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000

deathmatch<00:05:12.660> all<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.440> most<00:05:13.590> we<00:05:13.710> just<00:05:13.920> talked

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
deathmatch all the most we just talked

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.040 
deathmatch all the most we just talked
about<00:05:14.280> what<00:05:15.060> was<00:05:15.180> your<00:05:15.330> favorite<00:05:15.750> mode<00:05:15.900> to

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
about what was your favorite mode to

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.290 
about what was your favorite mode to
play<00:05:16.200> online<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:17.250> know<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:17.760> isn't<00:05:17.940> very

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
play online I know this isn't very

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.060 
play online I know this isn't very
creative<00:05:18.870> but<00:05:19.110> probably<00:05:19.470> team<00:05:19.770> deathmatch

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
creative but probably team deathmatch

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.310 
creative but probably team deathmatch
just<00:05:20.670> because<00:05:20.880> it's<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.630> most<00:05:21.840> played<00:05:22.080> by

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
just because it's the most played by

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.170 
just because it's the most played by
everyone<00:05:22.800> it's<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.310> one<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.580> shows<00:05:23.790> off<00:05:24.030> the

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
everyone it's the one that shows off the

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.780 
everyone it's the one that shows off the
most<00:05:24.360> teamwork<00:05:24.810> yes<00:05:25.170> plus<00:05:25.590> not<00:05:26.100> everyone<00:05:26.640> is

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
most teamwork yes plus not everyone is

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.940 
most teamwork yes plus not everyone is
shooting<00:05:27.120> at<00:05:27.300> you<00:05:27.540> so<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:27.930> think<00:05:28.200> it's<00:05:28.560> easier

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
shooting at you so I think it's easier

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.400 
shooting at you so I think it's easier
to<00:05:29.370> play<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.240> every<00:05:30.660> beginner<00:05:31.140> should

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
to play and every beginner should

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.600 
to play and every beginner should
probably<00:05:31.680> just<00:05:31.950> start<00:05:32.130> there

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
probably just start there

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.730 
probably just start there
so<00:05:33.030> Call<00:05:33.390> of<00:05:33.420> Duty<00:05:33.900> ghosts<00:05:36.350> would<00:05:37.350> you<00:05:37.500> buy

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
so Call of Duty ghosts would you buy

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.580 
so Call of Duty ghosts would you buy
rent<00:05:38.250> or<00:05:38.490> skip<00:05:38.910> probably<00:05:39.720> a<00:05:39.750> buy<00:05:39.990> if<00:05:40.320> you're<00:05:40.500> a

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
rent or skip probably a buy if you're a

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.860 
rent or skip probably a buy if you're a
fan<00:05:40.830> of<00:05:40.860> multiplayer<00:05:41.460> shooters<00:05:41.940> I<00:05:42.180> think<00:05:42.750> this

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
fan of multiplayer shooters I think this

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.450 
fan of multiplayer shooters I think this
game<00:05:43.050> is<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.410> worth<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.710> rent<00:05:43.950> the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460

single-player<00:05:44.820> game<00:05:45.150> was<00:05:45.330> good<00:05:45.510> in<00:05:45.630> parts<00:05:46.020> I

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
single-player game was good in parts I

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.020 
single-player game was good in parts I
just<00:05:46.620> wish<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.800> was<00:05:46.980> a<00:05:47.010> little<00:05:47.070> more<00:05:47.340> coherent

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
just wish it was a little more coherent

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.910 
just wish it was a little more coherent
