00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.009 
movie
I<00:02:36.569> like<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.590> Life<00:02:37.859> of<00:02:38.010> Pi<00:02:38.659> even<00:02:39.659> though<00:02:39.780> when<00:02:39.930> I

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
I like the Life of Pi even though when I

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.360 
I like the Life of Pi even though when I
went<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.319> see<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.739> thought<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.069> was<00:02:41.159> going

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
went to see and I thought it was going

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.099 
went to see and I thought it was going
to<00:02:41.519> be<00:02:41.640> about<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.000> mathematical<00:02:42.599> constant

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
to be about the mathematical constant

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.119 
to be about the mathematical constant
that<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.470> ratio<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.099> circles

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
that is the ratio of a circles

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.250 
that is the ratio of a circles
circumference<00:02:44.939> in<00:02:45.329> reference<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.930> certain

circumference in reference to a certain

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.750 
circumference in reference to a certain
diameter<00:02:46.409> and<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.040> approximately<00:02:47.549> equal<00:02:47.730> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
diameter and it's approximately equal to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.119 
diameter and it's approximately equal to
three<00:02:48.120> point<00:02:48.389> one<00:02:48.599> four<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:48.900> five<00:02:49.170> nine<00:02:49.439> six
