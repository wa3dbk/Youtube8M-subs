00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.140 
you need to head off and the idea is to
go<00:03:05.439> underneath<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.159> Tower<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.549> Babel

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
go underneath the Tower of Babel

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.940 
go underneath the Tower of Babel
because<00:03:07.629> we're<00:03:07.780> going<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.019> have<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.260> trap<00:03:08.530> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
because we're going to have to trap the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.580 
because we're going to have to trap the
electric<00:03:09.430> guy<00:03:09.730> underneath<00:03:10.719> there<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.319> he<00:03:11.439> can

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
electric guy underneath there so he can

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.220 
electric guy underneath there so he can
power<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.609> Tower<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.939> Babel<00:03:13.090> itself<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
power the Tower of Babel itself for the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.649 
power the Tower of Babel itself for the
next<00:03:14.469> step<00:03:14.909> now<00:03:15.909> the<00:03:15.939> best<00:03:16.150> way<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.299> do<00:03:16.540> this

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
next step now the best way to do this

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.610 
next step now the best way to do this
guys<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.889> obviously<00:03:18.340> meet<00:03:18.579> up<00:03:18.849> and<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:20.290> get

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.589 
guys is to obviously meet up and and get
to<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.859> cornfield<00:03:21.340> now<00:03:21.879> you're<00:03:22.420> going<00:03:22.540> to

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
to the cornfield now you're going to

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.229 
to the cornfield now you're going to
