smoke generator that you can see in one
of<00:00:13.500> my<00:00:13.679> other<00:00:13.799> videos<00:00:14.179> this<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.389> little

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
of my other videos this is a little

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.720 
of my other videos this is a little
aquarium<00:00:16.020> pump<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.890> actually<00:00:17.250> drives<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
aquarium pump that actually drives the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.570 
aquarium pump that actually drives the
smoke<00:00:18.029> generator<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.890> this<00:00:19.890> copper<00:00:20.310> pipe

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
smoke generator and this copper pipe

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.410 
smoke generator and this copper pipe
leads<00:00:21.240> into<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.810> smoker<00:00:22.470> box<00:00:22.820> I<00:00:23.820> think<00:00:24.330> it's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
leads into the smoker box I think it's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.820 
leads into the smoker box I think it's
worth<00:00:24.539> pointing<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.960> none<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> these<00:00:25.470> joints

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
worth pointing it none of these joints

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.830 
worth pointing it none of these joints
are<00:00:25.920> soldered<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.090> temperatures<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.660> here

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
are soldered the temperatures in here

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.689 
are soldered the temperatures in here
will<00:00:27.990> not<00:00:28.170> get<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.830> anything<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.580> would

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
will not get up to anything that would

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.060 
will not get up to anything that would
vaporize<00:00:30.230> lead<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> figured<00:00:31.830> better<00:00:31.949> safe

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
vaporize lead but I figured better safe

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.350 
vaporize lead but I figured better safe
than<00:00:32.340> sorry<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:32.910> don't<00:00:33.030> need<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.329> be

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360

two sets of walls there is actually
ceramic<00:01:33.869> insulation<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> use<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
ceramic insulation that you use for a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.219 
ceramic insulation that you use for a
kiln<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.570> happen<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.900> some<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.140> that

kiln I just happen to have some of that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.310 
kiln I just happen to have some of that
on<00:01:37.320> hand<00:01:37.650> from<00:01:37.829> another<00:01:38.040> project<00:01:39.170> inside<00:01:40.170> I've

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
on hand from another project inside I've

got<00:01:40.470> shelving<00:01:40.920> standards<00:01:41.430> there's<00:01:41.759> actually

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
got shelving standards there's actually

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.460 
got shelving standards there's actually
would<00:01:42.329> backing<00:01:42.780> these<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.079> they're<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.350> just

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
would backing these so they're not just

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.609 
would backing these so they're not just
hanging<00:01:43.770> off<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.399> sheet<00:01:44.790> metal<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.619> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
hanging off of the sheet metal and that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.200 
hanging off of the sheet metal and that
means<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.220> move<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.430> racks<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.060> or

right now I'm only got to win because

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
right now I'm only got to win because
we're<00:01:54.479> about<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> smoke<00:01:54.869> some<00:01:55.049> cheese<00:01:55.579> then

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
we're about to smoke some cheese then

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.219 
we're about to smoke some cheese then
the<00:01:56.670> last<00:01:56.820> thing<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.210> there's<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.840> exhaust

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the last thing is there's the exhaust

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.969 
the last thing is there's the exhaust
port<00:01:58.649> which<00:01:59.280> goes<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.200> our<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.469> tea

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
port which goes up to our little tea

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.709 
port which goes up to our little tea
chimney<00:02:02.399> there<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.000> rain<00:02:03.360> can't

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
chimney there just so that rain can't

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.050 
chimney there just so that rain can't
get<00:02:03.990> down<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> top<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.820> because

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
get down to the top and that's because

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
get down to the top and that's because
you<00:02:06.270> want<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.689> flow<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.320> smoke<00:02:07.680> through

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
you want to have a flow of smoke through

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.710 
you want to have a flow of smoke through
the<00:02:08.160> smoke<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.910> smoker<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.360> don't<00:02:09.509> want<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
the smoke the smoker you don't want to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.820 
the smoke the smoker you don't want to
have<00:02:09.810> stale<00:02:10.140> stagnant<00:02:10.709> smoke

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
have stale stagnant smoke

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.320 
have stale stagnant smoke
I<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.100> got<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.250> pie<00:02:12.460> plate<00:02:12.520> sitting<00:02:13.000> on<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
I just got a pie plate sitting on the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.530 
I just got a pie plate sitting on the
hot<00:02:14.050> plate<00:02:14.080> because<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:15.190> don't<00:02:15.940> want<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.360> have

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
hot plate because I don't want to have

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.590 
hot plate because I don't want to have
it<00:02:17.050> fill<00:02:17.380> up<00:02:17.410> with<00:02:17.680> smoke<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.420> look

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
it fill up with smoke if you look

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.870 
it fill up with smoke if you look
closely<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.050> can<00:02:20.110> actually<00:02:20.290> see<00:02:20.440> smoke<00:02:21.400> peels

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
closely you can actually see smoke peels

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.210 
closely you can actually see smoke peels
the<00:02:22.510> paint<00:02:22.780> off<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.110> almost<00:02:23.590> everything<00:02:23.980> this

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the paint off of almost everything this

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.790 
the paint off of almost everything this
is<00:02:24.280> where<00:02:24.520> smoke<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.380> humidity<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.710> the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
is where smoke and humidity and the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.080 
is where smoke and humidity and the
resins<00:02:27.220> from<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.460> smoke<00:02:27.670> we're<00:02:27.820> condensing

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
resins from the smoke we're condensing

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.120 
resins from the smoke we're condensing
and<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.900> just<00:02:29.050> removed<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.560> paint<00:02:29.770> off<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
and it just removed the paint off the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.150 
and it just removed the paint off the
bottom<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> old<00:02:30.730> filing<00:02:31.120> cabinet<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.980> yeah

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
bottom of the old filing cabinet so yeah

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.650 
bottom of the old filing cabinet so yeah
and<00:02:33.460> we<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.700> use<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.850> standard<00:02:34.120> little<00:02:34.480> class

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
and we just use a standard little class

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.320 
and we just use a standard little class
pure<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.080> side<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.040> latch<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.210> up

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
pure on the side so you can latch it up

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.920 
pure on the side so you can latch it up
and<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:39.010> double<00:02:39.310> wall<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:40.540> means

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
and because it's double wall it means

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.510 
and because it's double wall it means
that<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.500> won't<00:02:41.650> get<00:02:41.800> hot<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.280> can<00:02:42.400> actually

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
that it won't get hot you can actually

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.160 
that it won't get hot you can actually
deal<00:02:42.970> with<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.180> smoker<00:02:43.420> pretty<00:02:43.690> easily<00:02:43.870> when

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
deal with the smoker pretty easily when

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.800 
deal with the smoker pretty easily when
it's<00:02:44.290> running<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:46.060> yeah<00:02:46.270> we're<00:02:46.630> going<00:02:46.750> to

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
it's running so yeah we're going to

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.140 
it's running so yeah we're going to
eventually<00:02:47.110> mount<00:02:47.410> an<00:02:48.370> electrical<00:02:48.790> box<00:02:48.970> on

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
eventually mount an electrical box on

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.660 
eventually mount an electrical box on
the<00:02:49.270> side<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.959> hot<00:02:50.230> plate<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
the side so that the hot plate and the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.340 
the side so that the hot plate and the
aquarium<00:02:52.209> pump<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.600> whatnot<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.110> smoker

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
aquarium pump and whatnot for the smoker

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.080 
aquarium pump and whatnot for the smoker
will<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:53.709> be<00:02:53.860> mounted<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.640> body<00:02:54.820> of<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
will all be mounted on the body of the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.830 
will all be mounted on the body of the
smoker<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:57.000> probably<00:02:58.000> put<00:02:58.240> some<00:02:58.390> temperature

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
smoker and probably put some temperature

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.420 
smoker and probably put some temperature
sensors<00:02:59.170> on<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.680> monitor<00:03:00.010> right<00:03:00.280> now

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
sensors on it so I can monitor right now

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.470 
sensors on it so I can monitor right now
we<00:03:00.490> just<00:03:00.700> sort<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:00.880> stick<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> kitchen

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
we just sort of stick a kitchen

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.970 
we just sort of stick a kitchen
thermometer<00:03:01.600> into<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.380> see<00:03:02.440> how<00:03:02.560> hot<00:03:02.860> it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
thermometer into it and see how hot it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.610 
thermometer into it and see how hot it
