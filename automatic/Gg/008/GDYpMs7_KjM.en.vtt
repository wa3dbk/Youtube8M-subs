that's maemura the course is exactly the

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.189 
that's maemura the course is exactly the
same<00:04:48.210> except<00:04:49.210> instead<00:04:49.419> of<00:04:49.509> playing<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.050> F

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
open D second on the G bird on the on

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:20.870 
open D second on the G bird on the on
the<00:05:02.979> B<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.639> second<00:05:04.300> on<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.479> second<00:05:05.440> on<00:05:05.530> me<00:05:05.910> so

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.129 

that's<00:05:21.880> course<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.419> then<00:05:22.509> there's<00:05:22.720> one<00:05:22.900> bit

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
that's course and then there's one bit

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.290 
that's course and then there's one bit
which<00:05:23.560> is<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.710> bread<00:05:23.979> flip<00:05:24.250> bitch<00:05:24.669> which<00:05:25.060> is

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
which is a bread flip bitch which is

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.490 
which is a bread flip bitch which is
it's<00:05:26.110> it's<00:05:26.380> it's<00:05:27.280> it's<00:05:28.000> an<00:05:28.120> E<00:05:28.360> minor<00:05:28.780> which<00:05:29.289> is

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
it's it's it's it's an E minor which is

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.249 
it's it's it's it's an E minor which is
everything<00:05:30.430> open<00:05:30.819> except<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.419> AAP<00:05:31.840> which<00:05:32.110> is

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
everything open except the AAP which is

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.230 
everything open except the AAP which is
second<00:05:32.590> for<00:05:32.740> at<00:05:32.800> AMD<00:05:33.310> so<00:05:33.639> I<00:05:33.699> which<00:05:33.849> a<00:05:33.940> second

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
second for at AMD so I which a second

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:45.870 
second for at AMD so I which a second
flat<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:38.699> then<00:05:39.699> to<00:05:40.150> Iman<00:05:42.240> then<00:05:43.240> e

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:06:17.680 

then<00:05:46.880> a<00:05:47.440> minor<00:05:48.729> and<00:05:49.729> C<00:06:14.800> then<00:06:16.240> once<00:06:17.240> you've<00:06:17.449> done

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
then a minor and C then once you've done

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.580 
then a minor and C then once you've done
the<00:06:18.080> bit<00:06:18.560> which<00:06:19.160> is<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.760> Starbridge<00:06:20.419> and<00:06:21.320> when

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
the bit which is the Starbridge and when

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.990 
the bit which is the Starbridge and when
it<00:06:21.740> gets<00:06:21.860> to<00:06:22.430> the<00:06:22.580> line<00:06:24.490> when<00:06:25.490> it<00:06:25.550> gets<00:06:25.760> after

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
it gets to the line when it gets after

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.450 
it gets to the line when it gets after
the<00:06:26.210> first<00:06:26.449> part<00:06:26.949> he<00:06:27.949> goes<00:06:29.470> it<00:06:30.470> goes<00:06:30.680> exactly

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
the first part he goes it goes exactly

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:39.820 
the first part he goes it goes exactly
the<00:06:31.820> same<00:06:34.479> so<00:06:36.910> all<00:06:37.910> the<00:06:38.120> other<00:06:38.530> I'm<00:06:39.530> just<00:06:39.650> going

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
the same so all the other I'm just going

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:47.550 
the same so all the other I'm just going
to<00:06:39.860> play<00:06:40.010> one<00:06:40.220> of<00:06:40.250> each<00:06:40.460> so<00:06:40.880> it's

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.740 

Oh

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.350 

Oh

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:43.339 

ah

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:43.349 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:45.600 

so<00:07:44.349> the<00:07:44.439> first<00:07:44.619> father<00:07:44.919> bridge<00:07:45.129> base<00:07:45.369> are

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.610 
so the first father bridge base are

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.519 
so the first father bridge base are
belong<00:07:46.029> is<00:07:46.269> now<00:07:46.449> it's<00:07:46.689> actually<00:07:47.050> an<00:07:47.110> E<00:07:47.319> minor

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:47.529 
belong is now it's actually an E minor

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:52.919 
belong is now it's actually an E minor
then<00:07:48.279> the<00:07:48.490> a<00:07:48.519> minor<00:07:49.019> you<00:07:50.019> see<00:07:51.479> then<00:07:52.479> it's<00:07:52.659> good

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:52.929 
then the a minor you see then it's good

00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:57.029 
then the a minor you see then it's good
