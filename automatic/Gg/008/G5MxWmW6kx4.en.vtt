00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
compare the galaxy s at the galaxy y and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.009 
compare the galaxy s at the galaxy y and
the<00:03:17.870> galaxy<00:03:18.870> gio<00:03:19.139> over<00:03:19.440> here<00:03:20.449> now<00:03:21.449> these<00:03:21.690> are

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
the galaxy gio over here now these are

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.559 
the galaxy gio over here now these are
two<00:03:22.199> phones<00:03:22.560> are<00:03:22.889> very<00:03:23.159> compared<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:24.359> each

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
two phones are very compared to each

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.140 
two phones are very compared to each
other<00:03:24.810> most<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.500> time<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.459> let's<00:03:26.699> see<00:03:26.909> they

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
other most of the time so let's see they

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.490 
other most of the time so let's see they
are<00:03:27.239> not<00:03:27.479> very<00:03:28.019> bulky<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:30.090> do<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.419> a<00:03:30.750> st

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
are not very bulky and we do have a st

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.300 
are not very bulky and we do have a st

port on the the sorry USB port on the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.670 
port on the the sorry USB port on the
top<00:03:35.519> on<00:03:35.819> vai<00:03:36.239> but<00:03:36.599> we<00:03:36.750> don't<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.169> on<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
top on vai but we don't have that on the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.399 
top on vai but we don't have that on the
geo<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> side<00:03:39.479> we<00:03:39.659> do<00:03:39.810> have<00:03:39.989> volume

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
geo and on the side we do have volume

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.339 
geo and on the side we do have volume
rockers<00:03:40.799> over<00:03:41.099> here<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.810> bottom<00:03:42.989> 10

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
rockers over here and on the bottom 10

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.309 
rockers over here and on the bottom 10
we<00:03:43.799> have<00:03:43.979> the<00:03:44.519> USB<00:03:44.819> port<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.659> not<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.139> wire

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
we have the USB port but not on the wire

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.250 
we have the USB port but not on the wire
so<00:03:47.159> both<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.400> these<00:03:47.639> have<00:03:47.970> almost<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:49.019> same

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
so both of these have almost the same

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.569 
so both of these have almost the same
screen<00:03:49.590> size<00:03:49.849> this<00:03:50.849> one<00:03:51.060> has<00:03:51.329> a<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.319> galaxy<00:03:52.769> y

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
screen size this one has a the galaxy y

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.839 
screen size this one has a the galaxy y
has<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.269> three<00:03:54.599> point<00:03:54.900> three<00:03:54.989> inch<00:03:55.409> screen

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
has a three point three inch screen

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.189 
has a three point three inch screen
whereas<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.470> galaxy<00:03:58.470> gio<00:03:59.090> has<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.449> 3.2<00:04:00.989> inch

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
whereas the galaxy gio has a 3.2 inch

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:07.569 
whereas the galaxy gio has a 3.2 inch
screen<00:04:01.970> now<00:04:02.970> let's<00:04:03.209> compare<00:04:03.479> the<00:04:05.870> galaxy<00:04:06.870> of

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
screen now let's compare the galaxy of

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.479 
screen now let's compare the galaxy of
east<00:04:08.579> with<00:04:08.939> the<00:04:09.150> galaxy<00:04:09.810> y<00:04:10.019> now<00:04:10.919> both<00:04:11.159> of<00:04:11.340> these

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
east with the galaxy y now both of these

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.879 
east with the galaxy y now both of these
phones<00:04:11.909> you<00:04:12.209> can<00:04:12.239> see<00:04:12.629> have<00:04:12.989> very<00:04:13.470> different

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
phones you can see have very different

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.279 
phones you can see have very different
screens<00:04:14.220> because<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.759> has<00:04:14.939> a<00:04:15.209> 3<00:04:15.870> inch<00:04:16.019> screen

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
screens because this has a 3 inch screen

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.949 
screens because this has a 3 inch screen
and<00:04:16.530> ace<00:04:16.889> has<00:04:17.099> a<00:04:17.159> 3.5<00:04:17.639> inch<00:04:18.060> screen<00:04:18.299> so

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
and ace has a 3.5 inch screen so

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.940 
and ace has a 3.5 inch screen so
obviously<00:04:19.349> these<00:04:19.650> are<00:04:19.709> very<00:04:21.109> tall<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.860> other

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
obviously these are very tall the other

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.600 
obviously these are very tall the other
one<00:04:23.159> is<00:04:23.190> tall<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:24.690> width<00:04:25.320> is<00:04:25.680> almost<00:04:26.130> the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
one is tall and the width is almost the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.070 
one is tall and the width is almost the
same

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
same

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.540 
same
so<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.440> hardware<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.190> screen

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
so this is the hardware and the screen

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.760 
so this is the hardware and the screen
comparison<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.510> three<00:04:30.990> phones<00:04:31.260> they<00:04:31.620> all

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
comparison of the three phones they all

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.950 
comparison of the three phones they all
must<00:04:31.950> perform<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.520> same<00:04:32.790> there<00:04:33.450> is<00:04:33.480> no

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
must perform the same there is no

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.370 
must perform the same there is no
difference<00:04:34.380> in<00:04:34.530> their<00:04:34.710> performance<00:04:36.380> but

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
difference in their performance but

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.810 
difference in their performance but
there<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.800> difference<00:04:37.890> in<00:04:38.310> their<00:04:38.430> screen

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
there is a difference in their screen

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.540 
there is a difference in their screen
and<00:04:39.060> their<00:04:39.240> cameras<00:04:39.720> so<00:04:40.230> this<00:04:41.040> has<00:04:41.220> been<00:04:41.340> dr.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
and their cameras so this has been dr.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.640 
and their cameras so this has been dr.
