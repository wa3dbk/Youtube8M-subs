there's<00:01:28.020> no<00:01:28.110> doubt<00:01:28.290> about<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.670> could

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
there's no doubt about it so if we could

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.249 
there's no doubt about it so if we could
get<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> message<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.079> want

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
get the message out there that we want

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.600 
get the message out there that we want
all<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> Ozzy<00:01:31.770> supporters<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.520> would

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
all the Ozzy supporters here that would

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.249 
all the Ozzy supporters here that would
be<00:01:32.700> great<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.600> important<00:01:34.049> step

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
be great and it's important step

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.539 
be great and it's important step
obviously<00:01:34.439> getting<00:01:34.890> through<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.280> tighter

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
obviously getting through this tighter

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.969 
obviously getting through this tighter
to<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.329> towards<00:01:36.659> back<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.990> top<00:01:37.229> group<00:01:37.470> yeah

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
to get towards back that top group yeah

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.160 
to get towards back that top group yeah
I<00:01:38.159> look<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.790> what<00:01:38.970> what's<00:01:39.360> important<00:01:39.930> is

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I look I think what what's important is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.190 
I look I think what what's important is
getting<00:01:41.090> bit<00:01:42.090> by<00:01:42.119> bit<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.780> that's<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.049> beat

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
getting bit by bit and that's to beat

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.740 
getting bit by bit and that's to beat
Chinese<00:01:43.619> Taipei<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:45.119> would<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:45.420> play<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
Chinese Taipei we would then play the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.690 
Chinese Taipei we would then play the
winner<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.990> Japan<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> Philippines<00:01:47.220> in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
winner of Japan or the Philippines in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.920 
winner of Japan or the Philippines in
May<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.259> get<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> potential

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
May and then you get a potential

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.850 
May and then you get a potential
qualifying<00:01:51.930> spot<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.680> world

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
qualifying spot to get back in the world

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.280 
qualifying spot to get back in the world
group<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.159> September<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
group in September but you know you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.719 
group in September but you know you
can't<00:01:55.590> look<00:01:55.770> ahead<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.070> these<00:01:56.340> sorts<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
can't look ahead in these sorts of

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.069 
can't look ahead in these sorts of
things<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.090> anything<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.689> happen<00:01:57.840> in

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
things because anything can happen in

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
things because anything can happen in
davis<00:01:58.409> cup<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.340> people<00:01:59.640> play<00:01:59.820> either

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
davis cup that some people play either

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.870 
davis cup that some people play either
so<00:02:00.630> far<00:02:00.869> above<00:02:01.170> their<00:02:01.530> normal<00:02:01.890> ability<00:02:02.729> or

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
so far above their normal ability or

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.490 
so far above their normal ability or
self<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.570> play<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> tour<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
self of what they play on the tour and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.870 
self of what they play on the tour and
then<00:02:04.740> others<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.310> struggle<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
then others really struggle with the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
then others really struggle with the
stress<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> pressure<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.110> we'll<00:02:07.680> see<00:02:07.890> how

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
stress and the pressure so we'll see how

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.309 
stress and the pressure so we'll see how
it<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.250> pans<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.149> first<00:02:10.050> things<00:02:10.259> first

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
it all pans out that first things first

to hit the court running on the Friday

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.369 
to hit the court running on the Friday
and<00:02:15.450> finally<00:02:16.019> how<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.260> go<00:02:16.349> about

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
and finally how do you go about

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.839 
and finally how do you go about
selecting<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.129> team<00:02:17.280> obviously<00:02:17.430> they<00:02:17.760> have

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
selecting the team obviously they have

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.460 
selecting the team obviously they have
and<00:02:17.970> most<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:18.989> players<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.319> played

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and most of the players have played

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.350 
and most of the players have played
together<00:02:19.709> particularly<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> doubles

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
together particularly in in the doubles

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.289 
together particularly in in the doubles
arena<00:02:21.480> no<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.319> we're<00:02:22.860> pretty<00:02:23.040> set<00:02:23.700> on<00:02:23.760> who<00:02:24.150> we

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
arena no but we're pretty set on who we

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.180 
arena no but we're pretty set on who we
think<00:02:24.540> would<00:02:24.599> be<00:02:24.780> playing<00:02:25.019> doubles<00:02:25.500> obviously

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
think would be playing doubles obviously

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.800 
think would be playing doubles obviously
Paul<00:02:26.580> Hanley's<00:02:27.000> being<00:02:27.030> picked<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:27.599> that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
Paul Hanley's being picked for that

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
Paul Hanley's being picked for that

played well in doubles over the last
couple<00:02:31.079> of<00:02:31.230> years<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.590> Australia<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.480> fingers

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
couple of years for Australia so fingers

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.759

crossed nothing happens there to be the
potential<00:02:35.220> line<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.549> there<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.849> would<00:02:35.970> you

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
potential line up there you would you

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.089 
potential line up there you would you
would<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.510> thought<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.069> other

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
would have thought and then the other

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.309 
would have thought and then the other
positions<00:02:38.879> in<00:02:39.000> singles<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.690> we'll<00:02:39.870> see<00:02:40.049> we'll
