00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 after all what is the leader video 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.930
 the last video of tatiana feltrin her 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.660
 made a survey about who is ultimately who 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.970
 has capacity to talk about literature and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.160
 so we decided to make videos 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 answers to this topic this discussion 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.830
 It's rolling around and I have mine. 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.830
 opinion that would basically be similar 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 with others', so I agree with the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.879
 videos answers that I watched until 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.510
 so check out how are my 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.160
 reviews 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.580
 from the moment you see a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.059
 video or text made by a person 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.850
 common opinion on the book that he read 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.850
 you can not consider that to be 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.719
 a scientific article or based on 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 highly qualified theoretician but 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:01.440
 much of the literary baggage or the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.660
 barrage of study that the person has 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.320
 will have a differentiated opinion of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.320
 other this does not mean that it is bad 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.570
 another, after all, the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.130
 literature and if it does not matter 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.479
 exactly is the person has postgraduate degree 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.740
 doctorate in the area of journalism letters 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.270
 or something I believe we 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.709
 we share our literary tastes 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.610
 by youtube video or by is written 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.069
 in blogs 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.530
 we are only contributing to the 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:40.200
 culture of the country because if it was 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.840
 consider the last years the people 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.450
 they did not look like a lion today they had no taste 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.270
 by reading how it was as it is today 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.190
 You come here on our channels to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.599
 to say that we do not have the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.340
 talk about literature what we have 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.640
 to do a better critical analysis 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.030
 I think you are mistaken analysis 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:05.550
 Critique you have to make of yourself 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:08.550
 after all i believe that we disclose the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.670
 I like literature or reading or 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.080
 by books of various subjects 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.440
 we are here contributing to 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.920
 encourage others in a way 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.200
 to like to read is a best book 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.970
 selling a book but 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.540
 cut nÃ© the book - popular does not matter eh 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.459
 Eh 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.590
 if the person is going to talk the way she 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.069
 expresses her opinion 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.459
 this goes from each one and I think this is 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.660
 the main move of us to do 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.170
 videos 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.450
 there are several blogs vlogs and several 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.120
 people 's opinions on these books 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.769
 that they read this diversification 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.549
 It helps when it comes to getting a 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.530
 to read and have certain opinions and 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.630
 You sometimes thought I'm going to read this book. 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.690
 I will not read this book, this is mine. 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.480
 opinion then if the person reads is to grow 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.970
 cold twilight r 50 today gray 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.480
 I think it's great if you're a person who 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.799
 It is not much and you are looking for it and for the 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.829
 reading world 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.660
 each has its own literary level 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.790
 depending on how long the law has learned 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.790
 or started early started now 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.049
 after 20 years of life 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.639
 Finally, each one will have his or her 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.549
 start engaging in this world of 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.160
 and this is an opinion that you 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.910
 can not say that it is wrong or 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.220
 not important is that if the person 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.250
 started to like books and I'm going 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.500
 happened to come to like to read is a point 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.739
 the more for the people in this country 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.930
 I believe it and I believe that the 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.260
 videos can suck to 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.870
 some and can be a beauty to others 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.340
 smc my video response i hope 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.600
 You liked it and it really is the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.519
 my opinion 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.670
 and if you think my opinion is a 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:09.920
 Shit, just laugh but this is my opinion. 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.920
 right then until the next
