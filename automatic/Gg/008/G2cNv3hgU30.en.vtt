the most part now a lot of people to say
these<00:00:24.539> radiators<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.380> pretty<00:00:25.980> similar<00:00:26.369> to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
these radiators are pretty similar to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.630 
these radiators are pretty similar to
the<00:00:26.640> XS<00:00:27.359> PC<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.900> X<00:00:28.289> series<00:00:28.590> radiators<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.490> look

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the XS PC a X series radiators they look

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.900 
the XS PC a X series radiators they look
very<00:00:29.670> similar<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.420> square<00:00:30.720> shroud<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.910> in

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
very similar with a square shroud and in

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.880 
very similar with a square shroud and in
many<00:00:33.149> ways<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.420> are<00:00:33.710> performance<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.860> can

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
many ways they are performance I can

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.490 
many ways they are performance I can
tell<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.430> because<00:00:35.930> these<00:00:36.930> aren't<00:00:37.140> installed

one<00:03:28.349> let's<00:03:29.349> push<00:03:29.560> yourself<00:03:31.769> I'm<00:03:32.769> gonna<00:03:33.010> take<00:03:33.250> a

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
one let's push yourself I'm gonna take a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.349 
one let's push yourself I'm gonna take a
close-up<00:03:33.549> in<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:33.939> second<00:03:36.120> now<00:03:37.120> here's<00:03:37.299> a

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
close-up in a second now here's a

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.830 
close-up in a second now here's a
close-up<00:03:37.689> of<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.230> 120<00:03:38.739> millimeter<00:03:39.250> radiator

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
close-up of the 120 millimeter radiator

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.819 
close-up of the 120 millimeter radiator
again<00:03:40.840> I'm<00:03:40.959> showing<00:03:41.139> you<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.379> matte<00:03:41.620> black

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
again I'm showing you the matte black

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:48.119 
again I'm showing you the matte black
finish<00:03:42.099> which<00:03:42.669> is<00:03:42.819> nice<00:03:45.359> here<00:03:46.359> is<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:47.129> thin

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
finish which is nice here is the thin

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.649 
finish which is nice here is the thin
density<00:03:48.579> if<00:03:48.669> you<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.940> see<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.299> I'm<00:03:49.510> going<00:03:49.629> to

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
density if you can see it I'm going to

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.319 
density if you can see it I'm going to
try<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.840> move<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.169> around<00:03:51.060> pretty<00:03:52.060> busy

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
try to move it around pretty busy

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:00.449 
try to move it around pretty busy
actually<00:03:57.750> again<00:03:58.750> this<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.260> same<00:03:59.500> square

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
actually again this is the same square

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.979 
actually again this is the same square
style<00:04:00.879> similar<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.139> a<00:04:02.849> x-series<00:04:03.849> by<00:04:04.449> X<00:04:04.659> SPC

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
style similar to the a x-series by X SPC

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.659 
style similar to the a x-series by X SPC
and<00:04:10.680> I'm<00:04:11.680> pretty<00:04:12.009> sure<00:04:12.189> you<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.400> take<00:04:12.519> the

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
and I'm pretty sure you can take the

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.140 
and I'm pretty sure you can take the

all<00:04:50.540> right<00:04:50.720> now<00:04:50.990> one<00:04:51.230> thing<00:04:51.350> to<00:04:51.410> be<00:04:51.530> aware<00:04:51.710> of

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
all right now one thing to be aware of

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.470 
all right now one thing to be aware of
the<00:04:53.840> ports<00:04:54.290> are<00:04:54.650> actually<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.670> little<00:04:56.000> closer

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
the ports are actually a little closer

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.740 
the ports are actually a little closer
to<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.900> middle<00:04:57.080> then<00:04:57.290> some<00:04:57.590> radiators<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:58.750> if

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
to the middle then some radiators and if

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.440 
to the middle then some radiators and if
you<00:05:00.020> are<00:05:00.140> playing<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.770> vertical<00:05:01.460> build<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:02.030> you

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
you are playing a vertical build and you

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.840 
you are playing a vertical build and you
would<00:05:02.690> liked<00:05:02.900> these<00:05:03.590> ports<00:05:04.010> say<00:05:04.490> close<00:05:04.700> to

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
would liked these ports say close to

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.880 
would liked these ports say close to
here<00:05:05.150> this<00:05:05.900> is<00:05:06.080> probably<00:05:06.170> not<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.470> reader<00:05:06.860> to

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
here this is probably not the reader to

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.370 
here this is probably not the reader to
choose<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:07.640> just<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.570> let<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.720> know<00:05:08.870> they're<00:05:09.350> a

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
little toward the middle they're not Oh

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.020 
little toward the middle they're not Oh
get<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.080> here<00:05:12.350> or<00:05:12.530> here<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:12.950> it's<00:05:13.760> not<00:05:13.940> like

get it here or here and it's not like

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.670 
get it here or here and it's not like
some<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:14.570> other<00:05:14.870> radiators<00:05:15.380> where<00:05:15.560> you

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
some of the other radiators where you

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.620 
some of the other radiators where you
can<00:05:15.830> have<00:05:16.040> multiple<00:05:16.760> options<00:05:17.210> for<00:05:19.120> ports<00:05:20.120> it's

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
can have multiple options for ports it's

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.410 
can have multiple options for ports it's
only<00:05:20.810> two<00:05:21.220> obviously<00:05:22.220> for<00:05:23.030> 18<00:05:23.420> or<00:05:23.570> so<00:05:25.420> unlike

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
only two obviously for 18 or so unlike

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.600 
only two obviously for 18 or so unlike
the<00:05:28.900> Alpha<00:05:29.900> cool<00:05:30.140> Nexus<00:05:30.860> route<00:05:31.070> line<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.580> has

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
the Alpha cool Nexus route line it has

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.850 
the Alpha cool Nexus route line it has
multiple<00:05:32.210> ports<00:05:32.510> which<00:05:33.080> is<00:05:33.110> kind<00:05:33.410> of<00:05:33.440> cool<00:05:33.710> I

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
multiple ports which is kind of cool I

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.190 
multiple ports which is kind of cool I
basically<00:05:34.820> stuck<00:05:35.210> to<00:05:35.360> these<00:05:35.540> because<00:05:35.900> I

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
basically stuck to these because I

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
basically stuck to these because I
wanted<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.650> keep<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:36.920> all<00:05:37.190> EK<00:05:37.940> branded<00:05:38.830> for<00:05:39.830> my

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
wanted to keep it all EK branded for my

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.590 
wanted to keep it all EK branded for my
loop<00:05:41.020> now<00:05:42.020> obviously<00:05:43.120> you<00:05:44.120> can<00:05:44.150> use<00:05:44.300> whatever

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
loop now obviously you can use whatever

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600 
loop now obviously you can use whatever
it<00:05:44.840> is<00:05:44.960> you<00:05:45.170> like<00:05:45.320> doesn't<00:05:46.220> really<00:05:46.340> matter

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
it is you like doesn't really matter

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.220 
it is you like doesn't really matter
because<00:05:46.940> performance<00:05:47.360> is<00:05:47.630> pretty<00:05:47.840> similar<00:05:48.080> on

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
because performance is pretty similar on

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:59.830 
because performance is pretty similar on
all<00:05:48.470> ends

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.100 

now<00:06:00.840> he<00:06:01.139> came<00:06:01.410> cluded<00:06:02.099> these<00:06:02.280> um<00:06:02.750> g14<00:06:03.750> thready

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
now he came cluded these um g14 thready

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.550 
now he came cluded these um g14 thready
extenders<00:06:04.770> for<00:06:05.660> your<00:06:06.660> fittings<00:06:06.930> basically<00:06:09.560> ek

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
extenders for your fittings basically ek

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.170 
extenders for your fittings basically ek
says<00:06:10.860> that<00:06:11.159> these<00:06:11.370> are<00:06:11.430> absolutely<00:06:12.000> needed

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
says that these are absolutely needed

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.990 
says that these are absolutely needed
otherwise<00:06:13.280> it's<00:06:14.280> gonna<00:06:14.400> leak<00:06:14.699> around<00:06:14.940> the

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
otherwise it's gonna leak around the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.930 
otherwise it's gonna leak around the
fittings<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:15.560> that's<00:06:16.560> fine<00:06:16.770> I<00:06:17.009> mean<00:06:17.669> if<00:06:17.819> you

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
fittings and that's fine I mean if you

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.700 
fittings and that's fine I mean if you
don't<00:06:18.030> like<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.690> dreaded<00:06:18.990> extenders<00:06:21.710> don't

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
don't like the dreaded extenders don't

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.629 
don't like the dreaded extenders don't
get<00:06:22.889> this<00:06:22.979> radiator<00:06:23.629> now<00:06:24.629> now<00:06:25.139> I'm<00:06:25.289> gonna

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
get this radiator now now I'm gonna

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.950 
get this radiator now now I'm gonna
install<00:06:26.639> some<00:06:26.940> fittings<00:06:27.150> and<00:06:27.479> show<00:06:27.750> you<00:06:27.840> what

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
install some fittings and show you what

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.899 
install some fittings and show you what
it<00:06:28.020> looks<00:06:28.139> like<00:06:28.259> with<00:06:28.409> fittings<00:06:28.710> on<00:06:28.860> so<00:06:29.729> here

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
it looks like with fittings on so here

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:51.520 
it looks like with fittings on so here
again<00:06:30.150> with<00:06:30.300> the<00:06:30.360> Monson<00:06:30.750> rotaries

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.940 

and<00:06:53.300> that's<00:06:54.300> it<00:06:54.510> obviously<00:06:55.170> my<00:06:55.440> things<00:06:55.680> match

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
and that's it obviously my things match

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.790 
and that's it obviously my things match
very<00:06:56.100> well<00:06:56.220> cos<00:06:56.550> they're<00:06:56.820> both<00:06:56.970> matte<00:06:57.450> black

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
very well cos they're both matte black

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.520 
very well cos they're both matte black
so<00:06:58.800> it's<00:06:58.920> the<00:06:58.980> same<00:06:59.130> color<00:06:59.630> they<00:07:00.630> uh<00:07:00.660> look<00:07:01.350> good

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
so it's the same color they uh look good

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.310 
so it's the same color they uh look good
things<00:07:02.040> do<00:07:02.190> look<00:07:02.220> good<00:07:02.490> on<00:07:02.640> this<00:07:02.790> radiator

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.580 

office<00:07:07.320> you<00:07:07.410> can<00:07:07.530> still<00:07:07.740> see<00:07:07.980> the<00:07:08.100> extender

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
office you can still see the extender

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.340 
office you can still see the extender
which<00:07:10.590> is<00:07:10.740> fine<00:07:11.310> with<00:07:11.610> me<00:07:11.870> now<00:07:12.870> if<00:07:13.140> you<00:07:13.170> have

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.350 
which is fine with me now if you have

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.660 
which is fine with me now if you have
space<00:07:13.590> constraints<00:07:14.070> and<00:07:14.130> you<00:07:14.190> can't<00:07:14.430> use<00:07:14.550> the

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
space constraints and you can't use the

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:22.070 
space constraints and you can't use the
extender<00:07:15.060> do<00:07:15.780> not<00:07:16.050> buy<00:07:16.290> this<00:07:16.350> radiator<00:07:16.920> you<00:07:21.080> go

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
extender do not buy this radiator you go

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.500 
extender do not buy this radiator you go
this<00:07:22.530> is<00:07:22.680> D<00:07:22.890> 90<00:07:23.220> degree<00:07:23.520> adapters<00:07:23.970> I'm

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
this is D 90 degree adapters I'm

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.760 
this is D 90 degree adapters I'm
probably<00:07:24.900> gonna<00:07:25.110> have<00:07:25.290> to<00:07:25.350> play<00:07:25.500> with<00:07:25.650> this

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
probably gonna have to play with this

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.200 
probably gonna have to play with this
for<00:07:25.950> a<00:07:26.010> while<00:07:26.130> because<00:07:26.640> I<00:07:26.760> still<00:07:26.940> have<00:07:27.090> not

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.660 
for a while because I still have not
figured<00:07:27.360> out<00:07:27.540> my<00:07:27.750> loop<00:07:27.930> yet<00:07:28.970> and<00:07:31.490> that's<00:07:32.490> it

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:32.670 
figured out my loop yet and that's it

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.490 
figured out my loop yet and that's it
just<00:07:33.150> make<00:07:33.360> sure<00:07:33.510> this<00:07:33.660> radiator<00:07:34.050> fits<00:07:34.320> your

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 
just make sure this radiator fits your

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.680 
just make sure this radiator fits your
case<00:07:34.740> this<00:07:35.370> is<00:07:35.580> going<00:07:35.940> into<00:07:36.180> my<00:07:36.300> compact

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:36.690 
case this is going into my compact

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.280 
case this is going into my compact
splash<00:07:37.020> and<00:07:37.410> this<00:07:38.280> basically<00:07:38.760> just<00:07:39.290> barely

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 
splash and this basically just barely

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:46.210 
splash and this basically just barely
clears<00:07:40.770> the<00:07:40.860> case

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:46.220 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.340 

and<00:07:47.030> that's<00:07:47.480> it<00:07:47.660> for<00:07:47.840> my<00:07:48.340> unboxing
