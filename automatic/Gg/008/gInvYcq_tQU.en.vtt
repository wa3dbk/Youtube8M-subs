getting it but I'm always striving for
it<00:03:17.299> I<00:03:17.480> think<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.909> photography<00:03:20.629> I<00:03:20.659> do<00:03:20.930> as<00:03:21.799> a

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
it I think of the photography I do as a

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.180 
it I think of the photography I do as a
sport<00:03:22.849> as<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.090> competition<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.709> takes<00:03:24.980> effort

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
sport as a competition it takes effort

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.910 
sport as a competition it takes effort
it<00:03:25.819> takes<00:03:26.060> stamina<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:27.230> have<00:03:27.319> to<00:03:27.440> approach<00:03:27.709> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
it takes stamina you have to approach it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.250 
it takes stamina you have to approach it
almost<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.459> an<00:03:28.579> athlete<00:03:28.940> my<00:03:29.450> editor<00:03:29.810> can<00:03:30.049> put

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
almost like an athlete my editor can put

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.330 
almost like an athlete my editor can put
my<00:03:30.530> image<00:03:30.769> up<00:03:31.129> against<00:03:31.730> anybody<00:03:32.209> else's<00:03:32.659> and

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
my image up against anybody else's and

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.039 
my image up against anybody else's and
for<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.430> most<00:03:34.579> part<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:35.090> have<00:03:35.389> to<00:03:35.599> win<00:03:35.810> that

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
for the most part I have to win that

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.619 
for the most part I have to win that
battle<00:03:36.349> I<00:03:36.680> want<00:03:37.129> to<00:03:37.220> win<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.519> battle<00:03:37.760> I'm<00:03:38.389> not

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
battle I want to win that battle I'm not

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.720 
battle I want to win that battle I'm not
a<00:03:38.659> Michael<00:03:39.109> Jordan<00:03:39.379> I'm<00:03:39.709> not<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.889> Wayne<00:03:40.129> Gretzky

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
a Michael Jordan I'm not a Wayne Gretzky

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.759 
a Michael Jordan I'm not a Wayne Gretzky
but<00:03:41.180> it's<00:03:41.540> kind<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.989> same<00:03:42.260> thing<00:03:42.590> that

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
but it's kind of the same thing that

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.580 
but it's kind of the same thing that
drives<00:03:43.069> them<00:03:43.540> they<00:03:44.540> were<00:03:44.599> good<00:03:44.900> athletes<00:03:45.349> but

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
drives them they were good athletes but

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.229 
drives them they were good athletes but
they<00:03:45.739> had<00:03:45.829> something<00:03:46.129> else<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.849> that

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
they had something else that that

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.110 
they had something else that that
clicked<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:48.019> made<00:03:48.440> them<00:03:48.739> want<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.489> win<00:03:49.669> they

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
clicked that made them want to win they

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.210 
clicked that made them want to win they
push<00:03:50.480> themselves<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.260> that's<00:03:51.859> something

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
push themselves and that's something

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.009 
push themselves and that's something
that<00:03:52.519> I<00:03:52.549> think<00:03:52.819> every<00:03:53.030> photographer<00:03:53.629> needs<00:03:53.810> to

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
that I think every photographer needs to

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.659 
that I think every photographer needs to
do<00:03:54.139> as<00:03:54.260> well<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:55.129> have<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.340> approach<00:03:55.609> it

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
do as well you have to approach it

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.819 
do as well you have to approach it
almost<00:03:56.209> like<00:03:56.359> an<00:03:56.480> athlete<00:03:56.840> train<00:03:57.560> hard

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
almost like an athlete train hard

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.069 
almost like an athlete train hard
practice<00:03:58.430> hard

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
practice hard

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.210 
practice hard
don't<00:04:00.079> let<00:04:00.199> anybody<00:04:00.410> say<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.829> can't<00:04:01.069> be<00:04:01.129> done

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
don't let anybody say it can't be done

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.670 
don't let anybody say it can't be done
that<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.579> can't<00:04:01.849> win<00:04:02.199> just<00:04:03.199> keep<00:04:03.349> pushing

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
that you can't win just keep pushing

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.650 
that you can't win just keep pushing
ahead<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.040> you'll<00:04:04.160> win<00:04:04.370> I'll<00:04:05.120> be<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.480> first

together the concentration just gets

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.040 
together the concentration just gets
funneled<00:04:45.650> in<00:04:46.010> everything<00:04:46.820> turns<00:04:47.210> into<00:04:47.479> magic

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
fourth quarter or the third period I

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.170 
fourth quarter or the third period I
have<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.110> be<00:05:03.199> fine-tuned<00:05:03.889> so<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.669> don't<00:05:04.970> miss

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
have to be fine-tuned so I don't miss

that<00:05:05.210> shot<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:06.050> think<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:07.100> just<00:05:07.250> something

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610

that shot I think it's just something
you<00:05:08.570> know<00:05:08.690> pretty<00:05:08.930> deep<00:05:09.199> down<00:05:10.210> down<00:05:11.210> inside

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
you know pretty deep down down inside

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.180 
you know pretty deep down down inside
there's<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.160> joy<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.669> comes<00:05:13.820> from<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.240> from

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
there's a joy that comes from it from

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.680 
there's a joy that comes from it from
accomplishment<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.430> think<00:05:16.910> that's<00:05:17.090> why<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.270> sort

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
accomplishment I think that's why I sort

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.839 
accomplishment I think that's why I sort
of<00:05:17.810> explode<00:05:18.530> with<00:05:18.800> excitement<00:05:18.830> when<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.580> get<00:05:19.820> a

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
of explode with excitement when I get a

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:20.620 
of explode with excitement when I get a
great<00:05:20.090> shot

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
great shot

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.589 
great shot
it's<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.470> overcoming<00:05:22.370> of<00:05:22.520> everything<00:05:23.419> that

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
it's the overcoming of everything that

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.900 
it's the overcoming of everything that
goes<00:05:23.780> on<00:05:23.990> around<00:05:24.050> sometimes<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:25.220> can<00:05:25.400> be<00:05:25.430> lay

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
goes on around sometimes it can be lay

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.300 
goes on around sometimes it can be lay
some<00:05:26.450> on<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.990> set<00:05:27.200> of<00:05:27.289> face<00:05:27.470> and<00:05:27.770> when<00:05:28.039> you<00:05:28.160> go

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
some on the set of face and when you go

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.540 
some on the set of face and when you go
down<00:05:28.580> it's<00:05:28.970> just<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:30.110> quiet<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:31.099> somehow<00:05:31.400> you

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
down it's just so quiet and somehow you

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.730 
down it's just so quiet and somehow you
have<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:31.849> narrow<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:32.870> down<00:05:32.900> and<00:05:33.229> just<00:05:33.470> like<00:05:33.620> an

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
have to narrow it down and just like an
