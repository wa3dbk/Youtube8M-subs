similar the Z T's got an 800 megahertz
processor<00:02:47.079> if<00:02:48.079> we<00:02:48.319> remove<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:49.159> back<00:02:49.370> cover

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
processor if we remove the back cover

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.349 
processor if we remove the back cover
we'll<00:02:50.840> also<00:02:51.019> find<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.829> it's<00:02:52.010> got<00:02:52.159> a<00:02:52.370> micro<00:02:53.000> SD

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
we'll also find that it's got a micro SD

32<00:02:56.799> gigabytes<00:02:57.879> so<00:02:58.879> you've<00:02:58.969> got<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.150> sim<00:02:59.329> card

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
32 gigabytes so you've got the sim card

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.080 
32 gigabytes so you've got the sim card
slot<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.199> we've<00:03:00.949> got<00:03:01.159> an<00:03:01.250> unusual<00:03:01.639> shaped

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090
