00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
guys spill it a little bit differently

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.029 
guys spill it a little bit differently
but<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.309> go<00:00:15.139> now<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.440> my<00:00:16.560> leaf<00:00:16.800> mold

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
but here we go now this is my leaf mold

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.370 
but here we go now this is my leaf mold
pal<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:18.240> see<00:00:18.420> here<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.720> get<00:00:18.810> behind<00:00:18.990> here

pal you see here you get behind here

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.920 
pal you see here you get behind here
this<00:00:19.560> big<00:00:19.830> deciduous<00:00:20.820> tree<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.570> rake<00:00:21.750> up

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
this big deciduous tree you just rake up

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.300 
this big deciduous tree you just rake up
the<00:00:22.050> leaves<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.500> dump<00:00:22.680> them<00:00:22.830> all<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:22.949> here

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the leaves and dump them all in here

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.109 
the leaves and dump them all in here
that's<00:00:23.550> all<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.789> do

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
that's all you do

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.029 
that's all you do
leaf<00:00:24.390> mold<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> easiest<00:00:25.230> kind<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.590> compost

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
leaf mold is the easiest kind of compost

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
leaf mold is the easiest kind of compost
in<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> world<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:27.029> all<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.930> got<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> do

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in the world because all you got to do

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.839 
in the world because all you got to do
is<00:00:28.439> save<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> leaves<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> leaves<00:00:29.699> will

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
is save the leaves and the leaves will

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.359 
is save the leaves and the leaves will
break<00:00:30.510> down<00:00:30.539> over<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> course<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> year<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
break down over the course of a year to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.030 
break down over the course of a year to
three<00:00:32.730> years<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:34.020> faster<00:00:34.440> way<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
three years the faster way to do it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.940 
three years the faster way to do it
would<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:36.469> run<00:00:37.469> them<00:00:37.559> through<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.770> lawn

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
would be to run them through a lawn

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.889 
would be to run them through a lawn
mower<00:00:38.219> or<00:00:38.250> weed<00:00:38.730> eater<00:00:38.910> something<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.629> that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
mower or weed eater something like that

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.639 
mower or weed eater something like that
dump<00:00:40.500> them<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.059> in

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
dump them in here now this and in

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.590 
dump them in here now this and in
January<00:00:43.649> or<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.309> almost<00:00:44.820> running<00:00:45.149> over

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
January or so was almost running over

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420 
January or so was almost running over
and<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.469> already<00:00:46.620> breaking<00:00:47.250> down

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and you see it's already breaking down

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
and you see it's already breaking down
and<00:00:47.969> some<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.840> collapsing<00:00:49.440> just

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and some of that's just collapsing just

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.830 
and some of that's just collapsing just
from<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> from<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> rains<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.420> stuff<00:00:51.600> make

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
from the from the rains and stuff make

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
from the from the rains and stuff make
it<00:00:51.989> compact<00:00:52.469> more<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> stuff<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.640> here

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it compact more but the stuff down here

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.830 
it compact more but the stuff down here
at<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> bottom<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.690> it's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
at the bottom as you can see it's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.779 
at the bottom as you can see it's
breaking<00:00:55.440> down<00:00:55.469> much<00:00:55.890> better<00:00:56.219> than<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> stuff

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
breaking down much better than the stuff

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.150 
breaking down much better than the stuff
you<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.469> I'll<00:00:58.680> probably<00:00:58.829> add<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you see here and so I'll probably add a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
you see here and so I'll probably add a
few<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.180> sometimes<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
few more and then sometimes in the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.369 
few more and then sometimes in the
summer<00:01:01.789> take<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:02.969> whole<00:01:03.239> thing<00:01:03.539> off<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
summer take this whole thing off and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.149 
summer take this whole thing off and
then<00:01:05.570> move<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.170> know<00:01:07.290> down<00:01:07.830> aways<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
then move it you know down aways and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
then move it you know down aways and
then<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.640> turn<00:01:08.850> everything<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> kill

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
then in turn everything you need to kill

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.490 
then in turn everything you need to kill
that<00:01:10.020> slapping<00:01:11.360> now<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:12.990> leaf<00:01:13.200> mold

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that slapping now this is not leaf mold

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.080 
that slapping now this is not leaf mold
it's<00:01:13.680> leaves<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.189> using<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.670> mulch<00:01:14.909> in

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's leaves that I'm using for mulch in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.440 
it's leaves that I'm using for mulch in
one<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.479> beds<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.799> see<00:01:17.070> what's

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
one of my beds but you can see what's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.289 
one of my beds but you can see what's
possible<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.490> basically<00:01:20.700> use<00:01:21.090> leaf

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
possible and you can basically use leaf

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
possible and you can basically use leaf
mold<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> peat<00:01:22.259> moss<00:01:22.409> substitute<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> makes

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
mold as a peat moss substitute it makes

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.440 
mold as a peat moss substitute it makes
also<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:24.030> retains<00:01:24.540> water<00:01:24.659> well<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.380> great

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
also it retains water well it's a great

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.640 
also it retains water well it's a great
it's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.630> great<00:01:29.900> mulch<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.290> why<00:01:31.439> I'm<00:01:31.530> trying

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
it's a great mulch that's why I'm trying

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's a great mulch that's why I'm trying
to<00:01:31.770> sing<00:01:33.200> see<00:01:34.430> another<00:01:35.430> way<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to sing see another way you can do this

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.910 
to sing see another way you can do this
is<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.750> some<00:01:36.780> black<00:01:37.079> bags<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
is just put in some black bags like this

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
is just put in some black bags like this
maybe<00:01:38.610> poke<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> couple<00:01:39.360> holes<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> bottom

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
maybe poke a couple holes in the bottom

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.050 
maybe poke a couple holes in the bottom
so<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> water<00:01:40.530> drains<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.729> once<00:01:41.909> again

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so the water drains out and once again

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
so the water drains out and once again
the<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.810> fastest<00:01:43.290> way<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the the fastest way to do it is just to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.429 
the the fastest way to do it is just to
get<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.549> lawnmower<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:45.869> put<00:01:46.020> them<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.259> there

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
get your lawnmower but put them in there

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.020 
get your lawnmower but put them in there
and<00:01:46.470> let<00:01:46.710> them<00:01:46.799> sit<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.490> year<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and let them sit there for a year and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.429 
and let them sit there for a year and
they'll<00:01:48.149> probably<00:01:48.270> turn<00:01:48.930> out<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.350> bit

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
they'll probably turn out a little bit

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.770 
they'll probably turn out a little bit
faster<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.070> way<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.549> usually<00:01:50.970> keep<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.479> bag

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
faster that way I usually keep this bag

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.660 
faster that way I usually keep this bag
near<00:01:52.229> my<00:01:52.409> beds<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.640> just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
near my beds as you can see I can just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460 
near my beds as you can see I can just
put<00:01:53.970> some<00:01:54.000> leaves<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.570> whenever<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.049> needed<00:01:55.259> as

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
put some leaves in whenever I needed as

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.420 
put some leaves in whenever I needed as
a<00:01:55.500> mulch<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.799> there's<00:01:58.799> another<00:01:59.130> angle

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
a mulch so and there's another angle

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.340 
a mulch so and there's another angle
just<00:02:00.030> let<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> was<00:02:01.020> just

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
just let you know that it was just

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.639 
just let you know that it was just
running<00:02:01.649> over<00:02:02.159> running<00:02:02.939> over<00:02:03.240> completely<00:02:03.719> and

running over running over completely and

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.809 
running over running over completely and
that's<00:02:05.490> how<00:02:05.670> much<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.030> compacted<00:02:07.429> and<00:02:08.429> there

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
