so I'm going to go to the Mickey sheet
that<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.370> use<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.880> should<00:02:28.090> have<00:02:28.180> marked<00:02:28.330> me<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:28.870> I

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
that I use I should have marked me but I

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.610 
that I use I should have marked me but I
did<00:02:29.170> not<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.720> bear<00:02:31.900> with<00:02:31.930> me<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.320> just<00:02:32.380> a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
did not so bear with me for just a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.760 
did not so bear with me for just a
second<00:02:32.950> here<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.140> will<00:02:35.290> find<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> page

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
second here and I will find the page

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.060 
second here and I will find the page
this<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.550> one<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.080> used<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.860> as<00:02:38.890> you

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
this is the one that I used so as you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.710 
this is the one that I used so as you
can<00:02:39.250> see<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.760> cut<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.060> into<00:02:40.330> six<00:02:40.570> by

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
can see you can cut this into six by

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.090 
can see you can cut this into six by
sixes<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.320> that's<00:02:41.440> what<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> did

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
sixes and that's what I did

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.500 
sixes and that's what I did
so<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.120> used<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.630> one<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.470> then<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.640> used<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
so I used that one and then I used the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.860 
so I used that one and then I used the
Minnie<00:02:47.410> Mouse<00:02:47.500> one<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.310> designed

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
Minnie Mouse one that is designed

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.509 
Minnie Mouse one that is designed
relatively<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.020> same<00:02:50.200> way<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:51.100> those<00:02:51.280> are<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
relatively the same way so those are the

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.340 
relatively the same way so those are the
papers<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:52.030> use<00:02:52.269> like<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.660> said<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> got<00:02:53.019> these<00:02:53.170> at

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350
