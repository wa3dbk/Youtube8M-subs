00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 Akishev storm backpack 40 40 liters version 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.629
 2 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.340
 immediately looks like a classic 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.360
 trekking backpack without any special 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.070
 frills 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.230
 I really liked to shoot on my 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.570
 look they have someone with them given 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.279
 stifling like night when they are all the same 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
 like that here in this part sit easier not 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 unloading system dangling by the way 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 tough enough much tougher than 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.810
 straps here here are solid profile stitched 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.640
 there are pockets it is good at the end we 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 let's try to own but I predict in advance 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 what sit nbu is the purpose 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.130
 but because she has no choice with this 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 the parties lived so want to pay attention 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.460
 on the mesh here you can take for example 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.829
 swimming trunks and they will dry 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.070
 or a small towel we have it not 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.530
 write we will add late goods somewhere 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.690
 We look at the sides there are pockets size 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.180
 utyazhki it is important to reflect this to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.309
 sorry for my taste small to 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.500
 here the chair should be squeezed tightly so 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.629
 in all of this is not clear to pull on months 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.160
 even in the bottom pocket or not, but now 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.489
 when is it time to move on the rug 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.539
 so plus minus 1st degree for 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.790
 trekking poles 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.520
 very well made ballad me stick 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 for a nordic wand look coming out 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.180
 important 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.060
 here are the holes dehydrator carefully what 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.670
 all joy on the other hand all the same 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.250
 without any innovation whats here x 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.650
 top here it seems until I have a backpack 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.800
 lives long lives normal question not 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.270
 I have protection there is a mount under the ice 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.710
 tool is such a backpack 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.869
 gathering maybe took that is he 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.880
 now sit well because without the most 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.490
 times the volume just right you do not mind 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.710
 welding single fixture 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 it’s not ours that it’s very 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.649
 often done on mountain backpacks like 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.229
 times for appeals from people 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.200
 us hands mittens us easier here is one 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.940
 press once and connect one piece plus 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.509
 again some special load over here 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.600
 not here 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.399
 valve sins so often do let rub 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.570
 fusion usually avoid such a solution 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.009
 here he did not avoid 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.420
 respectively, which is a special load 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.759
 on here is not there that is, we cannot 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.860
 pile on a lot and from all sides utyagivat 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.630
 so ok even though once again we 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.080
 come club and we let's see no 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.860
 whether here 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:17.170
 cover but here it is not 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.510
 volume well so volume is enough a couple of bowls 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.970
 I think the burner will fit the same as the steering wheel 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.490
 and make and even leave me like 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.300
 wear royal food for convenience 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.570
 It will fall so if here the first case is the body 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.230
 I do not see well I looked on this side 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:40.600
 no for sure there is nowhere else too so 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:44.770
 we open the secret inside 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.709
 pocket off unlike backpack boxing not 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.530
 could not really important had happened to that here 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.959
 and back to the word youtube registrar 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.720
 mounted back he has his pocket up 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.300
 here it goes about triangular here this 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.830
 No, this course from the inside burned this 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.690
 processing why by the way is more serious than 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.400
 usually it seems to me really 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.140
 will not squander that confirms in 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.320
 the principal is more likely a destination 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.270
 so open here I like this one 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.920
 the element is very easy to stretch 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.790
 quite easy to fix but again 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.349
 i would prefer on in classic incomprehensible 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.260
 won't this thing break somewhere 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.659
 real tough conditions open up 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.430
 Here, too, all along the wick 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.859
 filmed field and toning 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.890
 the valve is nothing special on top 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.890
 will you help you have fastenings if the mount 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.569
 from a separate reinforcement under the hydrator i 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.299
 medic like i love fake farm on 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.739
 the marriage phase I see by which there is a part 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.920
 unloading system there is enough 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.340
 thin with a small profile and 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.829
 it's not aluminum, but there is some kind of plastic 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.150
 opposite material we did not break such 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:01.939
 I understood why Luxor 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:07.819
 so now we will see she was 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:13.909
 inserted left it was bend 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:16.459
 outward respectively until finally 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.289
 this is a smart backpack is a plus minus because 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.479
 Now that the system can understand want 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.009
 one much tormented by the question of the meaning of that 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.539
 she does not occupy extra space Odessa 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.940
 just enough to get a backpack 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.510
 collapse in private ownership 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.130
 not a backpack in absentia liked this skill 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.110
 Uzakov mushrooms for people who want 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.730
 to save 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:43.070
 leftovers so he went some summer 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:45.710
 travel dressed 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.760
 from need to lower lower to destroy 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.010
 start work and do not like 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:05:00.110

00:04:52.010 --> 00:05:01.610
 glance easily wrinkled oh yes sit there

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.310
 even they ran a little yes a little 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.560
 still runs away about feeling not much 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.150
 tight enough that formally I will say 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.860
 something still passed like this not 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.960
