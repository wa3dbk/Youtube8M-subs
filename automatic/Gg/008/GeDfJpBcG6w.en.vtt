any eggs of weevils that happened to be

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.970 
any eggs of weevils that happened to be
in<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> Maggs<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.800> hatch

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
in there because the Maggs will hatch

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.389 
in there because the Maggs will hatch
and<00:00:53.539> your<00:00:54.539> popcorn<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.710> completely<00:00:56.160> filled

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and your popcorn get completely filled

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.389 
and your popcorn get completely filled
with<00:00:56.550> weevils

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
with weevils

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.689 
with weevils
this<00:00:59.399> much<00:00:59.670> popcorn<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.399> don't<00:01:02.460> know<00:01:02.670> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
this much popcorn and I don't know I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
this much popcorn and I don't know I
guess<00:01:02.940> that's<00:01:03.149> about<00:01:03.300> 300<00:01:03.899> calories<00:01:04.430> maybe

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
guess that's about 300 calories maybe

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.899 
guess that's about 300 calories maybe
less<00:01:05.700> than<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.530> will<00:01:07.530> make<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.950> much<00:01:08.220> once

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
less than that will make this much once

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
less than that will make this much once
it's<00:01:09.090> popped<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.110> got<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.500> always<00:01:10.860> pop

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it's popped and we got we always pop

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.719 
it's popped and we got we always pop
ours<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.549> electric<00:01:11.939> air<00:01:12.119> popper<00:01:13.580> but<00:01:14.580> all

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
ours with electric air popper but all

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.840 
ours with electric air popper but all
you<00:01:14.880> need<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.210> heat<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.810> pop<00:01:15.990> popcorn<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.220> if

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you need is heat to pop popcorn so if

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670 
you need is heat to pop popcorn so if

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you got a fire you can still pop it you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.240 
you got a fire you can still pop it you

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
something that I learned a long time ago

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.330 
something that I learned a long time ago
and<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.229> didn't<00:01:28.439> learn<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:28.860> black<00:01:29.040> pepper

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

and I didn't learn it with black pepper
I<00:01:29.490> learned<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:29.939> actual<00:01:30.299> weevils<00:01:30.689> weevils

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I learned it with actual weevils weevils

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.560 
I learned it with actual weevils weevils
kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.880> resemble<00:01:32.880> black<00:01:33.060> pepper<00:01:33.360> they're

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
kind of resemble black pepper they're

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
kind of resemble black pepper they're
real<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.320> they've<00:01:34.650> tiny<00:01:35.610> black

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
real little and they've tiny black

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.100 
real little and they've tiny black
specks<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.570> might<00:01:39.750> look<00:01:39.900> something

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
specks and they might look something

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.609 
specks and they might look something
like<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
like this see if you can see that on you

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.550 
like this see if you can see that on you
it<00:01:43.619> might<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.430> too<00:01:44.579> close

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it might be too close

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.940 
it might be too close
but<00:01:47.310> anyhow<00:01:48.320> I'm<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> show<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.710> how<00:01:49.890> we

and this much popcorn seeds pop it and

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.630 
and this much popcorn seeds pop it and
you<00:03:51.060> make<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.269> very<00:03:51.840> very<00:03:52.320> calorie<00:03:53.070> dense<00:03:53.340> food

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
you make a very very calorie dense food

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.009 
you make a very very calorie dense food
and<00:03:53.940> then<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.150> drink<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.420> little<00:03:54.600> salt<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:54.989> it

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
and then it's drink a little salt on it

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.660 
and then it's drink a little salt on it
and<00:03:55.290> all<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.829> reason<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.100> mentioned<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.489> oil

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
and all the reason I mentioned the oil

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.949 
and all the reason I mentioned the oil
is<00:03:56.850> because<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.060> salt<00:03:57.299> won't<00:03:57.450> stick<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.870> it

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
is because the salt won't stick to it

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.420 
is because the salt won't stick to it
without<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.350> oil<00:03:58.500> but<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.769> oil<00:03:58.829> is<00:03:59.130> part<00:03:59.400> of

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
without the oil but the oil is part of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.300 
without the oil but the oil is part of
the<00:03:59.579> nutritional<00:04:00.359> value<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.930> snack<00:04:01.310> if

the nutritional value of the snack if

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.479 
the nutritional value of the snack if
you<00:04:03.109> if<00:04:04.109> you<00:04:04.290> had<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.709> much<00:04:04.920> butter<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.400> would

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
you if you had that much butter it would

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.699 
you if you had that much butter it would
go<00:04:05.609> rancid<00:04:06.060> before<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.540> run<00:04:06.900> out<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.410> just

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
go rancid before you run out but just

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.660 
go rancid before you run out but just
straight<00:04:08.540> filtered<00:04:09.540> oil<00:04:09.950> lasts<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.160> long<00:04:11.310> time

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.170 
straight filtered oil lasts a long time
without<00:04:11.880> going<00:04:12.180> bad<00:04:12.510> oh<00:04:13.549> well<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.790> don't<00:04:15.000> think

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
without going bad oh well I don't think

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.319 
without going bad oh well I don't think
there's<00:04:15.329> anything<00:04:15.569> else<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.989> add<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.530> but

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
there's anything else to add to that but

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.120 
there's anything else to add to that but
the<00:04:18.329> what<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:18.870> told<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.320> about<00:04:19.350> putting
