have<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.780> slide<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.350> one<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:06.290> prior<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
have to slide that one in prior to

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.350 
have to slide that one in prior to
bolting<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.160> because<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.489> one<00:03:08.670> will<00:03:08.819> not<00:03:09.000> fit

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
bolting it because that one will not fit

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.390 
bolting it because that one will not fit
after<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.110> have<00:03:10.290> bolted<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.799> seat<00:03:11.010> track<00:03:11.250> in

after you have bolted the seat track in

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.390 
after you have bolted the seat track in
place<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.810> now<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.680> do<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.100> we<00:03:14.250> actually

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
place so now what we do is we actually

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.680 
place so now what we do is we actually
take<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.940> seat<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.450> we<00:03:15.660> pivot<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.170> back

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
take the seat and we pivot it back

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.509 
take the seat and we pivot it back
reason<00:03:18.690> doing<00:03:19.079> that<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.500> there's<00:03:19.980> srs

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
reason doing that is there's srs

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.670 
reason doing that is there's srs
connectors<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.450> all<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.870> stuff<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.200> once

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
connectors and all that stuff that once

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.710 
connectors and all that stuff that once
you<00:03:22.829> disconnect<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.459> will<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.880> an<00:03:24.030> SRS<00:03:24.450> light

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
you disconnect it will have an SRS light

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.770 
you disconnect it will have an SRS light
on<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.799> now<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.700> where<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.150> have<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.630> use

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
on so now here is where you have to use

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.870 
on so now here is where you have to use
your<00:03:27.989> razor<00:03:28.230> blade<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.799> cut<00:03:29.010> into<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.459> carpet

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.030 
your razor blade and cut into the carpet
this<00:03:30.030> was<00:03:30.269> previously<00:03:30.690> cut<00:03:30.989> before<00:03:31.440> obviously

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
this was previously cut before obviously

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.650 
this was previously cut before obviously
they<00:03:32.519> have<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.670> battery<00:03:33.090> removed<00:03:33.359> at<00:03:33.540> one

for the bolt going all the way towards
the<00:03:42.959> front<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.440> where<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.130> front<00:03:44.519> bolts<00:03:44.880> will

the front of where the front bolts will

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.080 
the front of where the front bolts will
fit<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:46.170> makes<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.620> almost<00:03:46.829> like<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> like<00:03:48.060> a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
up we're short on space here

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.280 
up we're short on space here
reason<00:03:56.940> doing<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.569> this<00:03:57.750> way<00:03:57.810> instead<00:03:58.109> of

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
reason doing it this way instead of

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.960 
reason doing it this way instead of
removing<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.680> whole<00:03:58.709> seat<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.700> because

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
removing the whole seat is just because

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.420 
removing the whole seat is just because
you<00:04:00.870> don't<00:04:00.959> have<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.260> deal<00:04:01.410> with<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.620> SRS<00:04:02.130> like

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
you don't have to deal with the SRS like

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.110 
you don't have to deal with the SRS like
afterwards<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:04.140> here<00:04:04.620> there<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:05.790> vent

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
afterwards so here there is this vent

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.920 
afterwards so here there is this vent
that<00:04:06.480> circulates<00:04:07.380> or<00:04:07.680> moves<00:04:08.220> air<00:04:08.700> from<00:04:09.209> the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
that circulates or moves air from the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.500 
that circulates or moves air from the
center<00:04:10.200> vent<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:11.190> rear<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.880> your<00:04:12.000> second

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
center vent to the rear for your second

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.060 
center vent to the rear for your second
row<00:04:12.600> seat<00:04:12.870> there<00:04:13.139> so<00:04:14.130> now<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.489> is<00:04:14.700> held<00:04:14.940> in<00:04:15.120> by

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
row seat there so now this is held in by

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.860 
row seat there so now this is held in by
four<00:04:17.070> 10<00:04:17.579> millimeter<00:04:18.080> plastic<00:04:19.669> nuts<00:04:20.870> we're

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
we're the ones in the rear a little bit

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.450 
we're the ones in the rear a little bit
hard<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.900> see<00:04:26.500> you're<00:04:26.979> not<00:04:27.099> going<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.280> fully

remove them you can if you want to but a

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.100 
remove them you can if you want to but a
trick<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.699> you<00:04:30.970> take<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.210> ten<00:04:31.509> millimeter

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.770 

wrench<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:36.340> just<00:04:36.550> loosen<00:04:36.940> them<00:04:37.030> as<00:04:37.240> much

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
wrench and you just loosen them as much

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.260 
wrench and you just loosen them as much
as<00:04:37.960> possible<00:04:38.020> or<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.220> can<00:04:39.370> take<00:04:39.520> them<00:04:39.669> out<00:04:39.819> it

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
as possible or you can take them out it

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.600 
as possible or you can take them out it
doesn't<00:04:40.449> really<00:04:40.630> matter<00:04:40.930> but<00:04:41.830> when<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.430> do

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
doesn't really matter but when you do

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.210 
doesn't really matter but when you do
that<00:04:42.849> you<00:04:43.210> can<00:04:43.360> move<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:44.440> plastic<00:04:45.190> piece

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
that you can move that plastic piece

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.330 
that you can move that plastic piece
which<00:04:45.970> I'll<00:04:46.270> show<00:04:46.569> you<00:04:46.599> later<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:47.740> can<00:04:47.919> pop<00:04:48.130> it

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
which I'll show you later you can pop it

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.080 
which I'll show you later you can pop it
up<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.639> then<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:49.000> has<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.330> slide<00:04:49.599> forward<00:04:51.090> just

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
up and then it has to slide forward just

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.670 
up and then it has to slide forward just
like<00:04:52.270> this<00:04:52.449> one<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.780> pops<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.199> in<00:04:53.319> the<00:04:53.440> front

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
like this one it pops up in the front

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.120 
like this one it pops up in the front
and<00:04:54.300> then<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.330> slide<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.900> forward<00:04:56.130> leaving

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
and then I slide it forward leaving

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.830 
and then I slide it forward leaving
those<00:04:57.310> two<00:04:57.340> ten<00:04:57.880> millimeters<00:04:58.389> in<00:04:58.599> there

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
those two ten millimeters in there

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.330 
those two ten millimeters in there
because<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.110> little<00:04:59.319> bit<00:04:59.530> hard<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.770> get<00:04:59.979> to<00:05:00.159> but

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
because a little bit hard to get to but

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.740 
because a little bit hard to get to but
if<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.580> want<00:05:00.789> you<00:05:00.970> can<00:05:01.120> remove<00:05:01.180> them<00:05:01.509> all<00:05:01.630> the

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
if you want you can remove them all the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.830 
if you want you can remove them all the
way<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.650> is<00:05:02.710> what<00:05:03.009> it<00:05:03.130> looks<00:05:03.340> like<00:05:03.840> that

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
way and this is what it looks like that

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.990 
way and this is what it looks like that
vent<00:05:05.139> piece<00:05:05.409> is<00:05:05.680> actually<00:05:05.889> towards<00:05:06.639> the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
vent piece is actually towards the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.140 
vent piece is actually towards the
center<00:05:07.569> console<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:09.310> this<00:05:09.520> actually<00:05:09.909> fits

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
center console so this actually fits

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.570 
center console so this actually fits
your<00:05:10.360> opposite<00:05:11.199> way<00:05:11.349> as<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:12.069> can<00:05:12.220> see<00:05:12.370> there's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
your opposite way as you can see there's

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.629 
your opposite way as you can see there's
four<00:05:12.819> nuts<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.330> hold<00:05:13.479> it<00:05:13.659> in<00:05:13.720> place<00:05:14.550> once<00:05:15.550> you

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
four nuts that hold it in place once you

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.790 
four nuts that hold it in place once you
have<00:05:15.819> removed<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:17.259> battery<00:05:17.590> is<00:05:17.710> not

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
have removed that the battery is not

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.089 
have removed that the battery is not
accessible<00:05:18.310> and<00:05:18.639> you<00:05:19.000> can<00:05:19.180> see<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:20.770> vent

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
accessible and you can see that vent

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.230 
accessible and you can see that vent
right<00:05:21.250> there<00:05:21.310> actually<00:05:21.550> goes<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:22.060> center

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
right there actually goes to the center

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.710 
right there actually goes to the center
console<00:05:22.599> facing<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.110> front<00:05:24.180> so<00:05:25.180> now<00:05:25.389> this<00:05:25.659> is

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
console facing the front so now this is

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.659 
console facing the front so now this is
the<00:05:25.930> battery<00:05:26.409> we're<00:05:26.860> going<00:05:27.039> to<00:05:27.099> be<00:05:27.250> removing

remove that first when removing and then

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.990 
remove that first when removing and then
that<00:05:37.719> is<00:05:37.900> your<00:05:38.020> positive<00:05:38.500> which<00:05:38.770> is<00:05:38.800> red<00:05:39.250> there

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
that is your positive which is red there

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
a lip opposite that side so if you

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.309 
a lip opposite that side so if you
removing<00:06:16.030> it<00:06:16.150> it's<00:06:16.449> going<00:06:16.659> to<00:06:16.719> go<00:06:16.840> towards<00:06:17.259> the

see again there's a straight side that's
actually<00:06:38.510> facing<00:06:38.930> the<00:06:39.020> battery<00:06:39.380> and<00:06:39.620> the

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
actually facing the battery and the

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.780 
actually facing the battery and the
other<00:06:41.090> side<00:06:41.450> is<00:06:41.720> towards<00:06:42.140> the<00:06:42.530> vehicle<00:06:43.190> so
