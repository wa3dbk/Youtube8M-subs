 hand processing 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.529
 that he allows significantly 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.019
 to save 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.019
 resources and time are needed for 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.459
 which is very important when performing 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.339
 in large volumes 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.099
