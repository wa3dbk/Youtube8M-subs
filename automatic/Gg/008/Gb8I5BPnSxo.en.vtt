00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.419
 today's light the top which I would like to explain to you comes with two 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.750
 I then out once we have to the right side 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.399
 and because leadership ability is one of the TVA's 60 by 90 tall of boxing 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.319
 Great background, we are still a strip pain 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:32.649
 whose tasks I'll write more right now comes to first 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:33.970
 leadership circle 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.990
 this is only from the right side 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.270
 used around the model 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.570
 that is the model is not frontally lit but exclusively by 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.450
 the side 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.650
 here can the light intensity 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.740
 This management team does not measure anything that's why suddenly 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.750
 Do not forget the knife 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.159
 measure the whole time and come to a front panel 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.310
 8th 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.910
 In principle, the jobs could be defined in this way 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.700
 that our part is also the aperture 8 that means it is going out 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.219
 the position of the camera was from the front here also with a screen 8 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.409
 photographed but that does not mean our case 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.690
 that's the front of the model 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.750
 he complains of a diaphragm 8 corresponds to no 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.820
 the aperture 8 which is measured from the side of the light source and that here the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.190
 is called the front side of the model 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.700
 is a little underexposed but that's exactly the effect we are 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.120
 to achieve 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.800
 you can take pictures of the whole picture 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.670
 and I've already done that in the meantime and splendor you now 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.610
 the finished result 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.150
 and you see it coming exclusively ahead of percent left by neighbor council 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.200
 Seen from the side a beautiful 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.310
 Pages not 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.789
 on the model around the front section of the model is beautiful black 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.249
 that is exactly the effect of the text we have here in ours 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.890
 Want to achieve an example 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.899
 let's get to the second light source 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.999
 and luck stays in the background 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.119
 In the end, it should fulfill three different tasks 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:19.609
 on the one hand it serves as Hagen light even if our model 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.789
 today, especially little hair on the head bath despite everything 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.789
 you also have to imagine the situation that his no even with me 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.749
 a primacy the model is in front yes and we can with this piece remains the 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:36.659
 Hair to brighten up the other should the shadow area here in the front 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.780
 Area of ​​the model with the strip suffering something to be lightened up and 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.709
 The model is supposed to be triggered by the light around Harald Heck 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.869
 also be separated from the background 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:53.129
 and luck remains fulfilled the purpose that here at the edge of the model 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.839
 I want it can not be set and thus the model of the background 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:03.269
 something is lifted so the whole shot is a little more plastic 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.669
 The model fir upsets me with the background 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.279
 Let's do it the second I just torment 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.079
 and we just have to ask ourselves the question in which light 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.279
 relationship 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.289
 because the main light 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.289
 In addition, it should remain 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.409
 to a relatively beautiful did not know what to produce but not eaten 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.599
 appear 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.659
 you should check it exposes a diaphragm over 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.509
 For guiding light that means we had an aperture here 8 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.169
 measured and should then accordingly at the strip sorry 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.680
 I've measured that out about an aperture 11 we've already measured 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.039
 check if this value is still correct 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.019
 we measure once 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.209
 in the pages sets and determine the light meter shows us one 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.519
 Aperture 11 on 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.040
 perhaps the question is still open why we have a so-called here 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.969
 Lattice inserted into the happiness suffering 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.930
 the whole has the advantage that relatively little stray light goes towards the camera 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.089
 So the danger is not that their low-contrast almost to 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:18.939
 in the picture due to one receiving nothing about Zion and the light around 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.349
 simply dips even nicer place Jacques the sale that 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.129
 model 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.309
 the whole and photographed 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:28.120
 and you get that as a result now 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.780
 that was a lot of fun imitating it until next time
