photogenic<00:01:05.600> primer<00:01:06.619> this<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> primer

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
photogenic primer this is the primer

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.469 
photogenic primer this is the primer
that<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.490> made<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.270> foundation

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that was made to go with this foundation

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
that was made to go with this foundation
so<00:01:10.229> since<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.799> both<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> try<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so since I have both I'm going to try it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.590 
so since I have both I'm going to try it
with<00:01:12.090> it

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.020 

so<00:01:15.290> as<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.560> can<00:01:15.680> see<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:15.980> primer<00:01:16.370> does<00:01:16.610> not

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
so as you can see this primer does not

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.540 
so as you can see this primer does not
blend<00:01:17.540> in<00:01:17.810> well<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.260> it<00:01:18.409> dries<00:01:18.770> really<00:01:19.130> fast

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
blend in well and it dries really fast

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.390 
blend in well and it dries really fast
so<00:01:20.330> it's<00:01:21.080> pretty<00:01:21.229> much<00:01:21.320> just<00:01:21.470> looking<00:01:22.100> white

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
so it's pretty much just looking white

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.520 
so it's pretty much just looking white
on<00:01:22.670> my<00:01:22.850> face<00:01:23.090> right<00:01:23.270> now<00:01:23.390> which<00:01:23.960> looks<00:01:24.229> really

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
on my face right now which looks really

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.620 
on my face right now which looks really
weird<00:01:24.760> you<00:01:25.760> wouldn't<00:01:26.030> be<00:01:26.090> able<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.300> wear<00:01:26.450> this

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
weird you wouldn't be able to wear this

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.020 
weird you wouldn't be able to wear this
on<00:01:26.900> its<00:01:27.110> own<00:01:27.350> but<00:01:27.770> maybe<00:01:28.010> with<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.430> foundation

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
on its own but maybe with the foundation

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.230 
on its own but maybe with the foundation
over<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.420> it's<00:01:29.690> okay<00:01:30.190> but<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.580> feels<00:01:32.060> really

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
over it it's okay but it feels really

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.180 
over it it's okay but it feels really
sticky<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:34.509> don't<00:01:35.509> know<00:01:35.570> how<00:01:35.720> about<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.259> took

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.529 
beige was like way too dark and the nude
one<00:01:54.140> was<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.289> little<00:01:54.649> light<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:55.700> one<00:01:55.940> is

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
one was a little light so this one is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.510 
one was a little light so this one is
like<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> little<00:01:57.140> yellow<00:01:57.380> for<00:01:57.770> me<00:01:57.890> but<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.369> was

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
like a little yellow for me but it was

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.279 
like a little yellow for me but it was
the<00:01:58.820> closest<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.300> my<00:01:59.479> skin<00:01:59.720> type<00:01:59.930> out<00:02:00.080> of<00:02:00.200> the

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
the closest to my skin type out of the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.529 
the closest to my skin type out of the
colors<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.800> had<00:02:01.039> so<00:02:01.759> I'm<00:02:01.910> taking<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.330> clean

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
colors that I had so I'm taking a clean

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.779 
colors that I had so I'm taking a clean
Beauty<00:02:02.899> Blender<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.259> applying<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.610> see

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
Beauty Blender and applying this to see

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:13.600 
Beauty Blender and applying this to see
how<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.300> looks

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.790 

so<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.390> far<00:02:14.630> applying<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.380> feel<00:02:15.590> like<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
so so far applying it I feel like the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.620 
so so far applying it I feel like the
coverage<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.370> pretty<00:02:16.580> light<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.180> feel<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.510> I'm

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
coverage is pretty light I feel like I'm

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.990 
coverage is pretty light I feel like I'm
going<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.140> lot<00:02:18.410> for<00:02:18.740> more<00:02:18.920> product<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.550> get<00:02:19.820> a

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
going in a lot for more product to get a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.740 
going in a lot for more product to get a
good<00:02:20.300> coverage<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:22.700> you're<00:02:22.910> looking<00:02:23.630> for

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
good coverage so if you're looking for

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.320 
good coverage so if you're looking for
an<00:02:23.870> easy<00:02:23.990> full<00:02:24.380> coverage<00:02:24.770> foundation<00:02:25.520> already

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
an easy full coverage foundation already

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.300 
an easy full coverage foundation already
I<00:02:26.930> probably<00:02:27.290> wouldn't<00:02:27.620> recommend<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:28.130> one

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
I probably wouldn't recommend this one

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.120 
I probably wouldn't recommend this one
because<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.330> kind<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.350> lot<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.650> work<00:02:30.860> to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
because it is kind of a lot of work to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.170 
because it is kind of a lot of work to
get<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> good<00:02:31.670> cover<00:02:31.970> for<00:02:32.330> me<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.510> far

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.059 

okay<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.240> now<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:37.960> have<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.560> coverage<00:02:38.860> I

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
okay so now that I have the coverage I

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.130 
okay so now that I have the coverage I
like<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.640> feel<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.240> looks<00:02:40.330> pretty<00:02:40.750> good<00:02:40.959> in

know what you guys think all I can see
is<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> small<00:03:14.829> viewfinder<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:15.609> think<00:03:15.819> it

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
is the small viewfinder and I think it

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.759 
is the small viewfinder and I think it
looks<00:03:16.030> pretty<00:03:16.209> good<00:03:16.359> looks<00:03:16.930> really<00:03:17.200> even<00:03:17.530> and

where<00:04:22.510> my<00:04:22.750> sunglasses<00:04:23.110> were<00:04:23.289> so<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:24.130> definitely

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
where my sunglasses were so I definitely

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.399 
where my sunglasses were so I definitely
have<00:04:24.909> to<00:04:25.030> touch-up<00:04:25.419> before<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.780> go<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.139> dinner

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:30.029 
have to touch-up before I go to dinner
and<00:04:26.800> this<00:04:27.520> wasn't<00:04:27.909> a<00:04:29.039> long-lasting

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
and this wasn't a long-lasting

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.640 
and this wasn't a long-lasting
oil-control<00:04:30.820> foundation<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.050> I'm<00:04:32.320> not<00:04:32.440> like

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
oil-control foundation so I'm not like

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.409 
oil-control foundation so I'm not like
deducting<00:04:33.220> points<00:04:33.550> for<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:33.820> stuff<00:04:34.120> because

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
deducting points for that stuff because

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.779 
deducting points for that stuff because
I<00:04:34.449> do<00:04:34.599> have<00:04:34.900> really<00:04:35.199> oily<00:04:35.380> skin<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.070> at<00:04:36.580> normal

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
I do have really oily skin and at normal

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.580 
I do have really oily skin and at normal
foundations<00:04:37.539> that's<00:04:37.870> just<00:04:38.110> what<00:04:38.229> happens

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
foundations that's just what happens

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.249 
foundations that's just what happens
with<00:04:38.740> my<00:04:38.919> skin<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:40.210> lasting<00:04:40.630> power<00:04:40.810> isn't

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
with my skin so the lasting power isn't

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.110 
with my skin so the lasting power isn't
like<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.830> best<00:04:42.070> thing<00:04:42.280> in<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.490> world<00:04:42.669> but<00:04:42.970> it

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
like the best thing in the world but it

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.960 
like the best thing in the world but it
also<00:04:43.270> doesn't<00:04:43.539> look<00:04:43.720> bad<00:04:43.960> um<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:45.190> think<00:04:45.250> overall

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
also doesn't look bad um I think overall

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.610 
also doesn't look bad um I think overall
like<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.389> coverage<00:04:46.780> still<00:04:47.110> looks<00:04:47.349> pretty

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
like the coverage still looks pretty

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.240 
like the coverage still looks pretty
good<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:48.250> wish<00:04:48.789> this<00:04:49.419> foundation<00:04:50.250> covered

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
good I wish this foundation covered

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.850 
good I wish this foundation covered
better<00:04:51.849> than<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.360> does<00:04:52.599> like<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:53.080> like<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.620> said<00:04:53.830> I

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
better than it does like I like I said I

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.980 
better than it does like I like I said I
had<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.460> put<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.759> lot<00:04:54.970> of<00:04:55.150> layers<00:04:55.330> on<00:04:55.599> to<00:04:55.750> get<00:04:55.870> the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
had to put a lot of layers on to get the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.540 
had to put a lot of layers on to get the
coverage<00:04:56.289> that<00:04:56.349> I<00:04:56.590> want<00:04:56.860> but<00:04:57.039> once<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.340> did<00:04:57.520> I

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
coverage that I want but once I did I

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.820 
coverage that I want but once I did I
think<00:04:57.729> it<00:04:57.940> looks<00:04:58.120> really<00:04:58.300> nice<00:04:58.630> um<00:04:59.289> so

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
think it looks really nice um so

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.080 
think it looks really nice um so
definitely<00:05:00.370> not<00:05:00.460> my<00:05:00.639> favorite<00:05:00.909> foundation

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
definitely not my favorite foundation

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.330 
definitely not my favorite foundation

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
I've ever tried it's also not bad I'm

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.920 
I've ever tried it's also not bad I'm
not<00:05:03.400> I'm<00:05:03.699> not<00:05:03.880> sure<00:05:04.060> how<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.270> felt<00:05:04.449> about<00:05:04.750> the

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
not I'm not sure how I felt about the

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
not I'm not sure how I felt about the
primer<00:05:05.259> I<00:05:05.650> did

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
primer I did

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.830 
primer I did
like<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.250> would<00:05:06.400> apply<00:05:06.730> and<00:05:07.240> that<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.390> looks<00:05:07.660> so

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
like I would apply and that it looks so

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.350 
like I would apply and that it looks so
white<00:05:08.110> so<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.770> think<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.490> would<00:05:09.550> rather<00:05:09.760> use<00:05:10.120> this

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
white so I think I would rather use this

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.560 
white so I think I would rather use this
with<00:05:10.720> like<00:05:11.020> my<00:05:11.320> cover<00:05:12.190> FX<00:05:12.610> mattifying<00:05:12.910> primer

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.530 
um just to kind of tame this oil that
naturally<00:05:17.860> comes<00:05:18.070> out<00:05:18.250> through<00:05:18.430> my<00:05:18.460> face<00:05:18.760> so<00:05:19.510> I

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
naturally comes out through my face so I

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.270 
naturally comes out through my face so I
definitely<00:05:19.930> will<00:05:20.080> use<00:05:20.320> this<00:05:20.530> foundation<00:05:20.740> it

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
definitely will use this foundation it

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.470 
definitely will use this foundation it
won't<00:05:21.430> be<00:05:21.520> like<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.790> first<00:05:22.000> one<00:05:22.150> I<00:05:22.180> reach<00:05:22.450> for

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
won't be like the first one I reach for

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.000 
won't be like the first one I reach for
but<00:05:22.990> it's<00:05:23.110> definitely<00:05:23.350> a<00:05:23.650> good<00:05:23.860> alternative

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
but it's definitely a good alternative

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.220 
but it's definitely a good alternative
