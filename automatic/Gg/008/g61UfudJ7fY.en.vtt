00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.459 
which was having power issues the
machine<00:00:09.030> just<00:00:09.240> kept<00:00:09.450> turning<00:00:09.599> itself<00:00:09.960> off<00:00:10.200> so

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
machine just kept turning itself off so

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.039 
machine just kept turning itself off so
I<00:00:10.889> took<00:00:11.790> out<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.120> power<00:00:12.269> pack<00:00:12.570> which<00:00:12.900> is

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
I took out the power pack which is

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.720 
I took out the power pack which is
really<00:00:13.259> easy<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> do<00:00:13.710> just<00:00:13.950> take<00:00:14.400> out<00:00:14.549> these

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
really easy to do just take out these

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.269 
really easy to do just take out these

pack for my working through the oh and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.410 
pack for my working through the oh and
the<00:00:19.949> problem<00:00:20.279> still<00:00:20.490> persisted<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.180> knew

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the problem still persisted so I knew

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.349 
the problem still persisted so I knew
that<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:22.320> power<00:00:22.590> pack<00:00:23.119> wasn't<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.180> problem

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that this power pack wasn't the problem

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.450 
that this power pack wasn't the problem
the<00:00:24.600> problem<00:00:24.779> Leon<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> board<00:00:25.350> somewhere<00:00:25.619> so

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the problem Leon the board somewhere so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.950 
the problem Leon the board somewhere so
I<00:00:26.490> took<00:00:26.730> out<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.840> CDU<00:00:28.349> net<00:00:28.970> which<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.480> that

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
I took out the CDU net which is that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.100 
I took out the CDU net which is that
screw<00:00:31.320> another<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.219> down<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:32.930> likewise<00:00:33.930> on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
screw another one down here likewise on

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.100 
screw another one down here likewise on
this<00:00:34.260> side<00:00:34.500> lift<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.630> metal<00:00:36.630> shielding<00:00:36.960> off

this<00:00:40.260> whole<00:00:40.410> seed<00:00:40.649> unit<00:00:41.070> comes<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.640> then

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
this whole seed unit comes out so then

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
this whole seed unit comes out so then
you're<00:00:41.879> left<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> board<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:43.469> metal

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
you're left with a board and some metal

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.880 
you're left with a board and some metal
shielding<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.160> top<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.170> at<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.410> point<00:00:46.649> I

big one which is 1600 microphones 25
volts<00:01:22.580> now<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:24.049> was<00:01:25.049> originally<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:25.710> lazy

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
volts now I was originally a bit lazy

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.039 
volts now I was originally a bit lazy
and<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.450> didn't<00:01:27.450> bother<00:01:27.540> getting<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> board

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and I didn't bother getting the board

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.060 
and I didn't bother getting the board
out<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.470> solved<00:01:28.799> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
out and I solved it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.609 
out and I solved it
I<00:01:29.220> prized<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> original<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.780> off<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
I prized it the original one off the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.800 
I prized it the original one off the
board<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.130> sold<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> new<00:01:33.630> one

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
board and sold it in the new one

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.920 
board and sold it in the new one
directly<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.470> those<00:01:35.240> two<00:01:36.240> concept<00:01:36.659> points

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
directly to those two concept points

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.300 
directly to those two concept points
there<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:39.360> still<00:01:39.659> wouldn't<00:01:39.840> work<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
there and it still wouldn't work so I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.490 
there and it still wouldn't work so I
realized<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:41.820> obviously<00:01:42.000> done<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> ripped

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
realized what obviously done is I ripped

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.410 
realized what obviously done is I ripped
the<00:01:43.619> old<00:01:43.740> capacitor<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.460> I've<00:01:44.549> damaged

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the old capacitor out and I've damaged

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.139 
the old capacitor out and I've damaged
the<00:01:45.509> board<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.009> put<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.610> side<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the board so I put it to one side and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.090 
the board so I put it to one side and
wait<00:01:48.930> till<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.259> some<00:01:49.409> spare<00:01:49.619> time<00:01:49.649> what<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
wait till I got some spare time what you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.380 
wait till I got some spare time what you
did<00:01:50.250> today<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.610> got<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> board<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.210> which

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
did today and I got the board out which

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.149 
did today and I got the board out which
doesn't<00:01:51.750> take<00:01:51.780> long<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.320> take<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
doesn't take long just take the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.740 
doesn't take long just take the
shielding<00:01:53.579> off<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.950> few<00:01:55.950> more<00:01:56.100> bits<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.460> bobs

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
shielding off a few more bits and bobs

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.859 
shielding off a few more bits and bobs
you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.899> lift<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> board<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.869> I've

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you can lift the board out and I've

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.780 
you can lift the board out and I've
soldered<00:02:01.350> two<00:02:01.560> wires<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> contact<00:02:02.490> points

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
soldered two wires to the contact points

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.980 
soldered two wires to the contact points
in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> bottom<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.299> boards<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.780> pretty

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
in the bottom of the boards I pretty

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.990 
in the bottom of the boards I pretty
much<00:02:04.079> messed<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> ones<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.820> here

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
much messed up the ones on the in here

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
much messed up the ones on the in here
in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> top<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> board<00:02:06.829> by<00:02:07.829> being<00:02:08.039> lazy<00:02:08.220> at

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
in the top of the board by being lazy at

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.360 
in the top of the board by being lazy at
first<00:02:08.640> time<00:02:08.879> around<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.129> should<00:02:11.340> have

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
first time around so what I should have

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.830 
first time around so what I should have
done<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.610> hindsight<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
done with hindsight is the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.670 
done with hindsight is the
big<00:02:13.459> 6800<00:02:14.459> micro<00:02:14.790> farad<00:02:15.000> capacitor

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
big 6800 micro farad capacitor

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.509 
big 6800 micro farad capacitor
originally<00:02:16.680> she<00:02:16.769> was<00:02:16.890> stood<00:02:17.040> vertically

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
originally she was stood vertically

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.479 
originally she was stood vertically
there<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.910> should<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.170> taken<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.739> board<00:02:20.310> out

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
there I should have taken the board out

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.479 
there I should have taken the board out
and<00:02:20.790> D<00:02:21.180> soldered<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.690> from<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.989> underside<00:02:22.489> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
and D soldered it from the underside the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.800 
and D soldered it from the underside the
Saudis<00:02:23.879> for<00:02:23.910> wrenching<00:02:24.330> off<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.599> board

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
Saudis for wrenching off the board

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.369 
Saudis for wrenching off the board
anyway<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.400> got<00:02:26.519> this<00:02:26.670> new<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:28.459> soldered<00:02:30.379> to

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
anyway so I got this new one soldered to

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.930 
anyway so I got this new one soldered to
the<00:02:31.410> bottom<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.799> board<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:32.549> taped<00:02:32.760> in

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the bottom the board and just taped in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.729 
the bottom the board and just taped in
place<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:35.519> has<00:02:36.230> cured<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.260> power

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
place and this has cured the power

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.990 
place and this has cured the power
problems<00:02:38.099> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> studio<00:02:39.410> replacing<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
problems of the studio replacing the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.670 
problems of the studio replacing the
three<00:02:42.239> capacitors<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.900> big<00:02:46.140> 60

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
three capacitors so it's that big 60

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.850 
three capacitors so it's that big 60
hundred<00:02:47.130> microphones<00:02:49.430> 25<00:02:50.430> volts<00:02:51.860> that's

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
hundred microphones 25 volts that's

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.759 
hundred microphones 25 volts that's
slightly<00:02:53.400> larger<00:02:54.060> those<00:02:54.390> are<00:02:54.599> microphones<00:02:55.110> 16

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
slightly larger those are microphones 16

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.880 
slightly larger those are microphones 16
volts<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:57.420> little<00:02:59.629> 100<00:03:00.629> microphones<00:03:01.200> 25

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
volts and the little 100 microphones 25

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.289 
volts and the little 100 microphones 25
volt<00:03:02.190> there<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.150> all<00:03:03.299> three<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.629> sort<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.170> an<00:03:05.299> all

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
volt there so all three a sort of an all

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.780 
volt there so all three a sort of an all
three<00:03:06.660> interval<00:03:06.930> are<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.319> line<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.670> see

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
three interval are in a line you can see

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.780 
three interval are in a line you can see
the<00:03:08.910> positive<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.390> negative<00:03:09.650> sides<00:03:10.790> by

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the positive and the negative sides by

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.100 
the positive and the negative sides by
the<00:03:11.849> capacitors<00:03:12.329> which<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.629> already<00:03:12.810> there

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
the capacitors which you already there

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.000 
the capacitors which you already there
so<00:03:14.569> if<00:03:15.569> your<00:03:15.780> videos<00:03:16.140> got<00:03:16.349> similar<00:03:16.650> power

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
so if your videos got similar power

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
so if your videos got similar power
issues<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:20.489> don't<00:03:20.609> want<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.850> go<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
issues you don't want to go to the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.120 
issues you don't want to go to the
expense<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.450> buying<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.900> replacement<00:03:22.620> video

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
expense of buying a replacement video

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.879 
expense of buying a replacement video
just<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.639> new<00:03:23.790> power<00:03:24.060> pack<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.709> good

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
just for a new power pack it is a good

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.970 
just for a new power pack it is a good
idea<00:03:25.980> just<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.549> one<00:03:26.930> source<00:03:27.930> or<00:03:28.709> some
