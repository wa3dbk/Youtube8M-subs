have<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.169> rifle<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.780> comes<00:04:11.989> with<00:04:12.109> one<00:04:12.530> in

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
have the rifle and it comes with one in

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.129 
have the rifle and it comes with one in
the<00:04:12.829> gun<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.250> three<00:04:13.730> out<00:04:13.879> of<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.329> they're

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
the gun and three out of it and they're

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.979 
the gun and three out of it and they're
about<00:04:15.260> half<00:04:15.590> an<00:04:15.799> inch<00:04:15.889> each<00:04:16.190> so<00:04:16.880> maybe<00:04:17.720> three

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
about half an inch each so maybe three

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.990 
about half an inch each so maybe three
quarters<00:04:18.289> at<00:04:18.500> quarters<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.070> an<00:04:19.160> inch<00:04:19.250> so

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
quarters at quarters of an inch so

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.520 
quarters at quarters of an inch so
that's<00:04:20.239> can<00:04:20.510> extend<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.049> gun<00:04:21.260> make<00:04:21.410> it

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
that's can extend this gun make it

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.469 
that's can extend this gun make it
longer<00:04:21.829> or<00:04:22.130> make<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.460> shorter<00:04:22.820> again<00:04:23.450> I

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
longer or make it shorter again I

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.790 
longer or make it shorter again I
already<00:04:23.720> have<00:04:23.930> made<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.199> fairly<00:04:24.470> expensive

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
already have made a fairly expensive

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.200 
already have made a fairly expensive
review<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.370> this<00:04:25.460> gun<00:04:25.669> so<00:04:25.849> I'm<00:04:25.910> not<00:04:26.000> going<00:04:26.120> to

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
review of this gun so I'm not going to

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.390 
review of this gun so I'm not going to
go<00:04:26.300> into<00:04:26.389> all<00:04:26.720> sorts<00:04:26.960> of<00:04:27.680> details<00:04:27.860> i<00:04:28.190> believe

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
go into all sorts of details i believe

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.820 
go into all sorts of details i believe
it's<00:04:28.520> 49<00:04:29.000> inch<00:04:29.210> gun<00:04:29.510> now<00:04:30.139> this<00:04:30.289> does<00:04:30.500> not<00:04:30.620> have

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
it's 49 inch gun now this does not have

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.710 
it's 49 inch gun now this does not have
a<00:04:30.860> very<00:04:31.039> this<00:04:31.849> does<00:04:32.030> not<00:04:32.150> have<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.449> metal

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
a very this does not have the metal

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.390 
a very this does not have the metal
trigger<00:04:32.900> some<00:04:33.349> of<00:04:33.470> them<00:04:33.530> do<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:34.070> one<00:04:34.280> is

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
trigger some of them do this one is

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.000 
trigger some of them do this one is
plastic<00:04:34.940> which<00:04:35.930> kind<00:04:36.200> of<00:04:36.289> stinks<00:04:36.680> to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
plastic which kind of stinks to

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.469 
plastic which kind of stinks to
downgrade<00:04:37.250> i<00:04:37.580> am<00:04:37.849> going<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.090> go<00:04:38.150> ahead<00:04:38.180> and

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
downgrade i am going to go ahead and

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.700 
downgrade i am going to go ahead and
show<00:04:38.599> both<00:04:38.780> sides<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:39.349> because<00:04:39.500> if<00:04:39.590> you're

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
show both sides of it because if you're

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.920 
show both sides of it because if you're
buying<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.099> you<00:04:40.219> can<00:04:40.370> i<00:04:40.400> want<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.640> know

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
buying this you can i want to know

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.170 
buying this you can i want to know
so<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:41.979> does<00:04:42.190> have<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.490> plastic<00:04:42.669> trigger

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
so that does have the plastic trigger

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.090 
so that does have the plastic trigger
meaning<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.720> can't<00:04:43.930> even<00:04:44.110> take<00:04:44.289> a<00:04:44.320> GRT<00:04:44.680> three

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
meaning it can't even take a GRT three

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.740 
meaning it can't even take a GRT three
you<00:04:45.699> were<00:04:45.789> thinking<00:04:45.820> oh<00:04:46.150> I'll<00:04:46.300> buy<00:04:46.479> it<00:04:46.539> and

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
you were thinking oh I'll buy it and

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.390 
you were thinking oh I'll buy it and
just<00:04:46.840> going<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.080> upgrade<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:47.919> can't<00:04:48.130> get<00:04:48.310> the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
just going to upgrade you can't get the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.730 
just going to upgrade you can't get the
GRT<00:04:48.669> three<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.840> does<00:04:50.080> come<00:04:50.259> with<00:04:50.380> one<00:04:50.560> pretty

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
GRT three this does come with one pretty

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.950 
GRT three this does come with one pretty
cool<00:04:50.949> thing<00:04:51.130> which<00:04:52.060> is<00:04:52.389> hard<00:04:53.289> to<00:04:53.500> get<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.889> but

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
ok now I got it that little part right

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.230 
ok now I got it that little part right
there<00:04:58.750> with<00:04:59.080> bumps<00:04:59.470> out<00:05:00.419> right<00:05:01.419> there<00:05:01.889> that<00:05:02.889> is

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
there with bumps out right there that is

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.499 
there with bumps out right there that is
a<00:05:04.289> shock<00:05:05.289> absorption<00:05:06.030> little<00:05:07.030> part<00:05:07.330> of<00:05:07.419> the

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
a shock absorption little part of the

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.540 
a shock absorption little part of the
gun<00:05:07.720> you<00:05:08.110> can<00:05:08.229> look<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.530> up<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.770> pyramid<00:05:09.130> air<00:05:09.340> go

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
gun you can look it up on pyramid air go

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.629 
gun you can look it up on pyramid air go
to<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:10.289> Walter<00:05:11.289> talent<00:05:11.710> magnum<00:05:12.160> or<00:05:12.340> the

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
to the Walter talent magnum or the

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.300 
to the Walter talent magnum or the
Falcon<00:05:13.360> hunter<00:05:13.599> on<00:05:13.720> pyramid<00:05:14.169> air<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.590> they

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
Falcon hunter on pyramid air and they

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.800 
Falcon hunter on pyramid air and they
will<00:05:15.520> have<00:05:15.699> they<00:05:16.270> will<00:05:16.419> show<00:05:16.570> you<00:05:16.630> exactly

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
will have they will show you exactly

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.260 
will have they will show you exactly
what<00:05:17.229> it<00:05:17.349> does<00:05:17.530> but<00:05:18.250> that<00:05:18.490> absorbs<00:05:18.940> a<00:05:19.030> little

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
what it does but that absorbs a little

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.890 
what it does but that absorbs a little
bit<00:05:19.389> of<00:05:19.509> the<00:05:19.599> recoil<00:05:20.440> and<00:05:21.479> makes<00:05:22.479> it<00:05:22.690> less

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
bit of the recoil and makes it less

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.839 
bit of the recoil and makes it less
shock<00:05:23.440> absorbent<00:05:26.190> so<00:05:27.190> again<00:05:27.460> this<00:05:27.639> is<00:05:27.820> the

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
shock absorbent so again this is the

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.409 
shock absorbent so again this is the
synthetic<00:05:28.539> version<00:05:29.050> so<00:05:30.009> go<00:05:30.639> ahead<00:05:30.789> and<00:05:31.120> if<00:05:31.270> you

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
synthetic version so go ahead and if you

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.230 
synthetic version so go ahead and if you
would<00:05:31.599> like<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.780> buy<00:05:31.990> it<00:05:32.220> first<00:05:33.220> of<00:05:33.370> all<00:05:33.490> you're
