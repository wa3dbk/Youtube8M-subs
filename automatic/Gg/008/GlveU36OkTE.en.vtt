00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi today a little video that 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.580
 start with some shots of my 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.019
 small vegetable gardens in my wooded garden on 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.809
 purpose of this video is from you 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.910
 explain a technique in fact of two 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.210
 goals a gardening technique actually 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.439
 what I would also like to say is that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.420
 I get a lot of questions we do not 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.650
 pose asks me how to do this 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.939
 how persona what is the best 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.160
 technique is the best way to 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.599
 do what I would like to tell you this is 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.880
 that there are plenty of good ways to do it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 and that the idea she is of adapting 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 where we did not find the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.090
 resources locally and do the best 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.620
 with what we have on site no 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.540
 the perfect technique that must be adapted 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 from everywhere so here in this 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.020
 video I 'm going to show you one of 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.059
 techniques but a rat full of others 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.170
 so what I did was who 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 chooses a semi zone finally emilie 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.920
 sunny ambrosises me am so I 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 cleared a little bit the whole layer 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 of humus so I always have in my 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.039
 neighboring garden was cleared from the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.539
 museum installed a small formwork of 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.359
 summary way with just branches 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.460
 posed and small stakes planted on 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.080
 the outside of this formwork game because 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.369
 that in fact the goff age I'm going to the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 fill with soil for the end of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.890
 championship 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.180
 why I filled earth is because 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.439
 that in fact it had to be disbursed to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 places in my garden and suddenly 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.939
 I had small steps so 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.380
 I wanted to use this sphere which 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.939
 was a rather good land actually 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 a year that I had to jump I try to 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.909
 to do if he had not had this this stock 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.049
 I will only have to cultivate 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.080
 directly in the ground 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.790
 diack time so here I hope so 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.170
 it's a goal so once I have 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.710
 filled my little earth formwork like 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.020
 we see there I will put the whole layer 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.240
 of humus that I had removed at the beginning 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.990
 So layer of humus with the leaves 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 the brandishes the raids all that I 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.189
 put this layer over there so 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.390
 if we do this kind of limits actually the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.210
 only wooded as it was at the base 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.259
 so the purpose of this creation 7 goals of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.820
 this growing area that I'm in 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.820
 doing it was being able to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.439
 enlarge your summer gardens so the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.430
 scene is doing it in the winter 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.259
 so I believe that all the time by train 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.619
 last February if I do not say 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.350
 foolery 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.350
 the goal is really to be able to plant 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.670
 more complaints from vegetable gardens and was 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 so this is such a 0me humus I 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.460
 put also add a little bit of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.890
 also crushed because 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.170
 I do not like too much watered I want 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.360
 always some games So here 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.820
 now that it's done that I planted 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.260
 a lot of peas to kill them yesterday 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.000
 at the picket of a small cannonball time 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.210
 she saw a little bit of comfrey e 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.550
 of the father got started so even if this 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.810
 cropping area was intended to 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.320
 allow plants to be planted 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.480
 in the spring I still directly 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.860
 planted the ornate in winter actually because 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.330
 when I create a culture zone because 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.150
 I'm doing is that I always I 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.530
 door of seedlings so that at the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.270
 the faster there are roots that 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.680
 settles in the ground so that more 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.810
 quickly life comes back in this one and 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.070
 to have a fertile area of ​​fuel 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.650
 possible so there I put a lot of 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.300
 peas to do all this the advantage 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.410
 peas and beans do know is 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.760
 that these are plants that are 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.160
 capable of 6.7 to fix nitrogen 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.620
 atmospheric so on the very good 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.810
 green manures and in addition it is carried 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.550
 also in winter finally according to the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.550
 regions with little presence in winter or in 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.970
 autumn or early spring so 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.470
 a few months after that I think about 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.180
 the video I give early April 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.920
 I'm already starting harvested and first 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 the study I start to harvest the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.240
 chives I start to harvest 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.530
 some leaves of cause I'm harvesting a 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.060
 little parsley a little bit so 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.500
 see supplant very densely really 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.480
 I wanted to put a maximum of 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.500
 root in this soil you want to attract 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.260
 the best and the earthworms I 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.370
 wanted to attract ground life 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.020
 I also wanted to create some 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.700
 biomass to make fertility 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.770
 because in fact all this biomass the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.210
 Norman cu of fertility I 'm going 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.690
 give back you'll see later on 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.040
 monsols for my spring crops 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.030
 so here I harvest the lettuce he 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.390
 start to get a little bit 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.280
 colonized by the peas that are 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.020
 them in bloom a block right now so 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.610
 the city early April 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.840
 if I say no nonsense a gip to note 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.500
 the dates are there so I tell you that a 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.790
 little bit of feeling once this 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.280
 feeling says everything is funny because 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.500
 Algeria knew the end of April-beginning 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.400
 beginning but I also reaped all 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.070
 the yellow peas harvested 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.210
 also do them I harvest everything and 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.980
 then the plans start to be a little 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.170
 little 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.940
 tired they never had any gout 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.229
 of water I had never watered them and in 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.940
 the more I did all the harvests will be 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.580
 so here we see on the video that I 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.500
 harvest the last few dots and 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.470
 once I harvest all that in fact 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.940
 I put another layer of crushed stone 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.440
 above anything that does not interest me anymore 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.180
 that is to say that of course I leave my 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.919
 overtaken vine I leave my plan 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.990
 to consult past I leave the parsley 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.540
 and chives and passed by year all 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.410
 annual plants 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.340
 when peas the themes and the 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.750
 lettuce game the crush covers is in 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.250
 does that going to allow these plans to get 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.510
 break down in this hall to feed the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.530
 soil life and boost my soil again 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.020
 than ever a good layer of crushed 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.270
 everywhere on all the plants that are 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.560
 there and who more like those of 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.570
 legumes in yarn and all that is 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.919
 atmospheric nitrogen and degrading 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.960
 they will make some others 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:07.310
 consoles I want to remember that this is 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.590
 just a cup height there is 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.770
 a lot of others so here I am 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.180
 also recovers peas in 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.970
 more to prepare a growing area 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.740
 also throw out several harvests so there 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.840
 it is the joy of the priests of the genus 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.360
 planted squash acd squash 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.760
 butternut I planted tomatoes on 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.550
 is spring in f1 is not in and 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.440
 put me in a rage to the planters but 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.880
 thomas went short and all that we see 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.430
 that there is a woman who has survived my 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.250
 treatment a client goes out here we see 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.570
 the console at the bottom sees we see all that 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.490
 so is at the same time that I am 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.070
 prepared an offer for spring i 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.570
 still had harvests and so here 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.660
 it was a small idea that I wanted 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.740
 you doublette in this video but in 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.910
 do my videos it's a bit like the idea 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.169
 it shows us is full of techniques 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.310
 different and to you from you 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.760
 get by with all this to make 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.800
 better with what you have at home 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.630
 the father that suddenly it will allow me 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.850
 to link up with another garden that 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.420
 did not have at all in the same co 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.600
 configuration that is not a garden 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.270
 wooded which a small town garden of the 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.640
 village that I created so there it is by 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.600
 here a video from early May so we 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.760
 block there it's not at all the same 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.440
 configuration but I still wanted 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.520
 you show this little garden for just 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.720
 to show you that on the all 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.780
 little gardens you can have places 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.070
 extremely productive and so that's the 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.690
 purpose of this garden there we see that the 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.370
 links a fence on the left on this 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.010
 toasting in fact we make you run to 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.200
 also kiwis from the vines of the ranks 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.860
 without thorns passion fruit 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.860
 all that we try to take everything or 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.000
 productive so here I like it 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.420
 little garden for that because it is 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.920
 extremely small and productive and I 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.530
 wanted to show you that and suddenly 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.330
 look a step the same way when 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.560
 we look at a pea or canton 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.760
 during the 2nd Syrian like that here we 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.890
 did not have the right ya so we brought back 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.970
 a little bit of size the salads in 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.920
 ladder could deviate to what we wanted 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.100
 that they grow bigger there we see that 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.300
 a lot of crossing that side I put 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.680
 a lot of trees site recreates 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.790
 small canopy 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.620
 we even started a small port to 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.270
 at the neighbor's there we see that the effect 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.040
 did not lie down to replant I 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.050
 grown between the facts so I'm 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.160
 discover things that will become big 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.400
 who will take the place of the holidays 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.900
 after we see more he will not try 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.140
 also of tutor an automaton 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.460
 So here is plenty of good 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.720
 way of gardening is a little the purpose of 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.160
 this video is to show you the 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.360
 techniques but to know that you 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.760
 can do a little bit as good 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.380
 you seem with your own ideas and I 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.450

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.100
 greenhouse that is right behind me 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.600
