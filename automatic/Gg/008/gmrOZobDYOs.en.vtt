00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.799
 how friends said how are you waiting 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.090
 you are very welcome once again and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.920
 good this time I bring you enrere 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.500
 tutorials how to open ports for 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.180
 playstation 4 in a one of a modem 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.279
 harris to give the company and if and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.630
 good is relatively easy what 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.509
 we are going to need and continue 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.180
 PlayStation 4 knew no settings and in 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.270
 system information is going to come out 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.800
 a screen like this and here the only thing 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.560
 that we are going to use is ip address and 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.660
 of brand address as they have connected 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.550
 your console the internet 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.440
 either by wifi cable in this case 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.480
 I have it online then it 's very 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.660
 important to note these two ip address 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.489
 and the same as we receive we are going to 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.129
 our browser we put this 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.379
 address I'll put it in the box 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.019
 the description and here in password we go 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.560
 with exactly the same for word and 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.560
 we enter 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.540
 here we see ourselves ahead 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.840
 in the city of hcp 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.860
 and here we are going to do is that our 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.890
 ip address always be the same and not 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.800
 have changes here 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:35.810
 from hcp we are going to add our 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.810
 address and playstation of course 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.300
 ok nothing else google control and control 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.460
 to hit 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.100
 and our ip address should be left 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.020
 static so it's not going to change anymore and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.930
 there is no problem that the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 we know the ports or what we can 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.010
 do nothing else we're going to look here 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.110
 we're leaving and he did firewall a 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.780
 firewall we're going to go to the second 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:08.140
 tab that is virtual server and here 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.140
 let's add each of the ports 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.570
 4 and let's move on to the ports here 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.420
 I have to start with the tcp that is 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.350
 80 and with about 80 80 80 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.120
 remember at our address and this is 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.980
 the end of the play station and here in 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.980
 format like this 7 we leave it like this 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.380
 and friends, I'm going to add each of the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.190
 two 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.190
 of the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.160
 dead 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.849
 let's ok with 1.343 1.33 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.660
 If something does not come to understand friends 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.400
 remember that you can put us in the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.849
 questions and I would gladly 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.849
 I will respond 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.980
 with the third one that is this 52 23 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.380
 but do not repeat that much, but if you do not 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.819
 he moved and then I'm doing a 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.360
 Desmadre then we go to the safe 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:25.250
 ok tcp same signs with the fish or 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:31.640
 that since I 'm seeing what 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:36.010
 is not going to another that is this 1070 ok in 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.170
 1070 here there are 15 here have you say 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.940
 1070 and 1070 are both then what 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.940
 what we are going to do is a museum to win 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:04:03.110
 70 70 70.3 and that is what we have 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.550
 both formats where they know box me 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.220
 it seems that it is the only one that has double 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.160
 format if it is indeed a small 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.950
 where per module 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.370
 and so if we put it first one 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.620
 of tcp and then does not let us water the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.989
 second then better we add it that way 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.759
 and we already have scenic 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.060
 was 2 to go more to ensure that it is the 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.060
 following 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.220
 it is photo and we continue with disappointment 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.849
 and nothing else would be missing in these three 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:56.369
 which is one of the we add quickly 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:56.369
 it's not that it's done 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.990
 this is a band mess but it's 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.880
 easy to do it after understanding 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.880
 You already have it but Daddy is 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.389
 ah 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.389
 thirty eight of nine 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:44.090
 and that in turn that has love makes us 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.409
 missing one 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:51.159
 what is the simple 36 in fact yes yes 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.159
 finish 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.170
 6 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.699
 3 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:15.800
 ok and here we will have all of our 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.800
 ports added 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:28.850
 although with 24 268 18 ports and good 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.349
 here we are going to go after the boat 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.360
 rare triggers 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.699
 in the language the lock of whom 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.650
 monza trigger and that is what we're going to do 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.870
 exactly the same nothing more than 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.520
 we have and the address and train 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.539
 then I will add the first one and 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.539
 then he added them 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.870
 apart so that life is not so long 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.340
 and just like I just got here we're going to 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.160
 go adding each of the following 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.930
 and good in a bad moment and good 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.479
 friends as you can see I already have all 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.449
 the ports added in by triggers 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:10.600
 then the 8 are already there and the only thing 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:14.229
 we need to do is go to the plateau in the 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.199
 of plateau this I already have it like this but we 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:20.979
 it will appear empty and good here is the only 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:22.750
 more have our ip address than from 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.940
 the institution of course we give in 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.430
 applies is absolutely everything 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.009
 let's do and nothing else to finish 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.289
 we are going to optimize 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:34.539
 and the only thing we can do is reset 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:37.330
 the modem to apply and in these 

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:40.210
 changes of being router 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:43.750
 and we give in 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:45.880
 try to subtract ok and here it looks 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.710
 absolutely all friends I hope they 

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.750
