00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
to go too too tight because those little

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.630 
to go too too tight because those little
species<00:02:49.640> are<00:02:49.790> just<00:02:49.880> plastic<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:51.610> make<00:02:52.610> sure

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
species are just plastic so make sure

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.420 
species are just plastic so make sure
that<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.120> don't<00:02:53.270> crack<00:02:54.080> them<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:55.100> go<00:02:55.250> in

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
that you don't crack them just go in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:08.530 
that you don't crack them just go in
until<00:02:55.580> it's<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:55.970> there<00:02:56.270> snug<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:07.240> all<00:03:08.240> four

until it's on there snug and all four

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.470 
until it's on there snug and all four
spacers<00:03:09.110> are<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.500> same<00:03:09.770> exact<00:03:10.160> size<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:10.850> you

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
spacers are the same exact size so you

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.030 
spacers are the same exact size so you
don't<00:03:11.630> have<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.780> worry<00:03:11.930> about<00:03:11.959> which<00:03:12.590> ones<00:03:12.830> are
