hoop<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:29.049> it's<00:01:29.350> like<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.159> lake<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.659> really

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
hoop and it's like a lake when it really

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.060 
hoop and it's like a lake when it really
rains<00:01:32.350> hard<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:33.369> full<00:01:34.180> so<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.799> thing<00:01:36.039> is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
is that this is not full now because it

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.499

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.800

this would be great for everyone here
everyone<00:07:10.810> is<00:07:11.080> excited<00:07:11.919> about<00:07:12.310> having

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020
