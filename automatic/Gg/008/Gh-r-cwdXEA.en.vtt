00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.780
 torrijas would do the screaming two 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.820
 one ingredients is flour and the other 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 is the oil is still a pump but 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.750
 they are similar for and we will use 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.109
 the following ingredients a bar 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.869
 minimum bread a day a liter and a half 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.600
 whole milk a vanilla bean or 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.810
 aroma of loss sold in court 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.640
 on an orange last four 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.189
 spoonfuls of sugar to infuse the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 milk 34 tablespoons more and an increase of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.390
 our ground cinnamon to pass them 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 then for sugar and cinnamon at the end of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.579
 everything and 4 eggs the fourth part of a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.950
 glass of water and 50 grams of strawberries for 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.600
 decorate our plate to make this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.520
 dessert is super simple the only thing 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.410
 we need is to infuse the milk in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 When it starts to boil, let's add 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 the sugar the peel of the lemon and the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430
 orange let's open the pod of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.710
 vanilla in half and let's take out 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.840
 all the beans of the vanilla that is 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.290
 what will give the flavor and aroma to the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.150
 milk 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.370
 we are also going to add the pod and 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.950
 we turn off the fire to infuse what 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.470
 it is best to cover the pot and leave it for 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.240
 5 minutes approximately 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.490
 that all those aromas are coming together 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.980
 inside the milk the next thing that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.150
 let's do is cut the bread they 're going to be 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.490
 slices about 2 centimeters 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.010
 approximately with a cut 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.900
 approximately longitudinal will give us 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.150
 for 8 slices of about 2 centimeters 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.130
 not used the two ends because 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.350
 then it is difficult to be passed well 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.840
 the oven we have already infused milk 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 that has cooled a bit and with a saucepan 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 let's go dipping our torrijas 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.869
 we are pouring little by little until 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.280
 the torrijas are totally soaked 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.600
 maybe you have to soak the ones 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.360
 little more than the traditional way 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.800
 and we beat the four eggs but not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.080
 let's pass them through flour just for 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.970
 egg because our torrija we put it 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.590
 in the bowl with the egg and we're going to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.840
 place on a baking sheet 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.630
 previously lined with a paper for 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 bake them we put them all together and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.009
 place in the oven that we have 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.590
 preheated for 10 minutes to 250 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.700
 degrees has to be the tray the most 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.280
 next 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.470
 it's important and we're going to leave only the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.690
 green function or the function of 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.129
 higher temperature because what 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.110
 we want it to be crispy and for 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.080
 inside is the juice if we take out the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.420
 torrijas from the oven and we went through the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.459
 cinnamon sugar we had mixed 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.459
 so that they undertake a little bit with the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.010
 heat let's make a syrup with the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.530
 sugar and the remaining cinnamon in a saucepan 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.630
 with a little water the room of a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.120
 glass approximately we let it start 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.459
 to beat the water and add sugar 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.980
 stir quickly until they start 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.160
 upload bubbles as soon as this disc cited 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.079
 which is done in a minute on a rapid fire 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.480
 pour in the candy on top of the 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.120
 torrijas and put on a plate 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.739
 adorned with a strawberry to give 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.040
 color contrast that you have left very 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.349
 nice and it 's a different way of eating 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.170
 torrijas with the flavor of always and with 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.790
 less fat think that when you eat a 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.690
 of the traditional you can eat two of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.710
 these 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.580
 what's more in which I took advantage 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.580
 ah
