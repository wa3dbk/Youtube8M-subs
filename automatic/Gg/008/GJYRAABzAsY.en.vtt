teen in today's video working on a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.320 
teen in today's video working on a
modular<00:00:13.920> escalator<00:00:14.490> BAM

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
modular escalator BAM

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.420 
modular escalator BAM
alright<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.230> were<00:00:16.410> requested<00:00:16.890> by<00:00:16.920> spa

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
alright so this were requested by spa

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.000 
alright so this were requested by spa
cost<00:00:17.789> twelve<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.690> hope<00:00:19.350> I'm<00:00:19.500> saying<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.890> right

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
cost twelve I hope I'm saying that right

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.060 
cost twelve I hope I'm saying that right
and<00:00:20.789> wanted<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:21.810> escalator<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> simple

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and wanted an escalator like a simple

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.550 
and wanted an escalator like a simple
escalator<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.720> at<00:00:24.720> first<00:00:24.990> all<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.439> think

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
escalator and at first all I can think

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.140 
escalator and at first all I can think
of<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> item<00:00:26.460> escalator<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
of was like the item escalator that I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.910 
of was like the item escalator that I
made<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.570> hated<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> redstone<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.890> I

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
made but I hated the redstone on it so I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.320 
made but I hated the redstone on it so I
was<00:00:29.010> like<00:00:29.070> let<00:00:29.460> me<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.580> let<00:00:30.000> me<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
was like let me see let me see what I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
was like let me see let me see what I
can<00:00:30.359> find<00:00:30.750> that's<00:00:30.900> fairly<00:00:31.650> awesome<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
can find that's fairly awesome and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.979 
can find that's fairly awesome and
simple<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.180> found<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.570> thing<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
simple to do and I found this thing and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.470 
simple to do and I found this thing and
it's<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.620> super<00:00:35.010> simple<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it's it's super simple to do but you

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
it's it's super simple to do but you
know<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.750> pistons<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> two

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
know it's pistons and it's on like a two

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.160 
know it's pistons and it's on like a two
tick<00:00:38.309> delay<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.940> pretty<00:00:39.090> quick<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.660> worked

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
tick delay so it's pretty quick I worked

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.080 
tick delay so it's pretty quick I worked
at<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> best<00:00:40.590> works<00:00:41.160> best<00:00:41.430> when<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.730> look<00:00:41.910> down

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
at a best works best when you look down

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
at a best works best when you look down
and<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.989> approach<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.559> pressure<00:00:43.800> plate<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and just approach the pressure plate and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.029 
and just approach the pressure plate and
then<00:00:45.120> you're<00:00:45.239> pretty<00:00:45.360> much<00:00:45.570> good<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:46.039> at

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
then you're pretty much good to go at

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.680 
then you're pretty much good to go at
the<00:00:47.280> end<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.550> day<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.940> mean<00:00:48.180> their<00:00:48.300> piston

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the end of the day I mean their piston

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.779 
the end of the day I mean their piston
so<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:48.960> will<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.410> suffocate<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so they will not suffocate you it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.360 
so they will not suffocate you it
doesn't<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.449> sticky<00:00:51.780> pistons<00:00:52.140> either

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
doesn't have to be sticky pistons either

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.650 
doesn't have to be sticky pistons either
but<00:00:53.370> yeah<00:00:53.460> let's<00:00:53.760> build<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
but yeah let's build it so this is the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.869 
but yeah let's build it so this is the
whole<00:00:54.840> module<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.559> okay<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.850> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
whole module right here okay see that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.610 
whole module right here okay see that
see<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.480> I'll<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.170> build<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.530> scratch

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
see that I'll just build it from scratch

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.349 
see that I'll just build it from scratch
so<00:00:59.520> it'll<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> block<00:01:00.620> redstone<00:01:01.620> torch<00:01:02.359> block

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
so it'll be a block redstone torch block

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.609 
so it'll be a block redstone torch block
above<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.369> redstone<00:01:05.369> torch<00:01:06.200> block<00:01:07.200> above

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
above that redstone torch block above

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.480 
above that redstone torch block above
that<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:08.970> dust<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.860> block

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that with some dust and then a block

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.280 
that with some dust and then a block
here<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:13.500> block<00:01:14.330> here<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:16.170> your

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
here and a block here and then your

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.670 
here and a block here and then your
piston<00:01:16.619> goes<00:01:17.150> yeah<00:01:18.150> alright<00:01:19.049> pressure<00:01:19.409> plate

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
piston goes yeah alright pressure plate

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
piston goes yeah alright pressure plate
goes<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> other<00:01:20.340> person<00:01:20.759> goes<00:01:20.880> here

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
goes here and the other person goes here

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.700 
goes here and the other person goes here
again<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.840> don't<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.350> sticky

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
again they don't have to be sticky

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
again they don't have to be sticky
piston<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.400> let<00:01:23.549> me<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.880> use<00:01:23.909> sticky

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
piston so then let me not use sticky

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
piston so then let me not use sticky
pistons<00:01:24.960> alright<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> pretty<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.549> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pistons alright and it pretty much this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.760 
pistons alright and it pretty much this
is<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.630> raises<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.409> pushes

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
is it this raises you and this pushes

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.330 
is it this raises you and this pushes
you<00:01:28.860> forward<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:30.590> what<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> call<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> defense

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you forward the what you call a defense

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100 
you forward the what you call a defense
there<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> give<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
there is just kind of to give you a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.670 
there is just kind of to give you a
guide<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.470> sorts<00:01:35.720> like<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.869> know<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.290> you

guide of sorts like you know so you
don't<00:01:37.860> completely<00:01:38.400> walk<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.900> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
don't completely walk into it but to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.420 
don't completely walk into it but to
build<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.500> mean<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.400> can

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
build it I mean this is all and it can

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.969 
build it I mean this is all and it can
go<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.060> far<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.350> all<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
go as as far up as you like so all you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.460 
go as as far up as you like so all you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
do is this okay I'm only gonna go up

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.039 
do is this okay I'm only gonna go up
like<00:01:46.560> four<00:01:47.070> blocks<00:01:47.430> yeah<00:01:48.420> that's<00:01:48.659> good<00:01:48.840> it's

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
like four blocks yeah that's good it's

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.359 
like four blocks yeah that's good it's
good<00:01:49.259> all<00:01:49.979> right

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
good all right

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.770 
good all right
pressure<00:01:50.790> plate<00:01:51.030> pressure<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.479> pressure

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
pressure plate pressure put pressure

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840 
pressure plate pressure put pressure
plate<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.860> repeat<00:01:53.220> exactly

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
plate and then just repeat exactly

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.990 
plate and then just repeat exactly
everything<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.710> block<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.759> block

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
everything you know just block for block

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020 
everything you know just block for block
for<00:01:57.570> every<00:01:57.840> single<00:01:58.049> section<00:01:58.520> all<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.790> like

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
for every single section all right like

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.660 
for every single section all right like
that<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.680> then<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> redstone<00:02:02.159> torch<00:02:02.189> going

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
that and then the redstone torch going

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.060 
that and then the redstone torch going
this<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.360> way<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.659> way<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
this way this way this way and then the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.550 
this way this way this way and then the
block<00:02:05.250> above<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:08.209> that

block above that that that

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.250 
block above that that that
and<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> redstone<00:02:11.849> dust<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.270> here

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and then the redstone dust here here

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.380 
and then the redstone dust here here
here<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.280> need<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.550> put<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> block<00:02:15.000> anyways

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
here you need to put the block anyways

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.000 
here you need to put the block anyways
above<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.900> dust<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> other<00:02:16.770> ones

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
above the dust just like the other ones

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.360 
above the dust just like the other ones
and<00:02:17.250> see<00:02:17.849> see<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:18.390> all<00:02:18.780> coming<00:02:19.110> together

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and see see it's all coming together

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.220 
and see see it's all coming together
from<00:02:20.370> there<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.940> know<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.090> where<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
from there on you know just where the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.650 
from there on you know just where the
redstone<00:02:22.890> dust<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.459> put<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> block<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
redstone dust is you put the block the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.839 
redstone dust is you put the block the
redstone<00:02:25.170> dust<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.709> put<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> block<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
redstone dust you put the block the

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.339 
redstone dust you put the block the
redstone<00:02:27.269> -<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.599> put<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.840> block<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.260> then

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
redstone - you put the block and then

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.509 
redstone - you put the block and then
attach<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.860> Pistons<00:02:29.510> Pistons<00:02:30.510> oops

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
attach the Pistons Pistons oops

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
pistons here next to the pressure plates

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.360 
pistons here next to the pressure plates
like<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.980> like<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.220> put

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
like that like that and then you put

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.020 
like that like that and then you put
your<00:02:41.430> little<00:02:41.610> guide<00:02:42.680> fencepost<00:02:43.680> Deeley<00:02:44.130> all

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
your little guide fencepost Deeley all

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.150 
your little guide fencepost Deeley all
right<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.600> we'll<00:02:48.600> do<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:50.069> know

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
right like that and we'll do you know

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.380 
right like that and we'll do you know
it's<00:02:50.280> fine<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:50.819> why<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> like<00:02:51.209> that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
it's fine like that's why I like that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.150 
it's fine like that's why I like that
and<00:02:52.140> again<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.530> kind<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.739> approach<00:02:52.980> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and again just kind of approach it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.960 
and again just kind of approach it
slowly<00:02:53.250> look<00:02:53.700> down<00:02:53.880> works<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.269> best<00:02:55.970> and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
slowly look down works the best and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.490 
slowly look down works the best and
there<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.450> go<00:02:57.569> there<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.989> have<00:02:58.140> it

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
there you go there you have it

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.809 
there you go there you have it
modular<00:02:59.250> escalator<00:03:00.120> as<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.110> tell<00:03:01.319> it's

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
modular escalator as you can tell it's

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.550 
modular escalator as you can tell it's
extremely<00:03:02.819> extremely<00:03:03.480> repetitive<00:03:03.959> as<00:03:04.349> soon

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
extremely extremely repetitive as soon

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.900 
extremely extremely repetitive as soon
as<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.830> basically<00:03:05.099> start<00:03:05.400> laying<00:03:05.580> everything

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
as you basically start laying everything

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.789 
as you basically start laying everything
down<00:03:06.239> diagonal<00:03:06.720> everything<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.530> kind<00:03:07.769> of

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
down diagonal everything just kind of

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.740 
down diagonal everything just kind of
comes<00:03:07.980> into<00:03:08.250> place<00:03:08.459> extremely<00:03:09.330> simple

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
comes into place extremely simple

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.390 
comes into place extremely simple
