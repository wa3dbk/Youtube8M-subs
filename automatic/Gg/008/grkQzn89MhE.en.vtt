figured out instead of just answering
one<00:00:16.109> person<00:00:16.470> everybody<00:00:17.220> keep<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.640> by<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:18.000> I

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
one person everybody keep one by one I

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.420 
one person everybody keep one by one I
probably<00:00:18.570> just<00:00:18.720> make<00:00:18.840> one<00:00:19.020> big<00:00:19.170> video<00:00:19.439> show

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:01:24.960 

just<00:00:41.440> let<00:00:41.710> that<00:00:41.890> load<00:00:42.220> up

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:36.140 

might<00:01:25.600> take<00:01:25.810> one

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.470 

sunny

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.730 

that's<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.610> search<00:01:44.910> and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
that's what you do is go into search and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:02:00.930 
that's what you do is go into search and
you<00:01:46.740> want<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.980> search<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:50.870> SB<00:01:52.160> settings

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
you're probably going to get a lot of

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.930 
you're probably going to get a lot of
results<00:02:02.740> because<00:02:03.100> there's<00:02:03.310> different<00:02:03.730> themes
