00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
complete circus and I think if you

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.640 
complete circus and I think if you
market<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.329> thing<00:03:04.510> correctly<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.470> could

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
market that thing correctly you could

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.809 
market that thing correctly you could
probably<00:03:05.859> do<00:03:06.159> better<00:03:06.340> numbers<00:03:06.790> than

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
Mayweather versus dela Hoya I you could

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.470 
Mayweather versus dela Hoya I you could
I<00:03:10.870> guess<00:03:11.829> you're<00:03:12.579> kind<00:03:12.609> of<00:03:12.909> on<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.060> fact<00:03:13.390> that

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
I guess you're kind of on the fact that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.970
