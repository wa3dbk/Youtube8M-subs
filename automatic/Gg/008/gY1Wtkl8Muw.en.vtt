I've<00:01:18.900> already<00:01:19.110> started<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.490> do

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
I've already started on that and I do

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
I've already started on that and I do
have<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> video<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> which<00:01:22.200> might<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.710> on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
have a video for it which might be on

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.270 
have a video for it which might be on
part<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:24.259> step<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> Printrbot

help come for the instructions of the
new<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.689> invoice<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.530> don't<00:01:31.740> need<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
new one so invoice we don't need the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.999 
new one so invoice we don't need the
invoice<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:36.060> gives<00:01:36.329> us<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> little

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
invoice and it gives us this is a little

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
invoice and it gives us this is a little
bit<00:01:38.130> different<00:01:38.549> way<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:39.840> show

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
bit different way to do it but they show

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
bit different way to do it but they show
us<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.710> each<00:01:40.860> part<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.960> over<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:44.960> we<00:01:45.960> have

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
us what each part is over here we have

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.679 
us what each part is over here we have
some<00:01:47.479> screws<00:01:48.479> nuts<00:01:48.750> bolts<00:01:49.229> Springs<00:01:50.689> it

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
some screws nuts bolts Springs it

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.690 
some screws nuts bolts Springs it
doesn't<00:01:52.170> give<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> diagram<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.369> did<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
doesn't give a diagram like it did the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.510 
doesn't give a diagram like it did the
one<00:01:53.909> time<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:55.259> let's<00:01:55.439> open<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.860> bag<00:01:56.130> let's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
one time so let's open this bag let's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.999 
one time so let's open this bag let's
see<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.840> different<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.799> is

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
see what is different we know this is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.389 
see what is different we know this is
the<00:01:59.189> belt<00:01:59.399> driven<00:01:59.610> one<00:02:01.040> let's<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.219> what

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the belt driven one let's see what

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.289 
the belt driven one let's see what
what's<00:02:02.969> new<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.320> being<00:02:04.890> added<00:02:05.549> from

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
what's new that is being added from

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.550 
what's new that is being added from
we've<00:02:07.170> had<00:02:07.350> before

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
we've had before

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.630 
we've had before
so<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.280> looks<00:02:09.429> like<00:02:09.640> we<00:02:09.850> have<00:02:11.490> some<00:02:12.490> new

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
so it looks like we have some new

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.610 
so it looks like we have some new
electronics<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.510> here<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.990> new<00:02:14.319> end

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
electronics and here we have a new end

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.740 
electronics and here we have a new end
stop<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.880> looks<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.480> might<00:02:19.690> have

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
stop and it looks like we might have

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.410 
stop and it looks like we might have
extension<00:02:20.740> cords<00:02:20.770> for<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.980> fan<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:27.300> some<00:02:28.300> of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
extension cords for the fan and some of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.130 
extension cords for the fan and some of
the<00:02:28.510> other<00:02:28.660> end<00:02:28.930> stops<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.709> whatnot<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.900> new

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the other end stops and whatnot this new

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.550 
the other end stops and whatnot this new
model<00:02:32.560> has<00:02:32.800> all<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.310> stuff<00:02:33.520> underneath<00:02:33.910> it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
model has all the stuff underneath it

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.510 
model has all the stuff underneath it
and<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:35.800> we<00:02:35.980> have<00:02:36.239> new<00:02:37.239> plywood<00:02:37.510> parts<00:02:38.520> first

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
and then we have new plywood parts first

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.940 
and then we have new plywood parts first
white<00:02:39.850> wood<00:02:40.260> they<00:02:41.260> always<00:02:41.530> smell<00:02:41.920> so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
white wood they always smell so

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.210 
white wood they always smell so
interesting<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.790> smells<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:44.290> have<00:02:44.530> a

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
interesting it smells like you have a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.170 
interesting it smells like you have a
wood-burning<00:02:45.910> fireplace<00:02:46.209> in<00:02:47.080> your<00:02:47.230> house<00:02:48.180> so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
wood-burning fireplace in your house so

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.540 
wood-burning fireplace in your house so
they<00:02:49.450> labeled<00:02:49.959> everything<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.800> as<00:02:51.220> much<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.430> we

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
they labeled everything so as much as we

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.580 
they labeled everything so as much as we
can<00:02:51.760> see<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.120> but<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.630> wood<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.190> new

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
can see that but the wood on this new

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.180 
can see that but the wood on this new
chassis<00:02:56.590> has<00:02:56.860> got<00:02:57.100> everything<00:02:57.610> labeled<00:02:59.190> kind

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
chassis has got everything labeled kind

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.240 
chassis has got everything labeled kind
of<00:03:00.280> looks<00:03:00.430> stupid<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:02.080> guess<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.709> easier

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
of looks stupid but I guess it's easier

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.280 
of looks stupid but I guess it's easier
for<00:03:03.310> people<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:04.090> can't<00:03:04.480> read<00:03:04.690> instructions

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
for people that can't read instructions

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.250 
for people that can't read instructions
very<00:03:05.530> well<00:03:07.800> well<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.959> well<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.110> is

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
very well well so well this is

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.600 
very well well so well this is
interesting<00:03:11.410> looks<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.069> can<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.400> come

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
interesting looks like I can just come

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.400 
interesting looks like I can just come
apart<00:03:12.970> really<00:03:13.780> simple

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
apart really simple

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.410 
apart really simple
yeah<00:03:15.100> so<00:03:15.310> that's<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.700> chassis<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:18.420> the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
yeah so that's the chassis of the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.449 
yeah so that's the chassis of the
Printrbot<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.590> new<00:03:20.829> chassis<00:03:23.130> for<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.190> belt

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
Printrbot the new chassis for the belt

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.360 
Printrbot the new chassis for the belt
driven<00:03:25.110> version<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.860> board<00:03:27.130> is

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
driven version and so the board is

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.240 
driven version and so the board is
actually<00:03:27.579> going<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.120> be<00:03:28.239> underneath<00:03:29.250> this

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
actually going to be underneath this

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.690 
actually going to be underneath this
section<00:03:30.850> here<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:32.860> just<00:03:32.890> flip<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.310> out<00:03:33.489> and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
section here so you just flip it out and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.979 
section here so you just flip it out and
I<00:03:34.000> think<00:03:34.239> it's<00:03:34.390> gonna<00:03:34.540> be<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.720> little<00:03:34.900> bit

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
I think it's gonna be a little bit

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.810 
I think it's gonna be a little bit
better<00:03:35.140> some<00:03:35.440> people<00:03:35.769> said<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.340> they<00:03:36.610> don't

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
better some people said that they don't

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.199 
better some people said that they don't
like<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.620> but<00:03:38.620> it's<00:03:39.400> real<00:03:39.670> hard<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.940> get<00:03:40.090> to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
like that but it's real hard to get to

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.400 
like that but it's real hard to get to
the<00:03:40.299> printer<00:03:40.540> board<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.989> when<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:41.200> have<00:03:41.290> to

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
the printer board and when you have to

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.640 
the printer board and when you have to
adjust<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.920> pot<00:03:42.130> for<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.150> motor<00:03:43.959> overheating

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
adjust the pot for a motor overheating

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.880 
adjust the pot for a motor overheating
and<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.160> does<00:03:45.430> happen<00:03:46.320> it's<00:03:47.320> real<00:03:47.560> hard<00:03:47.769> to

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
and that does happen it's real hard to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.539 
and that does happen it's real hard to
adjust<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:48.549> let's<00:03:48.820> see<00:03:49.000> what's<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.299> this<00:03:49.420> bag

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
adjust for let's see what's in this bag

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.819 
adjust for let's see what's in this bag
let<00:03:51.549> me<00:03:51.670> open<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:52.120> one<00:03:52.329> up<00:03:52.410> let's<00:03:53.410> move<00:03:53.590> that

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
let me open this one up let's move that

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.400 
let me open this one up let's move that
over<00:03:54.010> here<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.450> far<00:03:55.600> we<00:03:55.720> have<00:03:55.750> wood<00:03:56.019> parts

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
over here so so far we have wood parts

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
over here so so far we have wood parts
we<00:03:57.130> got<00:03:57.370> some<00:03:58.209> extra<00:03:59.190> electronic<00:04:00.190> stuff

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
we got some extra electronic stuff

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.699 
we got some extra electronic stuff
mostly<00:04:00.970> extension<00:04:01.630> cables<00:04:02.049> looks<00:04:02.290> like<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> new

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
mostly extension cables looks like a new

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.290 
mostly extension cables looks like a new
end<00:04:02.920> stop

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.150 

with<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:07.630> open<00:04:08.050> here<00:04:09.780> we<00:04:10.780> have<00:04:11.050> three<00:04:11.860> bags

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
with this open here we have three bags

of black twist spice or zip tie a new
cord<00:04:22.000> extension<00:04:22.210> thing<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:23.230> already<00:04:23.680> have<00:04:24.040> one

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
cord extension thing I already have one

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.340 
cord extension thing I already have one
this<00:04:24.460> one<00:04:24.670> looks<00:04:24.700> twice<00:04:25.480> as<00:04:25.720> long<00:04:25.900> as<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.230> one

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
this one looks twice as long as the one

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.100 
this one looks twice as long as the one
I<00:04:26.380> currently<00:04:26.680> have<00:04:28.650> um<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.730> g2<00:04:30.730> belts<00:04:31.390> so<00:04:32.080> we

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
I currently have um the g2 belts so we

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.760 
I currently have um the g2 belts so we
get<00:04:32.560> two<00:04:32.830> belts<00:04:33.100> one<00:04:34.060> for<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.510> X<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.170> 1<00:04:35.380> for

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
get two belts one for the X and 1 for

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.750 
get two belts one for the X and 1 for
the<00:04:35.800> Y<00:04:37.080> we<00:04:38.080> get<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.470> new<00:04:38.740> motor<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.430> will<00:04:39.640> be

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
the Y we get a new motor this will be

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.840 
the Y we get a new motor this will be
for<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.830> y-axis<00:04:41.830> that's<00:04:41.980> gonna<00:04:42.190> replace<00:04:42.550> the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
for the y-axis that's gonna replace the

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:51.420 
for the y-axis that's gonna replace the
small<00:04:43.030> motor<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.810> y<00:04:44.320> axis<00:04:44.770> used<00:04:44.980> to<00:04:45.100> have<00:04:50.430> and

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
small motor the y axis used to have and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.330 
small motor the y axis used to have and
it's<00:04:52.380> basically<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.560> same<00:04:53.770> kind<00:04:54.040> of<00:04:54.100> motor

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
it's basically the same kind of motor

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.460 
it's basically the same kind of motor
that<00:04:54.700> is<00:04:54.850> on<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:56.080> Z<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:57.550> extruder<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:59.290> X

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
that is on the Z the extruder and the X

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.770 
that is on the Z the extruder and the X
now<00:04:59.830> same<00:05:00.640> kind<00:05:02.700> when<00:05:03.700> we<00:05:03.910> get<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.570> auto

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
now same kind when we get the auto

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.380 
now same kind when we get the auto
leveling<00:05:05.500> for<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:07.500> z<00:05:08.500> axis<00:05:08.980> so<00:05:09.250> this<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.300> the

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
leveling for the z axis so this is the

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.770 
leveling for the z axis so this is the
auto<00:05:10.570> level<00:05:11.050> sensor<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:13.060> is<00:05:13.270> nice<00:05:13.450> it's

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
auto level sensor this is nice it's

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.270 
auto level sensor this is nice it's
gonna<00:05:13.930> be<00:05:14.050> real<00:05:14.230> nice<00:05:14.410> don't<00:05:14.770> have<00:05:14.890> to<00:05:14.980> level

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
gonna be real nice don't have to level

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.040 
gonna be real nice don't have to level
the<00:05:15.400> battle<00:05:15.700> all<00:05:15.760> the<00:05:15.790> time<00:05:18.720> looks<00:05:19.720> like<00:05:19.900> we

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
the battle all the time looks like we

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.770 
the battle all the time looks like we
get<00:05:20.200> two<00:05:21.750> wooden<00:05:23.700> laser-cut<00:05:24.700> wrenches<00:05:25.450> I

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
get two wooden laser-cut wrenches I

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.140 
get two wooden laser-cut wrenches I
believe<00:05:26.740> that's<00:05:26.980> for<00:05:28.080> adjusting<00:05:29.080> this<00:05:30.030> if<00:05:31.030> I

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
believe that's for adjusting this if I

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.180 
believe that's for adjusting this if I
saw<00:05:31.390> some<00:05:31.660> of<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.840> other<00:05:31.990> videos<00:05:32.350> from

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
saw some of the other videos from

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.740 
saw some of the other videos from
Printrbot<00:05:33.790> I<00:05:33.970> believe<00:05:34.240> that's<00:05:34.450> what<00:05:34.630> those

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
Printrbot I believe that's what those

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.900 
Printrbot I believe that's what those
are<00:05:34.960> for

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
are for

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.490 
are for
mm<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:38.100> do<00:05:39.100> not<00:05:39.520> know<00:05:39.820> what<00:05:40.030> this<00:05:40.210> is<00:05:40.450> for<00:05:40.750> it's<00:05:41.110> a

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
mm I do not know what this is for it's a

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:50.160 
mm I do not know what this is for it's a
black<00:05:43.080> shiny<00:05:44.160> piece<00:05:45.160> of<00:05:45.310> plastic<00:05:48.240> hmm<00:05:49.300> I'll

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170
