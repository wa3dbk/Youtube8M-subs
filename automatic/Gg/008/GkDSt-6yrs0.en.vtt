00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.029
 hello in this video moderately very short 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.779
 five different bluetooth speakers 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.849
 imagine and a little bit about 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.480
 bluetooth speakers throughout 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.490
 tell 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.780
 I just like that for the topic 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.870
 I'm interested in them and that's why 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.740
 Bluetooth speaker closer 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.779
 basically one can say that the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.369
 if one looks so already at amazon all 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.080
 really very good reviews 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.650
 The worst is then here 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.330
 the creative of the 100 with 4 3 out of 5 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.689
 maximum and the best is the fund 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.130
 esm 485 maximum what is it about that 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.290
 all have such a good rating 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.620
 they all really bring a lot 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.420
 good acoustic performance that means you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 closes the peru via bluetooth altogether 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.829
 easy on power on the phone or 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.690
 tablet computer, the music and immediately you go 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.430
 go and the sound is appealing 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.370
 Of course you can not do that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 expect proper stereos sound 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.640
 and the better sometimes allow for something 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.800
 Wish but the native 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.510
 Differences are rather marginal because of that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.160
 the customers are usually very 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.870
 Satisfied if you just do it 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.019
 then just take it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.600
 this master for just under 20 euros 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.150
 that can be like most others 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.260
 also as a telephone handsfree 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.270
 still be used so they too 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.640
 Can accept calls if you have this 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.140
 ding here with the phone then use 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.549
 Are you on the safe side? 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.299
 if you have a bit better sound 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.570
 want 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.240
 then I recommend the costs of csl 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.400
 about 35 euros and offers but just in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.250
 bass range again a lot more than 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.880
 but these two are here 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.530
 just a lot more expensive but that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.659
 worth it here if you have one 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.270
 Listen to a bit more bass-heavy music 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.650
 would like and also louder then this 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 here from csl also has one 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.530
 handsfree a bit like that 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.850
 in between is the month of august ms 425 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 The name is also a mobile phone 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.290
 Handsfree while acceptable 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.540
 Sound costs a bit more than 20 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.470
 euro also a very good thing for 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.790
 someone who is still a bit 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.899
 want to be price conscious and still 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.979
 A good sound also has on Amazon 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.540
 455 so you can not go wrong 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.719
 do 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.020
 this one from isaac that costs 26 27 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.780
 Euro 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.760
 the offers to back here the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.380
 possibility of a usb stick or a sd 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.710
 map 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.410
 to pass and listen to mp3s about it 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.240
 That is, well, I do not know 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.920
 So I think here they wanted to so only 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.570
 Do not want to lay eggs like that 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.190
 he has a radio with him 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.740
 this works, however, from the receipt 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.840
 but here you have relatively bad for it 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.830
 in the boxes saved something is the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.870
 sound not so good 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.550
 I can not recommend it except 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.200
 for someone who is necessarily on usb 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.700
 sticks or sd cards wants to put 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.980
 otherwise not recommended 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.010
 this thing behind the big creative of the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.270
 100 costs about 50 euro that has one 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.890
 little better sound than this 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.360
 smaller here in front but the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.800
 Price difference is in my opinion 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.360
 has not justified either 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.370
 mobile handsfree and otherwise 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.900
 nothing special 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.340
 and even if you make your voice loud then 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.410
 you realize that they also from the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.760
 Acoustics come to their limits 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.080
 this is already three now 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.600
 years old become all these others 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.670
 devices were all released in 2013 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.250
 in my view no justification 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.050
 for that high price and from that 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.120
 one of these three and then one is 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.610
 actually on a very good way me 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.620
 as I said because the cre also csl it 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.170
 Price conscious wants to take one of 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.610
 Thank you both for that 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.380
 a watch and I hope they come 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.380
 to gain some important insights
