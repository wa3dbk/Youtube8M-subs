00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.080
 Hello everyone and we continue our series 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.959
 video lessons on color correction 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.619
 using curves and today as I already 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.629
 promised 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.130
 we'll talk about the use of creams 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.050
 for skinton correction 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.180
 Here is such a picture with you and me 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.360
 It turned out such a basket on 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.920
 themselves initially it could 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.170
 arise when for example you inadvertently 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.000
 shoot the whole series of a cap or just you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.609
 there is no normal raw on the computer 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.739
 converter and allows you to adjust 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.809
 with someone there and so on may be the situation 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.550
 be mass do not agree 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.609
 it turned out we have a picture with much 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.219
 better but how did it come out well for 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.120
 beginnings we will rest in a small 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.879
 number of theories 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 skinton in numbers in snow color model 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.829
 looks like this 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.440
 that is, it should not be on our skin 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:05.060
 more than sixty percent magenta and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.370
 yellow, respectively, no more than 30 or 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.440
 33 from the address for yellow but maybe 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.470
 it's a little more then there 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.140
 our skinton looks like their numbers now 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.090
 how to put it into practice that is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.840
 we have a magic piece of paper seemingly 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
 all the luck we have in your pocket 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.620
 it only remains to understand how it works 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.440
 for this we will return to our original 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.240
 picture and analyze a naturally 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.740
 if your monitor is calibrated then you 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.150
 initially can isolate color which 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.730
 you need 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.770
 but for example we can do this with you 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.930
 just calibrated the monitor and thoroughly 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.120
 examining there color corrections by viewing 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.650
 a huge number of pictures but it is not 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.560
 we always do it like this 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.020
 therefore , it will help us in this case 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.740
 magic friend pipette and own 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.229
 curve for starters we pick a pipette in 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.650
 toolbar and key hold 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.790
 shift 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.380
 we arrange several points on the face 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.379
 models, respectively, we now have with 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.310
 you present three points 1. 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.260
 it is random on the cheek and on the chin 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.569
 now on the right side 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.750
 there is such a panel here I 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.909
 specifically even brought removed from the tab 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.400
 navigators poured separately here this 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.560
 panel as you can see here is true colors but 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.319
 unfortunately is displayed in rgb to this 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.060
 change to with you click on the arrow 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:40.190
 Pipettes from the bottom and choose the mind 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.049
 let's do it all for all our points 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.510
 Here is such a picture we have and 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.859
 now we begin to adjust it we 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.720
 dotted now we go 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.879
 adjustment layer create your own with 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.829
 crooked 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.629
 little theory still in the last lesson i 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.450
 told me that if you pull red 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.930
 at the top we have this color red if 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.480
 pull 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.909
 red down there and with that colors 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.459
 cyan they apologize accordingly 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.989
 green is our green and magenta 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:19.859
 and blue is blue and yellow and so 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.199
 reset all our settings and start 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.329
 work how do we work to start 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:28.290
 we see that we have a lot of price 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:31.560
 that is, 4-8 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:37.410
 exceeding the norm we choose the middle point 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.989
 and start getting a point on the curve 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.190
 begin to pull it up that is, we 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.790
 add a little red 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:57.209
 photos not so much example leave 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:04:00.720
 somewhere on average 10 12 many example 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.120
 now we have a difference of seven to ten 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.069
 in the picture with the largest 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.319
 our content is on our cheek 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.040
 because it is visually I am slightly darker 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.109
 due to make-up further now we go 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.389
 then we choose magenta look 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.940
 argent and magenta us everywhere is enough 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.220
 a lot of excess grandfather by 20 percent 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.300
 again take our curve and pull a little 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.550
 look up to what state we have 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.570
 cuff lifted well by example now up 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.250
 35 35 we will consider it ok we can 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.930
 slightly reduce 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 Here is such a picture 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.580
 it turned out now we see that with someone 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.830
 he has become quite yellow and 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.010
 the last tab is actually blue 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.040
 channel we all understand what to pull 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:52.250
 up so the picture lines here we are 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:58.980
 reached about forty so much 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:02.820
 to 35 35 30 so check now 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.360
 tsiferkami that we have all 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.150
 ok 30 we are approximately 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.810
 fit 36 3335 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.550
 Here is such a picture 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.230
 You can even slightly remove magenta to 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.500
 example you know about green and a little bit 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.660
 pulling more up but this is already to taste I 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.690
 for example, I like this skinton slightly 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:30.120
 pinkish so here's what we have with you 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.080
 It turned out we have two and once again as we 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.800
 it's all done 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.510
 we hold down the shift key 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.710
 point on our face that is site selection 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:43.440
 where we want to control the skinton 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.600
 further in the info palette we chose smack 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.620
 that is, by clicking on the checkmark we removed the media 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.050
 color to choose a laugh display 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.370
 on the left we have in these columns 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.490
 what was what became 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.110
 and strictly speaking with the help of curves we 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.470
 leveled our skinton 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.980
 Here is such a picture you will strike on this 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.200
 our today's lesson is over we series 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.430
 be sure to continue to see you at 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.430
 following our lessons
