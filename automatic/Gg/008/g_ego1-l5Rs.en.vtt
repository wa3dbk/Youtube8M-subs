you guys know I did upload a video on
this<00:00:08.550> before<00:00:08.900> now<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.960> reason<00:00:10.349> I'm<00:00:10.410> running

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
this before now the reason I'm running

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.200 
this before now the reason I'm running
doing<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.160> because<00:00:11.460> my<00:00:11.610> commentating

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
doing this is because my commentating

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.990 
doing this is because my commentating
then<00:00:12.360> was<00:00:12.570> pretty<00:00:12.900> bad<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.610> wasn't<00:00:14.610> as<00:00:14.700> clear

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
then was pretty bad I wasn't as clear

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.960 
then was pretty bad I wasn't as clear
and<00:00:15.770> anyways<00:00:16.770> let's<00:00:16.980> just<00:00:17.039> get<00:00:17.250> into<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.580> so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
and anyways let's just get into it so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.630 
and anyways let's just get into it so
the<00:00:18.720> starting<00:00:19.109> around<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.680> either<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.010> 15

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the starting around you can either do 15

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.820 
the starting around you can either do 15
or<00:00:20.789> 20<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.539> by<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> way<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.320> want<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> do<00:00:22.740> this

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
or 20 and by the way you want to do this

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.679 
or 20 and by the way you want to do this
in<00:00:22.980> custom<00:00:23.340> games<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.150> will<00:00:24.390> count

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
in custom games and this will count

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.189 
in custom games and this will count
towards<00:00:24.990> your<00:00:25.019> KD<00:00:25.320> custom<00:00:25.859> games<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.580> count

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
towards your KD custom games do count

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.750 
towards your KD custom games do count
towards<00:00:28.199> your<00:00:28.289> kills<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.070> downs<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.640> all

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
towards your kills and downs and all

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.519 
towards your kills and downs and all
that<00:00:29.910> stuff<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> does<00:00:30.510> not<00:00:30.660> count<00:00:30.929> towards

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that stuff but it does not count towards

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.130 
that stuff but it does not count towards
your<00:00:31.820> leaderboard<00:00:32.820> ranking<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.540> rounds

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
your leaderboard ranking on the rounds

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
your leaderboard ranking on the rounds
so<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.040> round<00:00:35.219> 50<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.969> custom

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
so if you go to like round 50 on custom

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
so if you go to like round 50 on custom
games<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> count<00:00:37.670> because

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
games it's not going to count because

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.240 
games it's not going to count because
you<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:39.059> start<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.360> 20<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.870> custom<00:00:40.230> games<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
you can start on 20 in custom games so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.420 
you can start on 20 in custom games so
you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:42.450> either<00:00:42.600> sign<00:00:42.780> around<00:00:43.020> 20<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:43.350> 15<00:00:44.070> but

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you can either sign around 20 or 15 but

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.139 
you can either sign around 20 or 15 but
the<00:00:44.520> reason<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.789> start<00:00:45.000> around<00:00:45.180> 20<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.809> because

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
the reason I start around 20 is because

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.760 
the reason I start around 20 is because
you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.300> buy<00:00:48.450> mustang<00:00:48.840> sally'<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.469> get

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you can buy mustang sally' and get

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
you can buy mustang sally' and get
Juggernog<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> same<00:00:50.760> time<00:00:51.090> instead<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
Juggernog at the same time instead of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
Juggernog at the same time instead of
round<00:00:52.170> 15<00:00:52.559> you'll<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> pack<00:00:53.160> points<00:00:53.550> then

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
round 15 you'll have to pack points then

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
round 15 you'll have to pack points then
wait<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.989> build<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.320> points<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> open

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
wait a bit to build up points to open

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.130 
wait a bit to build up points to open
the<00:00:56.070> door<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.489> buy<00:00:56.640> jug<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.510> don't<00:00:57.899> like

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the door then buy jug and I don't like

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
the door then buy jug and I don't like
doing<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.680> I'd<00:00:59.340> rather<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.879> have

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
doing that because I'd rather not have

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
doing that because I'd rather not have
junk<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> most<00:01:00.930> explosive<00:01:01.289> weapon<00:01:01.739> on

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
junk with the most explosive weapon on

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.349 
junk with the most explosive weapon on
the<00:01:01.949> game<00:01:02.100> which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> Mustang<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.000> salad

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the game which is the Mustang in salad

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.320 
the game which is the Mustang in salad
so<00:01:04.250> with<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> knife<00:01:05.549> ranking<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> really

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
so with a knife ranking it really

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.649 
so with a knife ranking it really
depends<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.530> pretty<00:01:07.830> random<00:01:08.360> your<00:01:09.360> KD

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
depends them it's pretty random your KD

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.649 
depends them it's pretty random your KD
either<00:01:10.110> has<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.650> 75<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.490> 100<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> knife

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
either has to be 75 or 100 for the knife

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.760 
either has to be 75 or 100 for the knife
rank<00:01:12.960> anywhere<00:01:13.650> from<00:01:13.770> 75<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.369> 150<00:01:15.229> yeah<00:01:16.229> 150<00:01:16.590> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
rank anywhere from 75 to 150 yeah 150 is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.050 
rank anywhere from 75 to 150 yeah 150 is
a<00:01:16.830> big<00:01:17.009> jump<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.580> how<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:18.000> for

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a big jump because that's how it was for

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.340 
a big jump because that's how it was for
me<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.600> had<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.680> about<00:01:20.479> 145<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.689> 130<00:01:22.049> Katie

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
me I had to get about 145 or 130 Katie

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.690 
me I had to get about 145 or 130 Katie
the<00:01:23.310> reason<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.640> did<00:01:23.909> how<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> got<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the reason I did how I got it was a I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
the reason I did how I got it was a I
got<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> run<00:01:26.939> 82<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.600> dereyes<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.619> have

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
got to run 82 on dereyes and I have

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.149 
got to run 82 on dereyes and I have
15,000<00:01:30.119> kills<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:30.600> game<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.770> yeah<00:01:31.979> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
15,000 kills in one game so yeah that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.399 
15,000 kills in one game so yeah that
really<00:01:32.549> boosted<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.030> KD<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> guys

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
really boosted my KD up and if you guys

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.230 
really boosted my KD up and if you guys
wonder<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> KD<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
wonder what the KD is it's it's the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
wonder what the KD is it's it's the
kills<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.869> your<00:01:37.079> downs<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.860> say<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.920> have

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
kills and your downs so you say you have

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.960 
kills and your downs so you say you have
a<00:01:41.159> thousand<00:01:41.729> kills<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.750> only<00:01:42.990> want<00:01:43.380> like

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
you if you want to do it this way which

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.250 
you if you want to do it this way which
is<00:02:34.000> probably<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.390> quickest<00:02:34.840> unless<00:02:35.050> if<00:02:35.200> you

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
is probably the quickest unless if you

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.370 
is probably the quickest unless if you
know<00:02:35.380> some<00:02:35.680> glitch<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.580> will<00:02:36.989> like<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> very

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
know some glitch that will like a very

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.860 
know some glitch that will like a very
glitch<00:02:38.739> week<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:40.209> up<00:02:40.330> somewhere<00:02:40.660> you're

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
glitch week and get up somewhere you're

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.360 
glitch week and get up somewhere you're
invincible<00:02:41.170> if<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.739> unless<00:02:42.010> you're<00:02:42.190> going<00:02:42.280> to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
invincible if you unless you're going to

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.190 
invincible if you unless you're going to
do<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.580> then<00:02:42.849> this<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.300> fastest<00:02:43.780> way<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
do that then this is the fastest way and

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.840 
do that then this is the fastest way and
you'll<00:02:44.799> have<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.130> get<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> lot<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.549> kills

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
you'll have to get a lot of kills

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.360 
you'll have to get a lot of kills
without<00:02:46.330> dying<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:48.569> um<00:02:49.569> so<00:02:50.110> yeah<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.220> lot

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
without dying and um so yeah just a lot

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.830 
without dying and um so yeah just a lot
of<00:02:51.400> commitment<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:51.970> depends<00:02:52.330> really<00:02:52.360> how<00:02:52.780> many

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
of commitment it depends really how many

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.490 
of commitment it depends really how many
kills<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.470> have<00:02:53.739> before<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.390> what<00:02:56.380> your
