00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
part of this video I'm basically going

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.340 
part of this video I'm basically going
to<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.500> Korean<00:02:15.250> soldier<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.150> trains<00:02:16.660> also

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
to the Korean soldier and trains also

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.540 
to the Korean soldier and trains also
have<00:02:17.470> face<00:02:17.710> paint<00:02:17.980> some<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.280> characters

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
have face paint some of the characters

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.670 
have face paint some of the characters
in<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.700> game<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.960> after<00:02:20.290> she<00:02:20.530> crawling

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
in the game but after she crawling

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.860 
in the game but after she crawling
through<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.010> options<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.880> like<00:02:22.180> changing

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
through the options and like changing

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.590 
through the options and like changing
out<00:02:22.960> colors<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.860> couldn't<00:02:24.370> get<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.390> change

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
out colors I couldn't get it to change

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.240 
out colors I couldn't get it to change
because<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.440> guess<00:02:26.590> apparently<00:02:26.710> they<00:02:27.130> don't

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
because I guess apparently they don't

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.160 
because I guess apparently they don't
have<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.850> for<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.120> at<00:02:28.510> least<00:02:28.630> not<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> soldier

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
have it for it at least not the soldier

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.570 
have it for it at least not the soldier
maybe<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.500> signal<00:02:29.770> has<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:30.070> i'm<00:02:30.190> not<00:02:30.220> sure<00:02:30.520> i

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
maybe the signal has it i'm not sure i

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.940 
maybe the signal has it i'm not sure i
haven't<00:02:30.700> unlocked<00:02:30.940> yet<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.530> soldier<00:02:32.860> i'm

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
haven't unlocked yet but the soldier i'm

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.730 
haven't unlocked yet but the soldier i'm
using<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.610> pattern<00:02:34.600> but<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.380> don't<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:35.590> any

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
using a pattern but I don't have any

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.900 
using a pattern but I don't have any
face<00:02:35.890> been<00:02:36.070> on<00:02:36.160> my<00:02:36.220> character<00:02:36.370> as<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.730> see

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
face been on my character as you can see

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.710 
face been on my character as you can see
it's<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.900> blank<00:02:38.260> default<00:02:39.070> turning<00:02:39.720> so

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
it's just the blank default turning so

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.910 
it's just the blank default turning so
yeah<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.780> that's<00:02:44.140> basically<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.650> for<00:02:44.770> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
yeah but that's basically it for the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.949 
yeah but that's basically it for the
video<00:02:45.010> just<00:02:45.670> showing<00:02:46.240> off<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.420> face<00:02:46.570> pic<00:02:46.780> for

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
video just showing off the face pic for

video just showing off the face pic for
the<00:02:47.020> asari<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.940> lack<00:02:49.240> of<00:02:49.270> face<00:02:49.600> paint<00:02:49.750> for

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
the asari and the lack of face paint for

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.390 
the asari and the lack of face paint for
the<00:02:49.990> trillian<00:02:50.380> but<00:02:50.740> it's<00:02:50.830> cool<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.250> face

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
the trillian but it's cool that the face

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.220 
the trillian but it's cool that the face
paints<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> game<00:02:51.940> regardless<00:02:52.360> really

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
