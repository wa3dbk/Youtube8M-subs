done I think your fight last characters
about<00:02:22.000> maybe<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.360> hundred<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:22.959> ninety-three

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
about maybe a hundred and ninety-three

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.899 
about maybe a hundred and ninety-three
more<00:02:24.069> cars<00:02:24.400> do<00:02:24.819> but<00:02:26.579> for<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.670> most<00:02:27.790> part

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
more cars do but for the most part

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.580 
more cars do but for the most part
that's<00:02:28.150> pretty<00:02:28.720> much<00:02:28.810> what<00:02:28.959> this<00:02:29.079> is<00:02:29.200> gonna<00:02:29.319> be
