I'm going to show you how to make choc &amp;
nut<00:00:18.020> cookies

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.600 

now<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:37.960> easiest<00:00:38.200> way<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.650> make<00:00:38.800> these<00:00:39.160> is<00:00:39.460> to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
now the easiest way to make these is to

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.270 
now the easiest way to make these is to
use<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:39.790> food<00:00:40.060> processor<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:41.080> I'm<00:00:41.980> going<00:00:42.190> to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
use a food processor and I'm going to

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.960 
use a food processor and I'm going to
tip<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.670> flour<00:00:42.940> in<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.710> then<00:00:45.640> I'm<00:00:45.760> going<00:00:45.910> to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
tip the flour in and then I'm going to

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.290 
tip the flour in and then I'm going to
roughly<00:00:46.390> chop<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.989> butter<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.640> butter<00:00:48.820> is<00:00:49.150> at

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
roughly chop the butter the butter is at

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.990 
roughly chop the butter the butter is at
room<00:00:49.330> temperature<00:00:50.200> so<00:00:50.380> that<00:00:50.500> it<00:00:50.860> will<00:00:51.040> mix<00:00:51.760> in

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
room temperature so that it will mix in

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.450 
room temperature so that it will mix in
quite<00:00:52.330> easily

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.119 

and<00:01:01.540> then<00:01:02.540> I'm<00:01:02.840> going<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.079> add<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.680> caster

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
and then I'm going to add the caster

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.320 
and then I'm going to add the caster
sugar<00:01:04.630> and<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:07.520> pinch<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.970> salt<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:10.210> then<00:01:11.210> I'm

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
sugar and a pinch of salt and then I'm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.120 
sugar and a pinch of salt and then I'm
going<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.600> whisk<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.020> until<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.860> mixture

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
going to whisk this until the mixture

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.130 
going to whisk this until the mixture
binds<00:01:13.610> together<00:01:19.149> so<00:01:20.149> I'm<00:01:20.240> going<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.570> scrape<00:01:20.840> it

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
binds together so I'm going to scrape it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.249 
binds together so I'm going to scrape it
down<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:22.180> then<00:01:23.180> just<00:01:23.450> whizz<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.869> little<00:01:23.990> bit

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
down and then just whizz it a little bit

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:43.719 
down and then just whizz it a little bit
longer<00:01:41.380> now<00:01:42.380> this<00:01:42.590> stage<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:43.190> just<00:01:43.399> like<00:01:43.550> an

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
longer now this stage is just like an

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.800 
longer now this stage is just like an
ordinary<00:01:43.880> shortbread<00:01:44.630> dough<00:01:46.720> because<00:01:47.720> it

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
ordinary shortbread dough because it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.570 
ordinary shortbread dough because it
needs<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.229> have<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.470> chocolate<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.310> nuts

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
needs to have the chocolate and the nuts

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.399 
needs to have the chocolate and the nuts
added<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:53.030> can<00:01:53.179> add<00:01:53.300> them<00:01:53.539> to<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.960> bowl<00:01:53.990> of

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
added you can add them to the bowl of

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.440 
added you can add them to the bowl of
the<00:01:54.500> food<00:01:54.710> processor<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.000> actually<00:01:56.149> find

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
the food processor but I actually find

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.389 
the food processor but I actually find
it<00:01:56.659> easier<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.080> do<00:01:57.319> it<00:01:57.440> in<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.679> slightly<00:01:57.979> wider

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
it easier to do it in a slightly wider

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.440 
it easier to do it in a slightly wider
top<00:01:58.850> bowl<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:01.100> I'm<00:02:01.159> going<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.399> tip<00:02:01.700> all<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.299> that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
top bowl so I'm going to tip all of that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.749 
top bowl so I'm going to tip all of that
mixture<00:02:02.840> into<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.560> bowl<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:06.439> then<00:02:07.220> add<00:02:07.280> the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
mixture into the bowl and then add the

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.830 
mixture into the bowl and then add the
chocolate<00:02:07.939> chunks<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.590> trot<00:02:09.860> nuts<00:02:10.840> and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
chocolate chunks and the trot nuts and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.530 
chocolate chunks and the trot nuts and
then<00:02:12.470> I'm<00:02:12.620> going<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.860> use<00:02:13.040> my<00:02:13.070> fingers<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.760> work

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
then I'm going to use my fingers to work

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:24.850 
then I'm going to use my fingers to work
this<00:02:14.780> together<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.860> form<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.280> dough

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.980 

this<00:02:25.460> may<00:02:25.670> take<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.910> few<00:02:26.060> minutes<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.840> work

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
this may take a few minutes to work

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.500 
this may take a few minutes to work
together<00:02:27.370> depending<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.910> temperature<00:02:29.210> of

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
together depending on the temperature of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.020 
together depending on the temperature of
your<00:02:29.540> hands<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.170> how<00:02:30.350> hot<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.800> room<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.250> until

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
your hands and how hot the room is until

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.020 
your hands and how hot the room is until
it<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:32.270> starts<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.810> bind<00:02:33.020> together<00:02:33.820> but<00:02:34.820> just

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
it all starts to bind together but just

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.520 
it all starts to bind together but just
keep<00:02:35.180> working<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.050> will<00:02:36.230> come

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
keep working it and it will come

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.160 
keep working it and it will come
together<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:37.130> form<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.520> dough<00:02:40.630> okay<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:41.690> once<00:02:41.990> it

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
together to form a dough okay so once it

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.830 
together to form a dough okay so once it
starts<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.680> soften<00:02:42.950> into<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.940> dough<00:02:44.210> you<00:02:44.810> can

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
starts to soften into a dough you can

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.580 
starts to soften into a dough you can
take<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.170> sheet<00:02:45.470> of<00:02:45.530> baking<00:02:45.860> parchment<00:02:46.400> and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
take a sheet of baking parchment and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.310 
take a sheet of baking parchment and
then<00:02:48.590> lift<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.040> onto<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:52.690> shape<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.720> into<00:02:54.110> a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
then lift it onto it and shape it into a

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.270 
then lift it onto it and shape it into a
sausage<00:02:54.560> shape<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.390> can<00:03:02.630> roll<00:03:02.840> it

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
sausage shape and then you can roll it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:15.470 
sausage shape and then you can roll it
from<00:03:04.280> using<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.760> paper<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.930> help<00:03:06.140> shape<00:03:06.590> it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.530 

and<00:03:16.080> then<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.040> needs<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.550> be<00:03:17.610> chilled<00:03:18.060> for<00:03:18.450> at

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
and then this needs to be chilled for at

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.110 
and then this needs to be chilled for at
least<00:03:18.720> 30<00:03:19.170> minutes<00:03:19.500> or<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.370> can<00:03:20.610> leave<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:21.030> in

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
least 30 minutes or you can leave it in

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.580 
least 30 minutes or you can leave it in
the<00:03:21.239> fridge<00:03:21.420> for<00:03:21.480> several<00:03:21.989> days<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.200> then

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the fridge for several days and then

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.199 
the fridge for several days and then
just<00:03:22.799> cut<00:03:23.010> off<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.430> amount<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.790> need<00:03:23.819> at<00:03:24.120> a

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
just cut off the amount you need at a

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.140 
just cut off the amount you need at a
time<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.750> cook<00:03:25.250> or<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:26.519> even<00:03:26.610> freeze<00:03:26.879> it

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
time to cook or you can even freeze it

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.780 
time to cook or you can even freeze it
if<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.420> want<00:03:27.629> to<00:03:27.959> freeze<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.069> as<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> raw<00:03:29.519> dough

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
if you want to freeze it as a raw dough

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.000 
if you want to freeze it as a raw dough
so<00:03:30.720> I'm<00:03:30.810> going<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.019> pop<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.379> into<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.709> fridge

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
so I'm going to pop that into the fridge

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.150 
so I'm going to pop that into the fridge
as<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> save<00:03:32.640> for<00:03:32.849> 30<00:03:33.090> minutes<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.890> when<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
as a save for 30 minutes so when the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.640 
as a save for 30 minutes so when the
dough<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.340> nice<00:03:35.700> confirm<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:37.049> can<00:03:37.230> unwrap<00:03:37.620> it

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
dough is nice confirm you can unwrap it

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.930 
dough is nice confirm you can unwrap it
and<00:03:38.190> then<00:03:38.879> cut<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.450> into<00:03:39.810> slices<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.700> cut

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and then cut it into slices so you cut

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.509 
and then cut it into slices so you cut
it<00:03:45.090> into<00:03:45.269> slices<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:46.739> are<00:03:46.769> about<00:03:47.190> a

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
it into slices that are about a

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:57.650 
it into slices that are about a
centimeter<00:03:48.150> thick<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:56.150> then<00:03:57.150> spread<00:03:57.599> them

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
centimeter thick and then spread them

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.580 
centimeter thick and then spread them
out<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.799> baking<00:03:59.760> sheet<00:04:00.049> which<00:04:01.049> is<00:04:01.319> lined

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
out on a baking sheet which is lined

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.280 
out on a baking sheet which is lined
either<00:04:02.370> with<00:04:02.849> baking<00:04:03.239> parchment<00:04:03.420> or<00:04:04.109> with<00:04:04.260> a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
either with baking parchment or with a

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.800 
either with baking parchment or with a
non-stick<00:04:04.799> liner<00:04:05.209> if<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.390> dough<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.599> very

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
non-stick liner if the dough is very

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.640 
non-stick liner if the dough is very
firm<00:04:07.349> then<00:04:08.099> they<00:04:08.220> might<00:04:08.400> be<00:04:08.549> slightly<00:04:08.849> crumbly

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
firm then they might be slightly crumbly

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.670 
firm then they might be slightly crumbly
so<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.099> cut<00:04:11.340> them<00:04:11.810> push<00:04:12.810> them<00:04:13.049> together<00:04:13.200> on

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
so as you cut them push them together on

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.340 
so as you cut them push them together on
the<00:04:13.920> baking<00:04:14.069> sheet

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.860 

so<00:04:20.350> I'm<00:04:20.410> going<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.650> leave<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:20.919> dough<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:22.660> cook

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
so I'm going to leave that dough to cook

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.590 
so I'm going to leave that dough to cook
at<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.169> later<00:04:23.380> date<00:04:23.850> so<00:04:24.850> I'll<00:04:25.030> wrap<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.270> back

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
at a later date so I'll wrap it back

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.960 
at a later date so I'll wrap it back
again<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:28.479> put<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:28.930> back<00:04:29.169> in<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.470> fridge

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
again and put that back in the fridge

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.760 
again and put that back in the fridge
