so you want
check<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.189> with<00:01:43.430> just<00:01:44.229> continually<00:01:45.229> checking

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
check it with just continually checking

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.100 
check it with just continually checking
that<00:01:46.610> didn't<00:01:47.030> go<00:01:47.119> deep<00:01:47.270> enough<00:01:47.420> also<00:01:47.780> got<00:01:48.079> a

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
that didn't go deep enough also got a

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.440 
that didn't go deep enough also got a
lot<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.289> room<00:01:48.560> in<00:01:49.149> there

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.859 

so<00:01:55.750> I'm<00:01:55.810> going<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:55.960> go<00:01:56.080> a<00:01:56.110> little<00:01:56.260> deeper

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.160 

there's<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.439> little<00:02:02.710> bit<00:02:02.829> lighter<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.990> gonna

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
there's a little bit lighter I'm gonna

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.080 
there's a little bit lighter I'm gonna
go<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.289> little<00:02:05.380> bit<00:02:05.619> wider<00:02:06.009> because<00:02:06.340> as<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:06.939> can

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
go a little bit wider because as you can

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.949 
go a little bit wider because as you can
see<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.990> gets<00:02:08.170> wider<00:02:08.500> as<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.890> get<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
see it gets wider as you get to the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.570 
see it gets wider as you get to the
closer<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.349> screw<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.980> want<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.280> want

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
closer to the screw you want to want

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.150 
closer to the screw you want to want
that<00:02:12.760> spoon<00:02:13.239> closed<00:02:13.590> pretty<00:02:14.590> close<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
that spoon closed pretty close to the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:25.740 
that spoon closed pretty close to the
power<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.959> without<00:02:17.200> touching

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.940 

there<00:02:26.320> we<00:02:26.380> go

to set the position in the wax when

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.690 
to set the position in the wax when
we're<00:02:43.580> doing<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.880> wax<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.860> let's<00:02:46.280> do<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.520> Box

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
we're doing the wax so let's do the Box

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.020

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
out with some compressed air so now I'm

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.730 
out with some compressed air so now I'm
going<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> put<00:03:00.690> some<00:03:00.840> melted<00:03:01.170> wax<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.560> there

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
going to put some melted wax in there

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.800 
going to put some melted wax in there
and<00:03:01.950> set<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> screw<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:04.580> like<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.730> use<00:03:05.880> pink<00:03:06.600> wax

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
and set the screw I like to use pink wax

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.110 
and set the screw I like to use pink wax
because<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.400> that's<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.489> little<00:03:08.670> bit<00:03:08.910> more

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120

melted<00:05:08.509> wax<00:05:09.400> lots<00:05:10.400> of<00:05:10.490> cools<00:05:10.759> I'll<00:05:10.969> hold<00:05:11.120> its

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
melted wax lots of cools I'll hold its

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.839 
melted wax lots of cools I'll hold its
position<00:05:11.830> okay<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:12.979> think<00:05:13.069> this<00:05:13.340> is<00:05:13.520> cooled

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
position okay I think this is cooled

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.659 
position okay I think this is cooled
long<00:05:14.419> enough<00:05:14.659> so<00:05:15.169> just<00:05:15.710> very<00:05:16.039> gently<00:05:16.340> pull<00:05:16.639> it

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
long enough so just very gently pull it

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.050 
long enough so just very gently pull it
not<00:05:17.389> to<00:05:17.539> wiggle<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.020> little<00:05:18.259> bit<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:19.849> get<00:05:19.909> it

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
not to wiggle it a little bit to get it

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.129 
not to wiggle it a little bit to get it
to<00:05:20.210> release<00:05:22.360> take<00:05:23.360> you're<00:05:25.689> not<00:05:26.689> like<00:05:26.870> using

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
to release take you're not like using

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.499 
to release take you're not like using
this<00:05:27.349> little<00:05:27.529> blade<00:05:27.830> thing<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:29.210> can<00:05:29.389> use

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
this little blade thing you can use

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.839 
this little blade thing you can use
anything<00:05:29.870> just<00:05:30.110> clean<00:05:30.379> up<00:05:30.409> the<00:05:30.740> wax<00:05:31.639> that

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
anything just clean up the wax that

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.480 
anything just clean up the wax that
scored<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.300> out<00:05:32.479> a<00:05:34.240> little<00:05:35.240> bit

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
scored it out a little bit

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.010 
scored it out a little bit
this<00:05:37.490> is<00:05:37.699> mainly<00:05:37.909> for<00:05:38.180> acrylic<00:05:38.479> reasons

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
this is mainly for acrylic reasons

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.890 
this is mainly for acrylic reasons
you're<00:05:40.009> going<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.610> want<00:05:40.789> as<00:05:41.000> much<00:05:41.389> acrylic

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
you're going to want as much acrylic

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.950 
you're going to want as much acrylic
around<00:05:42.319> that<00:05:42.469> screw<00:05:42.740> as<00:05:42.860> possible<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.870> it

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
around that screw as possible so it

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.559 
around that screw as possible so it
stays<00:05:45.199> in<00:05:45.729> the<00:05:46.729> acrylic<00:05:48.639> okay<00:05:49.639> so<00:05:50.180> there<00:05:50.389> is

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
stays in the acrylic okay so there is

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.999 
stays in the acrylic okay so there is
your<00:05:50.719> wax<00:05:50.930> slot<00:05:51.319> which<00:05:52.250> fits<00:05:52.550> perfectly<00:05:54.009> your

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
your wax slot which fits perfectly your

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.090 
your wax slot which fits perfectly your
