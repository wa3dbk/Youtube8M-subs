 The materials and tools needed this time are chocolate-colored icing

 Such icing seems to be selling everywhere in the United States 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:32.140
 In Australia you can't get it unless you go to a specialty store 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.760
 If not , put the melted dark chocolate in the squeeze bag made of Ziplock bag and use it 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.270

 Is it very convenient to save the trouble of making a sound with this? 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.830
 If you can not get it, please make your own eyes 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.280
 Make a round place with melted white chocolate on the cooking sheet and on it 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.369

 This one has the cream in the middle 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.540
 Two knives 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:36.659
 So let's get started 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:41.370
 There is something prepared here, but I will start from taking place the cream of the space sky key 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:48.320
 The space key splits in half and scrapes cream in life 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:51.420
 Please be clean as possible by wiping with a finger when I still remains cream still 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.790
 I will use this flat surface this time 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.080
 This is done 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.159
 Next cut the chocolate chips in half 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.620

 A small flower was made 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.680
 Please prepare a spare in case you can not clean it 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:19.350
 Fix the sound based on the next 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:23.460
 I will add a little bit of icing or mashed dark chocolate to the food I prepared earlier 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:28.680
 It is easier to understand if you put it behind your eyes, so I put it here 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:33.120
 You can put it on either side This cookie icing is such as royal icing 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.830
 I want to go dry and why do you take the nyak here 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.510
 Of course dark chocolate will do the same 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.700
 Let's fix one more 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.960
 Do not put too much here . If you put a lot, it takes time to dry. 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.210
 It takes 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.830
 If you put it on the edge of the highlight oleo cookie and make a fan c please make it here 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.470
 I removed the cream 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:02.890

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:07.880
 Take a frosting cup with your back of life 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:13.860
 Spread the frosting to the position of the cake as you see it when you put it on 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:17.730
 Take care not to have frosting on the outside of the cupcake here 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.500
 Move the life back and forth with a little more frosting 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.500
 Make a small mountain 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:32.680

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:36.700
 Please save the small parts you made in 3 containers. 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.530

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.660
 Please do not 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:58.480
 Put a coconut in the morning when it is necessary to have a party, etc. so that you don't become a panda with a changed face 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.780
 Please make sure to attach the parts prepared in advance

 When rolling , the horse is raised with frosting , so the shape is adjusted with the palm of the hand

 Prepare a little flat surface and make it easy to make a face 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.720

 Let's get it right 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.540
 Change the orientation of the cupcake to face the panda

 Please find the ear a little away rather than two side by side 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.849
 The sentence of the fang is done now 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.920
 I will pay attention to the next 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:05:00.000
 Then put it in the middle and make it face the front, 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.000
 Fix so that the black part points to the diagonal bottom of both women 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.449
 I made a sound with this 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.969
