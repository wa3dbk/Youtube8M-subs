are<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.240> finished<00:01:42.659> areas<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.159> look

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
are in finished areas and as you look

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
are in finished areas and as you look
here<00:01:44.670> there<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> door<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> other<00:01:45.540> end<00:01:45.750> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
here there is a door at the other end of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.990 
here there is a door at the other end of
this<00:01:46.020> attic<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> go

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this attic but it's you have to go

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910 
this attic but it's you have to go
through<00:01:48.180> an<00:01:48.240> unfinished<00:01:48.630> attic<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.740> get

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
through an unfinished attic to to get

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.840 
through an unfinished attic to to get
there<00:01:50.100> which<00:01:50.250> would<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.610> been

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
there which would not have been

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.940 
there which would not have been
considered<00:01:51.149> safe<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> floor

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
considered safe you can see on the floor

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.690 
considered safe you can see on the floor
you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.820> there<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.350> conduit<00:01:55.350> for

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
you know there there are conduit for

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.010 
you know there there are conduit for
wiring<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.149> various<00:01:57.450> things<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.810> would<00:01:57.960> be

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
wiring and various things that would be

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560 
wiring and various things that would be
trip<00:01:58.259> hazards<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.130> really<00:01:59.729> that's<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.240> reason

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
trip hazards so really that's the reason

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.210 
trip hazards so really that's the reason
why<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> fourth<00:02:01.079> floor<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.500> occupied
