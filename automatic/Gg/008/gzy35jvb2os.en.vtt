00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
for a little while a pretty good time

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250 
for a little while a pretty good time
with<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.790> any<00:00:35.940> gun<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:37.110> make<00:00:37.230> sure

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
with just any gun just make sure

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
with just any gun just make sure
hopefully<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.920> gonna<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.219> powerful<00:00:38.520> but

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
hopefully it's gonna be a powerful but

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.660 
hopefully it's gonna be a powerful but
good<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> Wunderwaffe<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
good with the Wunderwaffe and with the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
good with the Wunderwaffe and with the
Raygun<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.290> makes

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
Raygun just because that makes

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.220 
Raygun just because that makes
everything<00:00:43.739> easier<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:45.090> yes<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.079> too

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
everything easier but yes it's not too

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.479 
everything easier but yes it's not too
hard<00:00:46.440> sometimes<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.340> tight

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
hard sometimes can get a little tight

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.360 
hard sometimes can get a little tight
situations<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.860> usually<00:00:49.860> you'll<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.129> fine

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
situations but usually you'll be fine

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.819 
situations but usually you'll be fine

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to do it here this works best when

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.289 
to do it here this works best when
you're<00:01:36.869> doing<00:01:37.200> more<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> team<00:01:38.310> not<00:01:38.970> with

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you're doing more with a team not with

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.030 
you're doing more with a team not with
just<00:01:39.659> yourself<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.920> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
just yourself but you can do it you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.889 
just yourself but you can do it you
would<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.460> either<00:01:41.670> way<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.659> whatever

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
would do it on either way just whatever

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
would do it on either way just whatever
the<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> zombies<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.610> should

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the way the zombies are going and should

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.109 
the way the zombies are going and should
be<00:01:45.210> pretty<00:01:45.390> easy<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.930> too<00:01:46.079> hard

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
be pretty easy not too hard

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.760 
be pretty easy not too hard
Sparra<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> starting<00:01:49.200> area<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
Sparra is in the starting area but I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
Sparra is in the starting area but I
really<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.430> recommend<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.090> unless<00:01:51.180> you're

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
really do not recommend it unless you're

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.760 
really do not recommend it unless you're
with<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> team<00:01:51.840> there's<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.229> many<00:01:52.320> zombies

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
with the team there's not many zombies

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
with the team there's not many zombies
with<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.509> caught<00:01:54.720> up

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
with you you can get really caught up

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.510 
with you you can get really caught up
here<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.590> stuck<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.369> just

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
here and you can get stuck and it's just

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.789 
here and you can get stuck and it's just
not<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> safe<00:01:57.299> luckily<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.290> had<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> get

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
not that safe luckily I had to get

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.170 
not that safe luckily I had to get
around<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> don't<00:01:59.790> recommend

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
around it but you know I don't recommend

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
around it but you know I don't recommend
it<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.420> playing<00:02:00.719> solo<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> team<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it for playing solo with the team and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.670 
it for playing solo with the team and
you<00:02:02.430> need<00:02:02.579> somewhere<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.180> maybe<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.530> but

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
you need somewhere to be maybe here but

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.679 
you need somewhere to be maybe here but
it's<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.460> great<00:02:05.790> rating<00:02:06.180> spot<00:02:06.479> but

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
it's just not a great rating spot but

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.279 
it's just not a great rating spot but
you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.990> run<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.320> train<00:02:07.799> there<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
you can run a train there and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.320 
you can run a train there and
it's<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:10.009> it's<00:02:10.190> pretty<00:02:10.459> decent<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:11.090> just

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
it's it's a it's pretty decent it's just

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.860 
it's it's a it's pretty decent it's just
definitely<00:02:11.870> not<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.500> best<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.330> guys<00:02:14.599> that's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
definitely not the best so guys that's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
solo or with the group the best area in

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.170 
solo or with the group the best area in
my<00:02:21.140> opinion<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.769> either<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.519> Tom's<00:02:22.790> room<00:02:22.970> is

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
my opinion is either the Tom's room is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.640 
my opinion is either the Tom's room is
pretty<00:02:23.360> big<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.569> pretty<00:02:23.750> easy<00:02:24.110> or<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
pretty big and pretty easy or the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.440 
pretty big and pretty easy or the
starting<00:02:25.310> area<00:02:25.489> aren't<00:02:25.879> nothing<00:02:26.209> starting

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
starting area aren't nothing starting

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.869 
starting area aren't nothing starting
near<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.720> power<00:02:26.870> area<00:02:27.290> my<00:02:27.500> bad<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.730> yeah

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
near the power area my bad and so yeah

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.309 
near the power area my bad and so yeah
those<00:02:29.030> are<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.269> two<00:02:29.420> best<00:02:29.629> so<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:29.959> run<00:02:30.230> them

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
those are the two best so you run them

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.509 
those are the two best so you run them
there<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.470> should<00:02:30.709> probably<00:02:30.860> go<00:02:31.040> for<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.250> long

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
there you should probably go for a long

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.850
