00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello to all a very long time I laid out on 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.230
 old tutorial channel about shower and many 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.370
 said in the comments that you can 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.860
 make less 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 I learned how and now I am ready for you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.049
 show this system as you can see 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 there is absolutely no difference with external 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.619
 sides but from the inside 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 changed a lot as you see we 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.970
 click on the lever and immediately swim 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.890
 north give them show how this system 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.470
 build in a more compact version 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.060
 For example, I will probably take this not to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.830
 wall and so to begin with we must 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.140
 decide where the water will drip 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.910
 let it be here we must 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.840
 put semi blocks to water 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.430
 did not spread 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.110
 next here we have to put two 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 piston and make a water tank 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:53.239
 I have you, he is quite simply like this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.780
 way further we raise the block above and 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.090
 here it is not fill in here yet 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.370
 screaming will stand here mean behind 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.000
 leverage we have to put the torch on 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.810
 torch block on the side of the block one more torch on 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.380
 torch is another block and here is another block 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.200
 here two blocks here god and redstone here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.689
 save up both pistons move in now we 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.500
 here we can pour water and when he 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.830
 push start 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.600
 two levers open and naturally 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.470
 face water begins guess at what is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.530
 pretty clear 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.270
 when this torch goes out this torch 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.329
 illuminates with the result that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.750
 this torch went out and accordingly the pistons 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.570
 open and when this torch is lit 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.140
 then this torch goes out and accordingly 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.520
 this torch lights up naturally 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.829
 makes the pistons activate again 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.740
 But I think this system is more than once 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.649
 than the old it is much less resource cost 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.090
 her very compact and even 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.280
 close to the ideal 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.899
 Well, this is probably all subscribe 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.490
 channel add from group start 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.020
 comments like you add 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.399
 national team invites their friends not 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.040
 forget that every week I have 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.200
 interesting videos come out 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.580
 Redstone systems once again all big 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.580
 thanks for watching everyone bye
