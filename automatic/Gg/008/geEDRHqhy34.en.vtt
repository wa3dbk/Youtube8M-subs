00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.019 

so<00:00:02.190> earlier<00:00:03.410> I<00:00:04.410> was<00:00:05.220> talking<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.640> these

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
so earlier I was talking about these

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.749 
so earlier I was talking about these
rear<00:00:06.529> differential<00:00:07.529> mounting<00:00:07.830> bolts<00:00:08.630> I

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
rear differential mounting bolts I

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.860 
rear differential mounting bolts I
mistakenly<00:00:11.759> said<00:00:12.059> they<00:00:12.150> were<00:00:12.210> ten<00:00:12.450> millimeter

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
mistakenly said they were ten millimeter

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.700 
mistakenly said they were ten millimeter
and<00:00:13.679> they're<00:00:14.070> not<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:15.289> forgot<00:00:16.320> they're

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and they're not I forgot they're

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.259 
and they're not I forgot they're
monsters<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.730> had<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.090> go<00:00:18.210> buy<00:00:18.359> this

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:33.290 

it's<00:00:24.269> an<00:00:24.420> H<00:00:24.660> 12<00:00:28.609> H<00:00:29.609> 12<00:00:30.080> monster<00:00:31.250> Allen<00:00:32.300> it's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it's an H 12 H 12 monster Allen it's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.760 
it's an H 12 H 12 monster Allen it's
like<00:00:33.450> stick<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.530> finger<00:00:34.829> almost<00:00:36.770> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
like stick is your finger almost you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.470 
like stick is your finger almost you
don't<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.070> bind<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> trick<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> with

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
don't want to bind so the trick is with

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.229 
don't want to bind so the trick is with
these<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.100> use<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> jack<00:00:41.579> if<00:00:41.910> you're<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
these is to use a jack if you're on the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.920 
these is to use a jack if you're on the
ground<00:00:42.950> don't<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.719> advantage<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.840> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
ground don't have the advantage of a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.760 
ground don't have the advantage of a
lift<00:00:46.399> which<00:00:47.629> still<00:00:48.629> it'd<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> had

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
lift which still it'd be good if you had

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.760 
lift which still it'd be good if you had
one<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.010> those<00:00:50.070> tall<00:00:51.590> transmission<00:00:52.590> jack

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
one of those tall transmission jack

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.220 
one of those tall transmission jack
things<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> bolts<00:00:55.020> like

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
things you want to get the bolts like

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.119 
things you want to get the bolts like
centered<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:57.059> their<00:00:57.539> mounting<00:00:57.899> positions<00:00:58.379> as

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
centered in their mounting positions as

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
centered in their mounting positions as
much<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.460> possible<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:01.079> kind<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
much as possible so you kind of have to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
much as possible so you kind of have to
work<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> jack<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.000> bit<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
work with the jack just a little bit to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.759 
work with the jack just a little bit to
get<00:01:03.719> them<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> where<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> don't<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> bunch

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
get them to where you don't have a bunch

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.200 
get them to where you don't have a bunch
of<00:01:04.860> resistance<00:01:05.400> against<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.000> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of resistance against them because you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.740 
of resistance against them because you
don't<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.920> bolt<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.750> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
don't want to take the bolt out you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.690 
don't want to take the bolt out you
don't<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> take<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.439> these<00:01:10.700> monster

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
don't want to take one of these monster

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.810 
don't want to take one of these monster
Bowl<00:01:11.880> cells<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> strip<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
Bowl cells have it strip so you want it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.550 
Bowl cells have it strip so you want it
to<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.180> even<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.659> possible<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.350> want

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to be as even as possible you don't want

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.399 
to be as even as possible you don't want
to<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> differential<00:01:18.409> down

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to like you have the differential down

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
to like you have the differential down
at<00:01:19.650> an<00:01:19.770> angle<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.580> where<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
at an angle it's where they have the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.179 
at an angle it's where they have the
bolt<00:01:21.360> down<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.590> trying<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> come<00:01:23.100> out

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
bolt down like this trying to come out

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.560 
bolt down like this trying to come out
of<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.460> hole<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> diff<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
of that hole you know in the diff and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.960 
of that hole you know in the diff and
you<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.470> close<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.130> level<00:01:29.850> as

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you want to have it as close to level as

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.130 
you want to have it as close to level as
possible<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.630> don't<00:01:30.750> want<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
possible and you don't want to have the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.450 
possible and you don't want to have the
jack<00:01:31.350> too<00:01:31.560> high<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:31.950> coming<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.340> like

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
jack too high you're coming out like

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
jack too high you're coming out like
this<00:01:32.759> makes<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> kind<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> hard<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this makes it kind of hard you want to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.310 
this makes it kind of hard you want to
get<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:36.000> workers<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.140> take

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
get it just right so workers it in take

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710 
get it just right so workers it in take
your<00:01:37.350> time<00:01:37.880> that's<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.540> last

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
your time that's what you know the last

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.560 
your time that's what you know the last
one<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.290> I'm<00:01:40.680> having<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> Matt<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.240> problem

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
one here I'm having it Matt I'm problem

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
one here I'm having it Matt I'm problem
I<00:01:42.630> had<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.380> was<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:44.310> messing<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I had it for I was just messing with it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.490 
I had it for I was just messing with it
for<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.540> minute<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.990> get<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> new<00:01:46.350> act

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
for like one minute and get the new act

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
for like one minute and get the new act
just<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.100> level<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.640> where<00:01:48.270> they<00:01:48.420> don't

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
just the right level to where they don't

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.120 
just the right level to where they don't
come<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:48.930> basically<00:01:49.759> almost<00:01:50.759> by<00:01:52.009> almost<00:01:53.009> by

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
come out basically almost by almost by

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.330 
come out basically almost by almost by
finger<00:01:53.460> tight

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.820 

anyways<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:59.600> that's<00:02:00.590> just<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:01.040> hint<00:02:01.250> or<00:02:01.490> tip
