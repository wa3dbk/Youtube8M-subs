00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.039 
all right the next shape is the G shape
we're<00:00:05.130> doing<00:00:05.460> all<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.670> these<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.330> key<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.720> D

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
there are all G chords so you take that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.670 
there are all G chords so you take that
same<00:00:54.510> shape<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:56.150> move<00:00:57.150> it<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.900> here's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
same shape and move it up so that here's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.270 
same shape and move it up so that here's
a<00:00:58.770> D<00:00:59.070> note<00:00:59.340> that's<00:01:00.240> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.630> eighth<00:01:00.780> fret<00:01:01.280> in

order<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.700> play<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.180> chord<00:01:03.450> I<00:01:03.600> need<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
order to play that chord I need to

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.060 
order to play that chord I need to
effectively<00:01:05.400> bring<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.910> nut<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.500> by<00:01:07.500> barring

and<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:10.280> play<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> G<00:01:11.700> shape<00:01:11.970> D<00:01:12.510> chord<00:01:13.850> so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and I can play a G shape D chord so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
and I can play a G shape D chord so
again<00:01:15.090> let's<00:01:15.300> start<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.900> root<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.530> time

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
again let's start on the root this time

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.370 
again let's start on the root this time
it's<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.190> be<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:17.460> little<00:01:17.760> finger<00:01:17.970> on
