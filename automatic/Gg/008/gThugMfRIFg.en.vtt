all<00:00:06.730> right<00:00:06.880> this<00:00:07.060> is<00:00:07.180> my<00:00:07.330> 2003<00:00:08.290> Yamaha<00:00:08.710> blaster

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
all right this is my 2003 Yamaha blaster

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.450 
all right this is my 2003 Yamaha blaster
I<00:00:09.910> was<00:00:10.420> going<00:00:10.600> up<00:00:10.660> a<00:00:10.780> hill<00:00:10.930> and<00:00:11.200> I<00:00:11.860> heard<00:00:12.370> a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
I was going up a hill and I heard a

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.180 
I was going up a hill and I heard a
little<00:00:12.760> bit<00:00:12.880> of<00:00:13.000> a<00:00:13.180> clunking<00:00:13.660> sound<00:00:14.020> and<00:00:14.440> lost

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
little bit of a clunking sound and lost

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.560 
little bit of a clunking sound and lost
lost<00:00:15.910> all<00:00:16.420> of<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.750> power<00:00:16.990> and<00:00:17.320> I<00:00:17.980> ended<00:00:18.220> up<00:00:18.310> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
lost all of the power and I ended up a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.839 
lost all of the power and I ended up a
limp<00:00:19.570> in<00:00:19.689> it<00:00:19.840> limping<00:00:20.439> at<00:00:20.560> home<00:00:20.770> and<00:00:21.160> I<00:00:21.189> took

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
limp in it limping at home and I took

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.659 
limp in it limping at home and I took
the<00:00:23.189> quad<00:00:24.189> apart<00:00:24.550> took<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.150> cylinder<00:00:25.509> off<00:00:25.810> and

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
the quad apart took the cylinder off and

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.850 
the quad apart took the cylinder off and
I'll<00:00:27.669> show<00:00:27.849> you<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:28.090> piston<00:00:28.540> and<00:00:28.800> looks<00:00:29.800> like

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
I'll show you the piston and looks like

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.729 
I'll show you the piston and looks like
the<00:00:30.040> piston<00:00:30.430> piece<00:00:31.329> of<00:00:31.509> it<00:00:31.630> broke<00:00:31.840> off<00:00:32.079> and<00:00:32.410> you

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
the piston piece of it broke off and you

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.780 
the piston piece of it broke off and you
can<00:00:32.860> see<00:00:32.890> it<00:00:33.100> probably<00:00:33.430> went<00:00:33.520> right<00:00:33.760> through

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
can see it probably went right through

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
can see it probably went right through
here<00:00:34.600> up<00:00:35.530> through<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.010> top<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.430> fused<00:00:36.850> I<00:00:37.180> mean

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
here up through the top it fused I mean

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.279 
here up through the top it fused I mean
part<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.039> piston<00:00:39.850> rings<00:00:40.090> or<00:00:40.329> fused<00:00:40.809> to<00:00:41.170> the

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
part of the piston rings or fused to the

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.220 
part of the piston rings or fused to the
piston<00:00:41.980> now<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.489> as<00:00:43.269> you<00:00:43.539> can<00:00:43.629> see<00:00:43.690> at<00:00:43.929> the<00:00:44.050> top

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
piston now and as you can see at the top

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.439 
piston now and as you can see at the top
here<00:00:44.500> there's<00:00:44.679> a<00:00:44.739> bunch<00:00:45.010> of<00:00:45.129> not<00:00:45.370> just<00:00:45.640> bounced

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
here there's a bunch of not just bounced

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.840 
here there's a bunch of not just bounced
around<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:47.050> there<00:00:47.289> quite<00:00:47.739> a<00:00:47.769> bit<00:00:48.010> before<00:00:48.519> it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
around and there quite a bit before it

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.549 
around and there quite a bit before it
probably<00:00:49.120> got<00:00:49.210> ejected<00:00:49.719> in<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.839> exhaust<00:00:50.230> or

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
probably got ejected in the exhaust or

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.009 
probably got ejected in the exhaust or
something<00:00:50.859> like<00:00:50.949> that<00:00:51.100> or<00:00:51.219> even<00:00:51.250> melted<00:00:51.910> so<00:00:52.629> I

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
something like that or even melted so I

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.130 
something like that or even melted so I
went<00:00:53.559> ahead<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.769> bought<00:00:54.039> a<00:00:54.839> set<00:00:55.839> from<00:00:56.280> Westco

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
went ahead and bought a set from Westco

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.459 
went ahead and bought a set from Westco
Weiss<00:00:59.140> Co<00:00:59.350> or<00:00:59.620> Westco<00:01:00.219> it's<00:01:01.089> a<00:01:01.469> highly

of all the gaskets you know put the top
end<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.490> piston<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:12.940> actually<00:01:13.360> it's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
end and the piston is actually it's

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.250 
end and the piston is actually it's
forged<00:01:13.900> so<00:01:14.940> pretty<00:01:15.940> much<00:01:16.060> an<00:01:16.240> pretty<00:01:16.750> pretty

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
forged so pretty much an pretty pretty

forged so pretty much an pretty pretty
good<00:01:17.530> deal<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.770> think<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.730> was<00:01:18.880> pretty<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.540> was

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
good deal I think it was pretty it was

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.750 
good deal I think it was pretty it was
in<00:01:19.810> about<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.200> hundred<00:01:20.350> dollars<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.070> came<00:01:21.610> with

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
in about a hundred dollars and came with

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.870 
in about a hundred dollars and came with
everything<00:01:22.150> I<00:01:22.360> took<00:01:23.350> this<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:24.310> cylinder<00:01:24.700> head

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
everything I took this the cylinder head

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.030 
everything I took this the cylinder head
it<00:01:25.090> wasn't<00:01:25.390> too<00:01:25.540> bad<00:01:25.750> actually<00:01:26.080> but<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.590> took<00:01:26.830> it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
it wasn't too bad actually but I took it

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.240 
it wasn't too bad actually but I took it
to<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.420> local<00:01:28.420> shop<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.050> they<00:01:29.260> actually<00:01:29.410> board

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
to a local shop and they actually board

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
it out honed it in you know for about a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.740 
it out honed it in you know for about a
hundred<00:01:33.280> bucks<00:01:33.610> actually<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.270> was<00:01:34.360> more<00:01:34.690> like

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
hundred bucks actually it was more like

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.380 
hundred bucks actually it was more like
eighty<00:01:35.170> dollars<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.670> they<00:01:36.790> did<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:36.970> really<00:01:37.240> good

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
eighty dollars so they did a really good

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.240 
eighty dollars so they did a really good
job<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.200> can<00:01:38.320> see<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.680> inside<00:01:38.980> of<00:01:39.010> the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
job and you can see the inside of the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.990 
job and you can see the inside of the
cylinder<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:40.830> looks<00:01:41.830> pretty<00:01:42.040> good<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:42.400> I'm

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
cylinder and looks pretty good so I'm

with the new piston so the bolts down

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.750 
with the new piston so the bolts down
here<00:02:16.060> there's<00:02:17.060> four<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.390> them<00:02:17.770> yet<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.920> pretty

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
here there's four of them yet the pretty

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.449 
here there's four of them yet the pretty
much<00:02:19.850> torque<00:02:20.120> them<00:02:20.240> down<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:21.590> 18

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
much torque them down to a it's 18

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.750 
much torque them down to a it's 18
pounds<00:02:23.090> per<00:02:23.320> foot<00:02:24.320> pounds<00:02:24.680> actually<00:02:25.160> it's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
pounds per foot pounds actually it's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.660 
pounds per foot pounds actually it's
this<00:02:25.940> four<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.360> them<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:27.520> sometimes<00:02:28.520> it's

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
this four of them and sometimes it's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.330 
this four of them and sometimes it's
hard<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.850> get<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> torque<00:02:29.330> wrench<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.720> there<00:02:29.930> so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
hard to get a torque wrench in there so

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.820 
hard to get a torque wrench in there so
sometimes<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.459> gotta<00:02:31.610> play<00:02:31.790> by<00:02:31.970> ear<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:32.450> now

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
sometimes you gotta play by ear but now

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.500 
sometimes you gotta play by ear but now
don't<00:02:33.830> over<00:02:34.160> over<00:02:34.910> tighten<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:38.150> here's<00:02:38.330> the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
don't over over tighten it so here's the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.990 
don't over over tighten it so here's the
piston<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.140> I'm<00:02:39.739> just<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.370> know<00:02:40.400> using<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
piston and I'm just you know using the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.030 
piston and I'm just you know using the
Kickstarter<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:42.410> see<00:02:42.590> it's<00:02:42.739> going

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
Kickstarter and you can see it's going

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.110 
Kickstarter and you can see it's going
up<00:02:43.160> now<00:02:43.580> down<00:02:43.910> easily<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.940> looks<00:02:46.940> like<00:02:47.030> a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
up now down easily and looks like a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.540 
up now down easily and looks like a
really<00:02:47.480> good<00:02:47.630> fit<00:02:47.870> as<00:02:47.989> well<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:49.250> know<00:02:49.370> of

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
really good fit as well so you know of

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.970 
really good fit as well so you know of
course<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.940> put<00:02:50.120> some<00:02:50.269> oil<00:02:50.690> both<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:51.860> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
course I put some oil both on the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.210 
course I put some oil both on the
cylinder<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.700> on<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.120> cylinder<00:02:53.420> wall<00:02:53.720> before

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
cylinder and on the cylinder wall before

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.060 
cylinder and on the cylinder wall before
installing<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:56.620> right<00:02:57.620> now<00:02:57.739> I'm<00:02:57.860> going<00:02:58.010> to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
installing it right now I'm going to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.870 
installing it right now I'm going to
install<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.180> head<00:03:00.110> gasket<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.880> normally

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
install the head gasket and normally

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.600 
install the head gasket and normally
there's<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.269> little<00:03:03.230> indicator<00:03:03.739> or<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.100> little

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
there's a little indicator or a little

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.310 
there's a little indicator or a little
stamping<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.810> know<00:03:05.900> right<00:03:06.080> on<00:03:06.110> this

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
stamping that you know right on this

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.470 
stamping that you know right on this
side<00:03:06.560> saying<00:03:06.920> up<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.670> that's<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.239> side<00:03:08.450> that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
side saying up and that's the side that

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.940 
side saying up and that's the side that
should<00:03:08.780> be<00:03:08.900> up<00:03:09.019> but<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.440> one<00:03:09.620> doesn't<00:03:09.799> have

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
should be up but this one doesn't have

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.880 
should be up but this one doesn't have
it<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.340> looked<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.850> manual<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
it so I looked in the manual and the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.190 
it so I looked in the manual and the
flat<00:03:13.340> part<00:03:13.670> should<00:03:13.910> be<00:03:13.940> facing<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.570> way<00:03:14.930> and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
flat part should be facing that way and

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.949 
flat part should be facing that way and
the<00:03:15.530> arrow<00:03:15.769> as<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.549> see<00:03:16.730> here<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.209> pointing

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
the arrow as you see here is pointing

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.020 
the arrow as you see here is pointing
forward<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:19.430> how<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.670> want<00:03:19.940> to

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
forward so that's how you want to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.670 
forward so that's how you want to
install<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.480> gasket<00:03:21.070> just<00:03:22.070> like<00:03:22.250> that

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
install the gasket just like that

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.110 
install the gasket just like that
just<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:25.200> now<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.950> know<00:03:27.120> installing

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
just like that now you know installing

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.199 
just like that now you know installing
the<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:29.049> head<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.560> then<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.940> torque<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.060> that

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
the the head and then the torque in that

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.100 
the the head and then the torque in that
down<00:03:31.420> as<00:03:31.659> well<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:33.450> here's<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.569> cylinder<00:03:34.959> with

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
down as well so here's a cylinder with

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.839 
down as well so here's a cylinder with
the<00:03:35.140> gasket<00:03:35.349> installed<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.129> here's<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.670> head

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
the gasket installed and here's the head

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.050 
the gasket installed and here's the head
so<00:03:37.599> I<00:03:37.629> cleaned<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:38.739> up<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.220> looked<00:03:39.459> pretty<00:03:39.760> good

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
so I cleaned it up it looked pretty good

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.580 
so I cleaned it up it looked pretty good
on<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.920> gonna<00:03:42.190> line<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.489> up<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.879> just

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
on and just gonna line it up and just

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:55.319 
on and just gonna line it up and just
install<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:44.829> top<00:03:52.739> that's<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.340> you'll

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
install it on top that's it and you'll

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.130 
install it on top that's it and you'll
see<00:03:55.629> there<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.319> one<00:03:56.590> two<00:03:56.650> three<00:03:56.829> four<00:03:57.160> five<00:03:57.640> six

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
see there is one two three four five six

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.680 
see there is one two three four five six
six<00:03:59.140> bolts<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.829> there<00:04:00.609> should<00:04:01.030> be<00:04:01.120> six<00:04:01.359> nuts

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
six bolts and there should be six nuts

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.960 
six bolts and there should be six nuts
and<00:04:01.989> six<00:04:02.410> washers<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.250> go<00:04:03.370> with<00:04:03.579> that<00:04:03.730> as<00:04:03.849> well

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
so you just work it down to 20 foot

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.270 
so you just work it down to 20 foot
pounds<00:04:08.940> alright<00:04:09.940> so<00:04:10.180> now<00:04:10.359> I've<00:04:10.750> installed<00:04:11.409> all

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
pounds alright so now I've installed all

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.059 
pounds alright so now I've installed all
the<00:04:12.340> bolts<00:04:13.120> with<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.079> washers<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.769> torque

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069

them<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.989> 20<00:04:17.320> foot<00:04:17.500> pounds<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.340> start<00:04:18.639> off

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
them to 20 foot pounds and you start off

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.670 
them to 20 foot pounds and you start off
you<00:04:18.970> know<00:04:19.090> criss-crossing<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.739> then

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
you know criss-crossing and then

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.150 
you know criss-crossing and then

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.029 
Yamaha gasket versus using the one that
came<00:04:36.910> with<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:37.900> kit<00:04:38.110> but<00:04:38.470> I<00:04:38.500> think<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:38.860> can

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
came with the kit but I think you can

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.620 
came with the kit but I think you can
use<00:04:39.220> either<00:04:39.400> one<00:04:39.639> of<00:04:39.669> them<00:04:39.880> but<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.240> went<00:04:40.539> ahead

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
use either one of them but I went ahead

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.730 
use either one of them but I went ahead
and<00:04:40.919> bought<00:04:41.919> a<00:04:41.979> Yamaha<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.690> goes<00:04:44.080> onto

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
and bought a Yamaha so that goes onto

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.450 
and bought a Yamaha so that goes onto
the<00:04:45.280> engine<00:04:45.430> side<00:04:46.020> this<00:04:47.020> goes<00:04:47.349> into<00:04:48.039> the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
the engine side this goes into the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.700 
the engine side this goes into the
engine<00:04:48.880> as<00:04:49.000> well<00:04:49.210> which<00:04:50.139> connects<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.680> that

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
engine as well which connects to that

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.110 
engine as well which connects to that
and<00:04:51.160> then<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:52.360> is<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.599> other<00:04:52.630> piece<00:04:53.080> and

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
and then this is the other piece and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.750 
and then this is the other piece and
which<00:04:55.120> connects<00:04:55.479> right<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.020> Reed<00:04:56.260> and

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
which connects right to the Reed and

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.310 
which connects right to the Reed and
this<00:04:57.760> there's<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.270> rubber<00:04:58.479> gasket<00:04:58.690> here<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.229> you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
this there's a rubber gasket here so you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.900 
this there's a rubber gasket here so you
don't<00:04:59.470> really<00:04:59.620> need<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.979> add<00:05:00.010> another<00:05:00.160> gasket

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
don't really need to add another gasket
