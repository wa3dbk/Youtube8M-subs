so<00:00:31.619> now<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.070> we've<00:00:32.340> understood<00:00:32.989> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
so now that we've understood the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.310 
so now that we've understood the
mechanics<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.800> shifting<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.280> little<00:00:35.430> better

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
mechanics of shifting a little better

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.100 
mechanics of shifting a little better
let's<00:00:37.370> look<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.579> specific<00:00:39.360> shifts<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.870> real

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
let's look at specific shifts and real

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.090 
let's look at specific shifts and real
pieces<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.879> use<00:00:42.149> these<00:00:42.780> areas<00:00:43.469> of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
pieces and how to use these areas of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920 
pieces and how to use these areas of
awareness<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.969> determine<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:45.809> of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
awareness to determine the kind of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.459 
awareness to determine the kind of
practice<00:00:46.469> needed<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.640> assure<00:00:47.789> success<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
practice needed to assure success in the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.069 
practice needed to assure success in the
shift

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
shift

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.209 
shift
so<00:00:52.079> let's<00:00:52.410> look<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:53.070> Monte's<00:00:53.699> chart<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
so let's look into Monte's chart as I

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.720 
so let's look into Monte's chart as I
have<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:57.090> from<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.010> a<00:01:01.730> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
have to go from this a to this a so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.990 
have to go from this a to this a so
let's<00:01:03.149> look<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.570> Monty's<00:01:04.019> chart<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
let's look at Monty's chart as I have to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.230 
let's look at Monty's chart as I have to
go<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.420> an<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.470> an<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:13.729> what<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
go from an a to an a what kind of a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.880 
go from an a to an a what kind of a
shift<00:01:15.479> did<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.080> do

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.170 

first<00:01:19.890> finger

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
to the third finger my finger pressure

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.910 
to the third finger my finger pressure
or<00:01:30.850> wheat<00:01:31.090> pattern<00:01:31.600> was<00:01:32.500> less<00:01:33.250> weight<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.750> more

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.830

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
or what about mass nays theis you know

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.040 
or what about mass nays theis you know
at<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.409> end<00:01:44.680> when<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.130> goes<00:01:45.430> from<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:46.060> to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
at the end when it goes from the a to

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.550 
at the end when it goes from the a to
the<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.310> similar<00:01:51.820> shift<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.350> shell

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
the a it's a similar shift it's a shell

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:12.240

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.100 
similar pattern to Monty's chart ass now
we've<00:02:12.580> talked<00:02:13.000> about<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.330> lot<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.810> different

when<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.510> totally<00:02:19.510> release<00:02:19.840> when<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:21.010> jump

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
when you totally release when you jump

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.240 
when you totally release when you jump
to<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.840> note<00:02:25.230> which<00:02:26.230> one<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:26.650> we<00:02:26.769> do<00:02:26.920> what

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
to the note which one can we do what

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.140 
to the note which one can we do what
about<00:02:27.340> Sebelius<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:30.070> know<00:02:30.190> from<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.700> B<00:02:30.940> flat

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
about Sebelius you know from the B flat

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:40.410 
about Sebelius you know from the B flat
to<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.750> B<00:02:32.079> flat<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:38.790> remember<00:02:39.790> having<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.180> big

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
to the B flat I remember having a big

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.140 
to the B flat I remember having a big
discussion<00:02:41.140> with<00:02:41.530> MS<00:02:41.920> delay<00:02:42.250> about<00:02:42.549> that<00:02:42.760> B

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
discussion with MS delay about that B

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.259 
discussion with MS delay about that B
flat<00:02:43.540> because<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.620> want<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.489> do<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:49.060> she

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
flat because I want it to do and she

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.970 
flat because I want it to do and she
said<00:02:49.299> Billy<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.870> can't<00:02:50.200> slide<00:02:50.530> into<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.980> if

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
said Billy you can't slide into it so if

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:06.180 
said Billy you can't slide into it so if
you're<00:02:54.250> gonna<00:02:54.519> jump<00:02:55.860> find<00:02:56.860> it<00:03:02.790> well<00:03:04.859> let's<00:03:05.859> see

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you're gonna jump find it well let's see

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.920 
you're gonna jump find it well let's see
what<00:03:06.459> could<00:03:06.640> we<00:03:06.790> do<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:09.070> can<00:03:09.310> use<00:03:09.600> way<00:03:10.600> your

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
what could we do you can use way your

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.250 
what could we do you can use way your
list<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.040> line<00:03:12.250> one<00:03:12.549> when<00:03:13.480> your<00:03:13.660> thumb

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
list is to the line one when your thumb

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.849 
list is to the line one when your thumb
is<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:15.190> neck<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.760> where<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:17.290> course<00:03:17.350> your
