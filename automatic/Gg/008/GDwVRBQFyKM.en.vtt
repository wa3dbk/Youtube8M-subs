Galaxy s4 two of the hottest smartphones
this<00:00:23.760> year<00:00:24.090> 2013<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.380> let's<00:00:25.529> see<00:00:25.619> how<00:00:25.710> they

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
this year 2013 so let's see how they

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.950 
this year 2013 so let's see how they
stack<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.580> you're<00:00:26.910> doing<00:00:27.090> some<00:00:27.330> intensive

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
stack up if you're doing some intensive

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
stack up if you're doing some intensive
gaming<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:29.130> how<00:00:29.220> fast<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:29.789> in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
gaming and just how fast they are in

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
gaming and just how fast they are in
general<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.199> let's<00:00:31.380> start<00:00:31.590> off<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.009> with

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
general so let's start off this one with

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.860 
general so let's start off this one with
a<00:00:32.219> good<00:00:32.399> old-fashioned<00:00:32.880> boot<00:00:33.120> test<00:00:33.420> starting

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
a good old-fashioned boot test starting

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
a good old-fashioned boot test starting
up<00:00:33.989> both<00:00:34.230> phones<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.340> same<00:00:35.370> time<00:00:36.210> you'll

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
up both phones at the same time you'll

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.780 
up both phones at the same time you'll
see<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> Apple<00:00:37.649> logo<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.040> first<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.550> pop

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
see that the Apple logo is first to pop

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
see that the Apple logo is first to pop
up<00:00:39.000> even<00:00:39.600> though<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.809> were<00:00:39.870> pressed<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
up even though they were pressed at the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.850 
up even though they were pressed at the
same<00:00:40.680> time<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.930> we'll<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:42.960> once<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.770> get

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
same time and we'll see once they get

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.729 
same time and we'll see once they get
past<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.309> first<00:00:44.610> intermission<00:00:45.149> screen<00:00:45.809> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
past the first intermission screen you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
past the first intermission screen you
get<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> o2<00:00:47.190> logo<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:47.910> that's<00:00:48.059> an<00:00:48.210> o2<00:00:48.629> branded

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
get the o2 logo as that's an o2 branded

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.560 
get the o2 logo as that's an o2 branded
thing<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> Samsung<00:00:50.399> logo<00:00:51.059> there

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
thing and then the Samsung logo there

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.869 
thing and then the Samsung logo there
the<00:00:52.260> iPhone<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.860> still<00:00:53.100> obviously<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the iPhone is still obviously on the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.479 
the iPhone is still obviously on the
Apple<00:00:54.329> logo<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> iPhone<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.219> done

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
Apple logo and then the iPhone is done

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.510 
Apple logo and then the iPhone is done
so<00:00:56.879> very<00:00:57.329> ever<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.530> slightly<00:00:58.859> quicker<00:00:59.280> than

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
so very ever so slightly quicker than

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.090 
so very ever so slightly quicker than
the<00:00:59.640> Samsung<00:00:59.910> Galaxy<00:01:00.210> s4<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:01.410> too<00:01:01.620> much<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the Samsung Galaxy s4 not too much in it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.260 
the Samsung Galaxy s4 not too much in it
but<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.579> definitely<00:01:02.670> worth<00:01:02.969> mentioning

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
but it's definitely worth mentioning

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.649 
but it's definitely worth mentioning
next<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.199> we're<00:01:04.290> gonna<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.799> Geekbench<00:01:05.339> 3

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
next up we're gonna do a Geekbench 3

through<00:01:21.990> until<00:01:22.409> both<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.650> these<00:01:22.890> devices<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
through until both of these devices I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.390 
through until both of these devices I
actually<00:01:23.759> finished<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.950> Geekbench<00:01:25.950> thing

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
actually finished the Geekbench thing

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.060 
actually finished the Geekbench thing
the<00:01:27.240> iPhone<00:01:27.570> 5s<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.380> quicker<00:01:28.710> quite

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the iPhone 5s was actually quicker quite

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.640 
the iPhone 5s was actually quicker quite
a<00:01:29.100> lot<00:01:29.340> quicker<00:01:29.579> almost<00:01:30.119> half<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:31.049> tight<00:01:31.380> half

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
a lot quicker almost half as tight half

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.609 
a lot quicker almost half as tight half
as<00:01:31.770> much<00:01:31.920> time<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.970> far<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.659> s4<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
as much time as the far as the s4 to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
as much time as the far as the s4 to
complete<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
complete it but as you can see the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.149 
complete it but as you can see the
iPhone<00:01:37.350> 5s<00:01:37.799> scores<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.400> whopping<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:39.950> 2557

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
iPhone 5s scores of whopping of 2557

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.770 
iPhone 5s scores of whopping of 2557
with<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.850> Samsung<00:01:42.540> Galaxy<00:01:42.659> s4<00:01:43.140> coming<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.860> at

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
with the Samsung Galaxy s4 coming in at

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
with the Samsung Galaxy s4 coming in at
1841<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.530> quite<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> substantial<00:01:46.979> difference

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
1841 so quite a substantial difference

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.120 
1841 so quite a substantial difference
however<00:01:48.210> both<00:01:48.540> scores<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.229> extremely<00:01:49.920> high

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
however both scores are extremely high

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.370 
however both scores are extremely high
and<00:01:50.820> they're<00:01:50.970> both<00:01:51.060> very<00:01:51.420> very<00:01:51.659> quick<00:01:52.020> phones

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and they're both very very quick phones

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.190 
and they're both very very quick phones
even<00:01:52.649> from<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> benchmarking<00:01:53.399> perspective

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
even from a benchmarking perspective

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.330 
even from a benchmarking perspective
okay<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.259> now<00:01:55.470> let's<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> good

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
okay so now let's get on to the good

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.630 
okay so now let's get on to the good

stuff
this<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.149> Riptide<00:01:57.780> gp2<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.430> quite

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
this is Riptide gp2 it's a quite

running<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> pretty<00:02:08.610> crazy

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
running it it's a pretty crazy

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.690 
running it it's a pretty crazy
experience<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:10.979> honest<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.250> both<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.580> these

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
experience to be honest on both of these

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.800 
experience to be honest on both of these
phones<00:02:12.090> they're<00:02:12.750> both<00:02:12.930> very<00:02:13.230> quick

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
phones they're both very quick

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.500

and<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:15.010> process<00:02:15.430> inside<00:02:15.849> them<00:02:16.150> even<00:02:16.420> though

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and the process inside them even though

32-bit experience so even on that 5s you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.710

with it no problem with that being said
the<00:02:33.819> iPhone<00:02:33.940> 5s<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.720> clearly<00:02:35.080> an<00:02:35.260> ultimate

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
the iPhone 5s is clearly an ultimate

the iPhone 5s is clearly an ultimate
powerhouse<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:37.330> benchmarks<00:02:37.989> higher<00:02:38.200> than

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
powerhouse it benchmarks higher than

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
almost any phone this year so it'll be

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.630 
almost any phone this year so it'll be
very<00:02:40.989> very<00:02:41.319> interesting<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.040> see<00:02:42.220> what<00:02:42.250> will

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
very very interesting to see what will

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.699 
very very interesting to see what will
happen<00:02:42.670> once<00:02:43.150> 64-bit<00:02:43.959> applications<00:02:44.560> are

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
happen once 64-bit applications are

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.460 
happen once 64-bit applications are
actually<00:02:45.180> programmed<00:02:46.180> for<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:46.810> processor

obviously the amount of RAM in the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.360 
obviously the amount of RAM in the
iPhone<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:50.140> doesn't<00:02:50.440> really<00:02:50.830> do<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.340> justice

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
iPhone it doesn't really do it justice

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.880 
iPhone it doesn't really do it justice
because<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> four<00:02:52.600> gigabyte<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.290> RAM<00:02:53.530> would<00:02:53.799> be

because a four gigabyte of RAM would be

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.880 
because a four gigabyte of RAM would be
ideal<00:02:54.250> for<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.549> 64-bit<00:02:55.269> architecture<00:02:56.019> but<00:02:56.530> even

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
ideal for a 64-bit architecture but even

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.350 
ideal for a 64-bit architecture but even
just<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.190> gaming<00:02:57.580> experience<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.120> couldn't

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
just this gaming experience you couldn't

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.059 
just this gaming experience you couldn't
tell<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.569> there's<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.989> lot<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.260> power<00:02:59.620> going

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
tell that there's a lot of power going

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.150 
tell that there's a lot of power going
into<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:02.140> only<00:03:02.349> kind<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.680> scratching

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
into it and it's only kind of scratching

the surface an intensive game like this

the surface an intensive game like this
the<00:03:05.410> 3d<00:03:05.709> rendering<00:03:05.799> looks<00:03:06.220> great<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:06.910> both

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
the 3d rendering looks great on both

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.570 
the 3d rendering looks great on both
displays<00:03:07.989> actually<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.190> gaming<00:03:09.489> is<00:03:09.519> a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
displays actually and gaming is a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.670 
displays actually and gaming is a
pleasure<00:03:09.819> on<00:03:10.090> both<00:03:10.299> platforms<00:03:10.630> there<00:03:11.470> we<00:03:11.560> have

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
pleasure on both platforms there we have

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.900 
pleasure on both platforms there we have
it<00:03:11.769> guys<00:03:11.799> I<00:03:12.040> thought<00:03:12.220> I'd<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.489> bring<00:03:12.730> you

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
it guys I thought I'd just bring you

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.870 
it guys I thought I'd just bring you
this<00:03:13.090> relatively<00:03:13.569> short<00:03:14.580> comparison<00:03:15.580> video

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
this relatively short comparison video

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.849 
this relatively short comparison video
between<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.510> two<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:17.260> be<00:03:17.319> honest<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.590> get<00:03:17.739> to

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
between the two to be honest you get to

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.160 
between the two to be honest you get to
this<00:03:17.980> level<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.549> it<00:03:19.299> starts<00:03:19.720> becoming<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
this level and it starts becoming a

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.610 
this level and it starts becoming a
little<00:03:20.290> bit<00:03:20.730> insignificant<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.940> comparisons

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
little bit insignificant the comparisons

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.750 
little bit insignificant the comparisons
comparing<00:03:23.620> things<00:03:23.769> like<00:03:24.010> gaming<00:03:24.280> speed

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
comparing things like gaming speed

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.220 
comparing things like gaming speed
however<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.150> thought<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:25.570> would<00:03:25.750> bring<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:25.959> it

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
however I thought I would bring you it

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.840 
however I thought I would bring you it
due<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.100> fact<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.489> an<00:03:27.549> interesting

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
due to the fact that it's an interesting

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.809 
due to the fact that it's an interesting
topic<00:03:28.329> especially<00:03:29.230> as<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.590> iPhone<00:03:29.890> 5s<00:03:30.340> has<00:03:30.790> a

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
topic especially as the iPhone 5s has a

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.699 
topic especially as the iPhone 5s has a
processor<00:03:31.329> that's<00:03:31.540> now<00:03:31.690> based<00:03:31.959> on<00:03:32.109> 64-bit

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
processor that's now based on 64-bit

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.650 
processor that's now based on 64-bit
architecture<00:03:33.579> personally<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.209> have<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:34.480> say

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
architecture personally I have to say

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.300 
architecture personally I have to say
without<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.989> doubt<00:03:35.170> I'm<00:03:35.620> gonna<00:03:35.829> go<00:03:36.010> with<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
without a doubt I'm gonna go with the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.900 
without a doubt I'm gonna go with the
iPhone<00:03:36.730> 5s<00:03:37.239> out<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.810> my<00:03:38.049> pick<00:03:38.440> for<00:03:38.920> these<00:03:39.609> two

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
iPhone 5s out of my pick for these two

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.729 
iPhone 5s out of my pick for these two
phones<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.690> build<00:03:40.930> quality<00:03:41.140> which<00:03:41.620> I

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
phones the build quality which I

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:42.930 
phones the build quality which I
actually<00:03:41.829> covered<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.400> video<00:03:42.639> yesterday

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
actually covered it in a video yesterday

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.490
