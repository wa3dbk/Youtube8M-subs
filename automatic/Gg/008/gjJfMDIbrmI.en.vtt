punch<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.550> kick<00:00:41.610> knocked<00:00:42.600> him<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> they

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
punch or kick knocked him out and they

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.110 
punch or kick knocked him out and they
said<00:00:43.649> treasure<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.370> made<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> mistake

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
said treasure but they made the mistake

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.690 
said treasure but they made the mistake
of<00:00:45.149> leaving<00:00:45.570> him<00:00:45.960> behind<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.550> going

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
of leaving him behind and that's going

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
of leaving him behind and that's going
to<00:00:47.760> cost<00:00:48.000> him<00:00:48.149> greatly<00:00:48.450> along<00:00:48.930> when<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> could

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
to cost him greatly along when I could

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.189 
to cost him greatly along when I could
see<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.010> he<00:00:50.160> knows<00:00:50.399> too<00:00:50.730> much<00:00:50.760> about

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
see it because he knows too much about

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.889 
see it because he knows too much about
Poseidon<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.440> Shira<00:00:52.770> Hoshi<00:00:52.980> um<00:00:53.969> yeah<00:00:54.629> that

Poseidon and Shira Hoshi um yeah that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.389 
Poseidon and Shira Hoshi um yeah that
was<00:00:55.199> definitely<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.680> big<00:00:55.829> mistake<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.309> their

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
was definitely a big mistake on their

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.069 
was definitely a big mistake on their
part<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:56.850> don't<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.510> he<00:00:57.719> knows

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
