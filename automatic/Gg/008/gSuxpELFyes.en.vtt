00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.759
 how does a new engine come about ? 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:13.769
 this time it's about the well triax yes and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.109
 the high tracks are about that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.990
 He always said it like a room with 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.539
 gets tied to your ax and that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.539
 is there a special ax if you like it 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.949
 Now this tree is coming off over here 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.560
 the whole wood down as you can see 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.590
 and whimsical these trees are from the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.000
 malls in tucson I already 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.100
 have presented with captain price and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 forgot to introduce co2 for that reason 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 I still give you my fashion play if you like 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.760
 I take advantage of this acceptance and that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 function again theme what that is 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.120
 a little different one very often to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.770
 example and not around the zoo 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.989
 means yes I am now full of the kita me 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.520
 I prefer to do with subject matter then do it 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.899
 you have such an ax because they are already one 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.120
 a bit of resources consuming again 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 that's more elaborate ten times ax 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 For that you have to have a look 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.289
 you need these two for that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.219
 Sticks and you need five diamonds around 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.769
 to get such a 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.619
 which says you can use over 50 times 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.049
 then of course it is broken and it is 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.729
 unfortunately a bit of a shame because on it but 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.740
 That's why their resources are expensive 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.360
 and really meant for survival because 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.509
 with a room you could just do everything 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.490
 tick it off and it would be gone and the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.960
 wear off little but you have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.130
 Of course it is a small disadvantage 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 not like in the room if you what 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.220
 then place and then turn 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 Again , it just could be gone 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.810
 For example, do not press shift 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.950
 For example , no ship can print 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 as soon as you press here it is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.170
 simply away is even more disadvantage 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.030
 if you have the ezb so esther the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 are mostly stuck up there bit 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.540
 we have to catch up but unfortunately 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
 if you are so blast otherwise now 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.799
 take care a bit with her 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.060
 Definitely a house 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.439
 Take care so that you me 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.299
 that's a bit of a drain 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.590
 take care that your house is not 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.030
 falls off if you say so for example yes 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.969
 I have built a beautiful house entirely 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.149
 Great here, the house is cool and then 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.469
 all of a sudden the ax is here then 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.250
 the whole house away and that would be 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.270
 Of course not what you are 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.069
 I think imagine 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.899
 So what you say these words I hope 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.660
 I like it, give it to me 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.710
 again between poppig the motto it 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.210
 I would say market 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.950
 meanwhile points because I'm a bit 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.020
 stupid find that the things with it 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.010
 you do not want to break down but until 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.010
 to the next motto bye
