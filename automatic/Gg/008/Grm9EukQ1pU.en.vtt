00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
be 24 or 32 64 I don't think any of us

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510 
be 24 or 32 64 I don't think any of us
really<00:00:45.000> expected<00:00:45.480> 64<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.160> has<00:00:47.340> been

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
really expected 64 but it has been

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
really expected 64 but it has been
confirmed<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:48.120> 16<00:00:48.480> players<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
confirmed as 16 players so that's a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.139 
confirmed as 16 players so that's a
little<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:50.039> disappointing<00:00:50.309> considering<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
little bit disappointing considering the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.910 
little bit disappointing considering the
size<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> map<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.020> mean<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.500> way<00:00:52.739> way

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
size of the map I mean this is way way

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.729 
size of the map I mean this is way way
way<00:00:53.129> way<00:00:53.160> bigger<00:00:53.699> than<00:00:53.940> GTA<00:00:54.329> 4<00:00:54.690> yet<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
way way bigger than GTA 4 yet it's the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.310 
way way bigger than GTA 4 yet it's the
same<00:00:55.949> number<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> players<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:58.230> know

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
same number of players so I don't know

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.540 
same number of players so I don't know
that's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.649> bit<00:00:58.859> disappointing<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.489> at

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
that's a little bit disappointing but at

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.830 
that's a little bit disappointing but at
the<00:00:59.699> same<00:00:59.850> time<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> can't<00:01:00.390> complain<00:01:00.690> because

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the same time I can't complain because

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
the same time I can't complain because
