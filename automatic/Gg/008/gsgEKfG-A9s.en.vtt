00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.150 
I've heated a heavy bottomed wok on a
very<00:00:18.029> high<00:00:18.330> flame<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> then<00:00:19.680> I've<00:00:19.920> added

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
very high flame and then I've added

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.420 
very high flame and then I've added
about<00:00:20.699> 750<00:00:21.480> grams<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.050> shelled<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.890> deviant

about 750 grams of shelled and deviant
prawns<00:00:23.699> which<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.090> earlier<00:00:24.449> washed<00:00:24.750> with<00:00:24.990> some

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
prawns which I earlier washed with some

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.710

light yellow in color but that's not an

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
am just going to mix all of this and the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.810 
am just going to mix all of this and the
prawns<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.440> make<00:02:24.620> sure<00:02:24.950> everything<00:02:25.670> has

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
prawns and make sure everything has

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.670 
prawns and make sure everything has
distributed<00:02:26.420> completely<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.320> prawns

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
distributed completely in the prawns

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.980 
distributed completely in the prawns
the<00:02:28.070> reason<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.430> added<00:02:28.730> extra<00:02:28.910> salt<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.660> because

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the reason I added extra salt is because

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.520 
the reason I added extra salt is because
I<00:02:30.170> have<00:02:30.320> added<00:02:31.480> cornstarch<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.260> chili

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
I have added cornstarch and the chili

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
I have added cornstarch and the chili
powder<00:02:33.770> or<00:02:34.130> extra<00:02:34.820> chili<00:02:35.060> powder<00:02:35.270> is<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
powder or extra chili powder is for a

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.890 
powder or extra chili powder is for a
little<00:02:37.550> bit<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.850> taste<00:02:38.360> because<00:02:38.750> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
little bit of taste because the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.750 
little bit of taste because the
cornstarch<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.530> definitely<00:02:40.130> going<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.400> reduce

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
cornstarch is definitely going to reduce

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.020 
cornstarch is definitely going to reduce
the<00:02:41.030> chili<00:02:41.750> taste<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:43.160> we<00:02:43.550> need<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> little<00:02:43.940> bit

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
the chili taste so we need a little bit

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.210 
the chili taste so we need a little bit
of<00:02:44.090> heat<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.020> I've<00:02:45.140> added<00:02:45.320> extra<00:02:45.770> chili<00:02:45.950> powder

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220
