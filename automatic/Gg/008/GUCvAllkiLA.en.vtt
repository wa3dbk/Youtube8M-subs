 recently I did not receive the parcel site March 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.890
 this is a site like the shadow did 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.070
 only there is more choice and you can say 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 of course there are very high quality goods 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.269
 not so much so that bad goods 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.080

 Of course, delivery to Ukraine is free 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 what I ordered was tweezers 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.190

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.120
 Picture I thought that the tweezers will 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.200
 can say different forms and under different 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.150
 slope in fact actually this 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 not so all these tweezers and the same and 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:19.009
 they go like this 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.009
 brush that comb your brow 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.009

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.350
 so here it is removed nothing there 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 There is no complicated and the same thing 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.220

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.920

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:35.430
 a penny but I still would like to 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:39.510
 This product was helpful next 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.370

 using them you can make different patterns 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.970
 on dots you need to do different dots 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.180

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.120
 tree and after unusual 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.239
 package I found another set 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.320

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.739

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:37.049

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:47.100
 smaller, too, all the same handle these 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.359
 plastic boards and different colors 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.290
 are present 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:55.859
 very nice of course I have these 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.239
 more like than this one I already 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:03.780
 I had time to try it so we just 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.389
 I have seen such a few where were 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.989
 practically only in one place I saw 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.180
 and they were so revered 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.269
 dose as if all are inexpensive ssylochki 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.500
 i will leave in infobox you can 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.870
 look and the last thing that I 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.350
 has come 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.860
 March 6th is one thing but I forgot to you 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.980
 tell me that the parcel was going 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:35.940
 somewhere 20 days Ukraine I think that this 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:40.080
 not long because solid brass me 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.290
 There are such links that are more well and in 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.340
 This is the essence and I came here is such a 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:51.630
 tripod can say so here it is 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:57.590
 Looks like came only the sachets format and 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.590
 but it was also here is such a black pouch 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.020
 tripod name so I'll show you now 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:13.590
 this tripod weighs basically 400 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:16.780
 I think I will say 420 grams 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.370
 Of course, every shy came clearly but 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.930
 the main thing is that the product has come a whole 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.060
 briefly tell you what's here 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.560
 there is such here 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.900
 rubber lining here so here it is 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:38.680
 It looks really so small that there 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.960
 present there is such here 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.740
 pen if you see it appeals 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:50.040
 left and right of here you can put 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:54.820
 like the camera still webcams 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:57.040
 here also the name he wrote this 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.740
 You can search for a compact but in reality 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.200
 It's big I would like to show you 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.200
 how do i lay it out 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:59.670
 and here these rivets are made of 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:04.000
 plastic 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:07.180
 I may say so myself in this material 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.700
 tripod I liked and wants space but 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.220
 very high quality plastics 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.580
 and already tried putting my camera here 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.680
 holding on very well with this one 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.220
 here 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:24.850
 rubberized gasket very well 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:28.270
 you can fix the camera itself and 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.700
 so I stand very pleased with it 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.580
 It became of course inexpensive, too, I can credit 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:36.240
 snowskute leave you downstairs and you can 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.160
 watch this tripod 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.160
 Well, probably this is all this 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.650
 Here was a small order site Timati 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.090
