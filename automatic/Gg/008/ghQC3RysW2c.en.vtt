it's<00:00:30.380> pretty<00:00:30.800> much<00:00:30.980> true<00:00:31.430> halo<00:00:31.820> 5<00:00:32.180> plays<00:00:32.660> a<00:00:32.870> lot

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
differently than any halo game before it

differently than any halo game before it
halo<00:00:37.010> 4<00:00:37.040> was<00:00:37.520> slowly<00:00:37.880> transitioning<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.809> that

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
cod atmosphere and it's pretty clear

lay<00:00:46.820> out<00:00:46.850> some<00:00:47.120> pros<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.660> cons<00:00:47.870> of<00:00:48.079> things<00:00:48.410> I

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
lay out some pros and cons of things I

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.889 
lay out some pros and cons of things I
noticed<00:00:48.890> well<00:00:49.040> planed<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.180> first<00:00:50.600> of<00:00:50.690> all<00:00:50.750> the

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
noticed well planed so first of all the

noticed well planed so first of all the
things<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.260> liked<00:00:51.559> it<00:00:51.890> felt<00:00:52.370> balance<00:00:52.820> the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
things that I liked it felt balance the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.030 
things that I liked it felt balance the
health<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:53.450> shield<00:00:53.629> only<00:00:53.870> recharge<00:00:54.469> when

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
health and shield only recharge when

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.979 
health and shield only recharge when
you're<00:00:55.219> walking<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:56.450> don't<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.690> people

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
you're walking so you don't have people

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.450 
you're walking so you don't have people
running<00:00:57.020> around<00:00:57.320> sprinting<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.070> shotgunning

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
running around sprinting and shotgunning

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.340 
running around sprinting and shotgunning
each<00:00:58.640> other<00:00:58.789> in<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:58.969> face<00:00:59.149> similar<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.960> other

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
each other in the face similar to other

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.619 
each other in the face similar to other
FPS<00:01:00.620> games<00:01:01.160> here<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:01.700> felt<00:01:01.910> more<00:01:02.059> balanced<00:01:02.510> you

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
FPS games here it felt more balanced you

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.270 
FPS games here it felt more balanced you
got<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.840> kind<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.020> think<00:01:03.260> ahead<00:01:03.410> before<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:04.129> do

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
got to kind of think ahead before you do

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.969 
got to kind of think ahead before you do
it<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:05.780> really<00:01:05.960> puts<00:01:06.260> an<00:01:06.350> emphasis<00:01:06.770> on

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
it and it really puts an emphasis on

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.280 
it and it really puts an emphasis on
strategy<00:01:07.640> which<00:01:07.820> I<00:01:07.970> like<00:01:08.210> another<00:01:09.020> thing<00:01:09.260> is

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
strategy which I like another thing is

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.130 
strategy which I like another thing is
also<00:01:09.619> that<00:01:10.070> felt<00:01:10.310> balance<00:01:10.700> was<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:10.970> 80s<00:01:11.210> when

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
also that felt balance was the 80s when

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.050 
also that felt balance was the 80s when
getting<00:01:12.440> shot<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:12.979> zooms<00:01:13.280> out<00:01:13.430> completely<00:01:13.909> so

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
getting shot it zooms out completely so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.120 
getting shot it zooms out completely so
you<00:01:14.330> don't<00:01:14.510> have<00:01:14.570> campers<00:01:15.409> or<00:01:15.680> people<00:01:16.040> who<00:01:16.070> are

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
you don't have campers or people who are

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.280 
you don't have campers or people who are
abusing<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.729> sniping<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:17.810> kind<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.049> feels

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
abusing the sniping it kind of feels

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.340 
abusing the sniping it kind of feels
again<00:01:19.100> balanced<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:19.939> it<00:01:20.659> sort<00:01:21.049> of<00:01:21.110> adds

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
again balanced and it sort of adds

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.289 
again balanced and it sort of adds
another<00:01:21.890> layer<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.220> strategy<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:23.060> really

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
another layer of strategy so you really

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.700 
another layer of strategy so you really
got<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.510> think<00:01:23.689> ahead<00:01:23.750> if<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:24.290> spotted

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
got to think ahead if you get spotted

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.679 
got to think ahead if you get spotted
you<00:01:24.799> got<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.010> move<00:01:25.100> around<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.670> again<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.510> puts

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
you got to move around and again it puts

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.260 
you got to move around and again it puts
more<00:01:26.869> emphasis<00:01:27.380> on<00:01:27.549> thinking<00:01:28.549> quickly<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.240> you

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
more emphasis on thinking quickly so you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.510 
more emphasis on thinking quickly so you
got<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.689> be<00:01:29.869> ready<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.650> shoot<00:01:31.040> from<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.310> hip

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
got to be ready to shoot from the hip

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.039 
got to be ready to shoot from the hip
and<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:32.090> you're<00:01:32.240> not<00:01:32.360> really<00:01:32.630> good<00:01:32.750> at<00:01:32.840> that

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
and if you're not really good at that

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.420 
and if you're not really good at that
then<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.500> gotta<00:01:33.710> really<00:01:33.979> brush<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:34.400> your

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
then you gotta really brush up your

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.060 
then you gotta really brush up your
skills<00:01:34.880> other<00:01:35.689> small<00:01:36.080> touches<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:36.560> liked<00:01:36.799> where

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
skills other small touches I liked where

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.649 
skills other small touches I liked where
things<00:01:37.520> are<00:01:37.700> just<00:01:37.729> grabbing<00:01:38.030> ledges<00:01:38.509> I'm

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
things are just grabbing ledges I'm

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.690 
things are just grabbing ledges I'm
actually<00:01:38.869> surprised<00:01:39.409> FPS<00:01:40.040> games<00:01:40.310> don't<00:01:40.520> do

because you can't jump high enough he
ends<00:01:46.130> up<00:01:46.189> grabbing<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.610> with<00:01:46.640> his<00:01:46.820> hand<00:01:46.850> and

ends up grabbing it with his hand and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.749 
ends up grabbing it with his hand and
it's<00:01:47.299> pretty<00:01:47.479> cool<00:01:47.979> another<00:01:48.979> nice<00:01:49.340> thing<00:01:49.369> is

you gotta study the map you got to know
it<00:02:20.400> inside<00:02:20.580> out<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.690> not<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.110> about

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
it inside out and it's not just about

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.260 
it inside out and it's not just about
having<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.130> best<00:02:23.370> weapon<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:23.880> having<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
your environment and that is the basis

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.400 
your environment and that is the basis
of<00:02:29.400> pretty<00:02:29.880> much<00:02:29.940> any<00:02:30.300> FPS<00:02:30.510> multiplayer<00:02:30.870> game

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
of pretty much any FPS multiplayer game

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.870 
of pretty much any FPS multiplayer game
and<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.650> love<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.370> I'm<00:02:32.430> glad<00:02:32.640> they

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
and I love that and I'm glad they

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.370 
and I love that and I'm glad they
actually<00:02:33.240> really<00:02:33.450> put<00:02:33.600> an<00:02:33.690> emphasis<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
actually really put an emphasis on that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.470 
actually really put an emphasis on that
and<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.890> hope<00:02:35.100> they<00:02:35.250> expand<00:02:35.610> upon<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
and I hope they expand upon it in the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.120 
and I hope they expand upon it in the
future<00:02:36.720> now<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.960> things<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.560> really<00:02:37.590> didn't

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
future now the things I really didn't

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.210 
future now the things I really didn't
like<00:02:38.630> because<00:02:39.630> it's<00:02:39.840> an<00:02:39.960> arena<00:02:40.410> based<00:02:40.620> game<00:02:40.950> I

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
like because it's an arena based game I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.520 
like because it's an arena based game I
don't<00:02:42.150> believe<00:02:42.270> will<00:02:42.660> be<00:02:42.780> getting<00:02:43.050> huge<00:02:43.290> maps

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
don't believe will be getting huge maps

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.950 
don't believe will be getting huge maps
now<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:43.950> has<00:02:44.100> not<00:02:44.250> been<00:02:44.310> confirmed<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.900> I

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
now this has not been confirmed but I

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.630 
now this has not been confirmed but I
don't<00:02:46.440> think<00:02:46.650> we'll<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:46.890> getting<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.340> level

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
don't think we'll be getting the level

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.410 
don't think we'll be getting the level
of<00:02:47.850> scale<00:02:48.420> maps<00:02:48.930> such<00:02:49.140> as<00:02:49.320> blood<00:02:49.590> gulch<00:02:49.890> or

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
of scale maps such as blood gulch or

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.400 
of scale maps such as blood gulch or
Sidewinder<00:02:51.420> or<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.840> know<00:02:51.990> one<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.230> those

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
Sidewinder or you know one of those

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.940 
Sidewinder or you know one of those
classic<00:02:52.650> maps<00:02:53.130> were<00:02:53.370> used<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.760> Valhalla<00:02:54.950> which

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
classic maps were used to Valhalla which

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.740 
classic maps were used to Valhalla which
is<00:02:56.130> kind<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.430> disappointing<00:02:56.550> because<00:02:57.240> those

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
is kind of disappointing because those

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.750 
is kind of disappointing because those
that's<00:02:58.410> kind<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.830> what<00:02:59.040> made<00:02:59.220> halo-halo<00:02:59.580> which

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
that's kind of what made halo-halo which

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.200 
that's kind of what made halo-halo which
is<00:03:00.330> going<00:03:00.830> indoors<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.190> then<00:03:02.280> outdoors<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
is going indoors and then outdoors and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.540 
is going indoors and then outdoors and
that<00:03:03.840> kind<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.110> transition<00:03:04.680> was<00:03:04.830> great<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.370> I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
that kind of transition was great and I

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.030 
that kind of transition was great and I
hope<00:03:05.850> they<00:03:06.300> bring<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.750> back<00:03:06.930> though<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.500> get<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
hope they bring it back though I get the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.710 
hope they bring it back though I get the
impression<00:03:08.190> based<00:03:08.910> from<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.360> played<00:03:09.690> that

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
impression based from what I played that

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.480 
impression based from what I played that
they<00:03:10.170> will<00:03:10.320> kind<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.650> tone<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.010> down<00:03:11.040> and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
they will kind of tone it down and

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.400 
they will kind of tone it down and
they'll<00:03:11.670> focus<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.450> small<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:13.290> know

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
for war to kill and here they are

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.130 
for war to kill and here they are
hanging<00:03:51.060> out<00:03:51.180> as<00:03:51.480> if<00:03:51.630> they're<00:03:51.810> just<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:52.080> to

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
hanging out as if they're just going to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.900 
hanging out as if they're just going to
go<00:03:52.320> on<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> road<00:03:52.740> trip<00:03:52.770> right<00:03:53.250> after<00:03:53.520> this<00:03:53.670> match

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
go on a road trip right after this match

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.380 
go on a road trip right after this match
it<00:03:54.390> felt<00:03:54.750> really<00:03:55.080> weird<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.460> just<00:03:56.670> didn't

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
it felt really weird and it just didn't

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.960 
it felt really weird and it just didn't
kind<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.660> fit<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.140> hole<00:03:58.290> halo<00:03:58.590> universe

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
kind of fit in the hole halo universe

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.250 
kind of fit in the hole halo universe
another<00:03:59.970> thing<00:04:00.210> I<00:04:00.330> really<00:04:00.660> liked<00:04:00.960> was<00:04:00.990> that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
another thing I really liked was that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.160 
another thing I really liked was that
there<00:04:01.680> were<00:04:01.800> no<00:04:02.180> emphasis<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.390> alien<00:04:03.780> weapons

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
there were no emphasis on alien weapons

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.140 
there were no emphasis on alien weapons
I<00:04:04.380> mean<00:04:04.560> again<00:04:04.830> this<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.160> all<00:04:05.370> based<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
I mean again this is all based on the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.960 
I mean again this is all based on the
beta<00:04:06.330> but<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.170> mean<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.680> idea<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.310> halo<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.790> that

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
beta but I mean the idea of halo is that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.850 
beta but I mean the idea of halo is that
you're<00:04:09.120> meant<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.570> be<00:04:09.600> playing<00:04:10.080> both<00:04:10.560> sides

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
you're meant to be playing both sides

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.650 
you're meant to be playing both sides
you're<00:04:11.160> meant<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.400> have<00:04:11.550> humans<00:04:11.970> weapons

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
you're meant to have humans weapons

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.480 
you're meant to have humans weapons
which<00:04:12.990> are<00:04:13.140> sort<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.410> military<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:14.130> then

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
which are sort of military and then

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
which are sort of military and then
you're<00:04:14.610> supposed<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.940> have<00:04:15.060> these<00:04:15.210> weird

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
you're supposed to have these weird

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.630 
you're supposed to have these weird
obscure<00:04:16.109> alien<00:04:16.560> weapons<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.130> do<00:04:17.340> weird

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
obscure alien weapons that do weird

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.370 
obscure alien weapons that do weird
things<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.390> they're<00:04:18.540> kind<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.840> fun<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.080> play

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
things but they're kind of fun to play

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.770 
things but they're kind of fun to play
with<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.830> didn't<00:04:20.520> get<00:04:20.580> any<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.030> also

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
with I didn't get any of that also

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.290 
with I didn't get any of that also
speaking<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.350> weapons<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.040> 80s<00:04:23.550> does<00:04:24.030> make<00:04:24.270> a

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
speaking of weapons the 80s does make a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.800 
speaking of weapons the 80s does make a
difference<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:25.020> mean<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.580> 343<00:04:26.580> stated

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
difference I mean I 343 stated

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.930 
difference I mean I 343 stated
their<00:04:27.990> video<00:04:28.260> saying<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:29.040> there<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.730> no

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
their video saying that there is no

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.940 
their video saying that there is no
penalty<00:04:30.180> for<00:04:30.480> shooting<00:04:31.110> from<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.320> hip<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.770> mean

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
penalty for shooting from the hip I mean

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.470 
penalty for shooting from the hip I mean
it's<00:04:32.100> they<00:04:32.520> said<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.030> it's<00:04:33.180> going<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.389> be

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
it's they said that it's going to be

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.870 
it's they said that it's going to be
practically<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.139> same<00:04:34.290> thing<00:04:34.350> but<00:04:35.280> clearly

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
practically the same thing but clearly

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.060 
practically the same thing but clearly
when<00:04:36.360> I'm<00:04:36.450> using<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.020> weapon<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.500> felt<00:04:37.860> there

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
when I'm using the weapon I felt there

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.240 
when I'm using the weapon I felt there
was<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.250> huge<00:04:38.700> advantage<00:04:39.290> when<00:04:40.290> using<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.830> 80s

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
was a huge advantage when using the 80s

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.300 
was a huge advantage when using the 80s
it<00:04:41.520> was<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:43.230> was<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.410> big<00:04:43.650> deal<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:44.190> was

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
it was so it was a big deal and I was

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.129 
it was so it was a big deal and I was
just<00:04:44.340> kind<00:04:44.639> of<00:04:44.669> confused<00:04:44.850> because<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.690> thought

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
just kind of confused because I thought

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.990 
just kind of confused because I thought
that<00:04:46.380> we're<00:04:46.620> going<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.950> go<00:04:47.400> ahead<00:04:47.430> with<00:04:47.820> this

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
that we're going to go ahead with this

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.530 
that we're going to go ahead with this
but<00:04:48.360> here<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:48.900> am<00:04:49.020> using<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.860> 80s<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:51.300> prove

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
but here I am using the 80s and to prove

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.420 
but here I am using the 80s and to prove
my<00:04:51.780> point<00:04:52.020> they<00:04:52.260> map<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.710> left<00:04:52.919> trigger<00:04:53.070> for

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
my point they map the left trigger for

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.490 
my point they map the left trigger for
80s<00:04:53.910> just<00:04:54.300> like<00:04:54.480> Call<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.750> Duty<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:55.350> like

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
80s just like Call of Duty just like

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.070 
80s just like Call of Duty just like

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080

trigger any halo fan would know that the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.480 
trigger any halo fan would know that the
left<00:05:00.780> trigger<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.290> primarily<00:05:01.979> used<00:05:02.070> for

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
left trigger is primarily used for

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.440 
left trigger is primarily used for
grenades<00:05:03.590> plasma<00:05:04.590> whatever<00:05:05.400> it's<00:05:05.790> used<00:05:06.330> for

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
grenades but here i am using it just

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.330

like<00:05:09.990> Call<00:05:10.169> of<00:05:10.200> Duty<00:05:10.500> I<00:05:10.530> guess<00:05:10.889> they<00:05:11.040> want<00:05:11.250> to

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
like Call of Duty I guess they want to

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.790 
like Call of Duty I guess they want to
attract<00:05:11.639> more<00:05:12.180> fans<00:05:12.720> who<00:05:13.110> are<00:05:13.229> used<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.620> this

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
attract more fans who are used to this

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.680 
attract more fans who are used to this
and<00:05:14.070> they'll<00:05:14.490> be<00:05:14.639> questioning<00:05:15.090> why<00:05:15.330> is<00:05:15.389> the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
and they'll be questioning why is the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.390 
and they'll be questioning why is the
left<00:05:15.870> trigger<00:05:16.050> used<00:05:16.410> for<00:05:16.650> grenades<00:05:16.919> well

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
left trigger used for grenades well

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.210

whatever<00:05:18.090> also<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.840> graphics<00:05:19.470> are<00:05:19.770> kind<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.130> a

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
whatever also the graphics are kind of a

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.340 
whatever also the graphics are kind of a
mixed<00:05:20.520> bag<00:05:20.550> yes<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.450> looks<00:05:21.630> kind<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.930> cool<00:05:22.110> and

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
mixed bag yes it looks kind of cool and

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.590 
mixed bag yes it looks kind of cool and
it<00:05:22.470> runs<00:05:22.590> at<00:05:22.740> 60fps<00:05:23.100> with<00:05:23.790> amazing<00:05:24.360> lighting

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
it runs at 60fps with amazing lighting

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.600 
it runs at 60fps with amazing lighting
but<00:05:25.020> there<00:05:25.290> are<00:05:25.320> a<00:05:25.440> lot<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.710> areas<00:05:26.220> that<00:05:26.430> had

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
but there are a lot of areas that had

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.000 
but there are a lot of areas that had
really<00:05:27.419> low<00:05:27.570> res<00:05:27.810> textures<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.560> when<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:28.860> was

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
really low res textures and when I was

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.190 
really low res textures and when I was
going<00:05:29.280> to<00:05:29.460> customize<00:05:29.880> my<00:05:30.060> avatar<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:31.020> just

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
going to customize my avatar I just

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.930 
going to customize my avatar I just
noticed<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.590> there<00:05:31.890> were<00:05:32.010> practically<00:05:32.580> no

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
noticed that there were practically no

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.550 
noticed that there were practically no
textures<00:05:33.479> on<00:05:33.600> it<00:05:33.720> out<00:05:33.840> I'm<00:05:34.020> pretty<00:05:34.229> sure<00:05:34.410> it's

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
textures on it out I'm pretty sure it's

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.469 
textures on it out I'm pretty sure it's
because<00:05:34.590> if<00:05:34.860> it's<00:05:34.979> a<00:05:35.100> it's<00:05:35.400> in<00:05:35.550> beta<00:05:35.760> or

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
because if it's a it's in beta or

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.760 
because if it's a it's in beta or
something<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.020> that<00:05:37.200> would<00:05:37.560> change

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
something and that would change

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.250 
something and that would change
definitely<00:05:38.280> but<00:05:38.850> I<00:05:39.060> wasn't<00:05:39.930> really<00:05:40.050> impressed

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
definitely but I wasn't really impressed

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.340 
definitely but I wasn't really impressed
by<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.710> graphics<00:05:41.160> overall<00:05:41.610> in<00:05:42.390> conclusion<00:05:42.990> I

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
by the graphics overall in conclusion I

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.770 
by the graphics overall in conclusion I
felt<00:05:43.650> that<00:05:43.740> halo<00:05:44.100> 5<00:05:44.430> multiplayer<00:05:44.780> judging

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
felt that halo 5 multiplayer judging

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.810 
felt that halo 5 multiplayer judging
from<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:46.050> beta<00:05:46.260> felt<00:05:46.710> like<00:05:47.039> cod<00:05:47.310> in<00:05:47.520> space

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
from the beta felt like cod in space

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.969 
from the beta felt like cod in space
while<00:05:48.510> 343<00:05:49.110> are<00:05:49.320> trying<00:05:49.560> their<00:05:49.680> best<00:05:49.740> to

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
while 343 are trying their best to

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.770 
while 343 are trying their best to
distance<00:05:50.430> themselves<00:05:50.580> away<00:05:51.090> from<00:05:51.120> it<00:05:51.419> I<00:05:51.539> just

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
distance themselves away from it I just

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.779 
distance themselves away from it I just
can't<00:05:51.990> shake<00:05:52.260> away<00:05:52.410> that<00:05:52.650> feeling<00:05:53.100> so<00:05:53.520> if

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
can't shake away that feeling so if

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.640 
can't shake away that feeling so if
you're<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> hardcore<00:05:54.450> halo<00:05:54.810> fan<00:05:55.050> hoping<00:05:55.500> that

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
you're a hardcore halo fan hoping that

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.290 
you're a hardcore halo fan hoping that
this<00:05:55.860> may<00:05:56.160> keep<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.460> heart<00:05:56.789> of<00:05:56.880> bungees

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
this may keep the heart of bungees

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.080 
this may keep the heart of bungees
original<00:05:57.750> vision<00:05:57.930> such<00:05:58.680> as<00:05:58.830> halo<00:05:59.340> reach<00:05:59.550> then

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
original vision such as halo reach then

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.610 
original vision such as halo reach then
you're<00:06:00.270> most<00:06:00.570> likely<00:06:00.780> going<00:06:01.050> to<00:06:01.139> find<00:06:01.410> this

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
you're most likely going to find this

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.650 
you're most likely going to find this
really<00:06:02.280> disappointing<00:06:02.970> but<00:06:03.360> if<00:06:03.479> you're

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
really disappointing but if you're

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.909 
really disappointing but if you're
looking<00:06:03.930> at<00:06:04.050> it<00:06:04.139> at<00:06:04.260> something<00:06:04.470> new<00:06:04.710> then

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
looking at it at something new then

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.830 
looking at it at something new then
maybe<00:06:05.130> halo<00:06:05.370> 5<00:06:05.669> may<00:06:06.030> just<00:06:06.270> surprise<00:06:06.419> you

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
maybe halo 5 may just surprise you

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.990 
maybe halo 5 may just surprise you
either<00:06:07.470> way<00:06:07.770> this<00:06:08.010> is<00:06:08.160> an<00:06:08.280> early<00:06:08.550> look<00:06:08.729> so

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
either way this is an early look so

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.850 
either way this is an early look so
maybe<00:06:09.270> things<00:06:09.539> might<00:06:09.690> change<00:06:09.750> since<00:06:10.289> 343

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
maybe things might change since 343
