there's there's there's team strategy
there's<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:20.829> much<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.220> yeah<00:03:21.489> well<00:03:22.030> you

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
there's so much to it yeah well you

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.610 
there's so much to it yeah well you
think<00:03:22.329> about<00:03:22.450> gymnast<00:03:23.049> going<00:03:23.320> back<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.590> that

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
think about gymnast going back to that

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.789 
think about gymnast going back to that
they<00:03:24.070> start<00:03:24.690> gymnastics<00:03:25.690> at<00:03:25.810> age<00:03:25.959> three<00:03:26.350> right

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
they start gymnastics at age three right

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.330 
they start gymnastics at age three right
so<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.870> know<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:28.989> think<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.769> have<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.190> be

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
so you know I think that you have to be

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.300 
so you know I think that you have to be
because<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.420> have<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.630> be<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.900> small<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.560> so

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
because you have to be that small and so

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.059 
because you have to be that small and so
we're<00:03:33.760> bored<00:03:34.209> anyways

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069

we're bored anyways
yeah<00:03:35.670> no<00:03:35.939> it's<00:03:36.090> certainly<00:03:36.359> odd<00:03:36.980> now<00:03:37.980> we're

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
yeah no it's certainly odd now we're

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.830 
yeah no it's certainly odd now we're
just<00:03:38.099> going<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.340> say<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.719> know

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
road yeah definitely on the road it's

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.920 
road yeah definitely on the road it's
it's<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.340> lot<00:03:53.489> harder<00:03:53.639> on<00:03:53.849> attract<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:54.389> a<00:03:54.629> lot

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
it's a lot harder on attract it's a lot

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.599 
it's a lot harder on attract it's a lot
more<00:03:54.980> straightforward<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.069> think<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.459> what

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
more straightforward I think that's what

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.089 
more straightforward I think that's what
I've<00:03:56.700> been<00:03:56.909> so<00:03:57.269> good<00:03:57.450> at<00:03:57.599> it<00:03:57.719> at<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.769> young<00:03:59.069> age

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
I've been so good at it at a young age

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.599 
I've been so good at it at a young age
but<00:03:59.879> I<00:04:00.530> mean<00:04:01.530> eventually<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:02.189> all<00:04:02.310> about<00:04:02.459> the

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
but I mean eventually it's all about the

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.899 
but I mean eventually it's all about the
road<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.590> couple<00:04:05.159> years<00:04:05.400> under<00:04:05.730> my<00:04:05.790> belt

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
road and so a couple years under my belt

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.500 
road and so a couple years under my belt
I<00:04:06.269> think<00:04:06.919> you'll<00:04:07.919> be<00:04:08.010> there<00:04:08.159> how<00:04:08.310> about<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:09.060> it

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
I think you'll be there how about is it

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.720 
I think you'll be there how about is it
is<00:04:09.689> it<00:04:09.829> easier<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:10.980> think<00:04:11.219> coming<00:04:11.340> kind<00:04:11.669> of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
is it easier you think coming kind of

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.089 
is it easier you think coming kind of
from<00:04:11.879> American<00:04:12.569> cycling<00:04:12.989> royalty<00:04:13.469> if<00:04:13.829> that's

from American cycling royalty if that's

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.319 
from American cycling royalty if that's
