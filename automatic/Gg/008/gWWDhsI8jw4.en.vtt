a<00:00:08.970> few<00:00:09.780> years<00:00:10.019> ago<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:10.800> purchased<00:00:11.340> some<00:00:11.429> bear

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
a few years ago we purchased some bear

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.230 
a few years ago we purchased some bear
rootstock<00:00:13.049> fruit<00:00:13.920> trees<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.670> our<00:00:14.820> property

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
rootstock fruit trees for our property

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.779 
rootstock fruit trees for our property
we<00:00:15.690> bought<00:00:16.020> three<00:00:16.470> different<00:00:17.010> apple<00:00:17.520> trees

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
we bought three different apple trees

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.529 
we bought three different apple trees
and<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.750> sweet<00:00:19.199> cherry<00:00:19.529> tree<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.490> now<00:00:21.119> they<00:00:21.359> are

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and a sweet cherry tree and now they are

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.080 
and a sweet cherry tree and now they are
full<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.230> foliage<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:23.369> there's<00:00:23.580> not<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> single

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
full of foliage but there's not a single

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.839 
full of foliage but there's not a single
bloom<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.689> them<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.619> looks<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:25.920> yet<00:00:26.550> again

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
bloom on them so it looks like yet again

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.410 
bloom on them so it looks like yet again
no<00:00:27.480> fruit<00:00:27.840> from<00:00:28.140> those<00:00:28.349> trees<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:29.010> year

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
no fruit from those trees this year

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.089 
no fruit from those trees this year
because<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.380> couldn't<00:00:31.800> help

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
because of that we just couldn't help

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.670 
because of that we just couldn't help
ourselves<00:00:32.420> we<00:00:33.420> were<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> nursery<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> we

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
ourselves we were at the nursery and we

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.720 
ourselves we were at the nursery and we
saw<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.520> bonfire<00:00:36.290> dwarf<00:00:37.290> peach<00:00:37.680> tree<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
saw this bonfire dwarf peach tree that

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
saw this bonfire dwarf peach tree that
was<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.300> completely<00:00:39.960> covered<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.920> blossoms

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
was just completely covered in blossoms

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
was just completely covered in blossoms
seemed<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.140> very<00:00:43.410> good<00:00:43.530> condition<00:00:44.340> not

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
seemed to be in very good condition not

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.440 
seemed to be in very good condition not
just<00:00:45.210> pretty<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.559> decided<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.129> buy<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
just pretty and so we decided to buy it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.150 
just pretty and so we decided to buy it
when<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.539> brought<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.809> home<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.469> immediately

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
when we brought it home it immediately

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.689 
when we brought it home it immediately
attracted<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> pollinators<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.100> now<00:00:53.100> we

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
attracted the pollinators and now we

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.400 
attracted the pollinators and now we
have<00:00:53.879> little<00:00:54.210> fruit<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.690> over<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> tree

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
have little fruit all over the tree

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.290 
have little fruit all over the tree
because<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> fruit<00:00:56.699> trees<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.120> had

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
because the fruit trees we had

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.200 
because the fruit trees we had
previously<00:00:57.539> planted<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.500> never<00:00:58.829> actually

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
previously planted have never actually

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
previously planted have never actually
blossomed<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.390> found<00:01:00.930> myself<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.530> quick

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
blossomed I found myself in a quick

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
blossomed I found myself in a quick
predicament<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.969> knowing<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.660> should

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
predicament not knowing what I should

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
predicament not knowing what I should
really<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:05.129> all<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> fruit<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> tree

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
really do with all the fruit on the tree

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.780 
really do with all the fruit on the tree
so<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> put<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> question<00:01:07.770> out<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
so I put the question out to you and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.120 
so I put the question out to you and
asked<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.810> several<00:01:10.170> different<00:01:10.290> social<00:01:10.860> media

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
asked on several different social media

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.730 
asked on several different social media
networks<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> would<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.590> were

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
networks what you would do if you were

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
networks what you would do if you were
getting<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.460> fruit<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> tree<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
getting so much fruit on a tree and the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.469 
getting so much fruit on a tree and the
two<00:01:16.500> general<00:01:16.950> guidances<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.939> received

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
two general guidances that we received

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.960 
two general guidances that we received
or<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:20.009> needed<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> prune<00:01:20.729> because

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
or that one we needed to prune because

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
or that one we needed to prune because
the<00:01:21.930> branches<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> tree<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.310> going

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the branches of the tree we're not going

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.249 
the branches of the tree we're not going
to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.670> able<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.060> support<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> weight<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
to be able to support the weight of the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.490 
to be able to support the weight of the
fruit<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.119> to<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.810> needed<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> prune

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
fruit and to that we needed to prune

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.950 
fruit and to that we needed to prune
because<00:01:28.710> there's<00:01:29.700> some<00:01:30.000> sort<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> inherent

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
because there's some sort of inherent

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560 
because there's some sort of inherent
mechanism<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.490> fruit<00:01:32.729> tree<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> when

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
mechanism in the fruit tree that when

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.649 
mechanism in the fruit tree that when
the<00:01:33.750> fruit<00:01:34.049> touch<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:35.340> sends<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> signal<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the fruit touch it sends a signal to the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.370 
the fruit touch it sends a signal to the
tree<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.380> produce<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.579> fruit<00:01:38.880> anymore

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
tree not to produce that fruit anymore

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
tree not to produce that fruit anymore
and<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.610> wouldn't<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and because of that we wouldn't get the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.020 
and because of that we wouldn't get the
size<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.110> sweetness<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.130> quality<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> the

size and sweetness and quality of the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.850 
size and sweetness and quality of the
fruit<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.540> were<00:01:45.780> hoping<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.649> get

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
fruit that we were hoping to to get

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.010 
fruit that we were hoping to to get
because<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> way<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.540> tree<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:48.960> been

because of the way this tree has been

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.859 
because of the way this tree has been
pruned<00:01:49.470> before<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.220> am<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:51.000> very<00:01:51.360> concerned

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
pruned before I am not very concerned

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.230 
pruned before I am not very concerned
about<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.770> being<00:01:53.189> too<00:01:53.310> heavy<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:53.909> the

fruit can you tell yet what the concern
is<00:02:08.539> look<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.690> all<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> fruit<00:02:10.950> hiding

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
is look at all of the fruit hiding

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.350 
is look at all of the fruit hiding
underneath<00:02:11.879> these<00:02:12.150> leaves

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
underneath these leaves

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.160 
underneath these leaves
now<00:02:14.320> some<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.710> these<00:02:15.070> are<00:02:15.430> quite<00:02:16.060> small<00:02:16.450> some

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
now some of these are quite small some

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.040 
now some of these are quite small some
are<00:02:17.410> already<00:02:17.860> getting<00:02:18.250> very<00:02:18.640> large<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.960> if

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
are already getting very large but if

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.390 
are already getting very large but if
they<00:02:20.140> get<00:02:20.290> too<00:02:20.470> large<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.040> they<00:02:21.100> touch<00:02:21.370> each

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
they get too large and they touch each

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.050 
they get too large and they touch each
other

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
other

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.940 
other
supposedly<00:02:22.750> they<00:02:22.990> won't<00:02:23.170> grow<00:02:23.380> any<00:02:23.710> further

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
supposedly they won't grow any further

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.150 
supposedly they won't grow any further
so<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:25.000> need<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.300> thin<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.660> out<00:02:25.870> some<00:02:26.170> let<00:02:27.040> me

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
so we need to thin this out some let me

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.440 
so we need to thin this out some let me
show<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.400> what<00:02:27.640> kind<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.880> things<00:02:28.120> are<00:02:28.270> gonna

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
show you what kind of things are gonna

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.630 
show you what kind of things are gonna
clue<00:02:28.720> me<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.590> thin<00:02:29.830> out<00:02:30.010> Mother

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
clue me in on what to thin out Mother

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.360 
clue me in on what to thin out Mother
Nature<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.120> already<00:02:31.540> doing<00:02:31.710> her<00:02:32.710> job

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
Nature is already doing her job

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.940 
Nature is already doing her job
for<00:02:33.610> us<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:35.080> can<00:02:35.230> see<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> lot<00:02:35.920> of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
for us and you can see that a lot of

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.200 
for us and you can see that a lot of
these<00:02:36.250> are<00:02:36.840> infertile<00:02:37.840> fruits<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.250> because

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
these are infertile fruits and because

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.910 
these are infertile fruits and because
of<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.540> they're<00:02:40.930> already<00:02:41.230> beginning<00:02:41.740> to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
of that they're already beginning to

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.820 
of that they're already beginning to
drop<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:43.840> see<00:02:44.020> like<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:45.010> here

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
drop so you can see like this here

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.460 
drop so you can see like this here
never<00:02:47.830> was<00:02:48.400> pollinated<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.540> hasn't<00:02:49.960> grown<00:02:50.170> at

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
never was pollinated it hasn't grown at

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.880 
never was pollinated it hasn't grown at
all<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.510> what<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:52.990> do<00:02:53.140> just<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.620> help

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
all and so what we can do just to help

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.980 
all and so what we can do just to help
make<00:02:54.370> sure<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.820> tree<00:02:55.120> stays<00:02:55.390> healthy<00:02:55.840> is

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
make sure that the tree stays healthy is

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.449 
make sure that the tree stays healthy is
help<00:02:56.230> get<00:02:56.530> all<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:58.020> excess<00:02:59.020> off<00:02:59.440> the<00:03:00.100> tree

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
help get all of this excess off the tree

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.880 
help get all of this excess off the tree
so<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.510> doesn't<00:03:01.900> have<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.230> try<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.530> send

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
so that it doesn't have to try to send

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.770 
so that it doesn't have to try to send
any<00:03:03.190> more<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.820> its<00:03:04.390> energy<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.860> those

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
any more of its energy to those

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.640 
any more of its energy to those
unpalatable<00:03:11.790> innate<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.959> way<00:03:14.140> you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
unpalatable innate it and in a way you

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.800 
unpalatable innate it and in a way you
can<00:03:14.860> say<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.100> it's<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.490> blessing<00:03:15.670> because<00:03:16.090> we

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
can say that it's a blessing because we

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.509 
can say that it's a blessing because we
don't<00:03:17.020> have<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.410> thin<00:03:17.620> out<00:03:17.830> all<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.220> fruits

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
don't have to thin out all the fruits

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.479 
don't have to thin out all the fruits
that<00:03:19.150> may<00:03:19.360> have<00:03:19.480> been<00:03:19.750> there<00:03:19.989> but<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:21.190> think

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
that may have been there but I think

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.820 
that may have been there but I think
that<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.480> look<00:03:22.930> back<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.470> root<00:03:23.680> of

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
that you can look back to the root of

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.190 
that you can look back to the root of
the<00:03:23.950> problem<00:03:24.459> being<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.300> this<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:25.720> nursery

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
the problem being that this is a nursery

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.270 
the problem being that this is a nursery
plant<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.940> simply<00:03:28.540> came<00:03:29.500> into<00:03:29.800> bloom

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
plant and it simply came into bloom

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.240 
plant and it simply came into bloom
before<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.930> pollinators<00:03:32.380> for<00:03:32.709> our<00:03:33.130> area<00:03:33.959> were

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
before the pollinators for our area were

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.350 
before the pollinators for our area were
established<00:03:36.250> for<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.550> year<00:03:36.730> but<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.060> can<00:03:37.180> see

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
established for the year but you can see

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.699 
established for the year but you can see
how<00:03:37.480> easily<00:03:38.280> all<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.610> just<00:03:39.880> drops<00:03:40.150> right<00:03:40.680> off

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
how easily all that just drops right off

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.040 
how easily all that just drops right off
so<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.459> infertile<00:03:42.910> fruits<00:03:43.269> may<00:03:43.510> have<00:03:43.690> been<00:03:43.900> an

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
so the infertile fruits may have been an

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.320 
so the infertile fruits may have been an
obvious<00:03:44.530> choice<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.190> chances<00:03:46.000> are<00:03:46.180> they

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
obvious choice and chances are they

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.729 
obvious choice and chances are they
would<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.570> all<00:03:46.720> come<00:03:46.959> off<00:03:46.989> naturally

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
would have all come off naturally

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.540 
would have all come off naturally
through<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.100> drop<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:49.440> up<00:03:50.440> here<00:03:50.500> we<00:03:51.040> can<00:03:51.250> see

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
through the drop but up here we can see

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.220 
through the drop but up here we can see
a<00:03:52.080> bigger<00:03:53.080> problem<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.880> see<00:03:55.060> here<00:03:55.420> this<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.050> a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
a bigger problem you see here this is a

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.460 
a bigger problem you see here this is a
good<00:03:56.560> example<00:03:57.360> where<00:03:58.360> we<00:03:58.510> have<00:03:58.720> two<00:03:59.050> fruits

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
good example where we have two fruits

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.410 
good example where we have two fruits
that<00:03:59.739> have<00:03:59.860> clearly<00:04:00.130> been<00:04:00.340> pollinated<00:04:01.239> and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
that have clearly been pollinated and

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.300 
that have clearly been pollinated and
they're<00:04:01.870> already<00:04:02.320> trying<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.830> touch<00:04:03.100> each

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
they're already trying to touch each

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.660 
they're already trying to touch each
other

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
other

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.580 
other
I<00:04:03.820> have<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.390> make<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.660> unfortunate<00:04:05.260> decision

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
I have to make the unfortunate decision

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.940 
I have to make the unfortunate decision
and<00:04:06.010> simply<00:04:06.459> pinch<00:04:06.970> off<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:08.140> smaller<00:04:08.500> fruit

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
and simply pinch off the smaller fruit

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.300 
and simply pinch off the smaller fruit
in<00:04:09.220> favor<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.570> larger<00:04:10.989> one<00:04:11.140> hoping<00:04:12.130> that

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
in favor of the larger one hoping that

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.120 
in favor of the larger one hoping that
it<00:04:12.489> will<00:04:12.640> not<00:04:12.850> get<00:04:13.209> diseased<00:04:13.600> or<00:04:14.080> damaged<00:04:14.920> in

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
it will not get diseased or damaged in

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.650 
it will not get diseased or damaged in
any<00:04:15.280> other<00:04:15.489> way<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.180> will<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.419> the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
any other way and that it will be the

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.289 
any other way and that it will be the
one<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:17.019> produces<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.650> fruit<00:04:17.940> here's<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.000> tip

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
one that produces the fruit here's a tip

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.719 
one that produces the fruit here's a tip
for<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.630> I've<00:04:19.840> quickly<00:04:20.109> discovered<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.070> I

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
for you I've quickly discovered that I

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.610 
for you I've quickly discovered that I
need<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.300> be<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.450> little<00:04:22.750> more<00:04:22.870> gentle<00:04:23.200> than<00:04:23.380> I

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
need to be a little more gentle than I

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.940 
need to be a little more gentle than I
was<00:04:23.800> being<00:04:24.100> at<00:04:24.310> first<00:04:24.640> and<00:04:25.120> it<00:04:25.780> seems<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.200> me

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
was being at first and it seems to me

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
was being at first and it seems to me
that<00:04:27.130> when<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.430> select<00:04:27.730> a<00:04:28.030> fruit<00:04:28.360> don't<00:04:29.140> tug

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
that when you select a fruit don't tug

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.640 
that when you select a fruit don't tug
tugging<00:04:30.970> causes<00:04:31.600> enough<00:04:31.870> vibration<00:04:32.050> that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
tugging causes enough vibration that

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.500 
tugging causes enough vibration that
I've<00:04:32.800> lost<00:04:33.070> one<00:04:33.460> or<00:04:33.580> two<00:04:33.730> fruits<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.330> would

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
I've lost one or two fruits that I would

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.530 
I've lost one or two fruits that I would
rather<00:04:34.720> have<00:04:34.930> kept<00:04:35.320> but<00:04:36.310> instead<00:04:36.700> give<00:04:37.360> it<00:04:37.480> a

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
rather have kept but instead give it a

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.670 
rather have kept but instead give it a
gentle<00:04:37.720> twist<00:04:38.790> just<00:04:39.790> a<00:04:40.140> half<00:04:41.140> or<00:04:41.500> three

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
gentle twist just a half or three

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.130 
gentle twist just a half or three
quarter<00:04:42.220> turn<00:04:42.490> one<00:04:42.850> way<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.330> then<00:04:43.510> come<00:04:43.960> back

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
quarter turn one way and then come back

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.720 
quarter turn one way and then come back
and<00:04:44.350> do<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.530> same<00:04:44.680> thing<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:45.010> other<00:04:45.040> way<00:04:45.310> and

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
and do the same thing the other way and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.670 
and do the same thing the other way and
that<00:04:46.540> fruit<00:04:46.720> will<00:04:46.870> come<00:04:47.020> right<00:04:47.230> off<00:04:47.260> without

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
that fruit will come right off without

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.800 
that fruit will come right off without
having<00:04:47.980> disturb<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.700> rest<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:49.090> them<00:04:49.240> here's

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
having disturb the rest of them here's

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.570 
having disturb the rest of them here's
another<00:04:50.080> situation<00:04:50.350> for<00:04:50.950> you<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.220> consider

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
another situation for you to consider

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.700 
another situation for you to consider
sometimes<00:04:52.480> you're<00:04:52.960> not<00:04:52.990> going<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.470> get<00:04:53.590> to

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
sometimes you're not going to get to

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.960 
sometimes you're not going to get to
have<00:04:53.890> your<00:04:54.070> pick<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.490> litter

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
have your pick of the litter

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.130 
have your pick of the litter
here<00:04:55.690> are<00:04:55.930> three<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:57.070> a<00:04:57.430> row<00:04:57.460> on<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.000> same<00:04:58.540> side

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
here are three in a row on the same side

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.070 
here are three in a row on the same side
of<00:04:59.170> the<00:04:59.740> same<00:05:00.010> branch<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.660> end<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:01.930> may

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
of the same branch and in the end I may

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.170 
of the same branch and in the end I may
only<00:05:02.200> be<00:05:02.380> able<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.650> keep<00:05:02.800> one<00:05:03.070> of<00:05:03.100> them<00:05:03.340> but<00:05:03.940> for

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
only be able to keep one of them but for

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.930 
only be able to keep one of them but for
now<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:05.230> make<00:05:05.410> sure<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.680> have<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.280> best<00:05:06.580> chance

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
now to make sure I have the best chance

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.010 
now to make sure I have the best chance
possible<00:05:07.290> my<00:05:08.290> best<00:05:08.590> choice<00:05:08.890> is<00:05:09.730> to<00:05:09.820> remove<00:05:10.780> the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
possible my best choice is to remove the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.830 
possible my best choice is to remove the
one<00:05:11.170> in<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.380> middle<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.540> let<00:05:13.720> the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
one in the middle and I can let the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.870 
one in the middle and I can let the
other<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:14.260> develop<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:15.070> if<00:05:15.280> I<00:05:15.430> need<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.640> make<00:05:15.850> a

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
other to develop and if I need to make a

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.270 
other to develop and if I need to make a
selection<00:05:16.270> between<00:05:16.780> them<00:05:17.020> I<00:05:17.230> can<00:05:17.710> do<00:05:17.830> so<00:05:18.010> later

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
selection between them I can do so later

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.670 
selection between them I can do so later
you<00:05:19.030> know<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.270> came<00:05:19.420> to<00:05:19.660> mind<00:05:19.870> while<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.350> was

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
you know it came to mind while I was

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.650 
you know it came to mind while I was
doing<00:05:21.010> this<00:05:21.190> that<00:05:21.520> it's<00:05:21.760> not<00:05:21.850> just<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.420> matter

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
doing this that it's not just a matter

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.480 
doing this that it's not just a matter
of<00:05:22.810> thinning<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.410> tree<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.890> try<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.160> make<00:05:24.460> sure

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
of thinning the tree to try to make sure

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.290 
of thinning the tree to try to make sure
that<00:05:24.820> we<00:05:25.180> have<00:05:25.420> bigger<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.560> better<00:05:26.740> fruit<00:05:27.300> but

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
that we have bigger and better fruit but

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.420 
that we have bigger and better fruit but
I<00:05:28.540> believe<00:05:28.960> it's<00:05:29.170> also<00:05:29.350> just<00:05:29.680> good<00:05:30.010> health<00:05:30.340> for

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
I believe it's also just good health for

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.670 
I believe it's also just good health for
the<00:05:30.880> tree<00:05:31.150> we<00:05:31.600> had<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.750> pretty<00:05:31.960> good<00:05:32.140> soaking<00:05:32.380> of

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
the tree we had a pretty good soaking of

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.580 
the tree we had a pretty good soaking of
rain<00:05:32.920> here<00:05:33.190> today<00:05:33.520> and<00:05:33.990> these<00:05:35.040> clusters<00:05:36.040> of

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
rain here today and these clusters of

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.760 
rain here today and these clusters of
unfertilized<00:05:38.590> fruit<00:05:39.240> had<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.690> blossom<00:05:41.290> ends

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
unfertilized fruit had the blossom ends

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.800 
unfertilized fruit had the blossom ends
and<00:05:42.040> they<00:05:42.190> were<00:05:42.460> just<00:05:42.700> clumped<00:05:43.120> all<00:05:43.360> together

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
and they were just clumped all together

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.980 
and they were just clumped all together
and<00:05:44.110> starting<00:05:45.040> to<00:05:45.160> get<00:05:45.340> wet<00:05:45.820> which<00:05:46.330> soon<00:05:46.750> is

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
and starting to get wet which soon is

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.340 
and starting to get wet which soon is

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
going to turn to rot and mold and easily

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.510 
going to turn to rot and mold and easily

leaves and it seems to me that by trying
to<00:06:02.350> get<00:06:02.530> as<00:06:02.650> much<00:06:02.800> of<00:06:02.860> this<00:06:03.190> out<00:06:03.400> as<00:06:03.610> we<00:06:03.790> can

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
to get as much of this out as we can

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.330 
to get as much of this out as we can
that<00:06:04.780> we<00:06:04.900> can<00:06:05.110> improve<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.680> overall<00:06:05.710> health

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
that we can improve the overall health

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.010 
that we can improve the overall health
of<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.550> tree<00:06:06.820> or<00:06:07.000> guarantee<00:06:07.570> its<00:06:07.750> health

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
of the tree or guarantee its health

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.280 
of the tree or guarantee its health
better<00:06:08.770> for<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.340> future<00:06:09.730> now<00:06:10.630> this<00:06:10.840> is<00:06:11.020> easy

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
better for the future now this is easy

better for the future now this is easy

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
pruned dwarf peach tree if this were

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.050 
pruned dwarf peach tree if this were
much<00:06:17.770> larger<00:06:18.010> tree<00:06:18.490> then<00:06:18.700> there<00:06:18.850> are<00:06:18.970> still

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
much larger tree then there are still

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.850 
much larger tree then there are still
things<00:06:19.360> that<00:06:19.510> you<00:06:19.720> can<00:06:19.870> do<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.200> try<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.470> thin

things that you can do to try to thin

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.910 
things that you can do to try to thin
out<00:06:21.070> you<00:06:21.760> can<00:06:21.970> wait<00:06:22.510> until<00:06:22.750> the<00:06:23.200> drop<00:06:23.470> comes

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920 
out you can wait until the drop comes

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.310 
out you can wait until the drop comes
and<00:06:24.250> then<00:06:24.430> go<00:06:24.610> and<00:06:24.760> just<00:06:25.000> remove<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:26.080> bigger
