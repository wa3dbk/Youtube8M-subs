00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.030
WITH LOSING A CHERISHED PET BUT

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.100
WITH THE IDEA THAT THE DOGS

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.200
RUNNING LOOSE WERE GIVEN BACK TO

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.370

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.070

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.940
THE DOG'S OWNER HAD GONE TO WORK

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.740
AND THE DOG WHICH IS NORMALLY

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.210

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.910

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.980
OUTSIDE HERE IN THE YARD WHEN

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.280
THERE IS NOBODY AT HOME.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.390
THIS IS THAT DOG'S DOMAIN.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.190

DEATH A LITTLE AFTER EIGHT IN

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.590
THE MORNING.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.920
SHE WAS TINY, ALWAYS FULL OF

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.060
ENERGY.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.090
13-YEAR-OLD NELLA KILLED IN

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.130
HER OWN YARD.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.460
IT REALLY HURTS.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.360
BECAUSE SHE WAS A LOVABLE DOG.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.330
SHE GOT ALONG WITH KIDS.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.130
NEVER BIT ANYONE.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.940
A WITNESS TOLD CASSELBERRY

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.740

NELLA WAS KILLED.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.050
THIS IS NOT SOME FLIMSY WIRE.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.350
I MEAN, THEY BENT IT ALL OUT OF

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.820
SHAPE.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.980
THE GATE IS BENT BUT THE

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.580
WITNESS SAYS SHE SAW THE DOGS

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.220

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.490
FENCE.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.220
THE POLICE REPORT SAYS ANIMAL

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.260
SERVICES LET THE OWNER TAKE THE

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.030
THROUGH EMAIL ANIMAL SERVICES

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.930
POINTED OUT STATE LAW LAYS OUT

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.300
TWO WAYS A DOG CAN BE DECLARED

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.530
DANGEROUS.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.000
IT EITHER INFLICTED SEVERE

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.530
INJURY ON A HUMAN BEING OR THAT

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.070
IT MORE THAN ONCE INJURED OR

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.770
KILLED A DOMESTIC ANIMAL.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.140
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO RECENT

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.540
CALLS.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.340
IN THE FIRST, A GUY WALKING HIS

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.240
DOG SAID THE DOGS RUNNING LOOSE

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.380
CHARGED HIM.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.450
HIS FRIEND TOLD US.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.680
HE GOT BIT IN HIS FOREARM BUT

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.780
IT DIDN'T PUNCTURE HIS SKIN.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.520
SO THE DOGS DON'T MEET THE

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.290
DANGEROUS DOG DEFINITION.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.990
NOW THEY ATTACK SOMEBODY

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.990
ELSE'S DOG.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.260
SORRY TO SAY BUT THAT SHOULD BE

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.330
IT.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.260
IT HURTS MY HEART THAT, YOU

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.000
KNOW, THEY JUSTIFY THAT ANIMALS

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.560
CAN BE KILLED IN A WAY.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.160
NOBODY WAS HOME WHERE THE

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.170
DOGS RAN OFF.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.330
THE OWNER DID CALL ME LATE IN

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.940
THE AFTERNOON SAYING SHE WAS

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.870
SORRY THEY GOT AWAY.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.640
THAT THE DOGS SHE DESCRIBES AS

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.940
LAB MIXES ARE SWEET AND GENTLE

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.180
AND SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THEY DID

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.350
WHAT PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.150
LATE THIS AFTERNOON I WAS ABLE

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.850
TO GET AHEAD OF THE ANIMAL

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.920
SERVICES MANAGER BY PHONE.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.320
HE TELLS ME THERE'S QUITE AN

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.990
INVESTIGATION THEY STILL NEED TO

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.490
GO ON THAT INITIAL DOG WALKING

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.920
INCIDENT.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.760
BUT HE SAYS RIGHT NOW THESE DOGS

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.790
THAT WERE RUNNING LOOSE DO NOT

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.690
MEET THE DEFINITION FOR

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.600
DANGEROUS DOGS.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.230
THAT'S WHY THEY WERE RETURNED TO

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.060
THEIR OWNER.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.830
THE OWNER WAS CITED FOR LETTING

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.400
THE DOGS RUN LOOSE AND CITED FOR

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.220
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN THIS YARD.
