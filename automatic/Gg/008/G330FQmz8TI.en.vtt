orchid of mine so you see this little

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.320 
orchid of mine so you see this little
knob<00:02:33.230> here<00:02:33.590> at<00:02:33.830> first<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.910> thought<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.180> was

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
knob here at first I thought it was

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.400 
knob here at first I thought it was
going<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:36.020> be<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> spike<00:02:37.630> because<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.960> was<00:02:39.110> sharp

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
going to be a spike because it was sharp

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.790 
going to be a spike because it was sharp
rather<00:02:39.950> than<00:02:40.280> pointy<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:42.050> I<00:02:42.080> waited<00:02:42.410> and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
rather than pointy so I waited and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.590 
rather than pointy so I waited and
waited<00:02:43.010> but<00:02:43.550> there<00:02:44.240> was<00:02:44.360> no<00:02:44.540> development<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:47.060> I

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
waited but there was no development so I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.170 
waited but there was no development so I
gave<00:02:48.200> up<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.210> instead<00:02:50.500> our<00:02:51.500> route<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:52.280> growing

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
think well I thought that it was it

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.900 
think well I thought that it was it
wasn't<00:04:14.380> going<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.500> do<00:04:15.650> anything<00:04:16.010> for<00:04:16.459> me<00:04:16.640> for<00:04:16.880> a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
wasn't going to do anything for me for a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.690 
wasn't going to do anything for me for a
while<00:04:17.530> so<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:18.590> brought<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:19.040> home<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.820> I

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
while so I brought it home and I

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.630 
while so I brought it home and I
produced<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.850> new<00:04:22.970> leaf<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:25.130> now<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:27.100> new<00:04:28.100> spike

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
produced a new leaf and now a new spike

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.170 
produced a new leaf and now a new spike
so<00:04:29.630> today<00:04:29.960> is<00:04:30.230> July<00:04:30.770> eleventh<00:04:31.490> two<00:04:31.790> thousand

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
so today is July eleventh two thousand

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.650 
so today is July eleventh two thousand
thirteen<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:34.160> was<00:04:34.430> very<00:04:34.490> surprised<00:04:35.210> I

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
thirteen and that was very surprised I

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.110 
thirteen and that was very surprised I
got<00:04:36.560> some<00:04:36.830> leaf<00:04:37.220> damage<00:04:37.760> here<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:39.760> last<00:04:40.760> week

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
got some leaf damage here so last week

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.650 
got some leaf damage here so last week
there<00:04:41.480> was<00:04:42.370> another<00:04:43.370> leaf<00:04:43.700> that<00:04:43.970> fell<00:04:44.330> that

updated<00:05:07.340> on<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.240> progress<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:10.070> I<00:05:10.610> don't<00:05:10.790> know

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
updated on the progress and I don't know

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.190 
updated on the progress and I don't know
if<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.030> noticed<00:05:11.390> but<00:05:11.450> I<00:05:11.570> haven't<00:05:11.900> been

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
if you noticed but I haven't been

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.200 
if you noticed but I haven't been
spiking<00:05:12.770> or<00:05:13.310> um<00:05:13.790> I<00:05:14.300> think<00:05:14.480> that's<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.810> term

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
spiking or um I think that's the term

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.600 
spiking or um I think that's the term
spiking<00:05:17.210> my<00:05:18.190> spiking<00:05:19.190> spikes<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:20.390> know<00:05:20.510> like

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
spiking my spiking spikes you know like

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.400 
spiking my spiking spikes you know like
um

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
um

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.030 
um
jeez<00:05:25.410> what<00:05:26.160> am<00:05:26.280> I<00:05:26.340> trying<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.639> say<00:05:26.880> here<00:05:28.010> yeah<00:05:29.010> I

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
jeez what am I trying to say here yeah I

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.830 
jeez what am I trying to say here yeah I
guess<00:05:29.280> that's<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.610> right<00:05:29.820> term<00:05:29.850> spiking<00:05:30.630> this

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
guess that's the right term spiking this

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.659 
guess that's the right term spiking this
spike<00:05:31.380> or<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:31.770> know<00:05:31.889> putting<00:05:32.100> those<00:05:32.250> sticks

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
spike or you know putting those sticks

spike or you know putting those sticks

uniform and perfect I like the look of
the<00:05:48.990> spikes<00:05:49.380> kind<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.830> just<00:05:49.980> growing

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
the spikes kind of just growing

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.300 
the spikes kind of just growing
naturally<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.419> letting<00:05:51.750> nature<00:05:51.780> take<00:05:52.310> you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.850 
think it was there was a video from New
England<00:06:01.350> Gardner<00:06:01.860> where<00:06:02.729> he<00:06:02.970> showed<00:06:03.270> his<00:06:03.690> uh

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
England Gardner where he showed his uh

England Gardner where he showed his uh
where<00:06:04.860> he<00:06:04.950> showed<00:06:05.130> his<00:06:06.410> his<00:06:07.410> by<00:06:07.680> growing<00:06:08.100> and

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
where he showed his his by growing and

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.670 
where he showed his his by growing and
he<00:06:08.700> just<00:06:08.910> kind<00:06:09.030> of<00:06:09.150> let<00:06:09.600> it<00:06:09.630> grow<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.440> side

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
he just kind of let it grow to the side

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.070 
he just kind of let it grow to the side
and<00:06:10.950> I<00:06:11.040> just<00:06:11.250> thought<00:06:11.340> oh<00:06:11.490> my<00:06:11.820> gosh<00:06:12.060> that<00:06:12.600> is<00:06:12.630> so

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
healthy for the plan because I know that

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.570 
healthy for the plan because I know that
the<00:06:19.020> blimps<00:06:19.320> can<00:06:19.470> sometimes<00:06:19.950> get<00:06:20.130> too<00:06:20.340> heavy

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
the blimps can sometimes get too heavy

and you know we don't want the stems to

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.860 
and you know we don't want the stems to
break<00:06:25.470> because<00:06:26.400> of<00:06:26.580> that<00:06:26.729> but<00:06:26.910> then<00:06:27.090> again<00:06:27.240> its

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
break because of that but then again its

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.770

nature in its natural environment and

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.450 
nature in its natural environment and
there<00:06:33.930> wouldn't<00:06:34.110> be<00:06:34.350> any<00:06:34.560> sticks<00:06:34.950> holding<00:06:35.340> up

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
there wouldn't be any sticks holding up

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.600 
there wouldn't be any sticks holding up
the<00:06:35.580> flower<00:06:35.850> spike<00:06:36.300> and<00:06:36.539> it<00:06:37.530> does<00:06:37.860> quite<00:06:38.310> well
