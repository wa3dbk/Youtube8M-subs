with a new new scene okay let's go ahead

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.850 
with a new new scene okay let's go ahead
and<00:00:58.640> open<00:00:58.729> our<00:00:58.940> project<00:00:59.390> up<00:00:59.600> let's<00:01:00.589> go<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.800> our

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
and open our project up let's go to our

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.509 
and open our project up let's go to our
library<00:01:01.159> and<00:01:02.650> we'll<00:01:03.650> go<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:03.860> our<00:01:04.010> generators

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
library and we'll go to our generators

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.190 
library and we'll go to our generators
tab<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:04.940> we're<00:01:05.089> going<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.300> get<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.510> gradient

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
tab and we're going to get a gradient

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.520 
tab and we're going to get a gradient
we're<00:01:07.130> going<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.310> apply<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:07.970> gradient<00:01:08.530> let's

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
we're going to apply that gradient let's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.050 
we're going to apply that gradient let's
go<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.740> our<00:01:09.830> inspector<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:12.610> let's<00:01:13.610> change<00:01:13.880> our

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
go to our inspector and let's change our

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.899 
go to our inspector and let's change our
gradient<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.659> grayscale<00:01:18.520> okay<00:01:19.520> let's<00:01:19.729> turn

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
gradient to grayscale okay let's turn

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.609 
gradient to grayscale okay let's turn
down<00:01:20.150> our<00:01:20.270> gradient<00:01:20.540> now<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.140> let's<00:01:21.440> make

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
down our gradient now and let's make

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.380 
down our gradient now and let's make
this<00:01:21.920> last<00:01:22.340> one<00:01:22.670> here<00:01:22.729> let's<00:01:22.970> click<00:01:23.150> on<00:01:23.240> the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
this last one here let's click on the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.940 
this last one here let's click on the
color<00:01:23.570> swatch<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:23.990> let's<00:01:24.200> make<00:01:24.290> it<00:01:24.350> grey<00:01:24.740> and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
color swatch and let's make it grey and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.450 
color swatch and let's make it grey and
sit<00:01:25.100> a<00:01:25.130> black<00:01:25.430> like<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:27.580> looks<00:01:28.580> pretty<00:01:28.760> good

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
sit a black like that looks pretty good

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.520 
sit a black like that looks pretty good
let's<00:01:31.460> right-click<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:32.390> say<00:01:32.660> edit<00:01:32.900> position

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
let's right-click and say edit position

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.350 
let's right-click and say edit position
this<00:01:34.040> will<00:01:34.250> allow<00:01:34.310> us<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.580> edit<00:01:34.940> our<00:01:35.090> gradient

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
this will allow us to edit our gradient

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.030 
this will allow us to edit our gradient
and<00:01:35.690> I'm<00:01:35.810> going<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:35.990> position<00:01:36.560> my<00:01:36.710> gradient

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
and I'm going to position my gradient

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.980 
and I'm going to position my gradient
and<00:01:38.000> here<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.720> corner<00:01:39.110> like<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.810> just<00:01:41.810> to

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
and here in the corner like so just to

and here in the corner like so just to
give<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.350> little<00:01:42.620> grayness<00:01:43.490> there<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:43.970> this

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
give it a little grayness there and this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.230 
give it a little grayness there and this
on<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.480> corner<00:01:44.840> there<00:01:45.020> okay<00:01:45.980> now<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.000> we've

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.330 
on the corner there okay now that we've
got<00:01:47.360> our<00:01:47.390> gradient<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.740> turn<00:01:48.950> off<00:01:49.160> our

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
got our gradient we can turn off our

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.770 
got our gradient we can turn off our
gradient<00:01:49.550> if<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:49.850> want<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.150> or<00:01:50.300> we<00:01:50.450> can<00:01:50.600> leave

hitting the Tiki and let's type hate ok
we're<00:05:05.870> going<00:05:05.960> to<00:05:06.020> set<00:05:06.260> this<00:05:06.590> time<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:07.040> size<00:05:07.250> to

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
we're going to set this time the size to

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.440 
we're going to set this time the size to
160<00:05:08.770> or<00:05:09.770> maybe<00:05:10.010> 163<00:05:10.880> 164<00:05:12.160> ok<00:05:13.300> now<00:05:14.300> we're<00:05:14.419> going

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
160 or maybe 163 164 ok now we're going

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.690 
160 or maybe 163 164 ok now we're going
to<00:05:14.600> place<00:05:14.840> this<00:05:15.110> layer<00:05:15.380> between<00:05:15.950> the<00:05:16.280> love<00:05:16.490> and

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
to place this layer between the love and

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.100 
to place this layer between the love and
the<00:05:16.790> gradient<00:05:17.300> layer<00:05:17.390> so<00:05:17.600> I'm<00:05:17.690> going<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.870> drag

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
the gradient layer so I'm going to drag

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.050 
the gradient layer so I'm going to drag
it<00:05:18.169> down<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:18.979> I'm<00:05:19.610> going<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:19.820> place<00:05:20.030> it

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
it down and I'm going to place it

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.969 
it down and I'm going to place it
between<00:05:20.390> the<00:05:20.810> love<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.260> gradient<00:05:21.710> right

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
between the love and the gradient right

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.600 
between the love and the gradient right
there<00:05:22.510> like<00:05:23.510> that<00:05:24.070> now<00:05:25.070> let's<00:05:25.220> click<00:05:25.340> on<00:05:25.490> the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
there like that now let's click on the

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.610 
there like that now let's click on the
style<00:05:25.850> tab<00:05:26.090> and<00:05:26.780> we're<00:05:26.930> going<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.470> then

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
style tab and we're going to and then

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.370 
style tab and we're going to and then
we're<00:05:27.740> going<00:05:27.830> to<00:05:27.890> set<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.280> face<00:05:29.000> feel<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:30.140> feel

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
we're going to set the face feel to feel

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.279 
we're going to set the face feel to feel
with<00:05:30.650> gradient<00:05:31.190> alright<00:05:32.120> now<00:05:32.990> we're<00:05:33.140> going<00:05:33.169> to

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
with gradient alright now we're going to

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.580 
with gradient alright now we're going to
edit<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.830> gradient<00:05:35.020> so<00:05:36.020> let's<00:05:36.200> go<00:05:36.380> to<00:05:36.440> our

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
edit the gradient so let's go to our

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.159 
edit the gradient so let's go to our
gradient<00:05:37.010> here<00:05:37.360> let's<00:05:38.360> go<00:05:38.510> ahead<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:38.750> set<00:05:39.020> it

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
gradient here let's go ahead and set it

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:45.070 
gradient here let's go ahead and set it
to<00:05:40.090> grayscale<00:05:41.950> like<00:05:42.950> so<00:05:43.780> turn<00:05:44.780> down<00:05:44.960> our

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
to grayscale like so turn down our

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.279 
to grayscale like so turn down our
disclosure<00:05:45.440> triangle<00:05:46.210> ok<00:05:47.210> so<00:05:47.960> now<00:05:48.080> let's<00:05:48.110> go

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
disclosure triangle ok so now let's go

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.810 
disclosure triangle ok so now let's go
ahead<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:48.560> set<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.890> angle<00:05:49.070> will<00:05:49.550> set<00:05:49.700> the

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
ahead and set the angle will set the

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.430 
ahead and set the angle will set the
angle<00:05:49.970> to<00:05:50.210> 95<00:05:51.460> ok<00:05:52.479> let's<00:05:53.479> set<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:53.750> opacity<00:05:53.840> to

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
angle to 95 ok let's set the opacity to

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.230 
angle to 95 ok let's set the opacity to
86<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:56.740> let's<00:05:57.740> set<00:05:57.890> the<00:05:58.010> blur<00:05:59.289> to<00:06:00.289> about<00:06:01.240> five

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
86 and let's set the blur to about five

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.620 
86 and let's set the blur to about five
point<00:06:02.690> six<00:06:02.960> five

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
point six five

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.590 
point six five
alright<00:06:06.000> so<00:06:07.000> now<00:06:07.150> let's<00:06:07.330> go<00:06:07.420> to<00:06:07.510> the

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
alright so now let's go to the

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.200 
alright so now let's go to the
properties<00:06:07.810> of<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.650> hate<00:06:08.980> text<00:06:09.490> we're<00:06:10.120> going

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
properties of the hate text we're going

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.210 
properties of the hate text we're going
to<00:06:10.330> set<00:06:10.510> the<00:06:10.630> position<00:06:10.810> so<00:06:11.770> let's<00:06:11.920> turn<00:06:12.040> down

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
to set the position so let's turn down

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.380 
to set the position so let's turn down
our<00:06:12.310> position<00:06:12.760> we're<00:06:12.910> going<00:06:12.940> to<00:06:13.090> make<00:06:13.240> the

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
our position we're going to make the

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.650 
our position we're going to make the
first<00:06:13.630> one<00:06:13.840> here<00:06:14.140> in<00:06:14.260> the<00:06:14.980> X<00:06:15.480> we're<00:06:16.480> going<00:06:16.600> to

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
first one here in the X we're going to

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.750 
first one here in the X we're going to
make<00:06:16.750> it<00:06:16.930> minus<00:06:17.110> 47<00:06:18.480> the<00:06:19.480> next<00:06:19.840> one<00:06:20.550> now<00:06:21.550> why

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
make it minus 47 the next one now why

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.850 
make it minus 47 the next one now why
we're<00:06:22.720> going<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:22.900> make<00:06:22.960> minus<00:06:23.290> seventy<00:06:23.650> four

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
we're going to make minus seventy four

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:30.240 
we're going to make minus seventy four
and<00:06:24.810> then<00:06:25.810> to<00:06:25.990> Z<00:06:26.760> we're<00:06:27.760> going<00:06:27.850> to<00:06:27.910> make<00:06:28.000> 35<00:06:29.250> now

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
and then to Z we're going to make 35 now

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.910 
and then to Z we're going to make 35 now
we're<00:06:30.400> going<00:06:30.490> to<00:06:30.580> set<00:06:30.730> our<00:06:30.760> rotation<00:06:31.920> X

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
we're going to set our rotation X

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.800 
we're going to set our rotation X
rotation<00:06:33.250> is<00:06:33.640> going<00:06:33.790> to<00:06:33.850> be<00:06:33.940> minus<00:06:34.120> 58<00:06:36.810> while

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
rotation is going to be minus 58 while

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.660 
rotation is going to be minus 58 while
rotation<00:06:38.410> is<00:06:38.470> going<00:06:38.590> to<00:06:38.650> be<00:06:38.710> minus<00:06:38.890> 22<00:06:40.500> Z<00:06:41.670> minus

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.670 
rotation is going to be minus 22 Z minus

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.410 
rotation is going to be minus 22 Z minus
24<00:06:44.460> now<00:06:45.460> we<00:06:45.520> just<00:06:45.730> need<00:06:45.760> to<00:06:45.910> set<00:06:46.030> our<00:06:46.060> anchor

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420 
24 now we just need to set our anchor

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.140 
24 now we just need to set our anchor
points<00:06:46.720> 1<00:06:46.930> 85<00:06:47.320> and<00:06:47.530> 88<00:06:47.890> so<00:06:48.880> let's<00:06:49.030> set<00:06:49.090> our

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
points 1 85 and 88 so let's set our

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.510 
points 1 85 and 88 so let's set our
anchor<00:06:49.480> point<00:06:49.920> 1<00:06:50.920> 85<00:06:51.600> 88<00:06:53.040> turn<00:06:54.040> back<00:06:54.190> on<00:06:54.250> our

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
anchor point 1 85 88 turn back on our

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.540 
anchor point 1 85 88 turn back on our
gradient<00:06:55.470> and<00:06:56.520> boom<00:06:57.520> we<00:06:58.390> now<00:06:58.570> have<00:06:58.870> our<00:06:59.250> 3d<00:07:00.250> or

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
gradient and boom we now have our 3d or

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.300 
gradient and boom we now have our 3d or
simulated<00:07:01.120> 3d<00:07:01.540> text<00:07:02.020> with<00:07:02.590> the<00:07:02.710> shadow<00:07:02.950> and<00:07:03.250> of

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
simulated 3d text with the shadow and of

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.530 
simulated 3d text with the shadow and of
course<00:07:03.520> the<00:07:03.640> shadow<00:07:03.820> could<00:07:04.060> have<00:07:04.150> said<00:07:04.300> love

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540 
course the shadow could have said love

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.590 
course the shadow could have said love
you<00:07:05.230> know<00:07:05.410> or<00:07:05.920> whatever<00:07:06.250> but<00:07:06.850> there<00:07:07.360> we<00:07:07.480> go
