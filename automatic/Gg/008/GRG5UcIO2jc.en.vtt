 abrupt in accident 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.920
 in this room is also a 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.830
 the second solution to solve 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.770
 this blue screen problem and tutorial 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.170
 it is not 100% guaranteed that will solve 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.930
 to screens on your windows but let's say 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.330
 about 90 percent sure that 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.549
 you can solve why you should be 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.310
 aware that even Microsoft does not 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.219
 has positioned to create a solution for 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.740
 this problem in its own system and 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.600
 there is more in us that we have a link one 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.969
 certain limit of knowledge 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.939
 then these net tutorials judges 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.689
 about solving this blue screen error 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.070
 can be resolved and may not resolve until 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.920
 even you can get a point one 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.229
 formatting in order to resolve scheme 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.729
 your computer was not my case, I 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.560
 to be able to solve this error with 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.640
 first solution is where you are 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.450
 watching on the small screen 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.060
 before authoring or want to talk about the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.310
 our new art from our channel where we 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.250
 and soon from our channel where you 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.140
 it could stop being yellow 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.400
 ours soon but we changed and put 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.740
 blue 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.890
 We also played that name here. 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.840
 black tÃ¡ssio jeffs beautiful name and we changed 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 Yes, with this here to stay too. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.260
 more beautiful but can tutorial us 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.110
 here we have two first commands 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.210
 command is the check says that the 2nd command 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.610
 pipe guus 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.830
 so what are you going to do to yourself? 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.740
 will run this first command here 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.470
 You will wait one day if you see that 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.570
 the blue tam pattern corrected you 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.740
 you will not need to run this command 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.740
 according to the command 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.170
 and if this second command also does not 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.690
 solved the blue screen problem then the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.090
 way is you look for the tutorial or even 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.740
 even formatting your computer 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.470
 I also want to talk here about the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.440
 pdf file that I created talking 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.590
 on these two commands which is all 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.890
 tutorial that is written all over 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.290
 history will be written in this 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.690
 pdf file called solution 02 where we 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.580
 We'll talk more about these two 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 commands on the execution of decisions 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.300
 how silva is how you also download 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.900
 this file here for you to have a 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.560
 notion of what this common will do 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.020
 on your computer to run the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.620
 two commands you will need to open 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.130
 its cm long away 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.310
 administrative 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.670
 you will dictate cmd in the start menu 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.010
 is here to appear in this program 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.260
 that you have with the right mouse and 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.960
 come here to perform as administrator 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 to ask permission to run 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.560
 As managed you click yes and 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.310
 static acm of the call cm de abreu 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.930
 cmde is this directory which is disks and 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.060
 windows vista e 12 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.160
 if you execute the first command that 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.680
 the check said that the way it is 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.040
 here the check says it will only 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.410
 check this folder 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.900
 So it's time you return to these 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.920
 share all days and get here on the disc 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.890
 ce to where will check all speech and 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.280
 why is this because maybe the error of 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:34.060
 blue screen is not contained in the folder if 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.370
 so be in another folder 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.650
 So you and you have to make the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.230
 check all folders and check 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.560
 found on the disk that it was a 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.690
 system for you to come back 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.070
 these folders to arrive at a discursive 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.820
 will do twice edit ced 2 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.600
 points and gives in to have again cd of the points 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.080
 and India 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.810
 we are there on disk c where it will be 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.860
 executed the check command says that then 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:09.180
 you will type then check the c diskin 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.970
 points bar efector / hash 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.320
 who is it if that is not so for yes and 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.000
 he or she would not be able to 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.750
 run this command with your pc 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.580
 switched on 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.160
 you will have to restart your computer 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.010
 you will apply in s 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.919
 and gives enter what you will make you 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.800
 will restart your operating system if 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.830
 come here and see you start or 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:39.300
 restart the system and when you restart 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.440
 you will see that you are going to open a 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.060
 the cmdca is open and checking 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.610
 some files actually all the 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.800
 speech files I believe in 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.900
 about 35 minutes 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.300
 will finish your first check 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.039
 because you will check everything 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.220
 discourse will then depend on 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:04.530
 number of files you have in your 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:07.830
 disk if the second command that is the 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.590
 Escano where he gives also fixes the 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.870
 errors will leave the files 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.330
 insecurity system then for you 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.639
 run command will not be 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.510
 necessary you to use that for many 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:27.389
 and two points will not be necessary 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:30.539
 or will just type sfc space bar 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:33.210
 and give an enter will 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.190
 file verification 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.210
 then this process will take some 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.180
 minutes 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.370
 okay if completed about the also believe 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.050
 that is on my computer and about 25 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.889
 minutes now announces on your computer 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.330
 and to reach 100% and will end will 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.830
 ask you to restart your 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.539
 computer 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.990
 if you can not resolve any of the 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.300
 two 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.120
 I advise you to look for the tutorial
