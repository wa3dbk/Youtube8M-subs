00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
if you look at the front face how many

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.960 
if you look at the front face how many
exactly<00:00:03.120> two<00:00:03.480> side<00:00:03.720> cubes<00:00:03.990> do<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.200> have<00:00:04.970> you

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
exactly two side cubes do you have you

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.500 
exactly two side cubes do you have you
have<00:00:06.259> to<00:00:07.259> here<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:08.010> here<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.610> here<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.330> here

have to here to here to here to here
eight<00:00:10.280> similarly<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> back<00:00:11.670> side<00:00:11.969> you

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
eight similarly in the back side you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.940 
eight similarly in the back side you
have<00:00:12.300> eight<00:00:12.509> again<00:00:12.840> eight<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.349> front<00:00:13.710> eight

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
have eight again eight in front eight

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.540 
have eight again eight in front eight
behind<00:00:14.490> now<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.049> missed<00:00:16.289> any<00:00:16.529> 82<00:00:17.340> side

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
behind now have you missed any 82 side

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.179 
behind now have you missed any 82 side
in<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> side<00:00:17.970> or<00:00:18.150> something<00:00:18.740> yes<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.039> have

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
in the side or something yes you have

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.230 
in the side or something yes you have
missed<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.910> these<00:00:21.900> two<00:00:22.170> exactly<00:00:22.500> two<00:00:22.830> sides

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
missed this these two exactly two sides

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.830 
missed this these two exactly two sides
get<00:00:24.240> my<00:00:24.390> point

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
get my point

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.859 
get my point
so<00:00:25.260> four<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.460> there<00:00:26.789> here<00:00:29.840> four<00:00:30.840> here

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
so four that are there here four here

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.280 
so four that are there here four here
there<00:00:31.619> are<00:00:31.710> eight<00:00:31.949> behind<00:00:32.489> eight<00:00:32.880> ahead<00:00:33.570> for

8 16 16 + 4 xx xx + 4 10 4 cubes with
two<00:00:42.899> sides<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.219> continue<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.969> take<00:00:45.510> out

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
two sides you can continue this take out

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.260 
two sides you can continue this take out
all<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.260> outer<00:00:46.410> cubes<00:00:46.800> look<00:00:47.070> inside<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:48.120> will

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
all the outer cubes look inside you will

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
all the outer cubes look inside you will
find<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> inside<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
find that inside there there is a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.360 
find that inside there there is a
segment<00:00:53.210> inside<00:00:54.210> there<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> segment<00:00:58.370> which

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
segment inside there is a segment which

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.260 
segment inside there is a segment which
will<00:00:59.489> only<00:00:59.760> be<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> much<00:01:03.979> that<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.270> again

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
will only be this much that is again

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.289 
will only be this much that is again
which<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:06.900> no<00:01:07.380> color<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.210> will

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
which has no color at all you will

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.850 
which has no color at all you will
calculate<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:10.409> find<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
calculate that and you will find a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.240 
calculate that and you will find a
particular<00:01:11.670> number<00:01:11.850> -<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.360> also<00:01:12.659> okay<00:01:13.350> by

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
particular number - that also okay by

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.120 
particular number - that also okay by
removing<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.090> outer<00:01:15.180> cubes<00:01:16.130> question

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
removing all the outer cubes question

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.179 
removing all the outer cubes question
here<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.720> there<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.170> definite<00:01:19.680> pattern

cubes<00:02:51.250> are<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.490> making<00:02:51.840> three<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.650> not

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
cubes are you making three so it is not

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.210 
cubes are you making three so it is not
number<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.190> cuts<00:02:54.430> it's<00:02:54.640> number<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.000> quick<00:02:55.420> use

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220

okay<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.550> are<00:02:57.640> getting<00:02:57.880> in<00:02:58.090> one<00:02:58.270> side

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
okay that you are getting in one side

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.820 
okay that you are getting in one side
this<00:02:59.440> one<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:01.060> one<00:03:01.330> here<00:03:01.720> what<00:03:02.320> did<00:03:02.470> we<00:03:02.590> get

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
this one this one here what did we get

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.080 
this one this one here what did we get
we<00:03:03.730> had<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> cube<00:03:04.390> here<00:03:08.700> imagine<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.790> cube<00:03:10.000> is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
we had a cube here imagine the cube is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.070 
we had a cube here imagine the cube is
going<00:03:10.330> back<00:03:10.510> like<00:03:10.690> this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
going back like this

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.670 
going back like this
one<00:03:11.769> two<00:03:12.430> cuts<00:03:13.980> how<00:03:14.980> many<00:03:15.160> equal<00:03:15.430> one<00:03:15.790> two

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
one two cuts how many equal one two

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.590 
one two cuts how many equal one two
three<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:17.920> if<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.640> are<00:03:18.730> having<00:03:18.940> three<00:03:19.300> cuts

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
three if if you are having three cuts

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.390 
three if if you are having three cuts
what<00:03:19.870> happens<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.320> one<00:03:20.560> two<00:03:20.860> three<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:21.340> are

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
what happens is one two three you are

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.340 
what happens is one two three you are
having<00:03:21.519> one<00:03:21.850> two<00:03:22.150> three<00:03:22.480> four<00:03:22.840> obviously<00:03:23.290> you

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
having one two three four obviously you

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.860 
having one two three four obviously you
will<00:03:23.410> do<00:03:23.560> three<00:03:24.040> cuts<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:24.610> also<00:03:24.870> right

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
will do three cuts like this also right

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.330 
will do three cuts like this also right
