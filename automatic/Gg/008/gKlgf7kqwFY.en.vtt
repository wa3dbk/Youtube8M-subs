00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.540
 hello hello this video on the object 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.219
 at 140 new soviet st 10 level and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.520
 literally it is a live broadcast 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.350
 from the test server and where do I drive this 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.430
 tank is the first fight on this car I 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.859
 just purchased 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.930
 try to get used to her feelings 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 It looks like ours for a deuce although there are some 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.519
 differences would say that the dynamics of the car 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.500
 better though she turns with 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.899
 some delay some replay glitch 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 here a little bit back and forth 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.370
 decided to jump let's look at 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.879
 tank silhouette he is much lower than 60 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.790
 two 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.680
 here is such a flat front 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.920
 his upper armor plate is located under 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.079
 and to the best elbow anna prina 2 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.020
 millimeter less but in theory it should 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.180
 give more bounce 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 rolls out the French batt punch 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.949
 and 330 of course is not enough to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.750
 punch him we are literally bred 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.969
 it turns out all sides and so here 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.270
 will end the life of an average tank usually 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.590
 on a test server very, very fast 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.450
 on the right glow from the twenty percent 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.790
 already 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.200
 american tank who's there then hiking in 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.600
 the world and roll out two Fri-shki here I 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.350
 I get my tank caterpillar can not 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.820
 get used to 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.090
 vertical guidance angles like 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.969
 get him something 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.310
 but, anyway, the gun doesn’t fall well 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.939
 three more artillery, I understand that in general 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.439
 Case of rubbish under lizki bad angles 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.630
 Vertical pickup is bad 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.860
 punch the bag now finally 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 leaves as i wanted to shoot a mask and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 pattona punches me with data 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.570
 besides interesting corpus that she doesn't 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.340
 broke through but these see no practically 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.049
 punched in the mask you will understand what to shoot 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.659
 Blue Drive it I don’t remember 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.899
 My husband for two I punched the area around 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.390
 masks well, I can't remember shooting at me 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.460
 art I start to roll back 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.560
 extra damage and also picked it up 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.290
 here already with interest our tank turns this 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.289
 glorious object object 263 and I therefore 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.660
 I can calmly shoot highlander corners 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.190
 no here i wanted to shoot at the bottom 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.500
 bronelist his gun did not fall 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.440
 so I didn’t get a poet where in the caterpillar 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.770
 very honestly there is no health 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.980
 drive on a similar tanks well, in principle 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.530
 play comfortably enough turns 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.810
 he is worse than 60 deuce and so 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.070
 noticeably similar but at maximum 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.380
 speed and in general in principle 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.200
 cross-country terrain I would say that 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.780
 he is similar to 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.030
 t-54 and in this regard it looks more like 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.489
 t-54 than t-62a, we have 73 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.070
 becomes it becomes this is not counter 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.600
 the battle is an assault though very strange hyper 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.489
 You are celebrated by the well known bug test 8-8 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.130
 disabled assault modes head-on 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.810
 you will still get cards with 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.150
 these modes I hope that the developers 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.280
 quickly fix it all because 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.239
 honestly the number of bugs that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.989
 now is in the test rolls 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.120
 let's see where the enemy artillery 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.280
 somewhere there should be apparently 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.320
 far I could not leave it here 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.500
 it is lit shoot literally go not 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.680
 their geese stabilization is excellent 317 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.800
 punch but british kang ji 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.050
 with shoots back remember and deals 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.550
 I can damage the gun criticizes me but it does not 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.070
 bothers me with two shots 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.800
 with good stabilization go to 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.980
 hangar remains the enemy three tanks still 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.320
 poteshka this foch 155 they are concentrated 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.130
 somewhere around our base a little bit 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.800
 rewind 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.410
 nothing interesting happens in 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.050
 principle fight standards left there 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.520
 traveled postrelyayte absolutely ride 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.620
 no her legs under attack 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.690
 preview whatever that of 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.960
 I imagine myself there I can 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.760
 say dpm he has exactly the same 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.370
 what we have on t-62 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.800
 what is its advantage in quality 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.230
 saying did not understand the speakers a little better 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.780
 armor supposedly also better but the tower 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.180
 controversial tower controversial because there is 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.019
 two very large knobs if t-62 them 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.230
 land very difficult then on site 140 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.330
 These glitches are very, very large. 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.480
 even if you try somehow 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.880
 way to tank the tower people will 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.400
 this obstacle is not very pleasant 5 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.430
 the whole procedure and here I look he 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.890
 guess foch 155 them take it 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.690
 there was a nezhdanchik at the end of the battle on the result 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.860
 look we will not be more interesting to see you 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.860
 next time everyone bye
