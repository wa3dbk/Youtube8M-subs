 Dermatologist of Lima Peru editor of the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.450
 weapon peru.com website today 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.419
 I want to help you with some tips 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.820
 about what the use is or how it should be done 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.070
 the use of cosmetics to roses and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.770
 we know that people who have 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.040
 Rosacea should edit everything 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.540
 hot foods or drinks because the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.080
 steam production redness 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.320
 skin the liquor cigar 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.329
 changes from a place where there is an air 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.519
 conditioning has to be gradual 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.719

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:49.589
 I suggest you use products that do not 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.179
 have more than 10 ingredients and use 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.339

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.839

 whatever they have in saved 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.530

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.230

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.910
