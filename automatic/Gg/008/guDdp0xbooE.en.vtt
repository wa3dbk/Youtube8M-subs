00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.290
 submission of a dictionary of a single person 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.680
 in the composition on the quality of their 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.680
 Russian teams 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.240
 I do not know any of the coaches would have worked 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.669
 scoop but also in russia abroad who is 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.769
 dad bad word victor kaka man 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.349
 and his footballers were impacted with great 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.880
 warmly responds 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 hitting the 2nd quarter a huge amount 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 her friends and buddies are all 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.649
 a little so warm are 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.130
 children 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.579
 the most professional 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.409
 capital not only as a footballer 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.270
 only for man 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.580
 such a professional 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.350
 but maybe such a defender all the same 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.640
 aphorism of course professionals if 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.980
 did not want to win 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.150
 but such a central 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.560
 quarterback can be in the first half 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.280
 locomotive is not always enough its cold 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.060
 heading the desire of the young population 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.150
 you play correctly positionally in those 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.530
 episodes when the attack developed costs with 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.170
 the heat of the rival's web veb 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.390
 three times in the role of sobolev zadornov associate professor 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.450
 twice 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.320
 One-on-one Medvedev showed 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.480
 Video has one time 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.160
 kindness goalie 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.770
 squares left undisguised mark up 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.100
 1000 which 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.280
 and opened an account 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.180
 for the presidency 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.500
 so 1 1 nothing is clear yet most popular 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.670
 scores matches when these teams are 2 thousand 4 pages 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.040
 brought themselves 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.070
 fights just such a result was 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.730
 fixed but one more 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.810
 at least 45 minutes to play the team 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.310
 progressed 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.060
 the meeting opened now 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.060
 keywords 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.010
 here is kirichenko grischenko believes that 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.649
 Levenets broke the rules 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.569
 I have to be assigned 1 100 meter 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.729
 just like in the fall cases 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.080
 Bilyaletdinov 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.490
 the arbitrator does not respond to this and considers 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.510
 what 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.730
 in this case 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.470
 reasons for penalty or not 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.620
 let's see passports good 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 broadcast 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.010
 look again 100 thousand 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.830
 not one they know what is kirichenko 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.010
 displeased all the same rain with above all 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.010
 played the ball and then by inertia 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.869
 Telichenko but this is absolutely 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:23.939
 game episode and no write off 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.689
 no breaking the rules would be bad 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.529
 putting another person on trial 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.719
 dedication is more than what a 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.669
 dedication dedication 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.829
 can not refuse a very brave guy 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.319
 always rushes 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.259
 this period is never my hands 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.359
 honestly 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.619
 seen in rare cases like water 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:45.619
 look at the lead amount 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.229
 but just in case, first 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.619
 he came to attack the gate 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:55.859
 now earns 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.469
 Libyan net nets 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.199
 rushed forward hands risk 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.199
 get damaged which is total and 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.499
 got a new abbass from their gates so 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:04.119
 the most highlight
