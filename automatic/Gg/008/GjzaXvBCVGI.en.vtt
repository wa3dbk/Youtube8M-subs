00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.420 
we won't have a shadow or a dark part of
the<00:02:23.209> fabric<00:02:23.390> showing<00:02:23.870> through<00:02:24.140> now<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.190> want

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
the fabric showing through now we want

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.660 
the fabric showing through now we want
to<00:02:25.550> press<00:02:25.849> this<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.050> that's<00:02:27.230> nice<00:02:27.760> crease<00:02:29.230> and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
to press this so that's nice crease and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.160 
to press this so that's nice crease and
we<00:02:31.670> need<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:32.000> work<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> next<00:02:32.930> line

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
we need to work with the next line

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.199 
we need to work with the next line
between<00:02:33.680> one<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.160> next<00:02:34.640> biggest<00:02:34.940> number

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
between one and the next biggest number

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.490 
between one and the next biggest number
which<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.510> three<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:35.810> we're<00:02:36.019> going<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.170> crease

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
which is three and we're going to crease

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.699 
which is three and we're going to crease
that<00:02:36.769> line<00:02:37.150> between<00:02:38.150> those<00:02:38.690> two<00:02:39.080> areas<00:02:39.290> and

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
that line between those two areas and

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.910 
that line between those two areas and
that<00:02:40.130> will<00:02:40.280> transfer<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.849> location<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
that will transfer the location to the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.030 
that will transfer the location to the
fabric<00:02:43.430> side<00:02:43.670> where<00:02:44.239> there's<00:02:44.390> no<00:02:44.540> print<00:02:45.040> we're

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
fabric side where there's no print we're

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.600 
fabric side where there's no print we're
going<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.450> put<00:02:47.450> number<00:02:48.140> three<00:02:48.170> fabric<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.580> that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
going to put number three fabric so that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.030 
going to put number three fabric so that
it<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.209> quarter<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:50.989> an<00:02:51.080> inch<00:02:51.200> past<00:02:51.680> that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
it is a quarter of an inch past that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.780 
it is a quarter of an inch past that
line<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.260> crease<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.709> here<00:02:55.010> we're<00:02:55.700> going

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
line so the crease is here we're going

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.759 
line so the crease is here we're going
to<00:02:55.880> turn<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.120> over<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:57.230> we're<00:02:57.350> going<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.500> sew

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
to turn it over and we're going to sew

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.150 
to turn it over and we're going to sew
on<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.760> line<00:02:59.049> notice<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.500> doesn't<00:03:00.799> have<00:03:01.040> to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
on that line notice it doesn't have to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.180 
on that line notice it doesn't have to
be<00:03:01.280> straight<00:03:01.580> cut<00:03:02.200> because<00:03:03.200> it's<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.739> sewing

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
be straight cut because it's the sewing

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.789 
be straight cut because it's the sewing
that's<00:03:04.640> going<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.060> define<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:06.549> line<00:03:08.799> again

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
that's going to define that line again

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.530 
that's going to define that line again
we<00:03:09.980> trimmed<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.730> extra<00:03:11.090> out<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.299> seam

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
we trimmed the extra out of the seam

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.770 
we trimmed the extra out of the seam
undercutting<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.349> dark<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:14.239> then<00:03:14.360> we<00:03:14.450> open

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
undercutting the dark and then we open

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.560 
undercutting the dark and then we open
it<00:03:14.870> up<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.650> we'll<00:03:15.799> cover<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.849> next<00:03:17.120> area

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
it up and we'll cover that next area

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.550 
it up and we'll cover that next area
that's<00:03:18.470> basic<00:03:19.160> foundation<00:03:19.730> PC<00:03:20.320> next<00:03:21.320> on<00:03:21.440> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
that's basic foundation PC next on the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.229 
that's basic foundation PC next on the
same<00:03:21.799> pattern<00:03:22.190> we'll<00:03:22.579> show<00:03:22.790> how<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.090> add

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
same pattern we'll show how to add

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.190 
same pattern we'll show how to add
dimension<00:03:23.840> by<00:03:24.530> adding<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.010> wings
