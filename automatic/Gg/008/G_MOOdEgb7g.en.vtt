00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
minute with Elliot and I go and get a

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:38.510 
minute with Elliot and I go and get a
goal<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.890> i'm<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.219> show<00:01:38.310> too

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
goal there i'm not going to show too

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.709 
goal there i'm not going to show too
much<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> game<00:01:39.210> i'm<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.539> to<00:01:39.600> show

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
much about the game i'm going to show

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.690 
much about the game i'm going to show
the<00:01:39.869> goals<00:01:40.109> and<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:41.039> course<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.429> can<00:01:41.549> probably

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the goals and of course you can probably

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.789 
the goals and of course you can probably
guess<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.179> did<00:01:42.420> win<00:01:42.659> actually<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> it's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
guess that he did win actually and it's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.020 
guess that he did win actually and it's
a<00:01:43.859> pretty<00:01:44.009> funny<00:01:44.280> match<00:01:44.490> you'll<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.909> he

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
a pretty funny match you'll see that he

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.179 
a pretty funny match you'll see that he
goes<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.359> scores<00:01:45.600> next<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:46.229> matt<00:01:46.530> three<00:01:46.799> who

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
goes and scores next with matt three who

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.469 
goes and scores next with matt three who
was<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.609> pretty<00:01:47.789> strong<00:01:48.000> strike<00:01:48.329> in

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
was actually a pretty strong strike in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.730 
was actually a pretty strong strike in
the<00:01:48.659> game<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.170> he<00:01:49.229> goes<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.530> scores

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the game and then he goes and scores

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.169 
the game and then he goes and scores
again<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.429> header<00:01:50.670> off<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> crossbar

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
again with a header off the crossbar

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.359 
again with a header off the crossbar
with<00:01:51.570> ogbonna<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:52.560> i<00:01:52.829> will<00:01:53.039> go<00:01:53.219> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
with ogbonna and then i will go and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.340 
with ogbonna and then i will go and
actually<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:53.850> goal<00:01:54.179> here<00:01:54.479> running<00:01:55.200> along

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
actually get a goal here running along

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.080 
actually get a goal here running along
with<00:01:55.469> royce<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.859> think<00:01:56.009> I'd<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> berber<00:01:56.789> spin

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
with royce I think I'd do a berber spin

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
with royce I think I'd do a berber spin
past<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.539> goal<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.990> past<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.679> defender

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
past the goal and past the defender

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.520 
past the goal and past the defender
