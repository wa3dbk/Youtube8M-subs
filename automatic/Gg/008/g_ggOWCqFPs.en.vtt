be careful so I'm going to put it on
walls<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.660> things<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.959> still<00:02:15.230> recommend<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.950> is

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
walls and things I still recommend it is

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.820 
walls and things I still recommend it is
good<00:02:16.280> on<00:02:16.430> paint<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:16.849> fine<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.180> dry<00:02:17.270> well<00:02:17.569> but

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
good on paint it's fine and dry well but

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.110 
good on paint it's fine and dry well but
test<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:19.040> first<00:02:19.310> if<00:02:19.610> you're<00:02:19.700> using<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.060> in

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
test it first if you're using it in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.270 
test it first if you're using it in
metal<00:02:20.420> mask<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:21.020> old<00:02:21.319> paint<00:02:21.650> or<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.160> know

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
metal mask because old paint or you know

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.550 
metal mask because old paint or you know
lesser<00:02:23.209> quality<00:02:23.480> paint<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.110> could<00:02:24.290> come<00:02:24.440> off

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
lesser quality paint it could come off

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.960 
lesser quality paint it could come off
so<00:02:24.709> test<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.130> doing<00:02:25.310> something<00:02:25.519> big<00:02:25.670> but

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
so test you to doing something big but

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.940 
so test you to doing something big but
otherwise<00:02:26.300> go<00:02:26.510> nuts<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.900> how<00:02:27.230> about<00:02:27.470> throw<00:02:27.920> a
