little bit more high quality that's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
little bit more high quality that's
mainly<00:01:22.650> due<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.310> ridges<00:01:23.790> running<00:01:24.060> along

lining these two up you can definitely

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
lining these two up you can definitely

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
single core GPU definitely not the most

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.710 
single core GPU definitely not the most
powerful<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.540> definitely

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
powerful thing but I was definitely

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990 
powerful thing but I was definitely
