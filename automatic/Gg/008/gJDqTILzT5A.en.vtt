hi<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.560> mark<00:00:01.800> Medina<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:03.330> making<00:00:03.750> this

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
hi I'm mark Medina and I'm making this

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.170 
hi I'm mark Medina and I'm making this
video<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.230> show<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.490> differences<00:00:05.970> between

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
video to show the differences between

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.299 
video to show the differences between
the<00:00:06.600> two<00:00:06.810> different<00:00:06.990> intakes<00:00:07.529> used<00:00:07.830> on<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the two different intakes used on the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.129 
the two different intakes used on the
4-h<00:00:09.110> Toyota<00:00:10.110> engine<00:00:10.500> used<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> mr2<00:00:12.139> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
4-h Toyota engine used in the mr2 the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.829 
4-h Toyota engine used in the mr2 the
original<00:00:13.650> intake<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.330> what

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
original intake is this one the what

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.950 
original intake is this one the what
they<00:00:15.960> call<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.289> T<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.740> intake<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.779> you<00:00:18.779> can

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
they call the T this intake and you can

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.470 
they call the T this intake and you can
see<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.320> eight<00:00:19.590> runners<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.340> feed<00:00:20.609> four

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
see the eight runners that feed four

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.960 
see the eight runners that feed four
cylinders<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> engine<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.800> has<00:00:23.640> eight

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
cylinders in the engine it has eight

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.870 
cylinders in the engine it has eight
runners<00:00:24.210> because<00:00:24.680> one<00:00:25.680> runner<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.519> each

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
runners because one runner for each

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.960 
runners because one runner for each
cylinder<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.960> blocked<00:00:28.410> off<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:28.830> low<00:00:28.949> rpm<00:00:29.429> by

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
cylinder is blocked off at low rpm by

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.350 
cylinder is blocked off at low rpm by
this<00:00:30.029> Tevas<00:00:30.689> plate<00:00:31.520> it<00:00:32.520> looks<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.149> when

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
this Tevas plate it looks like that when

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.510 
this Tevas plate it looks like that when
it's<00:00:33.510> closed<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.290> then<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.680> high<00:00:34.829> rpm<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it's closed and then at high rpm and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.950 
it's closed and then at high rpm and
under<00:00:35.790> load<00:00:36.469> these<00:00:37.469> open<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.780> get

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
under load these open so that you get

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.979 
under load these open so that you get
full<00:00:40.410> flow<00:00:40.739> through<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.280> eight<00:00:41.460> holes<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.180> lot

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
full flow through all eight holes a lot

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.110 
full flow through all eight holes a lot
of<00:00:43.050> people<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.129> say<00:00:44.340> oh<00:00:44.670> gee

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
of people look at this and say oh gee

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
of people look at this and say oh gee
those<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.170> big<00:00:46.410> holes<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.860> must<00:00:47.070> flow

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
those are some big holes it must flow

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.810 
those are some big holes it must flow
very<00:00:47.640> well<00:00:48.289> the<00:00:49.289> problem<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:52.070> on<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.489> side<00:00:53.789> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
very well the problem is on this side of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.450 
very well the problem is on this side of
the<00:00:54.090> intake<00:00:55.190> where<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> casting

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.609 

there<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> problem<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:04.110> runners<00:01:04.470> are

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
there is the problem the runners are

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.859 
there is the problem the runners are
real<00:01:04.799> nice<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.270> far

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
real nice for about this far

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.230 
real nice for about this far
and<00:01:08.360> after<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.979> they<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.460> section<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and after that they this section is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.630 
and after that they this section is
extremely<00:01:12.570> narrow<00:01:14.750> this<00:01:15.750> casting<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.680> about

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
extremely narrow this casting is about

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880 
extremely narrow this casting is about
3/8<00:01:18.119> thick<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.659> between<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> port<00:01:19.619> walls

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
3/8 thick in between the port walls

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.840 
3/8 thick in between the port walls
which<00:01:20.759> means<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.299> whole<00:01:21.509> area<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.850> all

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
which means this whole area here is all

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
which means this whole area here is all
filled<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.380> actually<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.070> small<00:01:26.400> in

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
filled in and it's actually so small in

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.249 
filled in and it's actually so small in
this<00:01:26.759> area<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.930> my<00:01:28.680> pinkie<00:01:29.750> barely<00:01:30.750> fits<00:01:31.049> in

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
this area that my pinkie barely fits in

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.030 
this area that my pinkie barely fits in
between<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> while<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.380> looks<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.860> you've

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
between so while it looks like you've

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.179 
between so while it looks like you've
got<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.520> lot<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.759> flow<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.229> this

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
got a lot of flow down here in this

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.380 
got a lot of flow down here in this
curve<00:01:40.189> which<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> large<00:01:41.700> section<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
curve which is a large section of the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.620 
curve which is a large section of the
intake<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.740> actually<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:44.729> poor<00:01:45.180> flow

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
intake you actually have very poor flow

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
intake you actually have very poor flow
I<00:01:46.009> don't<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.670> really<00:01:47.850> look

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
I don't think that I can really look

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.120 
I don't think that I can really look
inside<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:50.149> I'm<00:01:51.149> gonna<00:01:51.329> try<00:01:52.130> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
inside here very much I'm gonna try you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.910 
inside here very much I'm gonna try you
can<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.729> rectangular<00:01:54.360> shape<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
can see that rectangular shape of the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840 
can see that rectangular shape of the
openings<00:01:56.689> that's<00:01:57.689> about<00:01:58.469> twice<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> opening

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
openings that's about twice the opening

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.539 
openings that's about twice the opening
that<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.210> actually<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.990> once<00:02:01.860> you're<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that you actually get once you're in the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.850 
that you actually get once you're in the
curved<00:02:02.850> part<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> manifold<00:02:04.469> right<00:02:04.680> down

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
curved part of the manifold right down

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100 
curved part of the manifold right down
here

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
here

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.830 
here
now<00:02:08.110> by<00:02:08.650> contrast<00:02:11.460> this<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:12.840> modified

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
now by contrast this is a modified

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.000 
now by contrast this is a modified
version<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:15.610> small<00:02:15.910> port<00:02:16.210> intake<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
version of a small port intake I

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.350 
version of a small port intake I
modified<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.670> could<00:02:18.850> bolt<00:02:19.090> on

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
modified this so that it could bolt on

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.380 
modified this so that it could bolt on
to<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.260> big<00:02:20.470> port<00:02:20.770> head<00:02:21.070> without<00:02:21.790> having<00:02:22.300> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
to the big port head without having a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.470 
to the big port head without having a
vacuum<00:02:22.780> leak<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.290> did<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.310> by<00:02:24.550> filling<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.360> in

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
vacuum leak I did that by filling it in

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.100 
vacuum leak I did that by filling it in
with<00:02:25.540> epoxy<00:02:26.020> as<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.590> can<00:02:26.770> see<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:31.110> that's

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
with epoxy as you can see and that's

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.110 
with epoxy as you can see and that's
what<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.470> bottom<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.040> looks<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:33.340> it's

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
what the bottom of it looks like it's

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.320 
what the bottom of it looks like it's
not<00:02:34.330> real<00:02:34.510> pretty<00:02:34.810> but<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.650> worked<00:02:36.330> didn't

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
not real pretty but it worked didn't

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.020 
not real pretty but it worked didn't
have<00:02:37.480> any<00:02:37.600> problems<00:02:38.080> with<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.650> as<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.880> can

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
have any problems with it and as you can

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.210 
have any problems with it and as you can
see<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.600> whole<00:02:43.840> area<00:02:44.230> would<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:44.980> all<00:02:45.190> been

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
see this whole area would have all been

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.390 
see this whole area would have all been
wide<00:02:45.640> open<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.620> engine<00:02:47.920> would<00:02:48.100> not<00:02:48.130> have

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
wide open and the engine would not have

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.060 
wide open and the engine would not have
run<00:02:49.020> now<00:02:50.020> if<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.260> look<00:02:50.410> at<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.650> two<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:50.830> these

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
run now if you look at the two of these

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.310 
run now if you look at the two of these
side-by-side<00:02:53.280> turn<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.400> upside<00:02:54.790> down<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.390> we

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
side-by-side turn it upside down so we

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.600 
side-by-side turn it upside down so we
have<00:02:56.440> them<00:02:56.590> nice<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:56.800> close<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.310> each<00:02:57.430> other

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
have them nice and close to each other

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.680 
have them nice and close to each other
you<00:02:59.730> can<00:03:00.730> see<00:03:00.910> there's<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.240> pretty<00:03:01.450> big

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
you can see there's a pretty big

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.000 
you can see there's a pretty big
difference<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.770> width<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.400> ports

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
difference in the width of the ports

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.920 
difference in the width of the ports
well<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.250> can<00:03:06.400> also<00:03:06.520> see<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.030> from<00:03:07.420> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
well you can also see that from the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.040 
well you can also see that from the
gasket<00:03:08.380> markings<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:10.060> my<00:03:10.900> modified<00:03:11.350> version

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
gasket markings on my modified version

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.400 
gasket markings on my modified version
but<00:03:14.459> what<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.640> do<00:03:15.850> get<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.840> small<00:03:17.080> cord

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
but what you do get in the small cord

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.760 
but what you do get in the small cord
intake<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:20.070> only<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.340> 90<00:03:21.610> degree<00:03:22.150> turn<00:03:22.770> instead

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
intake is only a 90 degree turn instead

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.720 
intake is only a 90 degree turn instead
of<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:27.780> turn<00:03:28.780> where<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.620> runners<00:03:29.920> go<00:03:30.100> backwards

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
of a turn where the runners go backwards

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.780 
of a turn where the runners go backwards
and<00:03:31.000> then<00:03:31.270> turn<00:03:31.540> forward<00:03:31.930> again<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.480> also<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
and then turn forward again and also a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.979 
and then turn forward again and also a
small<00:03:36.790> port<00:03:37.090> intake<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:39.390> wish<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.630> could<00:03:40.810> see

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
small port intake I wish you could see

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.190 
small port intake I wish you could see
in<00:03:41.170> there<00:03:41.380> better<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:46.570> can<00:03:46.600> tell<00:03:46.959> by<00:03:46.989> the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
in there better but you can tell by the

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.310 
in there better but you can tell by the
back<00:03:47.910> again<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.060> have<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:49.420> same<00:03:49.690> large

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
back again you have that same large

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.699 
back again you have that same large
casting<00:03:50.980> split<00:03:51.310> down<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.520> center<00:03:52.050> but<00:03:53.050> you're

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
casting split down the center but you're

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.640 
casting split down the center but you're
only<00:03:53.890> talking<00:03:54.160> about<00:03:54.930> four<00:03:55.930> runners<00:03:56.350> not

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
only talking about four runners not

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.460 
only talking about four runners not
eight<00:03:57.570> so<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:59.340> actual<00:04:00.340> volume<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:02.080> runner

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
eight so the actual volume of the runner

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.240 
eight so the actual volume of the runner
through<00:04:02.830> here<00:04:03.340> is<00:04:04.470> almost<00:04:05.470> two<00:04:05.800> fingers<00:04:06.250> wide

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
through here is almost two fingers wide

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.699 
through here is almost two fingers wide
so<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:10.030> makes<00:04:10.300> it<00:04:10.600> let's<00:04:11.350> see<00:04:11.620> here
