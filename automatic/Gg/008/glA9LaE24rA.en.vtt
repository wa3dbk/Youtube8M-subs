 Ministry of Education for the reform of the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.240
 trough

 because that's the tray it's no matter 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.179
 what in time for example the books on 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.000
 do not say that is to say at least fifteen 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.220
 migrants terminal 15 books real voice 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.939
 well you chose your fifteen 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.019
 heroes oh yes yes to kindergarten where 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.689

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:39.930
 took a tintin after yes yes at the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.940
 whores the plastic will need to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.870
 inspiration you see there is nothing to 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 inspire us in the ordeal of a 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 plastic will take a trick so before you 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.890
 start your sketches we'll all 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.110
 to sink a bigjean could too much 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 that you have the flaws in your 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.300
 right and confession to your left you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.890
 you will nevertheless note on your collage 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:05.909
 you have to roll to the Dutch it's 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 to say the callas lemberg but I arrive 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.369
 not the mickey band my opinion this is the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.950
 last week i'm super suck 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:20.520
 the damn ma'am but what ever 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.140
 inspired and it would be necessary that the test of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.580
 philo be right after the first 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.479
 plastics like that we're always 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.979
 smashed when we arrive in philo michael 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.490
 can you give us an analysis this is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.720
 the phrase 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.060
 to be or not to be such is the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.540
 matter of fact we shakespeare 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.460
 shakespeare it really if it existed 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.490
 new professions as institute circulate 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.710
 on itself and in fact it's because 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.670
 referent of the coup he is afraid to leave the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.670
 vagina of his mother so 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.800
 ah yes you see it should be improved 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.180
 teachers of ps too because you have to be 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.540
 honest run around like this it's 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.310
 shit 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.820
 moreover it's all the more will love me finally 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.740
 duke shits not should 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.490
 as for the ps also for the test 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.540
 should we be like when you said 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.890
 already there for the plastic inspiration 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:19.060
 the inspiration for the ps it would take 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:24.640
 we have inspiration 15 minutes 25 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.040
 seconds and 33 hundredths good month for 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.360
 the story I would see something that 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.400
 we immerse a little more in what 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.830
 happened you see like we could 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 do like the Americans it's in 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.740
 the series when they make 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.040
 historical representations and where aulas 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.640
 a pirate have beaten the mutate a boosted 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.660
 you me I just have a stick yes and no 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:57.400
 but we just have to say that your stick 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:58.540
 is magic yes I was a cons 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.230
 for asb and and I am not 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.709
 arrived or to waimes also to you think that 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.650
 I think 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.720
 we are not close enough to animals 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.320
 will have to raise animals to study the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.320
 animal psychology and all yes 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.320
 exactly 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.590
 that's what you thought a little bit of 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.240
 things close then today 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.880
 excluding sex education 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.880
 for number one to tone 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:48.790
 alright then the maths down and mat the maths 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:49.959
 it's like physics beats them 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.359
 will be able to do what we want for a 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.799
 game but the improved not yeah actually you 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.099
 for good reason we will not always understand 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.099
 nothing
