00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:12.030
 every goal requires a great effort 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.030
 for me 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.099
 to get to the top you have to 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.099
 make sacrifices 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.660
 but not 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.230
 to succeed you have to sweat 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.230
 work to improve you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.030
 to be the best you must know yourself 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.300
 same know your strength and overcome your 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.300
 weaknesses 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.579
 to be a champion you must hold the 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.579
 reproaches 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.760
 we believe that an ornament 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.610
 as a child 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.820
 he hammocks in the same 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.280
 to be great is to take one step after another 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.680
 travel the road every day without rest 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.680
 without failing to be great is not having it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.600
 all being great is having lost it and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.600
 have the courage to recover it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.289
 being great is not always walking in 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.289
 straight line 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.300
 to be great to fall once two fall 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.570
 times falling three times fall a thousand times if 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.570
 it takes 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.619
 because only when you've looked at the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.040
 defeat the eyes only when you know that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.040
 you are weak 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.420
 is when pride and the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.420
 rage that makes you get the glory 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.830
 to be great is to listen to those who 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.830
 they support because they are your livelihood 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.720
 greatness is not measured by victories 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.650
 but for the courage not to give up 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.650
 never
