00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 in this tutorial we see how to play 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.189
 every breath you take the police doing 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.440
 a slightly simplified version mi 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.200
 explain instead of playing it is in face 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
 starting from an agreement made greater 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.130
 as would be the original you are a mistake 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.890
 or at least I had not been taught 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 so we play it starting from a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.700
 added agreement to stay and act as 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.370
 play all chords 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.520
 in first position without going to 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.930
 get tangled up with overly complicated bars 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.960
 moreover, it is also much easier 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.110
 sing it in this shade at least for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.110
 myself 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.059
 so we'll have something like this 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 sea 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.090
 no 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.130
 internally then you can go to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.130
 support this way 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.930
 you can support it in the manner that 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.610
 prefer not to be here to explain 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.650
 the mountain pasture everyone does what he wants 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.650
 in the sense that everyone can find the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.810
 painting that he prefers he can do 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.580
 same as the original or can do 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.930
 slightly different or completely 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.960
 different can do it with an approach 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.820
 strambi that this would be I do to you 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.530
 see only the agreements then 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.600
 the agreement in the first part are in 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.360
 this case in our major case 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.470
 a sort of lesser minority like us 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.980
 we add ourselves 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.850
 little finger first key third rate 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.320
 before the sun rope 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.320
 third of his second string 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:13.500
 siena in a after with after the addition of 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.500
 I work in here and here 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.210
 torremaggiore I have always achieved this 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.900
 package 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.900
 run rabbit 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.400
 no 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.150
 Yes, yes 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.730
 nic 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.519
 so I basically played after 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.450
 this agreement is the biggest one I don't like 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.730
 is the major 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:13.790
 then the refrain or rather the bridge 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.790
 would not that what you 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.630
 this would be a la 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.620
 choosing little finger then 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.880
 already this agreement here 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.680
 el sheikh 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.680
 r major and then restart 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.610
 and so on 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.580
 at this point the beautiful comes 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:55.910
 engraved ie the song changes 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:04:13.810
 completely and in our case it goes in mi 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:15.800
 B flat major 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.790
 easy 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.260
 instead of doing it on a stretcher 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.150
 stopping first and sixth string if 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.010
 this time the stop with the middle finger 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.010
 first time stopped an index finger 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.630
 Well 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.379
 obviously 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.870
 ancient so much to do right for 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.330
 make you understand how to give a damn 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.630
 if I do it where I say I don't care 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.370
 anything 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.449
 this tutorial so the purpose is 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.130
 simply to show the 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.979
 agreements certainly not that of performing 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.250
 sing good for what are mine 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.699
 what's this 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.789
 indeed if you want it went to see on mine 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.440
 channel there are various playlists I would have 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.490
 the rial institute is the playlist you will have me 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.780
 the covers playlist is original 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.039
 so just go and see in 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.630
 click on that fanelli sense like 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.940
 see my performance where of course 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.490
 I try so to speak to sing in 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.250
 much less decent 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.030
 these are tutorials so the important thing 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.849
 that's when the message arrives and that's it 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:38.830
 I repeat it again 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:40.229
 B flat major equals milano di 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.000
 new on the G major 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.800
 that's how much fun to listen to 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.349
 the song discarded even more 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.710
 version will certainly be useful and 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:53.849
 try to do it also in this shade 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.849
 simplified see you still served
