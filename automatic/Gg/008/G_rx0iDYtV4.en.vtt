presented by Party W constituency in
this<00:00:17.699> video<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:18.810> going<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> take<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> look

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
this video we are going to take a look

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.310 
this video we are going to take a look
at<00:00:20.279> how<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> create<00:00:21.590> hierarchies<00:00:22.670> in<00:00:23.670> tab<00:00:23.970> view

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
at how to create hierarchies in tab view

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.310 
at how to create hierarchies in tab view
hierarchies<00:00:26.480> also<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.630> will<00:00:27.810> see<00:00:27.990> how<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
hierarchies also we will see how to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
hierarchies also we will see how to
extract<00:00:28.859> data<00:00:29.730> from<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:31.610> source<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:35.239> store

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
extract data from the source and store

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.530 
extract data from the source and store
it<00:00:36.420> inside<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.500> TV<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.520> TB<00:00:38.850> e<00:00:38.879> which<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.210> tab

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it inside the TV the TB e which is tab

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.479 
it inside the TV the TB e which is tab
we<00:00:39.690> extract<00:00:40.050> file<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:41.329> use<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.629> for<00:00:43.489> faster

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
we extract file and use that for faster

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.740 
we extract file and use that for faster
response<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.450> reports<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.329> in<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
response time in reports so in this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
response time in reports so in this
video<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.110> will<00:00:49.260> learn<00:00:49.410> three<00:00:49.829> things<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
video you will learn three things the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.260 
video you will learn three things the
first<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.559> how<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> create<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> hierarchy<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
first is how to create a hierarchy the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
first is how to create a hierarchy the
second<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> how<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> extract<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> data<00:00:56.190> from

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
second is how to extract the data from

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.599 
second is how to extract the data from
tableau<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.180> how<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> switch<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.250> source<00:00:59.489> of

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
tableau and how to switch the source of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.799 
tableau and how to switch the source of
connection<00:01:00.059> from<00:01:01.010> tableau<00:01:02.010> extract<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:03.570> live

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
connection from tableau extract to live

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.289 
connection from tableau extract to live
data<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.379> back<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.590> let's<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.770> started<00:01:08.189> so

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.340 

here<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.320> Left<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:14.760> department<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
here on the Left I have department and a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.630 
here on the Left I have department and a
manager<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.700> falsi<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.840> creates<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
manager it's falsi it creates a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.359 
manager it's falsi it creates a
hierarchy<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.330> department<00:01:21.869> have

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
hierarchy so what department have

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.420 
hierarchy so what department have
multiple<00:01:24.259> right<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:26.930> I'll<00:01:27.930> put<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:29.130> manner

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
multiple right so I'll put this manner

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.990 
multiple right so I'll put this manner
just<00:01:29.729> drag<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.390> manager<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.680> drop<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.189> in

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
just drag this manager and drop it in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
just drag this manager and drop it in
the<00:01:33.180> department<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.680> create

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the department you can see create

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:45.639 
the department you can see create
hierarchy<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.700> will<00:01:36.299> say<00:01:36.479> equal<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:39.680> hierarchy

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.109 

and<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> hierarchy<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.369> Department

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and the hierarchy you have Department

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.020 
and the hierarchy you have Department
and<00:01:48.299> manager<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.920> also<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.630> employee

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and manager you can also have employee

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.569 
and manager you can also have employee
as<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> part<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.659> hierarchy<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:56.399> can

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
as a part of hierarchy you can they can

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.209 
as a part of hierarchy you can they can
change<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> level<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.229> three

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
change the level so it is three

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.100 
change the level so it is three
dimensional<00:01:59.719> hierarchy<00:02:02.540> item<00:02:03.540> category<00:02:03.930> an

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
dimensional hierarchy item category an

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
dimensional hierarchy item category an
item<00:02:04.439> code<00:02:04.680> also<00:02:05.640> forms<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.979> hierarchy<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.220> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
item code also forms a hierarchy here so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.190 
item code also forms a hierarchy here so
I<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.270> say<00:02:10.190> item<00:02:11.190> name<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:12.030> own<00:02:12.209> profit

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
I can say item name just own profit

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.640 
I can say item name just own profit
in<00:02:13.440> type<00:02:13.770> item<00:02:14.250> category<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.200> will<00:02:16.410> say

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
in type item category and I will say

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:31.070 
in type item category and I will say
item<00:02:19.910> hierarchy<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:28.130> let's<00:02:29.660> see<00:02:30.660> how<00:02:30.900> it

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
item hierarchy and let's see how it

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.670 
item hierarchy and let's see how it
behaves<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.530> I'm<00:02:34.650> gonna<00:02:34.800> drag<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.819> drop<00:02:36.680> item

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
behaves so I'm gonna drag and drop item

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.110 
behaves so I'm gonna drag and drop item
hierarchy<00:02:38.190> column<00:02:39.030> section<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:41.519> say

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
hierarchy column section and say

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.589 
hierarchy column section and say
Department<00:02:42.599> hierarchy

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.780

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
and item hierarchy which we just created

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.670 
and item hierarchy which we just created
in<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.799> color<00:03:00.670> section<00:03:04.260> now<00:03:05.260> take<00:03:05.439> a<00:03:05.470> look

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
in the color section now take a look

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.649 
in the color section now take a look
here<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.720> Department<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:10.299> can<00:03:10.480> see

wonderful now I can mini right coming
back<00:03:47.650> at<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.159> manor<00:03:48.370> level<00:03:48.669> and<00:03:49.659> then<00:03:49.780> I'll

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
back at the manor level and then I'll

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.789 
back at the manor level and then I'll
expand<00:03:50.769> item<00:03:51.250> hierarchy<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:55.409> this<00:03:56.409> is<00:03:56.560> item

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
expand item hierarchy so this is item

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.809 
expand item hierarchy so this is item
mean<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.639> I<00:03:57.900> can<00:03:59.729> put<00:04:00.729> it<00:04:00.909> in<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.569> rows<00:04:02.819> so

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
mean that I can put it in the rows so

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.210 
mean that I can put it in the rows so
this<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.150> cellular<00:04:05.040> cosmetic<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.599> electron

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
this is cellular cosmetic and electron

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.800 
this is cellular cosmetic and electron
and<00:04:09.220> if<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.489> expand<00:04:09.849> this<00:04:10.530> certain<00:04:11.530> AT&amp;T<00:04:12.129> in

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
and if I expand this certain AT&amp;T in

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.810 
and if I expand this certain AT&amp;T in
cosmetics<00:04:13.810> powder<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.620> soap<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:17.820> can

source connection with a small tick mark

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.420 
source connection with a small tick mark
which<00:04:52.599> means<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.229> is<00:04:53.349> directly<00:04:53.650> connected<00:04:53.979> to

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
and say extract data as soon as I

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.739 
and say extract data as soon as I
extract<00:05:04.300> data<00:05:04.509> we<00:05:05.499> give<00:05:05.860> an<00:05:06.099> option<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:07.509> filter

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:07.749 
extract data we give an option to filter

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:09.989 
extract data we give an option to filter
out<00:05:07.989> the<00:05:08.739> database<00:05:08.979> could<00:05:09.309> be<00:05:09.489> having

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:09.999 
out the database could be having

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.839 
out the database could be having
millions<00:05:10.509> and<00:05:10.689> billions<00:05:10.839> of<00:05:11.080> records<00:05:11.499> right

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849

millions and billions of records right
so<00:05:12.849> you<00:05:12.909> don't<00:05:13.300> want<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:13.599> extract<00:05:14.199> everything

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:14.589 
so you don't want to extract everything

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:16.499 
so you don't want to extract everything
or<00:05:14.860> you<00:05:14.949> just<00:05:15.099> want<00:05:15.339> to<00:05:15.369> extract<00:05:15.759> a<00:05:15.939> subset

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
or you just want to extract a subset

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.259 
or you just want to extract a subset
this<00:05:17.019> is<00:05:17.169> how<00:05:17.259> you<00:05:17.319> can<00:05:17.559> control<00:05:17.889> it<00:05:18.069> here<00:05:18.369> and

this is how you can control it here and

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:23.850 
this is how you can control it here and
apply<00:05:19.599> a<00:05:19.629> filter<00:05:20.050> or<00:05:22.169> you<00:05:23.169> can<00:05:23.349> subtract<00:05:23.739> if

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
apply a filter or you can subtract if

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.559 
apply a filter or you can subtract if
you<00:05:23.979> know<00:05:24.069> that<00:05:24.279> the<00:05:24.699> data<00:05:24.879> is<00:05:25.029> not<00:05:25.209> too<00:05:25.389> much

done just few minutes back and it's 58

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:53.790 
done just few minutes back and it's 58
records<00:06:49.409> now<00:06:50.409> I<00:06:51.899> want<00:06:52.899> to<00:06:52.989> switch<00:06:53.199> it<00:06:53.229> back<00:06:53.349> to

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
records now I want to switch it back to

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.519 
records now I want to switch it back to
the<00:06:54.129> live<00:06:54.309> data<00:06:54.550> connection<00:06:55.119> I<00:06:55.300> would<00:06:55.869> uncheck

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:56.529 
the live data connection I would uncheck

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:01.709 
the live data connection I would uncheck
this<00:06:56.889> pop<00:06:57.159> which<00:06:57.879> is<00:06:58.649> use<00:06:59.649> extract<00:07:00.360> see<00:07:01.360> here

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:01.719 
this pop which is use extract see here

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:05.459 
this pop which is use extract see here
that<00:07:02.879> it's<00:07:03.879> switching<00:07:04.659> the<00:07:04.899> connection<00:07:05.289> it's

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:05.469 
that it's switching the connection it's

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:09.629 
that it's switching the connection it's
it's<00:07:05.739> so<00:07:06.039> powerful<00:07:06.599> tool<00:07:07.599> and<00:07:08.129> it<00:07:09.129> can<00:07:09.189> switch

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 
it's so powerful tool and it can switch

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.089 
it's so powerful tool and it can switch
it<00:07:09.789> back<00:07:09.999> to<00:07:10.059> the<00:07:10.360> extract<00:07:10.749> and<00:07:10.930> then<00:07:11.139> back<00:07:11.979> to

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:12.099 
it back to the extract and then back to

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.850 
it back to the extract and then back to
the<00:07:12.189> live<00:07:12.369> data

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
the live data

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.110 
the live data
here<00:07:14.860> again<00:07:15.160> that<00:07:15.699> it's<00:07:16.120> converted<00:07:16.660> into<00:07:18.120> the

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 
here again that it's converted into the

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.810 
here again that it's converted into the
light<00:07:19.330> so<00:07:20.169> we<00:07:20.199> let<00:07:20.440> me<00:07:20.530> think<00:07:20.740> so<00:07:20.889> the<00:07:21.430> first<00:07:21.639> is

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 
light so we let me think so the first is

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.420 
light so we let me think so the first is
how<00:07:21.970> to<00:07:22.030> create<00:07:22.270> hierarchies<00:07:22.889> how<00:07:23.889> to<00:07:23.949> create

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
how to create hierarchies how to create

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.659 
how to create hierarchies how to create
the<00:07:27.430> extract<00:07:28.120> and<00:07:28.300> how<00:07:28.840> to<00:07:28.900> switch<00:07:29.229> between

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:29.669 
the extract and how to switch between

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.700 
the extract and how to switch between
extract<00:07:30.669> and<00:07:30.850> live<00:07:31.000> connection<00:07:31.300> I<00:07:31.690> hope<00:07:32.560> you

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
extract and live connection I hope you

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:43.140 
extract and live connection I hope you
enjoyed<00:07:33.009> it<00:07:33.190> thank<00:07:33.570> you

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.150 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.210 

you
