00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.110
 weatherman 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.470
 francisco the day what are the factors that are causing so many rains, right? 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.969
 with the sanction only returned as strict as cp is already witnessing in this 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:10.649
 time 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.229
 vandinho gave a good day to all 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.550
 tvca viewers here is not a pleasure to be here 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.329
 with you this Tuesday 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.800
 and actually 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.999
 That 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.630
 is to speak climatic condition it was announced one month 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.900
 it is not that we should have in a quarter or greater 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.150
 in june and july 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.560
 it is bad to have all the posts of the 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.350
 is above standard 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.540
 in a final 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.270
 the like disassembled to roll in that situation during the month of April 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.260
 Atlantic roseana to adjacent bet 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.900
 he portions are part of the human being are extremely well heated 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.470
 so we come then he is to observe 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.720
 around 30 degrees celsius water temperature on the surface of the sea 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.110
 this is a very significant amount of energy 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.330
 I want this date so serious it's through the sea water prayer revap 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.930
 evaporation of sea water 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.500
 by the way of fulfilling them 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.049
 and these clouds precipitate causing 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.280
 sometimes thunderstorms 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.659
 we have been mentioning here that the amount of rain that fell is well 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.390
 above 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.980
 I waited for the whole month there I ask 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.720
 the worst has gone 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.150
 or there's more rain out there in the next few months not the worst has not passed 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.280
 among the crimes we have conditions we have two conditions 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.840
 determinants 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.540
 to which it continues still because in these intense works in the from moderate to strong 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.800
 we have to be warmer 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.900
 and now in the month of May for the month of June 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.140
 there is a configuration of the abdomen 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 change in the system of events two hundred years 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.950
 the musicians winds that blow from the continent process at this time of year 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.010
 they tend to grow stronger at this time of year then with the pacu junction of these 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.890
 two factors are not associated 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.389
 This gives a tendency for this study to continue 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.399
 so we are 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.189
 in which they are the beginning 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.439
 in the rainy season historically the month of June 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.690
 it rains a lot more than the month of May 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.570
 and a month of May and has been hitting the historical records in relation to the 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.150
 total accumulated phrases for us to complete in these next days until the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.160
 end of the week 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.029
 is that we can expect to the south that the most affected region of the state 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:30.529
 because it's him 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.700
 in fact nobody a piece that is the forecast is that it has 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.570
 the next 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.250
 24 hours to today's parliament 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.369
 a rainfall ticket will be more intense and concentrated in the southern forest 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.689
 in the northern forest now it is raining more concentrated in the northern forest 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.889
 in the metropolitan area should contain more amazed 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.039
 is the moderate can sometimes give a stronger blow but the middle pm 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.649
 environment 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:55.489
 to be continued 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.780
 and should have even concentrated on and continuing these blows 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.319
 of rain and along 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.139
 of today and of tomorrow 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.430
