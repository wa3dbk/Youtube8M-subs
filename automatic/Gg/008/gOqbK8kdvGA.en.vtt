more<00:00:15.360> information<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.020> setup<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.500> I

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
more information on this setup so I

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.950 
more information on this setup so I
figured<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.010> would<00:00:17.570> see<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.900> to

spray glue but the glue isn't a big
plastic<00:00:28.619> bag<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.609> drum<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.119> too

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

extensively<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.430> had<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.969> sucker<00:00:36.239> glowing<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
extensively I had that sucker glowing I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.830 
extensively I had that sucker glowing I
added<00:00:38.040> four<00:00:38.730> air<00:00:38.969> inlets<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> bottom

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
added four air inlets down at the bottom

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.240 
added four air inlets down at the bottom
and<00:00:40.260> they're<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.590> inch<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> half<00:00:40.920> off

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.979 
them and the other two have ball valves
for<00:00:51.899> fine-tuning<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.879> basically<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.660> cook<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989

drum and that makes cleaning it out a
whole<00:02:26.459> lot<00:02:26.670> easier<00:02:27.030> because<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.540> mean<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.050> any

small curry and all they get to be a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.520 
small curry and all they get to be a
mess

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
mess

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.170

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
kettle grill from Walmart I think if I

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.380 
kettle grill from Walmart I think if I
remember<00:02:45.630> correctly<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.000> I've<00:02:48.180> got

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
remember correctly and on that I've got

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.620 
remember correctly and on that I've got
some<00:02:49.110> feet<00:02:49.350> welded<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:50.100> keep<00:02:50.329> it<00:02:51.329> off<00:02:51.450> out<00:02:51.600> of

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
some feet welded to keep it off out of

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.630 
some feet welded to keep it off out of
the<00:02:51.780> ash<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:53.190> basically<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:56.220> fill<00:02:56.459> this

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
the ash so basically you fill this

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.009 
the ash so basically you fill this

admitted admittedly I've not used made
it<00:04:01.950> seasoned<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:04.489> saw<00:04:05.489> has<00:04:05.730> rusted<00:04:06.150> but

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
it seasoned it and saw has rusted but

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.810 
it seasoned it and saw has rusted but
basically<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.320> sits<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:07.920> about<00:04:08.489> like

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
basically it sits on there about like

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.750 
basically it sits on there about like
that<00:04:09.060> well<00:04:10.020> granted<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.500> lid<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.580> still

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
that well granted the lid is still

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.460 
that well granted the lid is still
sitting<00:04:11.910> there<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.870> use<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.140> original

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
sitting there and I use the original

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.080 
sitting there and I use the original
lock<00:04:13.650> ring<00:04:13.920> around<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.670> hold<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:15.000> and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
lock ring around it to hold it and

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.759 
lock ring around it to hold it and
secure<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.660> seals<00:04:16.019> it<00:04:16.169> up<00:04:16.229> pretty<00:04:16.410> well<00:04:16.590> to

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
secure it and seals it up pretty well to

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.009 
secure it and seals it up pretty well to
my<00:04:17.519> intentions<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.209> were<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.840> add

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
my intentions with this were to add

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.860 
my intentions with this were to add
another<00:04:19.049> great<00:04:19.790> or<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.479> be<00:04:21.570> able<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.720> do

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
another great or to be able to do

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.760 
another great or to be able to do
sausages<00:04:22.560> or<00:04:22.950> just<00:04:23.640> taller<00:04:23.880> things<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.390> know

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
sausages or just taller things you know

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.990 
sausages or just taller things you know
and<00:04:25.770> that's<00:04:26.040> gave<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.550> whole<00:04:26.610> lot<00:04:26.669> more

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
and that's gave it a whole lot more

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.560 
and that's gave it a whole lot more
I<00:04:27.360> just<00:04:27.870> haven't<00:04:28.169> used<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.500> yet<00:04:28.729> but<00:04:29.729> basically

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
I just haven't used it yet but basically

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.020 
I just haven't used it yet but basically
this<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.840> just<00:04:31.140> another<00:04:31.380> barrel<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.340> cut

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
this is just another barrel that I cut

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.450 
this is just another barrel that I cut
off<00:04:33.060> my<00:04:33.240> partitions<00:04:33.900> right<00:04:34.200> at<00:04:34.470> one<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.400> the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
off my partitions right at one of the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.730 
off my partitions right at one of the
lips<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:36.180> then<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.690> went<00:04:36.840> all<00:04:36.990> around<00:04:37.380> with<00:04:37.680> a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
lips and then I went all around with a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.960 
lips and then I went all around with a
hammer<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.010> flared<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.460> out<00:04:38.550> just<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.940> little

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
hammer and flared it out just a little

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.400 
hammer and flared it out just a little
bit<00:04:39.240> more<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.780> where<00:04:39.870> it'll<00:04:40.020> sit<00:04:40.229> right<00:04:40.350> down

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
bit more to where it'll sit right down

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.909 
bit more to where it'll sit right down
there<00:04:40.530> good<00:04:44.330> but<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.870> think<00:04:46.229> that's<00:04:46.410> about<00:04:46.680> it

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
there good but I think that's about it

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.130 
there good but I think that's about it
that<00:04:47.370> is<00:04:47.610> my<00:04:47.820> ugly<00:04:48.150> drum<00:04:48.360> smoker<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.900> it's
