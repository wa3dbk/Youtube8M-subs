00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.740
 I want to say a few words to my mother 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.680
 the board you chose for your 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.530
 computer based change x boards 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.630
 which is now before you in this case 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.830
 This gigabyte accident 75 and that is it again 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.830
 on 475 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 chipset up to 75 and socket lga 1155 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.260
 pictures directly the board itself why 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.079
 I chose her the power removed first 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 so that it is quite inexpensive 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.469
 as such it is because it is 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:48.890
 variants of the same board only on the chipset 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.890
 intel and god of memory or 75 and 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.210
 h77 z77 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 how do they differ specifically from this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.820
 fees why are they more expensive firstly 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.969
 there is a connector in my opinion this is less 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 the song is called right here in those dear 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.260
 boards have a wifi module connected and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.130
 bred still here to panel connectors 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.409
 devi 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.170
 one more panel to metal is on 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.720
 which are mounted mounted two 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 connectors for external antennas in my case 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.300
 wi-fi is not needed more precisely he is needed but 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.150
 we have 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:34.260
 no usb 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.520
 forgot what it's called we have a hut 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.680
 device which is included in yusb 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.150
 wi-fi buffalo connector in my opinion it 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.920
 small enough for a laptop 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.020
 intended we use it now 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.620
 for big computers on grade 3 on 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.080
 work that is to network we 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.170
 connect with wifi and speed 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.070
 Enough for watching videos on youtube 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.470
 and other things on the Internet 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.570
 different main difference main 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.210
 the difference is that on this 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:11.260
 the board has only one connector for sata 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.440
 sata 3 3 little black little white to sata 3 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.850
 sata 3 before blueberry is sata 2 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.320
 my case will be connected to sata3 ssd 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.500
 drive in the rest of this case one 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.850
 It will be used it will be the hard drive 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.700
 the speed I think will be enough 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.750
 basically a media repository therefore 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.030
 special speed 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.830
 and not necessary on the one hand on the other 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.620
 hand enough 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.270
 that is, the speed which is the first 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.760
 the main difference is the more expensive 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.760
 more precisely the second is already there is no wifi 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.600
 the second difference from expensive boards and 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.580
 actually there in my 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.790
 any one features which acceleration 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.280
 Of course it is possible on the chip for 77 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.739
 but I don't need him here 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.650
 Core i3 3520 3225 processor installed 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.830
 in which there is an integrated video core 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.720
 hd 4000 itself is powerful today 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.130
 video core 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.600
 that's why I chose him with a sight 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.040
 use without a discrete video card 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.010
 although on this board 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:29.690
 some kind she was not small eat food 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:33.080
 xps 16 which you can plug in 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.310
 discrete graphics card of course not 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.209
 monsters that are on today 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.269
 a day but a map which can be improved 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.769
 the speed of the video part of the computer but 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.700
 In our case, this is most likely not 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.590
 need and there are two slots for 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.630
 RAM that we will have 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:58.190
 two of the faster two are involved 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.100
 4 gigabyte planks 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:09.459
 I liked it a little surprised this 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:09.459
 what is there 2 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.459
 speed away completely out of my head like this 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.540
 everything is called 2 2 2 network connectors 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.540
 200 per card reader 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:35.790
 4 usb connectors 9 2 hdmi connector what else 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:39.180
 two visby three external and old 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.880
 mouse connector in our 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.060
 the case will be connected to the external 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.320
 keyboard because we have a mouse 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.110
 logitech wireless and ovsky 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.240
 the keyboard is old we are connected here 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.320
 so all will be involved 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.100
 connectors 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.530
 and about the power of the fans and 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.020
 so love them in this case there are 2 4 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.390
 pin connectors for power 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.840
 fans one of them without looking back 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.850
 which of nowhere is most likely this one with 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.370
 right side is the power connector 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.530
 CPU fan for cooling 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.360
 CPU cooler cooler 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.900
 processor and this is an additional 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.200
 fan 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.940
 I still do not know whether to install in 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.850
 this little body which I 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.840
 I'll tell you in another video 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.479
 additional fan because there 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.160
 there is little space, but if it succeeds 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.850
 will be further cooling what 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.490
 all the same all will firmly stand their 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.040
 tight and it will be necessary to Greece 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.290
 opportunities to provide good 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:49.220
 cooling 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:49.220
 Well, in a nutshell, so far all
