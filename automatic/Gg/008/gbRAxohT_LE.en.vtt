00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.300
 we come back with more 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.180
 abc rural 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.080
 producers have to learn to 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.730
 handle what water is and through 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.500
 irrigation systems 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.259
 it is not necessary to make large 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.590
 investments but make the investments 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:26.890
 adequate there are for large extensions and 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.230
 small extensions the engineer sábad 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.060
 hands will talk about the use 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.250
 of an irrigation system for small 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 producers and the advantages that this 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.550
 have 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.960
 and we do not find in the field 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.480
 experimental located here in bellavista 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.210
 Itapúa department which is the idea of 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.940
 what we are going to see today is irrigation by 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.559
 superficial drip for the little ones 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.360
 producers the irrigation system by 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.879
 drip to give a bit a brief 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.309
 true story this starts in israel 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.410
 since the decade of the 60s that already 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.540
 he is developing and driving this 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.790
 Irrigation system in Paraguay is already good 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.369
 known for a long time already this system 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.560
 especially in horticultural areas but 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.080
 what are the advantages of using the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.440
 irrigation system one that works at low 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.720
 pressures that can also be injected 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.300
 fertilizers in this system and it's a 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.300
 Irrigation system very easy to use 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.039
 for the producers the practicality 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.410
 the engineer explained how it works 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.240
 the equipment without using a 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.270
 water pump us here in the field 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.460
 experimental a kit of 500 is mounted 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.160
 square meters can work by 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.649
 gravity putting a tank at 2 meters 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.700
 of height can already work by the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.439
 Water column 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.899
 the pressure that that water column forms 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.210
 of 2 meters for serious and 1000 meters 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.450
 squares for archiving for projects 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.399
 largest horticulture you already have 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.890
 have to install a pump to give it a 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.960
 little more pressure what are some 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.450
 details to keep in mind for the good 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.000
 equipment operation first for 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.849
 durability is maintenance that 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.860
 it is essential to clean the filter 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.470
 opening of the purge valves and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.569
 especially something to keep in mind that 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.120
 many producers do not know or 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.940
 they do not know that they do not take into account is the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.299
 theme of algae the enemy number one 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.130
 of drip irrigation are the algae because 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.310
 that's going to be struggling with time 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.470
 then recommendations if in case 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.840
 the producer has a water reservoir 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.900
 and from there it extracts the water for its irrigation is 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.810
 cover that reservoir that does not reach the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.180
 light and in a certain way the algae do not go 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.430
 to germinate and we will be avoiding the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.560
 algae and combined with cleanup 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.109
 filter that is also depending on the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.360
 water type let's get a 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.640
 minimum durability of 5 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.130
 always taking into account the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.500
 maintenance giving some numbers 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.750
 about this family irrigation system the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.510
 engineer stressed that the kit covers a 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.240
 extension of 500 square meters and should 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.880
 have a tank of 500 to 600 liters 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.190
 of water must also be elevated to a 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.710
 height of 2 meters which is enough 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.540
 to give the necessary water pressure 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.790
 so that it covers all the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.250
 extension of land to be irrigated 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.470
 on the other hand the times that will be used 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.930
 the irrigation system per day will depend on 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.270
 the amount of rain that has fallen on 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.280
 equipment normally water 6 mm 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.489
 water per day and it is recommended to do the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.470
 irrigation in two shifts of one hour but to 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.840
 from what extension of land is 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.450
 You need to acquire a water pump to 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.610
 perform drip irrigation for 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.489
 Larger kits arrived by drip or for 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.290
 Largest project watering time 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.360
 to reach the required sheet 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.820
 It depends on some hydraulic calculations 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.160
 whose variables are the type of hose 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.410
 I'm going to use and the distance between the 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.600
 hoses that tells me how many hours per 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.300
 day I must open the valve to reach 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.770
 the millimeter that I want to reach is 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.620
 You can see at a glance the 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.930
 differences between a crop with irrigation and 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.360
 another without irrigation we have to 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.080
 do it here and especially the irrigation 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.830
 drip in cassava and yerba mate with the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.470
 witness as you can see there is a greater 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.450
 development in the witness area over 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.690
 all in the case of good cassava and 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.240
 this comes even here is a year 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.780
 rainy and it's a very good year but what 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.120
 pass 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.730
 the high temperatures makes the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.340
 plant are in stress the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.100
 evapotranspiration is greater than 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.320
 water absorption then the plant will 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.690
 Stress us with drip irrigation 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.150
 we are seeing truth that the plant 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.000
 when it is needed in periods and in 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.400
 critical hours of the day have the water 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.160
 available even we did 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.160
 measurements with infrared meters 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.440
 temperature and we saw that the leaves where 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.190
 they have drip irrigation they have lower 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.710
 temperature that 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.510
 which leaves us no irrigation 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.760
 we went and we found out in the bibliography 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.000
 that wants to tell us that and tells us that 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.100
 when the temperature of the leaf increases 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.720
 low the photosynthetic rate that 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.150
 translates into less development and 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.220
 just what we are seeing is a 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.470
 greater development in the area where it has 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.930
 watering where the temperature of the leaf 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.420
 is smaller with respect to the control area 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.520
 that can also be observed in the 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.950
 next stage which is the cultivation 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.830
 extensive is also seen that same 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.110
 phenomenon finally the rowan engineer 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.000
 jan stressed what points he should have in 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.710
 the producer who installs this 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.780
 irrigation system to achieve its 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.880
 durability is mostly the 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.600
 maintenance will see a correct 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.520
 installation the effective and efficient use of 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.200
 this system following the 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.170
 recommendations that we give 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.730
 especially the time arrived because 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.010
 It should also be noted that if the 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.530
 producer is passed in the time of 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.050
 come and especially the textured floor 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.270
 more sandy can produce leaching 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.880
 in nutrients and irrigation can have 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.100
 a negative effect and highlight 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.190
 last time about all the maintenance 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.520
 of this system the hose I carry 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:21.150
 drip can endure many years always 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.760
 and when we prevent the gas from entering the 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.700
 hose or dirt as we avoid the 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.970
 algae that our reservoirs do not 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.850
 come sunlight and dirt the 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.040
 cleaning the daily filter with that with 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.530
 this primordial maintenance and 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.230
 main we get that 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.780
 our drip irrigation system 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:46.160
 operate at 100% efficiency and by 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.160
 as long as possible
