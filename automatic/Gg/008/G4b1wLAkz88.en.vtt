00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.389 
energy if it's just sitting there okay
so<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:51.350> don't<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.890> worry<00:01:52.070> about<00:01:52.220> the

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
so we don't have to worry about the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.010 
so we don't have to worry about the
middle<00:01:52.670> order<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:53.149> we<00:01:53.240> have<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.630> three

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
middle order but we have the three

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.490 
middle order but we have the three
sniper<00:01:54.890> towers<00:01:55.340> that<00:01:55.520> are<00:01:55.580> still<00:01:55.880> left<00:01:55.909> and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
sniper towers that are still left and

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.690 
sniper towers that are still left and
the<00:01:57.500> cannons<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.070> we're<00:01:58.190> going<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.369> try<00:01:58.670> and

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
the cannons so we're going to try and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.940 
the cannons so we're going to try and
bring<00:01:59.030> our<00:01:59.210> forces<00:01:59.659> up<00:01:59.840> tight<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.560> top<00:02:00.770> end

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
bring our forces up tight to the top end

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.410 
bring our forces up tight to the top end
of<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.130> base<00:02:01.340> we're<00:02:01.970> going<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.149> use<00:02:02.240> some

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
of the base we're going to use some

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.350 
of the base we're going to use some
flares<00:02:02.690> here<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:03.200> then<00:02:03.890> from<00:02:04.190> there<00:02:04.250> I'm<00:02:05.060> not

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
flares here and then from there I'm not

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.639 
flares here and then from there I'm not
going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.660> use<00:02:05.780> anything<00:02:06.050> they're<00:02:06.380> going<00:02:06.590> to

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
going to use anything they're going to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.169 
going to use anything they're going to
go<00:02:06.800> in<00:02:06.979> they're<00:02:07.310> gonna<00:02:07.399> try<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:07.880> take<00:02:08.030> out

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
go in they're gonna try and take out

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.150 
go in they're gonna try and take out
that<00:02:08.330> sniper<00:02:08.479> tower<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.229> we<00:02:09.769> got<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> couple

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
that sniper tower and we got a couple

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.040 
that sniper tower and we got a couple
guys<00:02:10.340> firing<00:02:11.120> at<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.269> sniper<00:02:11.480> tower<00:02:11.690> up<00:02:11.930> at

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
guys firing at the sniper tower up at

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.350 
guys firing at the sniper tower up at
the<00:02:12.110> top<00:02:12.260> right<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.709> that's<00:02:13.580> where<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.150> would

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the top right and that's where it would

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.210 
the top right and that's where it would
have<00:02:14.390> been<00:02:14.540> probably<00:02:14.870> more<00:02:15.290> beneficial<00:02:15.860> had

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
have been probably more beneficial had

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.309 
have been probably more beneficial had
we<00:02:16.400> brought<00:02:16.700> our<00:02:16.910> artillery<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.810> between

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
we brought our artillery in between

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.960 
we brought our artillery in between
those<00:02:18.500> two<00:02:18.680> sniper<00:02:18.950> towers<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.610> were<00:02:19.670> left

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
those two sniper towers that were left

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.880 
those two sniper towers that were left
over<00:02:20.180> as<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:21.019> is<00:02:21.140> we're<00:02:21.380> taking<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.739> these

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
over as it is we're taking out these

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.979 
over as it is we're taking out these
these<00:02:22.430> buildings<00:02:22.880> again<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.540> don't<00:02:23.569> want<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
these buildings again I don't want to

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.080 
these buildings again I don't want to
use<00:02:24.170> all<00:02:24.620> my<00:02:24.739> energy<00:02:25.130> here<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.580> want<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.819> save

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
use all my energy here I want to save

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.390 
use all my energy here I want to save
some<00:02:26.120> energy<00:02:26.560> there's<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.709> flare<00:02:28.069> on<00:02:28.100> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
some energy there's a flare on the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.910 
some energy there's a flare on the
cannon<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:28.970> then<00:02:29.360> once<00:02:30.050> these<00:02:30.260> guys<00:02:30.500> are<00:02:30.739> done

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
cannon and then once these guys are done

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.110 
cannon and then once these guys are done
with<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.160> cannon<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.550> want<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.819> bring<00:02:31.940> them

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
with the cannon I want to bring them

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.360 
with the cannon I want to bring them
back<00:02:32.390> towards<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.050> bunker<00:02:33.380> at<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.590> top<00:02:33.800> base

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
back towards that bunker at the top base

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.640 
back towards that bunker at the top base
and<00:02:34.870> hopefully<00:02:35.870> we<00:02:35.959> have<00:02:36.049> enough<00:02:36.110> energy<00:02:36.410> to

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
and hopefully we have enough energy to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.150 
and hopefully we have enough energy to
maybe<00:02:37.549> he'll<00:02:37.790> them<00:02:37.970> up<00:02:38.090> maybe<00:02:38.750> not<00:02:39.160> depending

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
maybe he'll them up maybe not depending

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.620 
maybe he'll them up maybe not depending
on<00:02:40.250> how<00:02:40.430> much<00:02:40.549> we<00:02:40.730> get<00:02:40.880> back<00:02:41.090> from<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.450> bunker

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
on how much we get back from the bunker

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.009 
on how much we get back from the bunker
and<00:02:41.959> then<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.280> rest<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.850> attack<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.480> on

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
and then the rest of the attack is on

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.039 
and then the rest of the attack is on
the<00:02:45.890> HQ<00:02:46.370> there<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:46.700> go<00:02:46.820> okay<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:47.329> I<00:02:47.660> mean<00:02:47.959> we

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
the HQ there we go okay so I mean we

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.060 
the HQ there we go okay so I mean we
don't<00:02:48.140> really<00:02:48.320> need<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.680> heal<00:02:48.799> them<00:02:48.920> up<00:02:48.980> at

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
don't really need to heal them up at

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.350 
don't really need to heal them up at
this<00:02:49.190> point<00:02:49.400> anyway<00:02:49.610> because<00:02:49.880> they're<00:02:50.180> out<00:02:50.329> of

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
this point anyway because they're out of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.900 
this point anyway because they're out of
range<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.620> remaining<00:02:51.980> defenses<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.880> the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
range of the remaining defenses in the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.440 
range of the remaining defenses in the
base<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.010> said<00:02:55.070> those<00:02:55.880> buildings

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
base but like I said those buildings

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.880 
base but like I said those buildings
that<00:02:56.660> were<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.079> far<00:02:57.380> right<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.709> base

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
that were on that far right of the base

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.120 
that were on that far right of the base
extremely<00:02:58.820> important<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.709> get<00:03:00.709> additional

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
extremely important to get additional

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.340 
extremely important to get additional
energy<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.329> by<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.570> time<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:03.079> get<00:03:03.290> to

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
energy so that by the time you get to

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.680 
energy so that by the time you get to
where<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.799> need<00:03:03.829> to<00:03:04.280> use<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.209> do<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.630> it

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
where you need to use it you do have it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.020 
where you need to use it you do have it
whether<00:03:06.530> you're<00:03:06.799> using<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.340> with<00:03:07.579> the<00:03:07.730> flares

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
whether you're using it with the flares

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.780 
whether you're using it with the flares
the<00:03:08.540> artillery<00:03:09.170> with<00:03:09.859> the<00:03:09.980> med<00:03:10.220> kits<00:03:10.489> again

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
the artillery with the med kits again

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.789 
the artillery with the med kits again
we're<00:03:10.940> still<00:03:11.180> here<00:03:11.450> on<00:03:11.570> headquarters<00:03:12.079> level<00:03:12.350> 6

we're still here on headquarters level 6
our<00:03:13.100> gunboat<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.150> level<00:03:14.390> 7<00:03:14.540> we<00:03:15.380> don't<00:03:15.560> have

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
our gunboat is a level 7 we don't have

our gunboat is a level 7 we don't have
some<00:03:17.000> more<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.359> advanced<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.530> know

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
some more of the advanced you know

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.640 
some more of the advanced you know
there's<00:03:18.829> smoke<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.190> there's<00:03:19.970> one<00:03:20.209> that

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
there's smoke and there's one that

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.860 
there's smoke and there's one that
disables<00:03:21.650> enemy<00:03:22.359> defenses<00:03:23.359> for<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.570> period<00:03:23.750> of

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
disables enemy defenses for a period of

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.990 
disables enemy defenses for a period of
time<00:03:24.019> we<00:03:24.140> don't<00:03:24.170> have<00:03:24.410> those<00:03:24.799> tools<00:03:25.100> for<00:03:25.880> us

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
time we don't have those tools for us

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.210 
time we don't have those tools for us
okay<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:26.630> we<00:03:27.019> have<00:03:27.200> our<00:03:27.380> for<00:03:27.650> landing<00:03:27.980> craft
