00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.200
 we prepare students for tests 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.520
 both advertising and advertising 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.990
 of teledramaturgy 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.700
 I have always had great interest in this area 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.380
 this year I started to work 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.780
 as a model and they told me to do a 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.710
 TV and film course to help in the tests 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.140
 of video 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.470
 the teacher course that sees the situations 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.260
 who lived an intense that is the version of the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.570
 text and cam get to text and 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.300
 very little time to think and finish 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.520
 giving did in the advertising part 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.079
 we work several texts in each class 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.670
 every one that we have like the people 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.530
 it's really going to be a test 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.440
 we record people watch a lot 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.320
 people can improve we create an environment 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.630
 of the advertising test so that the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.430
 student can experience this before the 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.350
 professional moment 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.680
 with this he acquired much more 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.260
 confidence tranquility decreases 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.930
 anxiety causes that in the moment that it 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.350
 professional test it does not get 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.030
 do not feel like you 're different 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.159
 other people who are doing it 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.620
 but of course for those who do not 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.820
 had experience that started to be everything 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.940
 a calm 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.159
 the work of mourning, but I felt 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.229
 willing when he arrived at that moment 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.210
 to have to actually do work has 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.270
 the foundation needed to do to get there 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.670
 well done in the part of teledramaturgia 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.280
 we work the monologues and the scenes 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.930
 reprieve from monologues us 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.250
 we put the student in contact with a 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.080
 another language 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:41.619
 It would be a camera with an interlocutor to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.380
 the student's thinking areas and the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.450
 then puts it face-to-face with another 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.430
 possibility of a new possibility of 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.490
 interpretation that we call 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.770
 solitary interpretation together with the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.700
 monologue we also know scenes from 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.590
 doubles 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.200
 Why, then, why did we do it? 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.360
 divide this responsibility before 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.549
 monologue for the student to play more 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.380
 with text play with possibilities 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.019
 already toying with the question of 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.319
 person who is their partner and also 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.810
 the areas of thought now 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.819
 the great advantage comes more uninhibited 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.769
 but the will is much easier 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.780
 interact with the alexandre camera was 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.790
 teacher who has learned this 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.790
 I want all your safety to do
