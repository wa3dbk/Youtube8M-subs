land for instance the weapons now have
unique<00:01:50.940> traits<00:01:51.300> for<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:51.929> this<00:01:52.319> sword<00:01:52.619> has<00:01:52.739> the

ball<00:01:54.989> in<00:01:55.259> your<00:01:55.440> hand<00:01:55.709> so<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.069> you<00:01:56.190> sword<00:01:56.489> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
ball in your hand so if you sword the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.430 
ball in your hand so if you sword the
carrier<00:01:57.149> you'll<00:01:57.539> automatically<00:01:57.989> get<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> odd

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440

ball in your hands as opposed to having
to<00:02:00.209> find<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.599> on<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.780> ground<00:02:01.080> after<00:02:01.319> you

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to find it on the ground after you

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.770 
to find it on the ground after you
killed<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.979> carrier<00:02:02.310> now<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.599> gravity

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
killed the carrier now with the gravity

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719 
killed the carrier now with the gravity
hammer<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.319> time<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.679> not<00:02:04.830> able<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.520> use

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
hammer this time you're not able to use

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.359 
hammer this time you're not able to use
it<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.300> room<00:02:07.050> like<00:02:07.319> Hogwarts<00:02:07.920> style<00:02:08.190> like

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it like a room like Hogwarts style like

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.650 
it like a room like Hogwarts style like
he<00:02:08.489> used<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.880> Halo<00:02:09.060> Reach<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.330> remember<00:02:09.599> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
he used to in Halo Reach I remember you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.270 
he used to in Halo Reach I remember you
can<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:09.929> jump<00:02:10.200> turn<00:02:10.410> around<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:10.770> start

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
can just jump turn around and just start

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.620 
can just jump turn around and just start
swinging<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.760> behind<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.390> launch

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
swinging it behind you to launch

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.660 
swinging it behind you to launch
yourself<00:02:12.810> across<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.739> map<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.489> no

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
yourself across the map you can no

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.100 
yourself across the map you can no
longer<00:02:14.910> really<00:02:15.239> do<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.780> can't<00:02:16.050> really

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
longer really do that you can't really

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.690 
longer really do that you can't really
want<00:02:16.560> your<00:02:16.739> players<00:02:16.920> anymore<00:02:17.250> which<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.579> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
want your players anymore which is a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.399 
want your players anymore which is a
little<00:02:17.879> bit<00:02:17.969> unfortunate<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:18.659> it<00:02:19.110> seems<00:02:19.319> a

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
little bit unfortunate but it seems a

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.710 
little bit unfortunate but it seems a
little<00:02:19.530> bit<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.799> fair<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.159> this<00:02:20.340> case<00:02:20.670> but

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
little bit more fair in this case but

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.420 
little bit more fair in this case but
this<00:02:21.810> time<00:02:21.990> around<00:02:22.040> physics<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.280> been

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
this time around physics have been

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.130 
this time around physics have been
enabled<00:02:23.850> with<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.180> gravity<00:02:24.390> hammer<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.020> so

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
enabled with the gravity hammer and so

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.390 
enabled with the gravity hammer and so
you<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.350> actually<00:02:25.500> basically<00:02:25.800> play<00:02:26.160> baseball

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
you can actually basically play baseball

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400 
you can actually basically play baseball
with<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.850> oddball<00:02:27.120> if<00:02:27.480> it's<00:02:27.720> not<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.050> anyone's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
with the oddball if it's not in anyone's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.380 
with the oddball if it's not in anyone's
hands<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.370> careful<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.880> oddball<00:02:30.240> will

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
hands so be careful the oddball will

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.330 
hands so be careful the oddball will
start<00:02:30.600> bouncing<00:02:31.050> like<00:02:31.260> crazy<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.250> my

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
start bouncing like crazy so my

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.610 
start bouncing like crazy so my
recommendation<00:02:32.550> when<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.330> use<00:02:33.510> each<00:02:33.810> weapon

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
recommendation when to use each weapon

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.440 
recommendation when to use each weapon
is<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.370> save<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> gravity<00:02:36.090> hammer<00:02:36.240> from

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
is that to save the gravity hammer from

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.050 
is that to save the gravity hammer from
when<00:02:36.720> you're<00:02:36.840> facing<00:02:37.020> on<00:02:37.260> big<00:02:37.730> swarms<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
when you're facing on big swarms of the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.820 
when you're facing on big swarms of the
enemy<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.720> mindful<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.380> can<00:02:40.560> easily

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
enemy and be mindful that you can easily

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.040 
enemy and be mindful that you can easily
betray<00:02:41.250> your<00:02:41.460> teammates<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.000> save<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.750> sword

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
betray your teammates and save the sword

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.180 
betray your teammates and save the sword
for<00:02:43.230> when<00:02:43.350> you're<00:02:43.470> chasing<00:02:43.680> people<00:02:44.070> from

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
for when you're chasing people from

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.160 
for when you're chasing people from
behind<00:02:44.550> it's<00:02:45.030> much<00:02:45.270> faster<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.720> way<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.990> can

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
behind it's much faster that way you can

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.960 
behind it's much faster that way you can
obviously<00:02:46.350> cover<00:02:46.650> much<00:02:46.890> longer<00:02:47.520> distances

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
obviously cover much longer distances

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.180 
obviously cover much longer distances
when<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.240> are<00:02:48.600> able<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.110> lunge<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.710> I

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
when you are able to lunge and I

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.790 
when you are able to lunge and I
recommend<00:02:50.580> trying<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.540> sort<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.470> carrier

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
recommend trying to sort the carrier

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.830 
recommend trying to sort the carrier
from<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> behind<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:53.940> much<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.660> possible

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
from the behind as much as possible

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.930 
from the behind as much as possible
because<00:02:55.290> he<00:02:55.590> does<00:02:55.890> have<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.250> ability<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.610> one

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
because he does have the ability to one

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.940 
because he does have the ability to one
punch<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> oddball<00:02:58.260> bet<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.830> can

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
punch you with the oddball bet you can

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.130 
punch you with the oddball bet you can
only<00:02:59.070> do<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.580> often<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.240> if<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.750> want<00:03:00.990> to

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
only do that so often so if you want to

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.420 
only do that so often so if you want to
you<00:03:01.290> can<00:03:01.380> swarm<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.770> with<00:03:01.890> your<00:03:02.010> teammates<00:03:02.310> and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
you can swarm in with your teammates and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.970 
you can swarm in with your teammates and
try<00:03:02.670> as<00:03:03.000> much<00:03:03.270> as<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.540> can<00:03:03.750> another<00:03:04.470> tip<00:03:04.709> that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
try as much as you can another tip that

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.949 
try as much as you can another tip that
I<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.459> if<00:03:05.610> you've<00:03:05.790> played<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.120> grifball

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
I have is if you've played a grifball

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.900 
I have is if you've played a grifball
before<00:03:07.290> halo<00:03:07.590> reach<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.130> initial<00:03:08.610> clash

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
before halo reach the initial clash

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.250 
before halo reach the initial clash
between<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.330> two<00:03:09.480> teams<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> middle<00:03:10.140> when

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
between the two teams in the middle when

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.600 
between the two teams in the middle when
they<00:03:10.350> first<00:03:10.650> tried<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.040> grab<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.430> ball

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
they first tried to go grab the ball

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.190 
they first tried to go grab the ball
it's<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.180> little<00:03:12.360> bit<00:03:12.450> different<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.870> time<00:03:12.930> or

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
it's a little bit different this time or

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.050 
it's a little bit different this time or
like<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.440> said<00:03:13.620> physics<00:03:14.070> are<00:03:14.250> now<00:03:14.430> enabled<00:03:14.910> so

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
like I said physics are now enabled so

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.480 
like I said physics are now enabled so
after<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.540> huge<00:03:15.720> clash<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.100> ball<00:03:17.280> is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
after that huge clash the the ball is

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.770 
after that huge clash the the ball is
not<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:18.090> going<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.270> be<00:03:18.330> sitting<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
not just going to be sitting in the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.150 
not just going to be sitting in the
middle<00:03:18.900> anymore<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.770> gonna<00:03:19.830> bounce

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
middle anymore it's gonna bounce

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.460 
middle anymore it's gonna bounce
somewhere<00:03:20.700> crazily<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.390> i<00:03:21.600> found<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.110> technique

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
somewhere crazily so i found a technique

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.260 
somewhere crazily so i found a technique
is<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.860> i<00:03:22.980> let<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> players<00:03:23.580> just<00:03:23.820> rush<00:03:24.060> on

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
is that i let the players just rush on

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.060 
is that i let the players just rush on
in<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.020> find<00:03:25.290> out<00:03:25.440> where<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.890> oddball

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
in and then I find out where the oddball

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.130 
in and then I find out where the oddball
has<00:03:26.400> since<00:03:26.850> then<00:03:27.120> bounced<00:03:27.600> from<00:03:27.690> all<00:03:27.930> those

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
has since then bounced from all those

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.110 
has since then bounced from all those
gravity<00:03:28.620> hammer<00:03:28.769> swings<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.430> more<00:03:29.760> often

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
gravity hammer swings and more often

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.210 
gravity hammer swings and more often
than<00:03:30.300> not<00:03:30.360> if<00:03:30.810> your<00:03:31.260> team<00:03:31.530> has<00:03:31.709> swung<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
than not if your team has swung the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
than not if your team has swung the
gravity<00:03:32.610> hammer<00:03:32.730> first<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.390> odd<00:03:33.540> ball<00:03:33.810> will

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
gravity hammer first the odd ball will

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.440 
gravity hammer first the odd ball will
bounce<00:03:34.170> backwards<00:03:34.670> towards<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.239> can

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
bounce backwards towards you so you can

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.880 
bounce backwards towards you so you can
quickly<00:03:36.720> grab<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.200> if<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.350> take<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.560> few<00:03:37.800> steps

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
quickly grab it if you take a few steps

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.680 
quickly grab it if you take a few steps
back<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.310> don't<00:03:38.640> rush<00:03:38.790> them<00:03:39.000> initially<00:03:39.209> and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
back and don't rush them initially and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.630 
back and don't rush them initially and
then<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:40.050> just<00:03:40.170> go<00:03:40.320> run<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.100> score

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
then you can just go run on in and score

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.210 
then you can just go run on in and score
once<00:03:42.030> again<00:03:42.209> now<00:03:42.840> my<00:03:43.410> thoughts<00:03:43.739> on<00:03:43.980> both

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
once again now my thoughts on both

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.640 
once again now my thoughts on both
playlists<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.850> really<00:03:45.660> prefer<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.140> regular

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
playlists I really prefer the regular

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.140 
playlists I really prefer the regular
grifball<00:03:47.070> variant<00:03:47.430> which<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.790> single

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
grifball variant which is the single

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.970 
grifball variant which is the single
12-minute<00:03:48.630> round<00:03:48.720> because<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.200> can<00:03:49.320> continue

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
12-minute round because you can continue

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.070 
12-minute round because you can continue
the<00:03:50.100> momentum<00:03:50.220> forward<00:03:50.820> as<00:03:51.000> opposed<00:03:51.900> to

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
the momentum forward as opposed to

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.870 
the momentum forward as opposed to
having<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.440> stopped<00:03:52.830> after<00:03:53.070> each<00:03:53.430> time<00:03:53.700> your

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
having it stopped after each time your

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.820 
having it stopped after each time your
score<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.750> way<00:03:54.870> when<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.320> score<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.739> can

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
score so that way when you score you can

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.170 
score so that way when you score you can
have<00:03:55.950> nickens<00:03:56.340> when<00:03:56.549> you're<00:03:56.640> about<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.940> score

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
have nickens when you're about to score

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.550 
have nickens when you're about to score
it<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.390> can<00:03:57.510> send<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.750> teammate<00:03:58.080> back<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.440> the

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
it you can send a teammate back to the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.770 
it you can send a teammate back to the
center<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.010> go<00:03:59.160> grab<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.580> resetting<00:04:00.000> audible

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
center to go grab the resetting audible

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.840 
center to go grab the resetting audible
and<00:04:00.959> go<00:04:01.380> try<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.709> score<00:04:02.010> quickly<00:04:02.310> again<00:04:02.640> and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
and go try and score quickly again and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.509 
and go try and score quickly again and
it's<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.480> lot<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.690> fun<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.200> way<00:04:04.410> but<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:05.040> do<00:04:05.190> have

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
it's a lot of fun that way but I do have

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.220 
it's a lot of fun that way but I do have
them<00:04:05.730> say<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.480> grip<00:04:06.660> ball<00:04:06.810> pro<00:04:07.049> is

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
them say the grip ball pro is

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.530 
them say the grip ball pro is
challenging<00:04:07.950> in<00:04:08.130> its<00:04:08.310> own<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.880> definitely

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
challenging in its own and is definitely

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.180 
challenging in its own and is definitely
still<00:04:09.780> quite<00:04:10.080> fun<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.500> do<00:04:10.590> prefer<00:04:10.860> the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
still quite fun but I do prefer the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.520 
still quite fun but I do prefer the
