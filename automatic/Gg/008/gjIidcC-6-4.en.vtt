one of the things that we realized

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.580 
one of the things that we realized
though<00:02:49.880> when<00:02:50.269> we<00:02:50.299> were<00:02:50.510> using<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:51.019> was<00:02:51.349> that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
though when we were using it was that

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.860 
though when we were using it was that
typing<00:02:52.250> requires<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.209> with<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.450> reach<00:02:53.630> all

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
typing requires you with to reach all

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.900 
typing requires you with to reach all
the<00:02:54.230> way<00:02:54.260> into<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.980> middle<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.760> screen

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the way into the middle of the screen

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.449 
the way into the middle of the screen
and<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.569> we<00:02:56.989> designed<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.440> thumbs<00:02:57.739> lab<00:02:58.040> which

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
and so we designed this thumbs lab which

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.490 
and so we designed this thumbs lab which
is<00:02:58.489> sort<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.760> more<00:02:58.940> ergonomic<00:02:59.569> and<00:02:59.690> it<00:03:00.200> feels

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
is sort of more ergonomic and it feels

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.420 
is sort of more ergonomic and it feels
