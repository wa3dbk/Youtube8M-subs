00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
packet into the container with the water

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.049 
packet into the container with the water
and<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> matter<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.309> heat<00:00:59.789> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and it's just a matter of the heat and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
and it's just a matter of the heat and
light<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:01.410> depends<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.039> quickly<00:01:02.219> they

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
light or depends on how quickly they

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.960 
light or depends on how quickly they
grow<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.090> let's<00:01:03.989> start<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.890> project<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
grow so let's start this project so

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.250 
grow so let's start this project so
we're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> water<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
we're going to get the water and as you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280 
we're going to get the water and as you
can<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> front<00:01:08.040> there's<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:10.020> the

can see on the front there's the of the
water<00:01:10.470> line<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.189> hopefully<00:01:11.610> we'll<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.330> fill

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
water line so hopefully we'll just fill

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the packet and literally all we need to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.030 
the packet and literally all we need to
do<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.520> pour<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.290> yolks<00:02:01.290> into<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
their packet into the tanks so literally

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.250 
their packet into the tanks so literally
it<00:02:18.980> doesn't<00:02:19.340> tell<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:20.090> don't<00:02:20.600> believe<00:02:20.780> to

stir<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.740> water<00:02:22.000> after<00:02:23.000> you've<00:02:23.090> added<00:02:23.180> this

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
stir the water after you've added this

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.540 
stir the water after you've added this
if<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.410> go<00:02:24.590> over<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.830> instructions<00:02:25.340> when<00:02:25.460> you

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
if we go over the instructions when you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.340 
if we go over the instructions when you
again<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:26.180> says<00:02:26.360> empty<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.870> contents<00:02:27.050> of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
again this says empty the contents of

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.110 
again this says empty the contents of
the<00:02:27.410> packet<00:02:27.800> into<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.070> water<00:02:28.220> I'll<00:02:28.730> stir

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
the packet into the water I'll stir

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.540 
the packet into the water I'll stir
gently<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.500> should<00:02:30.680> dissolve<00:02:31.040> now<00:02:31.280> I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
gently and it should dissolve now I

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.060 
gently and it should dissolve now I
don't<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.240> any<00:02:32.390> other<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:33.140> didn't<00:02:33.860> bring<00:02:33.980> a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
don't have any other I didn't bring a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.260 
don't have any other I didn't bring a
spoon<00:02:34.310> for<00:02:34.550> this<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.030> should<00:02:35.180> have

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
spoon for this because I should have

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.520 
spoon for this because I should have
Washington<00:02:35.720> read<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.900> instructions<00:02:36.320> first

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
Washington read the instructions first

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.550 
Washington read the instructions first
but<00:02:36.740> all<00:02:37.160> these<00:02:37.460> I'll<00:02:37.610> use<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> feed-in<00:02:38.120> spoon

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
but all these I'll use the feed-in spoon

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.680 
but all these I'll use the feed-in spoon
just<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.680> very<00:02:39.860> gently<00:02:40.160> spin<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.210> water<00:02:41.300> on

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
just to very gently spin the water on

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.960 
just to very gently spin the water on
like<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.170> now<00:02:42.920> again<00:02:43.250> we<00:02:43.640> don't<00:02:43.790> need<00:02:43.880> to

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
like this now again we don't need to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.820 
like this now again we don't need to
worry<00:02:44.090> about<00:02:44.150> feeding<00:02:44.600> them<00:02:44.870> at<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.590> point

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
worry about feeding them at this point

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.710 
worry about feeding them at this point
in<00:02:46.040> time<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:46.730> need<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.150> keep<00:02:47.270> them<00:02:47.480> in

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
in time we just need to keep them in

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.650 
in time we just need to keep them in
some<00:02:48.650> form<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:48.980> like<00:02:49.280> at<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.520> lamp<00:02:49.790> or<00:02:50.030> sunlight

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
some form of like at a lamp or sunlight

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.570 
some form of like at a lamp or sunlight
so<00:02:50.930> get<00:02:51.080> plenty<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.380> light<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.710> them<00:02:51.890> make<00:02:52.550> sure

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
so get plenty of light on them make sure

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.280 
so get plenty of light on them make sure
they're<00:02:52.820> nice<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.000> warm<00:02:53.360> at<00:02:53.630> night<00:02:53.660> make<00:02:54.260> sure

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
they're nice and warm at night make sure

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.010 
they're nice and warm at night make sure
that<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.830> tank<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.760> somewhere<00:02:56.240> again<00:02:56.870> where

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
that the tank is somewhere again where

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.390 
that the tank is somewhere again where
it<00:02:57.110> doesn't<00:02:57.320> get<00:02:57.410> too<00:02:57.590> cold<00:02:57.620> because<00:02:58.250> that

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
it doesn't get too cold because that

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.600 
it doesn't get too cold because that
will<00:02:58.550> kill<00:02:58.730> off<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:59.120> lot<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.900> aqua<00:03:00.170> dragons

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
will kill off a lot of the aqua dragons

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.740 
will kill off a lot of the aqua dragons
so<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:01.790> make<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:01.940> bit<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> nice<00:03:02.300> little<00:03:02.570> stir

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
so just make a bit a nice little stir

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.980 
so just make a bit a nice little stir
like<00:03:02.990> this<00:03:03.820> that's<00:03:04.820> really<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.300> believe<00:03:05.510> poor

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
like this that's really I believe poor

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.280 
like this that's really I believe poor
it<00:03:06.080> needs<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:07.310> gentle<00:03:07.550> stir<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.930> now

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
it needs just a gentle stir and now

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.720 
it needs just a gentle stir and now
again<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:09.890> just<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.100> matter<00:03:10.130> of<00:03:10.400> keeping

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
again it's just a matter of keeping

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.300 
again it's just a matter of keeping
these<00:03:10.970> guys<00:03:11.209> somewhere<00:03:11.900> warm<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.530> somewhere
