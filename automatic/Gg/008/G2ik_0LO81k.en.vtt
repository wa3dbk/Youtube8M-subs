00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
this clip spread out throughout the

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.770 
this clip spread out throughout the
whole<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.840> black<00:02:54.169> ops<00:02:54.379> so<00:02:55.219> the<00:02:55.699> quality<00:02:55.909> is<00:02:56.299> in

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
whole of black ops so the quality is in

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.110 
whole of black ops so the quality is in
my<00:02:56.930> opinion<00:02:57.019> pretty<00:02:57.530> high<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.819> like<00:02:58.909> the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
my opinion pretty high I think like the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.959 
my opinion pretty high I think like the
worst<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.870> worst<00:02:59.900> clip<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:00.469> like<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.699> quad<00:03:01.699> feed

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
worst the worst clip is like a quad feed

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.199 
worst the worst clip is like a quad feed
so<00:03:02.389> is<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:04.069> it's<00:03:04.340> pretty<00:03:04.549> good<00:03:04.699> it's<00:03:05.060> pretty

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
so is this it's pretty good it's pretty

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.379 
so is this it's pretty good it's pretty
nice<00:03:05.359> so<00:03:05.629> as<00:03:06.199> I<00:03:06.260> said<00:03:06.439> that<00:03:07.060> yeah<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.239> been<00:03:08.329> a

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
nice so as I said that yeah it's been a

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.699 
nice so as I said that yeah it's been a
project<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.870> we've<00:03:09.079> been<00:03:09.199> thinking<00:03:09.409> offs
