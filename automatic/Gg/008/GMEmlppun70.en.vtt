00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
to keep in frame this is more difficult

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:09.969 
to keep in frame this is more difficult
than<00:01:02.449> it<00:01:02.570> looks<00:01:02.659> like<00:01:08.680> remotely<00:01:09.680> possible

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
yeah it's probably a remote-controlled

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.570 
yeah it's probably a remote-controlled
helicopter<00:01:13.130> or<00:01:13.220> something<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:13.670> effect<00:01:15.580> I'm

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
helicopter or something that effect I'm

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
either the coolest remote control plane

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.480 
either the coolest remote control plane
oh<00:01:25.549> oh<00:01:25.790> yeah<00:01:26.150> he's<00:01:26.330> pretty<00:01:26.479> high<00:01:26.630> up<00:01:26.659> there<00:01:26.810> I

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
thing yet number one down that's if I

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.000 
thing yet number one down that's if I
can<00:01:40.250> get<00:01:40.310> a<00:01:40.370> better<00:01:40.520> close<00:01:40.820> control<00:01:41.120> sure<00:01:41.330> look

calls

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:08.639 

yeah<00:02:00.480> I'm<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:01.050> on<00:02:01.170> YouTube

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.710 

looking<00:02:09.399> here<00:02:09.640> it's<00:02:09.849> got<00:02:10.000> some<00:02:10.239> sound<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.689> it

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
looking here it's got some sound to it

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.190 
looking here it's got some sound to it
so<00:02:11.049> it's<00:02:11.200> probably<00:02:11.409> a<00:02:12.000> helicopter<00:02:13.200> airplane

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
so it's probably a helicopter airplane

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.910 
so it's probably a helicopter airplane
type<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:15.150> remote-controlled<00:02:16.150> deal<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.799> this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
type of remote-controlled deal and this

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.000 
type of remote-controlled deal and this
is<00:02:18.069> right<00:02:18.189> over<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.489> schoolyard<00:02:22.799> let's<00:02:23.799> see<00:02:23.950> if

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
is right over a schoolyard let's see if

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.319 
is right over a schoolyard let's see if
we<00:02:24.129> can<00:02:24.220> get<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.340> better<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.879> lights<00:02:28.120> are

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
we can get a better the lights are

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.620 
we can get a better the lights are
pretty<00:02:28.510> cool

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.210 

hopefully<00:02:33.350> we'll<00:02:33.470> turn<00:02:33.620> around<00:02:33.830> give<00:02:33.980> us<00:02:34.070> some

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
hopefully we'll turn around give us some

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:55.340 
hopefully we'll turn around give us some
more<00:02:34.340> light<00:02:38.740> let's<00:02:39.740> see<00:02:39.920> if<00:02:40.010> we<00:02:40.160> get<00:02:40.280> closer

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:28.210 

Oh

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.570 

we<00:03:28.760> go<00:03:28.880> behind<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.240> tree

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:53.220 

you

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.290 

you
