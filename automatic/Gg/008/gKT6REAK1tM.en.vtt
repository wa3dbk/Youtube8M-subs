00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
nice to see and so that way we're not

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.410 
nice to see and so that way we're not
you<00:01:18.530> know<00:01:18.560> having<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.070> turn<00:01:19.280> kids<00:01:19.909> away<00:01:20.150> and

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
because it really is a good even though

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.969 
because it really is a good even though
get<00:01:22.970> kids<00:01:23.210> decide<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:24.170> isn't<00:01:24.470> for<00:01:24.620> them<00:01:24.740> when

first step for any kind of activity and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.030 
first step for any kind of activity and
it's<00:01:32.030> great<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.240> see<00:01:32.360> kids<00:01:32.720> out<00:01:32.900> being<00:01:33.619> active

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
leaders the instructors and the people

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.520 
leaders the instructors and the people
who<00:02:13.940> head<00:02:14.090> up<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.360> program<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.019> then<00:02:15.379> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
who head up the program and then that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.110 
who head up the program and then that
just<00:02:15.709> filters<00:02:16.099> down<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.610> kids<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.030> I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
just filters down to the kids and I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.300 
just filters down to the kids and I
think<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.569> I'm<00:02:18.290> not<00:02:18.470> sure<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.799> instructors

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
think that I'm not sure the instructors

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.520 
think that I'm not sure the instructors
would<00:02:19.489> see<00:02:19.700> themselves<00:02:20.150> as<00:02:20.420> role<00:02:20.660> models<00:02:21.049> but

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
would see themselves as role models but

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.110 
would see themselves as role models but
I<00:02:21.590> think<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.010> these<00:02:22.190> kids<00:02:22.489> are<00:02:22.730> learning

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
I think that these kids are learning

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.089 
I think that these kids are learning
some<00:02:23.480> things<00:02:23.720> now<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:23.959> they<00:02:24.799> may<00:02:24.950> not

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
some things now that they may not

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.190 
some things now that they may not
realize<00:02:25.549> until<00:02:26.090> there<00:02:26.599> are<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.750> few<00:02:26.959> years

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
realize until there are a few years

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.229 
realize until there are a few years
older<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.709> they'll<00:02:27.860> look<00:02:28.010> back<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.519> say<00:02:28.700> well

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
older and they'll look back and say well

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.430 
older and they'll look back and say well
