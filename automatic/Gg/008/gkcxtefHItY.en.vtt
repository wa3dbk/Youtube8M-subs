00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.129
 everything flooded by people of 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.140
 people of bath addicted tourists 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.850
 terrible condition here can hardly be 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.890
 but you can see that she is there already 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.750
 She keeps us all bathing here 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.610

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.260
 Sawing nerves from the neck in the sense 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.989
 cameraman again here 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.360
 Today we make a nice abdominal muscle 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.040
 workout on the beach with me, of course 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.750
 these thousands of people here 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.770
 can present abdominal muscles and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.270
 envious looks at me 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.289
 I did not even think with you 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.270
 ever together are little ones 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.250
 abdominals breakout the whole leaves 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.720
 to do at any place 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.880
 just nice blanket so you do not 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.160
 with a sand lies then you lie down 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 on the blanket feet are open 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.530
 All this about here 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.259
 Angled state so what could 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.910
 being a 90 degree angle so as to in 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.550
 Do you serve yourself back? 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.200
 Forefinger put her to the sleeps 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.200
 and then we start 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.590
 game 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.480
 For beginners, it is recommended the chin 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.970
 to put on the breast so you the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.860
 Stress in abdominal area feels 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.720
 you should not be in it 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.550
 but have actually noticed 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.140
 that the abdomen has to work then 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.030
 Do you do your exercise properly and 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.490
 concentrates on the fact that the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.170
 abdominal muscles work so that you just 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.240
 everything doing right so far if you 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.010
 the whole exercise will rock you 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.690
 not the time i'm not there anymore 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.550
 Of course you have to think of yourself and what 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.530
 so you even more to the 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.190
 abdominal muscles arrive at the burden 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.590
 to increase 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.870
 I recommend you to the point of 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.630
 the most painful is for example the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.760
 Just stop here for a while 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.860
 Just this moment this pain 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.240
 enjoy a little bit there 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.800
 Of course, on the other side again 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.670
 restricts the moment again 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.290
 where the load is highest on it 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.000
 small moment endure isometric 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:16.690
 use loads and then again with 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.690
 carry on the usual repetitions 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.100
 my secret tip around the abdominal muscles too 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.860
 exercise is 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.630
 20 pieces left right alternately around the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.990
 Exercise lateral abdominal muscles 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.900
 and 20 pieces straight and at the end still 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.240
 once each five left and right agree 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.040
 to oblique so almost at the end again 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.600
 to turn the lateral abdominal muscles 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.500
 this is my secret tip for the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.900
 abdominal muscles 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.740
 The whole thing is natural with me now 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.740
 currently a snapshot 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.240
 Of course that is now a first 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.920
 certain status quo a snapshot 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.260
 I will do some more for you 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.310
 My abdominal muscles are set to open this year 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.160
 in any case, be something 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.560
 Body fat reduces muscle 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.700
 trained so should the whole be like one 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.700
 real baywatch
