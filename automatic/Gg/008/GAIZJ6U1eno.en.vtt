topography<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> sound<00:00:47.730> serenity<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:49.110> really

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
topography and sound serenity was really

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
topography and sound serenity was really
about<00:00:49.559> being<00:00:49.770> involved<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:50.879> pushing

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
about being involved is about pushing

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.290 
about being involved is about pushing
pause<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:52.050> taking<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> break<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:52.860> this

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
pause was about taking a break from this

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
pause was about taking a break from this
urban<00:00:54.300> life<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> place<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.100> was

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
urban life and going to a place that was

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.299 
urban life and going to a place that was
different<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> caused<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.500> stop<00:00:58.890> for

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
different it just caused you to stop for

different it just caused you to stop for
a<00:00:59.340> second<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> inspiration<00:01:00.629> was<00:01:00.660> essentially

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
a second the inspiration was essentially

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.529 
a second the inspiration was essentially
potato<00:01:01.559> chip<00:01:01.800> dropped<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> barge<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:03.239> create

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
potato chip dropped on a barge to create

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.210 
potato chip dropped on a barge to create
the<00:01:03.629> undulating<00:01:03.960> topography<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.710> exists<00:01:05.129> in

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the undulating topography that exists in

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.250 
the undulating topography that exists in
dunes<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> beach<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.990> create

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
dunes on the beach and how can we create

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.840 
dunes on the beach and how can we create
that<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> uniformed<00:01:08.340> way<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.729> had

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that in a uniformed way that had

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.940 
that in a uniformed way that had
proportion<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.479> scale<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.110> worked<00:01:10.740> within

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
proportion and scale and worked within

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
proportion and scale and worked within
the<00:01:11.040> base<00:01:11.340> plate<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.850> had<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.210> work<00:01:12.810> with

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the base plate that we had to work with

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.770 
the base plate that we had to work with
so<00:01:13.680> those<00:01:14.189> pringles<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> plate<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so those pringles on a plate I'm the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.999 
so those pringles on a plate I'm the
structural<00:01:16.140> engineer<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> project<00:01:16.590> so

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
structural engineer on the project so

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.800 
structural engineer on the project so
ultimately<00:01:17.250> Mike<00:01:17.700> my<00:01:18.060> role<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> make<00:01:18.780> sure

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
ultimately Mike my role is to make sure

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
ultimately Mike my role is to make sure
the<00:01:19.020> project<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.470> safe<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.369> also<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the project is safe but we also have the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
the project is safe but we also have the
opportunity<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.930> push<00:01:22.380> boundaries<00:01:22.740> in

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
opportunity to to push boundaries in

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.109 
opportunity to to push boundaries in
architecture<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.640> something<00:01:24.000> that's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
architecture and do something that's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.840 
architecture and do something that's
really<00:01:24.619> different<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.830> creative<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.460> think

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
really different and creative I think

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.160 
really different and creative I think
architecture<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.810> make<00:01:27.960> an<00:01:28.080> impact

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
architecture can really make an impact

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
architecture can really make an impact
on<00:01:28.530> people's<00:01:28.829> lives<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.000> change

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
on people's lives because it can change

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
on people's lives because it can change
the<00:01:30.509> way<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.780> feel<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.710> all<00:01:31.860> move<00:01:32.100> through<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the way they feel we all move through a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.490 
the way they feel we all move through a
busy<00:01:32.820> urban<00:01:32.850> environment<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.079> look<00:01:34.290> for

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
busy urban environment and we look for

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.929 
busy urban environment and we look for
moments<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.070> peace<00:01:35.369> moments<00:01:35.880> of

moments of peace moments of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.730 
moments of peace moments of
contemplation<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.900> architecture<00:01:37.590> can

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
contemplation and architecture can

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.319 
contemplation and architecture can
create<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.430> people<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.880> their<00:01:39.060> everyday
