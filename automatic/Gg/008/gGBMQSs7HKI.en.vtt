think<00:00:18.580> that<00:00:18.730> sounds<00:00:19.240> all<00:00:19.359> natural<00:00:19.720> from<00:00:19.960> the

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
think that sounds all natural from the

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.919 
think that sounds all natural from the
ground<00:00:20.320> well<00:00:21.279> it<00:00:21.849> is<00:00:22.060> natural<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:22.689> from<00:00:22.840> the

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
ground well it is natural and from the

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.439 
ground well it is natural and from the
ground<00:00:23.140> but<00:00:23.560> it's<00:00:23.949> a<00:00:24.099> byproduct<00:00:24.490> of<00:00:24.849> gasoline

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
ground but it's a byproduct of gasoline

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.870 
ground but it's a byproduct of gasoline
its<00:00:25.840> petroleum<00:00:26.679> so<00:00:27.720> 100%<00:00:28.720> baby<00:00:29.410> oil<00:00:29.740> is<00:00:30.130> 100%

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
its petroleum so 100% baby oil is 100%

mineral oil and petroleum jelly does in

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.010 
mineral oil and petroleum jelly does in
the<00:00:34.450> name<00:00:34.660> it's<00:00:35.350> not<00:00:35.680> only<00:00:35.950> incredibly<00:00:36.580> toxic

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the name it's not only incredibly toxic

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.680 
the name it's not only incredibly toxic
to<00:00:38.020> put<00:00:38.260> on<00:00:38.440> our<00:00:38.710> largest<00:00:39.210> organ<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.480> our

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
to put on our largest organ of our

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.860 
to put on our largest organ of our
bodies<00:00:41.140> that<00:00:41.470> is<00:00:42.430> so<00:00:42.820> good<00:00:43.120> at<00:00:43.240> absorbing

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
bodies that is so good at absorbing

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.080 
bodies that is so good at absorbing
things<00:00:44.080> I<00:00:44.380> mean<00:00:44.530> think<00:00:44.800> about<00:00:44.860> it<00:00:45.040> people<00:00:45.640> use

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
things I mean think about it people use

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.720 
things I mean think about it people use
patches<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:47.110> quit<00:00:47.350> smoking<00:00:47.800> they<00:00:48.040> use<00:00:48.280> it<00:00:48.490> to

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
patches to quit smoking they use it to

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.510 
patches to quit smoking they use it to
administer<00:00:49.350> birth<00:00:50.350> control<00:00:50.770> drugs<00:00:51.040> so<00:00:51.280> if

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
administer birth control drugs so if

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.670 
administer birth control drugs so if
your<00:00:52.000> skin<00:00:52.300> can<00:00:52.480> absorb<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:53.020> medicine<00:00:53.440> it's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
your skin can absorb the medicine it's

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.520 
your skin can absorb the medicine it's
also<00:00:53.890> absorbing<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:54.580> crap<00:00:54.790> so<00:00:55.720> it's<00:00:56.260> not<00:00:56.380> only

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
also absorbing the crap so it's not only

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.460 
also absorbing the crap so it's not only
toxic<00:00:57.100> but<00:00:57.280> mineral<00:00:57.640> oil<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.600> molecules<00:00:59.320> are

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
toxic but mineral oil the molecules are

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.910 
toxic but mineral oil the molecules are
so<00:00:59.710> big<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.520> it's<00:01:00.820> hard<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.720> it<00:01:02.410> lays<00:01:02.650> like<00:01:02.830> a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
so big that it's hard to it lays like a

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.700 
so big that it's hard to it lays like a
thick<00:01:03.190> layer<00:01:03.430> on<00:01:03.700> your<00:01:03.850> skin<00:01:04.180> and<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:05.379> doesn't

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
thick layer on your skin and it doesn't

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.069 
thick layer on your skin and it doesn't
allow<00:01:05.920> for<00:01:05.950> anything<00:01:06.520> else<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:07.060> get<00:01:07.299> in<00:01:07.450> so<00:01:07.810> if

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
allow for anything else to get in so if

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.980 
allow for anything else to get in so if
a<00:01:08.859> lotion<00:01:09.340> says<00:01:09.729> oh<00:01:09.850> it's<00:01:10.090> got<00:01:10.270> vitamin<00:01:10.780> E<00:01:10.929> and

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
a lotion says oh it's got vitamin E and

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.260 
a lotion says oh it's got vitamin E and
an<00:01:11.439> L<00:01:12.039> o<00:01:12.219> and<00:01:12.549> blah<00:01:12.729> blah<00:01:12.759> blah

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.330 
an L o and blah blah blah
well<00:01:13.780> that's<00:01:13.960> great<00:01:14.200> but<00:01:14.710> if<00:01:14.799> it<00:01:14.890> has<00:01:15.009> mineral

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340

quick little demo with putting a regular
cracker<00:01:22.869> into<00:01:23.799> a<00:01:24.070> couple<00:01:24.609> of<00:01:24.640> glasses<00:01:24.909> one

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
cracker into a couple of glasses one

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.969

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
half percent mineral oil the other one

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.660 
half percent mineral oil the other one
will<00:01:28.719> be<00:01:28.840> water<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:30.189> other<00:01:30.219> one<00:01:30.490> will<00:01:30.640> be

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
will be water the other one will be

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.410 
will be water the other one will be
coconut<00:01:31.179> oil<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:32.170> make<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.469> a<00:01:32.530> little<00:01:32.649> messy

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
coconut oil and make it a little messy

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.139 
coconut oil and make it a little messy
so<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:35.229> way<00:01:35.409> over<00:01:36.219> just<00:01:36.429> a<00:01:36.549> short<00:01:36.819> period<00:01:36.999> of

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
so this way over just a short period of

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.370 
so this way over just a short period of
time<00:01:37.210> you'll<00:01:37.539> see<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:39.490> your<00:01:39.999> skin<00:01:40.270> can<00:01:41.140> absorb

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
time you'll see how your skin can absorb

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.029 
time you'll see how your skin can absorb
or<00:01:41.920> cannot<00:01:42.280> absorb<00:01:42.670> certain<00:01:43.479> things<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.920> we're

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
or cannot absorb certain things so we're

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.039 
or cannot absorb certain things so we're
going<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.189> put<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.789> cracker<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.389> this<00:01:46.749> coconut

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
going to put the cracker in this coconut

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.129 
going to put the cracker in this coconut
oil<00:01:47.469> and<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:49.149> we're<00:01:49.270> going<00:01:49.389> to<00:01:49.420> put<00:01:49.719> the

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
oil and then we're going to put the

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.999 
oil and then we're going to put the
cracker<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:51.039> water<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.770> we're<00:01:53.859> going<00:01:53.950> to

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
cracker in water and then we're going to

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.669 
cracker in water and then we're going to
put<00:01:54.219> this<00:01:54.579> cracker<00:01:54.939> in<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.659> mineral<00:01:55.990> oil<00:01:56.049> so

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
put this cracker in the mineral oil so

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:57.809 
put this cracker in the mineral oil so
I'm<00:01:56.740> going<00:01:56.859> to<00:01:56.889> let<00:01:57.009> everything<00:01:57.249> sit<00:01:57.609> for<00:01:57.789> a

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
I'm going to let everything sit for a

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.749 
I'm going to let everything sit for a
little<00:01:57.909> while<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:59.649> all<00:01:59.770> know<00:02:00.069> that<00:02:00.340> crackers

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
little while we all know that crackers

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.209 
little while we all know that crackers
