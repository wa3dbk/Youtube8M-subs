guys all you do get two of each so you

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.829 
guys all you do get two of each so you

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
do get two clones and two droids which I

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.930 
do get two clones and two droids which I
kind<00:01:02.140> of<00:01:02.199> wish<00:01:02.350> they<00:01:03.159> would<00:01:03.370> not<00:01:03.610> have<00:01:03.790> done

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
kind of wish they would not have done

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.730 
kind of wish they would not have done
this<00:01:04.120> I<00:01:04.269> like<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.900> better<00:01:05.019> when<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.229> get<00:01:05.409> four

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
this I like it better when you get four

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.460 
this I like it better when you get four
of<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.040> same<00:01:06.430> outside<00:01:06.909> like<00:01:07.840> if<00:01:07.960> we<00:01:08.049> got<00:01:08.170> four

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
of the same outside like if we got four

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.250 
of the same outside like if we got four
clones<00:01:08.770> but<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:10.120> minifigs<00:01:10.510> are<00:01:10.720> pretty<00:01:10.990> cool

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
clones but the minifigs are pretty cool

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.620 
clones but the minifigs are pretty cool
so<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.770> do<00:01:11.890> get<00:01:12.040> an<00:01:12.250> arc<00:01:12.640> trooper<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.299> this<00:01:13.479> is

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
so you do get an arc trooper and this is

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.370 
so you do get an arc trooper and this is
different<00:01:13.870> from<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.560> arc<00:01:14.710> trooper<00:01:15.070> from<00:01:15.250> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
different from the arc trooper from the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.590 
different from the arc trooper from the
2011<00:01:17.380> battle<00:01:17.920> pack<00:01:18.100> he<00:01:18.700> does<00:01:18.880> have<00:01:19.090> the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
2011 battle pack he does have the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.130

red color printing on his helmet and the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.530 
red color printing on his helmet and the
printing<00:01:25.690> design<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:26.470> different<00:01:27.390> from<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
printing design is different from the

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.720

our<00:01:28.630> other<00:01:28.870> our<00:01:29.230> trooper<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.160> there's<00:01:30.670> a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730

you can put that way or you can put it
this<00:02:30.489> way<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.730> think<00:02:30.969> this<00:02:31.209> other

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
this way I think this other

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.000 
this way I think this other
böck<00:02:31.659> shows<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:33.569> but<00:02:34.569> it's<00:02:35.290> pretty<00:02:35.530> cool<00:02:35.650> nice

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
böck shows it but it's pretty cool nice

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.270 
böck shows it but it's pretty cool nice

we'll<00:03:58.900> put<00:03:59.049> our<00:03:59.290> earth<00:03:59.560> trooper<00:04:00.010> there<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:01.060> he

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
we'll put our earth trooper there and he

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.089 
we'll put our earth trooper there and he
has<00:04:01.810> this<00:04:01.959> little<00:04:02.109> control<00:04:02.560> thing<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:02.949> can

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
has this little control thing that can

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.990 
has this little control thing that can
come<00:04:03.250> up<00:04:05.069> for<00:04:06.069> some<00:04:06.250> reason<00:04:06.280> it's<00:04:06.579> I<00:04:06.699> like<00:04:06.879> a

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
come up for some reason it's I like a

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.080 
come up for some reason it's I like a
control<00:04:07.480> pad<00:04:07.720> it's<00:04:07.870> more<00:04:08.019> like<00:04:08.199> a<00:04:08.290> handle<00:04:08.799> bar

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
control pad it's more like a handle bar

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.030 
control pad it's more like a handle bar
which<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.239> kind<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.599> weird<00:04:10.810> with<00:04:11.470> respect<00:04:11.919> of

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
which is kind of weird with respect of

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.800 
which is kind of weird with respect of
control<00:04:12.459> pad<00:04:12.639> but<00:04:12.849> that's<00:04:13.120> okay<00:04:15.720> there<00:04:16.720> you

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
control pad but that's okay there you

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.699 
control pad but that's okay there you
can<00:04:16.959> see<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:18.639> still<00:04:18.940> hold<00:04:19.180> his<00:04:19.709> blaster

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
can see that it still hold his blaster

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.330 
can see that it still hold his blaster
and<00:04:21.030> then<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.539> turret<00:04:22.990> there's<00:04:23.650> no<00:04:23.830> crank<00:04:24.190> or

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and then the turret there's no crank or

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.339 
and then the turret there's no crank or
anything<00:04:24.520> but<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:24.970> can<00:04:25.210> use<00:04:25.630> your<00:04:25.750> hands<00:04:26.199> and

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
anything but you can use your hands and

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.820 
anything but you can use your hands and
rotate<00:04:26.889> it<00:04:27.270> your<00:04:28.270> fingers<00:04:28.630> rotate<00:04:29.349> up<00:04:29.650> and

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
rotate it your fingers rotate up and

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.670 
rotate it your fingers rotate up and
down<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.930> then<00:04:31.930> there's<00:04:32.139> a<00:04:32.320> foot<00:04:32.500> fire

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
down and then there's a foot fire

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.529 
down and then there's a foot fire
missile<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.760> drop<00:04:33.909> these<00:04:34.090> your<00:04:34.240> fingers

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
missile that you drop these your fingers

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.390 
missile that you drop these your fingers
you<00:04:34.690> can<00:04:34.720> use<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.110> function<00:04:35.349> and<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:35.830> push

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
you can use this function and just push

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.820 
you can use this function and just push
that<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:36.880> it<00:04:37.000> shoots<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.360> out<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:38.560> it<00:04:38.620> makes<00:04:38.770> a

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
that and it shoots it out so it makes a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.200 
that and it shoots it out so it makes a
lot<00:04:38.949> more<00:04:39.099> powerful<00:04:39.430> than<00:04:39.610> if<00:04:39.849> you<00:04:39.969> were<00:04:40.090> to

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
lot more powerful than if you were to

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.200 
lot more powerful than if you were to
use<00:04:40.389> your<00:04:40.570> fingers<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.550> then<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.729> actual

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
use your fingers and then the actual

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.189 
use your fingers and then the actual
turret

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
turret

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.469 
turret
the<00:04:44.379> part<00:04:45.129> that<00:04:45.279> would<00:04:45.370> shoot<00:04:45.879> the<00:04:46.029> bullets<00:04:46.360> or

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
the part that would shoot the bullets or

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.480 
the part that would shoot the bullets or
whatever<00:04:46.719> it<00:04:46.870> is<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.169> you're<00:04:47.289> shooting<00:04:47.490> it's

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
whatever it is that you're shooting it's

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.320 
whatever it is that you're shooting it's
kind<00:04:48.789> of<00:04:48.879> small<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.270> thought<00:04:49.800> not<00:04:50.800> too<00:04:51.069> long<00:04:51.340> but

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
kind of small I thought not too long but

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.050 
kind of small I thought not too long but
that's<00:04:52.719> okay<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.110> do<00:04:53.379> get<00:04:53.560> four<00:04:54.009> legs<00:04:54.279> also<00:04:54.729> on

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
that's okay you do get four legs also on

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.510 
that's okay you do get four legs also on
it<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.389> rotate<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.099> then<00:04:57.099> you<00:04:57.219> get<00:04:57.370> this

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
it that rotate and then you get this

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.429 
it that rotate and then you get this
queer<00:04:57.849> piece<00:04:58.029> on<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.300> bottom<00:04:58.629> to<00:04:58.810> stabilize

00:04:59.429 --> 00:04:59.439 
queer piece on the bottom to stabilize

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.899 
queer piece on the bottom to stabilize
it<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.659> that<00:05:01.659> is<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:01.960> for<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.199> set<00:05:02.469> part<00:05:02.909> here's

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
it so that is it for the set part here's

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.540 
it so that is it for the set part here's
what<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.300> box<00:05:04.659> look<00:05:04.900> like<00:05:07.439> on<00:05:08.439> the<00:05:09.159> back<00:05:09.310> it

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
what the box look like on the back it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.700 
what the box look like on the back it
shows<00:05:09.580> different<00:05:10.449> functions<00:05:10.870> of<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:12.629> and<00:05:13.710> then

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
shows different functions of it and then

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.249 
shows different functions of it and then
just<00:05:14.740> some<00:05:15.279> little<00:05:15.370> battles<00:05:15.939> going<00:05:16.330> on<00:05:16.479> here's

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
just some little battles going on here's

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
what the instruction manual click and

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.029 
what the instruction manual click and
this<00:05:18.879> is<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.240> mini<00:05:19.870> instruction<00:05:20.379> manual<00:05:20.710> some

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
this is the mini instruction manual some

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.920 
this is the mini instruction manual some
other<00:05:21.189> battle<00:05:21.520> packs<00:05:21.699> or<00:05:22.330> most<00:05:22.599> of<00:05:22.689> all<00:05:22.779> the

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
other ones had the larger one but this

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.179 
other ones had the larger one but this
is<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.449> mini<00:05:25.689> version<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:27.120> it<00:05:28.120> has<00:05:28.889> 26<00:05:29.889> pages

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:30.189 
is the mini version and it has 26 pages

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:31.890 
is the mini version and it has 26 pages
of<00:05:30.520> instruction<00:05:30.999> steps<00:05:31.300> normally<00:05:31.659> battle

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
of instruction steps normally battle

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.829 
of instruction steps normally battle
packs<00:05:32.080> have<00:05:32.199> 19<00:05:32.830> so<00:05:33.520> that's<00:05:34.330> just<00:05:34.479> again

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839 
packs have 19 so that's just again

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.659 
packs have 19 so that's just again
because<00:05:35.259> there's<00:05:35.439> a<00:05:35.499> larger<00:05:35.860> piece<00:05:36.039> count<00:05:36.310> now

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
because there's a larger piece count now

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.029 
because there's a larger piece count now
you<00:05:36.759> can<00:05:36.909> sell<00:05:37.089> the<00:05:37.180> pieces<00:05:37.539> do<00:05:38.349> get<00:05:38.529> a<00:05:38.740> good

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
you can sell the pieces do get a good

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.409 
you can sell the pieces do get a good
number<00:05:39.219> of<00:05:39.339> them<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:39.729> this<00:05:39.819> is<00:05:39.879> actually<00:05:40.240> good

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
number of them so this is actually good

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.540 
number of them so this is actually good
if<00:05:40.539> you<00:05:40.659> want<00:05:40.839> to<00:05:40.990> build<00:05:41.830> some<00:05:42.099> other<00:05:42.219> Star
