 beautiful juicy shades in the photo and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.510
 that's why I recorded this

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.280
 You can take any of your 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.900
 and try this treatment on it in 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.870
 first of all we need you 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.460
 convert photo from p mode 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.260
 lived in lab mode 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.430
 for this we go to the point 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.869
 Images here select the item mode 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.350
 so we are interested here lab mode 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.680
 we choose it so we have a photo 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.540
 transferred to the new mode now 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.280
 duplicate layer click combination 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.090
 control jay on the keyboard and on 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.310

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.740
 image correction choose here 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:33.729
 item curves here we have in this item 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.770
 there are three channels brightness and channel a 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.300
 and channel b first go to channel a and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.870
 dragging a curve like this 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.840
 way 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.610
 about 3 squares shift it 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.850
 from the bottom and on 3 squares we shift and and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:02:00.270
 top this way too 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 do in channel b so the same thing here 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.390
 as you can see on the essence of our picture already 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.960
 rose 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.130
 Do not worry if the photo looks 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.750
 oversaturated in the future we are all this 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.650
 fix and just go to the channel 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.830
 brightness and adjust contrast here 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.690
 Well, at your request, that is, as you 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.450
 more like something like this 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.610
 leave a little curve 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.890
 small letter s 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.880
 click ok here and we have with you 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.920
 these settings are saved to a new layer 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.800
 as a result, we get just such a perry 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.800
 rich photo 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.709
 to get rid of unnecessary 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.550
 Saturation is enough for us 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.700
 lower the transparency of this layer 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:56.030
 I usually put the value around 50 or 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.890
 40 percent depending on the picture 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.860
 these values ​​may differ for you 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.050
 try experimenting and when you have 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.410

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.769
 the values ​​you need and so here we are 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.080
