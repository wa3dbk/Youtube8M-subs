a<00:00:05.750> ton<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.779> those<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.859> got<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.130> little<00:00:08.700> Newton

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
a ton of those we got a little Newton

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.990 
a ton of those we got a little Newton
duo<00:00:09.990> for<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.500> here<00:00:10.740> Doug's<00:00:11.429> been<00:00:11.670> chaining

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
duo for you here Doug's been chaining

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.930 
duo for you here Doug's been chaining
them<00:00:12.090> both<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.450> these<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.400> we<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
them both of these and we have the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.230 
them both of these and we have the
Newton<00:00:15.780> gravity<00:00:16.529> neutral<00:00:16.949> trainer<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
Newton gravity neutral trainer and the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.310 
Newton gravity neutral trainer and the
Newton<00:00:18.630> distance<00:00:19.490> new<00:00:20.510> neutral<00:00:21.510> trainer<00:00:21.779> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
Newton distance new neutral trainer and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.689 
Newton distance new neutral trainer and
essentially<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.310> know<00:00:23.430> what's<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
essentially you know what's the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
essentially you know what's the
difference<00:00:24.060> right<00:00:24.240> away<00:00:24.449> get<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> specs

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
difference right away get you the specs

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.109 
difference right away get you the specs
as<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.980> go<00:00:26.099> through<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.460> basically<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
as we go through this basically a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
as we go through this basically a
gravity<00:00:27.539> trainer<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.439> Newton's<00:00:29.310> line<00:00:29.490> right

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
gravity trainer in Newton's line right

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.580 
gravity trainer in Newton's line right
now<00:00:29.910> we'll<00:00:30.480> give<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> action<00:00:31.410> reaction

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
now we'll give you the action reaction

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.130 
now we'll give you the action reaction
technology<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> forefoot<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
technology in the forefoot and in the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
technology in the forefoot and in the
hill<00:00:34.320> when<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.100> go<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.460> lighter<00:00:35.790> weight

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
hill when you go to a lighter weight

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.639 
hill when you go to a lighter weight
shoe<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.780> basically<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.230> high<00:00:37.410> mileage

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
shoe this is basically a high mileage

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.740 
shoe this is basically a high mileage
trainer<00:00:38.129> okay<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:39.120> their<00:00:39.450> stuffs<00:00:39.690> pretty

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
trainer okay all their stuffs pretty

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
trainer okay all their stuffs pretty
lightweight<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.500> pretty<00:00:40.680> level<00:00:41.070> filling<00:00:41.460> low

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
lightweight and pretty level filling low

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.610 
lightweight and pretty level filling low
profile<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> give<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
profile but this is going to give you a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.470 
profile but this is going to give you a
little<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.010> under<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.309> foot<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:45.329> when

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
little more under your foot then when

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.709 
little more under your foot then when
you<00:00:45.570> move<00:00:45.719> into<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.739> distance<00:00:47.370> trainer<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you move into the distance trainer the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.180 
you move into the distance trainer the
neutral<00:00:49.110> version<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.649> you're<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> get

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
neutral version here you're going to get

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.580 
neutral version here you're going to get
action<00:00:50.640> reaction<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> front<00:00:51.570> end<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.379> not

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
action reaction in the front end but not

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
action reaction in the front end but not
in<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> hill<00:00:53.039> action<00:00:53.730> reaction<00:00:53.879> technology

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
in the hill action reaction technology

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
in the hill action reaction technology
we've<00:00:54.930> shown<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.440> some<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> our<00:00:55.860> other

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
we've shown you on some of our other

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430 
we've shown you on some of our other
videos<00:00:56.180> previously<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.870> goes<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.230> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
videos previously but what goes on is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.260 
videos previously but what goes on is
there's<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> chamber<00:00:58.980> actually<00:00:59.579> inside<00:01:00.030> this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
there's a chamber actually inside this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
there's a chamber actually inside this
rubber<00:01:00.690> area<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> shoe<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.190> will

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
rubber area of the shoe that this will

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.729 
rubber area of the shoe that this will
come<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.960> sitting<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.470> top

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
come in to because it's sitting on top

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.320 
come in to because it's sitting on top
of<00:01:04.799> rubber<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.309> rubber<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> then

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
of rubber that rubber is going to then

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
of rubber that rubber is going to then
bounce<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.409> tennis<00:01:07.799> racket<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
bounce back like a tennis racket and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.370 
bounce back like a tennis racket and
what<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.939> does<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.330> absorb<00:01:09.630> shock<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
what it does is absorb shock but you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
what it does is absorb shock but you
also<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.010> rebound<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.909> instead

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
also get some rebound for that instead

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
also get some rebound for that instead
of<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.840> shoe<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.470> got<00:01:13.650> regular<00:01:14.100> blown

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of a shoe that's just got regular blown

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
of a shoe that's just got regular blown
rubber<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> lot<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> times<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
rubber on it you know a lot of times you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.469 
rubber on it you know a lot of times you
lose<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.009> response<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.240> these

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
lose some of that response and so these

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390 
lose some of that response and so these
give<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> response<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
give you a response they will have that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
give you a response they will have that
in<00:01:20.700> their<00:01:20.880> gravity<00:01:21.360> trainers<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.170> hill<00:01:22.350> as

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
in their gravity trainers in the hill as

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.440 
in their gravity trainers in the hill as
well<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.310> are<00:01:23.340> someone<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.210> has<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
well so if you are someone that has a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
well so if you are someone that has a
bit<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.960> hill<00:01:25.170> strike<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
bit of a hill strike you're gonna get a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.249 
bit of a hill strike you're gonna get a
little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:27.060> protection<00:01:27.299> from<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> in

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
little bit more protection from that in

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.749 
little bit more protection from that in
this<00:01:28.439> than<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.040> will<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> distance

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
this than you will in the distance

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
this than you will in the distance
trainer<00:01:30.000> okay<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.140> let's<00:01:31.740> start<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
trainer okay so let's start with the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
trainer okay so let's start with the
distance<00:01:32.759> trainer<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.259> you've

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
distance trainer because we know you've

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.280 
distance trainer because we know you've
been<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> little<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.369> longer<00:01:36.290> how

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
been in that a little bit longer how

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.550 
been in that a little bit longer how
many<00:01:37.470> miles<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.070> far<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.880> got<00:01:39.030> in

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
many miles so far you think you got in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.880 
many miles so far you think you got in
probably<00:01:40.560> about<00:01:40.680> 100<00:01:41.009> miles<00:01:41.159> okay<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.890> wear

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
probably about 100 miles okay and wear

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.920 
probably about 100 miles okay and wear
and<00:01:44.070> tear<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:45.149> we're<00:01:45.360> starting<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.780> see

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and tear you know we're starting to see

there's<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.870> little<00:02:34.050> we're<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:34.800> just

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
there's a little we're on this one just

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.470 
there's a little we're on this one just
because<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> treadmill<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.300> one

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
because of the treadmill but on this one

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.420 
because of the treadmill but on this one
you<00:02:36.720> can't<00:02:36.930> even<00:02:37.170> hardly<00:02:37.260> tell<00:02:37.620> anywhere<00:02:38.100> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
you can't even hardly tell anywhere and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.580 
you can't even hardly tell anywhere and
everything<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.350> just

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
everything is just you just

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.520 
everything is just you just
automatically<00:02:41.459> your<00:02:42.120> body<00:02:42.390> starts<00:02:43.019> adjusting

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
automatically your body starts adjusting

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.020 
automatically your body starts adjusting
to<00:02:43.680> your<00:02:43.830> running<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:44.430> great

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
essentially 100 miles just starting to

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.270 
essentially 100 miles just starting to
show<00:02:47.459> where<00:02:47.880> they're<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.890> far<00:02:50.160> I've

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
show where they're on this so far I've

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.009 
show where they're on this so far I've
never<00:02:50.489> had<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> Newton<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.300> didn't<00:02:51.569> last<00:02:51.720> you

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
never had a Newton that didn't last you

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.890 
never had a Newton that didn't last you
know<00:02:52.140> they're<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.370> 350<00:02:54.150> mile<00:02:54.360> minimum

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
know they're the the 350 mile minimum

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.509 
know they're the the 350 mile minimum
that<00:02:55.019> people<00:02:55.350> want<00:02:55.530> their<00:02:55.680> shoes<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.040> last<00:02:56.250> and

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
that people want their shoes to last and

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.940 
that people want their shoes to last and
on<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.360> contrary<00:02:57.750> mine<00:02:58.019> have<00:02:58.170> lasted<00:02:58.650> you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
on the contrary mine have lasted you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.009 
on the contrary mine have lasted you
know<00:02:59.069> up<00:02:59.250> into<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.610> 400<00:03:00.150> mile<00:03:00.330> range<00:03:00.630> these

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
know up into the 400 mile range these

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.270 
know up into the 400 mile range these
have<00:03:01.319> oh<00:03:02.959> these<00:03:03.959> are<00:03:04.200> probably<00:03:04.530> only<00:03:04.800> around

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
have oh these are probably only around

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.740 
have oh these are probably only around
the<00:03:05.370> hundred<00:03:05.640> miles<00:03:05.850> as<00:03:06.090> well<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.510> just

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the hundred miles as well you just

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.000 
the hundred miles as well you just
started<00:03:07.050> training<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.500> merabh<00:03:07.800> with

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
started training in a merabh with

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.970 
started training in a merabh with
training<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.610> prior<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.819> that<00:03:09.120> and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
training and and prior to that and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.340 
training and and prior to that and
really<00:03:10.980> about<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.760> same<00:03:12.000> where<00:03:12.690> look<00:03:13.049> as

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
really about the same where look as

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
these so we're gonna kind of let them

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.110 
these so we're gonna kind of let them
keep<00:03:16.620> training<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.400> them<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.640> see<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.030> we'll

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
keep training in them and see and we'll

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.819 
keep training in them and see and we'll
give<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> final<00:03:18.900> impressions<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.590> fainting

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
give you a final impressions of fainting

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
high-mileage training shoe it's

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.350 
high-mileage training shoe it's
something<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.360> reminds<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.049> nicely<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:26.700> mid

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360
