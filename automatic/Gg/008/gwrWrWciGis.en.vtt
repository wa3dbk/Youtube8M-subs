00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:07.779
 through how to go to the servers of 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.370
 google games the first thing we have to 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.519
 do in the menu 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.109
 multiplayer 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.330
 and here I already have the server but good 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.330
 it's going to come out like the notes that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.599
 A) Yes 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.119
 and what we have to do is 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.559
 copy what I'm going to leave the 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.840
 description that are the ip you have the 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.740
 server address or each 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.090
 computer has one time 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.560
 and it shows what we're going to play the ip of 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.680
 server is to know one of the problems 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.610
 that this one is not going to do 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 if it were really 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.710
 we place it although we want it to 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.329
 be highlighted for example if they are children 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.059
 of man does not have to be the game of 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.369
 Hunger can be anything else if 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.530
 we give it to you ready and it will be here 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.750
 when then that is something you 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.970
 I have to double click and we have already 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.800
 entered but to enter we have to be 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.800
 He commented then there are three maps 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.789
 and I'm watching the players 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.390
 like when one dies then how do we 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.230
 we remove those by squeezing and we write 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.980
 then we place 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.980
 the pretty 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.150
 and it will take us to not necessarily this 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.270
 site to another then what we have to 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.470
 to do is not to this compass we give 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.700
 double click right and its noise to gay 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.980
 and here this will appear here for 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.890
 get us have to go to class 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.900
 example here says lobby liberally 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.890
 means lobby that has not started yet 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.890
 but that is about to start 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.810
 like it's starting here is the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.750
 goal game comes to the game of match is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.319
 that are ending I said that still 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.319
 missing 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.820
 we put 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.920
 that 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:44.310
 and is that as this time of night does not 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.310
 there is almost nobody in both the 20 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.610
 And I want to show everything that 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.610
 do 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.520
 then what 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.510
 we can 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.260
 5 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.590
 reaching for that we have to place 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.590
 after 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:22.780
 vote in the we would not like but the cynical 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.120
 we started 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.520
 and we will have five and if there will be scope 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.790
 the 5 and continues from my voice votes 011 now 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.329
 if we give the boat 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.010
 will have a because it will be my vote and the button 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:43.390
 with more than it will be 9 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.960
 there with enter the map number 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.960
 one 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.530
 and when it appears you can play 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.280
 quietly 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.310
 and good is the oblivion of today but that 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.310
 please I mentioned it and
