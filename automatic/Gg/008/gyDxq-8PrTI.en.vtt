hey guys so today I want to compare it
in<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.399> iPhone<00:00:02.790> 5s<00:00:03.360> versus<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.529> Nokia<00:00:04.950> Lumia

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
in the iPhone 5s versus the Nokia Lumia

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.490 
in the iPhone 5s versus the Nokia Lumia
630<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.180> asphalt<00:00:06.359> 8<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.230> could<00:00:07.410> be

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
630 in asphalt 8 and this could be

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500 
630 in asphalt 8 and this could be
pretty<00:00:07.649> fun<00:00:07.770> because<00:00:08.130> these<00:00:08.849> devices<00:00:09.059> they're

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
pretty fun because these devices they're

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.900 
pretty fun because these devices they're
a<00:00:09.540> big<00:00:09.780> price<00:00:10.050> difference<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.759> play

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
a big price difference and you can play

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.280 
a big price difference and you can play
in<00:00:11.969> both<00:00:12.120> games<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.599> both<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:12.960> two<00:00:13.110> devices

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
in both games on both these two devices

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.580 
in both games on both these two devices
but<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:14.009> cost<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:14.580> only<00:00:15.179> 25%<00:00:16.139> or

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
but this one cost like only 25% or

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.830 
but this one cost like only 25% or
something<00:00:16.980> or<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> price<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.180> an<00:00:18.300> iPhone<00:00:18.390> 5s

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
something or the price of an iPhone 5s

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.830 
something or the price of an iPhone 5s
so<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.859> know<00:00:19.980> why<00:00:20.910> willing<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.330> pick<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.539> up<00:00:21.630> if

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
so you know why willing to pick it up if

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.660 
so you know why willing to pick it up if
it<00:00:21.990> works<00:00:22.140> awesome<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.800> let's<00:00:23.369> check<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.180> out

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.290 

so<00:00:29.670> use<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> quick<00:00:30.869> little<00:00:31.019> race<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.300> can

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
so use do a quick little race here I can

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.280 
so use do a quick little race here I can
all<00:00:33.390> right<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.840> right<00:00:33.930> now<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.170> gonna

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
all right that all right now it's gonna

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.950 
all right that all right now it's gonna
be<00:00:34.440> way<00:00:34.590> better<00:00:34.620> graphics<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> air<00:00:35.960> 5s

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
be way better graphics on the air 5s

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.709 
be way better graphics on the air 5s
guess<00:00:37.890> that's<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.340> powerful<00:00:38.670> internals

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
start here with the iPhone 5s with this

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:39.300 
start here with the iPhone 5s with this
little<00:01:32.230> game<00:01:32.380> here

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.170 

so<00:01:39.880> first<00:01:40.119> of<00:01:40.330> all<00:01:40.450> all<00:01:40.810> games<00:01:41.710> all<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.909> iOS

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
so first of all all games all to iOS

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.170 
so first of all all games all to iOS
games<00:01:43.540> or<00:01:44.020> it's<00:01:44.200> amazing<00:01:44.650> on<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.850> latest

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
games or it's amazing on to latest

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.960 
games or it's amazing on to latest
iPhone<00:01:46.570> it's<00:01:47.350> pretty<00:01:47.710> crazy<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.340> mean<00:01:48.490> Android

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
iPhone it's pretty crazy I mean Android

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.260 
iPhone it's pretty crazy I mean Android
and<00:01:49.240> Windows<00:01:49.720> Phone<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.440> not<00:01:50.650> even<00:01:50.890> close<00:01:51.190> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and Windows Phone is not even close to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
and Windows Phone is not even close to
the<00:01:52.270> smoothness<00:01:52.810> here<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.970> optimizations

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the smoothness here in the optimizations

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.320 
the smoothness here in the optimizations
amanda<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.220> like<00:01:57.610> really<00:01:57.940> if<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.090> want<00:01:58.270> to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
amanda is like really if you want to

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.600 
amanda is like really if you want to
have<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.540> best<00:01:58.780> performance<00:01:59.080> ever<00:01:59.649> possible

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
have the best performance ever possible

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.410 
have the best performance ever possible
I<00:02:01.380> mean<00:02:02.380> there's<00:02:03.040> nothing<00:02:03.190> beating<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.000> 5s

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
I mean there's nothing beating the 5s

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.660 
I mean there's nothing beating the 5s
here

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.050 

and<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.840> one<00:02:11.110> reason<00:02:11.380> why<00:02:11.849> Apple<00:02:12.849> devices

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and the one reason why Apple devices

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.350 
and the one reason why Apple devices
could<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:13.750> good<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.349> because<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.970> low

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
could be this good is because of the low

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.300 
could be this good is because of the low
resolution<00:02:16.630> display<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.500> high<00:02:17.890> phones<00:02:18.130> are

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
resolution display that high phones are

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.790 
resolution display that high phones are
pretty<00:02:18.459> small<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.060> they<00:02:19.599> can<00:02:19.810> get<00:02:20.380> away<00:02:20.500> with

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
pretty small and they can get away with

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.309 
pretty small and they can get away with
the<00:02:20.920> little<00:02:21.040> square<00:02:21.370> solution<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:23.140> it's<00:02:23.260> a

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
the little square solution but it's a

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.600 
the little square solution but it's a
lot<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.530> Android<00:02:23.800> smartphones<00:02:24.280> with<00:02:24.459> us

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
lot of Android smartphones with us

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.120 
lot of Android smartphones with us
better<00:02:25.150> displays<00:02:25.660> more<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:26.560> terms<00:02:26.980> of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
better displays more in terms of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.470 
better displays more in terms of
resolution<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:28.950> yeah<00:02:30.150> that's<00:02:31.150> not<00:02:31.239> always

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
resolution but yeah that's not always

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.410 
resolution but yeah that's not always
good<00:02:31.810> for<00:02:32.050> performance<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.850> amazing

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
good for performance so amazing

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.479 
good for performance so amazing
performance<00:02:37.840> here<00:02:38.080> but<00:02:38.890> we'll<00:02:39.010> check<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.370> out

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
performance here but we'll check it out

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.640 
performance here but we'll check it out
here<00:02:39.760> also<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.440> low-end<00:02:41.440> device<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:43.650> even

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
here also on a low-end device and even

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.820 
here also on a low-end device and even
though<00:02:44.800> it's<00:02:45.100> not<00:02:45.430> as<00:02:45.819> good<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.660> gotta<00:02:47.319> say<00:02:47.620> it's

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
though it's not as good I gotta say it's

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.460 
though it's not as good I gotta say it's
super<00:02:48.760> super<00:02:48.910> impressive<00:02:51.930> you're<00:02:52.930> gonna<00:02:53.230> feel

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
super super impressive you're gonna feel

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.770 
super super impressive you're gonna feel
I<00:02:53.769> mean<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.069> smoothness<00:02:54.549> that<00:02:54.580> it's<00:02:55.390> not<00:02:55.510> even

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
I mean the smoothness that it's not even

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.340 
I mean the smoothness that it's not even
close<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:58.150> were<00:02:58.360> really<00:02:58.810> waiting<00:02:59.080> on

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
close but you were really waiting on

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:07.020 
close but you were really waiting on
expert<00:02:59.709> advice<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:06.519> gotta<00:03:06.730> get<00:03:06.880> some

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
expert advice and you gotta get some

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:17.140 
expert advice and you gotta get some
food<00:03:07.209> as<00:03:07.360> carefully<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:07.930> one

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.940 

but<00:03:17.720> then<00:03:17.870> again<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.379> see<00:03:18.530> I'm<00:03:18.620> eating<00:03:18.769> the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
but then again I can see I'm eating the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.229 
but then again I can see I'm eating the
source<00:03:19.220> graphics<00:03:19.700> also<00:03:19.849> way<00:03:20.150> higher<00:03:20.360> only<00:03:20.930> 5s

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
source graphics also way higher only 5s
