00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
a while to make I must admit because I

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
a while to make I must admit because I
had<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> replace<00:00:42.239> all<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.870> sandstone

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
had to replace all this with sandstone

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.790 
had to replace all this with sandstone
at<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> very<00:00:44.040> bottom<00:00:44.480> which<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.620> took

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
at the very bottom which was and it took

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.830 
at the very bottom which was and it took
a<00:00:46.890> long<00:00:47.010> time<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.600> there's<00:00:48.600> other<00:00:48.690> things

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

as<00:01:09.990> always<00:01:10.400> saw<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.520> other<00:01:11.700> other<00:01:13.040> options<00:01:14.040> i

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
as always saw with other other options i

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.450 
as always saw with other other options i
guess<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.439> i<00:01:16.530> turn<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.009> waiver<00:01:17.220> on

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
guess like so if i turn the waiver on

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.510 
guess like so if i turn the waiver on
boom<00:01:18.200> up<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.850> elevator<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.770> yeah<00:01:22.770> so

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.260 

if<00:01:28.570> I<00:01:28.780> turn<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.140> on<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:30.220> Pistons<00:01:30.460> are<00:01:30.909> pushed

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
if I turn it on the Pistons are pushed

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.020 
if I turn it on the Pistons are pushed
