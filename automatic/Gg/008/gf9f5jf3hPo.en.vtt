uppercut will do you can use it as an
anti-air<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.130> use<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.790> getup<00:01:39.119> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
anti-air you can use it as a getup it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.450 
anti-air you can use it as a getup it's
that<00:01:39.509> kind<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.500> works<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.250> well

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that kind of and it works really well

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.630 
that kind of and it works really well
for<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.820> however<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> keep<00:01:42.840> pressing

for that however if you keep pressing
the<00:01:44.640> second<00:01:45.030> special<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:47.630> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the second special you will do this and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
that's with three charges so you do

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.609 
that's with three charges so you do
pretty<00:01:51.299> good<00:01:51.479> damage<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.990> juggling<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.590> a

greatest things you can do by knocking
them<00:02:00.810> off<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.229> wall<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.520> combos

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
them off of that wall is it combos

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.289 
them off of that wall is it combos
directly<00:02:03.299> into<00:02:03.450> your<00:02:03.570> super<00:02:05.030> maybe<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.180> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
directly into your super maybe if I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.499 
directly into your super maybe if I
should<00:02:06.479> charge<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:07.459> my<00:02:08.459> little<00:02:08.789> sore<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.060> so

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
should charge my my little sore here so

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.630 
should charge my my little sore here so
you<00:02:09.569> might<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.959> asking<00:02:10.229> well<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:11.280> kind<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you might be asking well it's kind of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.850 
you might be asking well it's kind of
hard<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.209> charge<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> sword<00:02:13.170> because

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
hard to charge the sword because

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.350 
hard to charge the sword because
this<00:02:13.980> gave<00:02:14.130> me<00:02:14.220> very<00:02:14.490> very<00:02:14.610> defensive<00:02:15.240> and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
this gave me very very defensive and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.300 
this gave me very very defensive and
it's<00:02:15.510> kind<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.260> hard<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.890> charged<00:02:17.160> up

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it's kind of hard to get that charged up

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.470 
it's kind of hard to get that charged up
because<00:02:17.490> they<00:02:17.610> get<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.790> charge<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.270> need<00:02:18.390> to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
because they get that charge you need to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.420 
because they get that charge you need to
connect<00:02:18.900> with<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.140> hit<00:02:19.350> they<00:02:19.830> can't<00:02:20.100> block<00:02:20.370> it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
connect with the hit they can't block it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.000 
connect with the hit they can't block it
so<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.180> thing<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.750> do<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.500> get<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> charge

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
so one thing you can do to get to charge

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.560 
so one thing you can do to get to charge
a<00:02:23.100> little<00:02:23.340> bit<00:02:23.460> easier<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.000> got<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.210> be<00:02:24.270> pretty

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
a little bit easier you got to be pretty

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.180 
a little bit easier you got to be pretty
good<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.780> your<00:02:24.960> timing<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.740> do<00:02:25.950> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
good on your timing is if you do a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.460 
good on your timing is if you do a
mix-up<00:02:26.820> or<00:02:26.940> cross<00:02:27.240> up<00:02:27.510> an<00:02:27.660> aerial<00:02:28.080> mix-up<00:02:28.350> or

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
mix-up or cross up an aerial mix-up or

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.550 
mix-up or cross up an aerial mix-up or
cross<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:29.030> then<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.660> easily<00:02:30.930> combo<00:02:31.410> that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
cross up then you can easily combo that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.820 
cross up then you can easily combo that
into<00:02:32.040> getting<00:02:32.430> your<00:02:33.110> yourse<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:34.320> charge<00:02:34.650> so

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
into getting your yourse or charge so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.960 
into getting your yourse or charge so
i'll<00:02:34.920> show<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.160> what<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.310> looks<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.700> right

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
i'll show you what that looks like right

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.780 
i'll show you what that looks like right
now<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.040> see<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.400> don't<00:02:38.490> really<00:02:38.640> have

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
now so you see they don't really have

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.390 
now so you see they don't really have
time<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.110> go<00:02:40.110> back<00:02:40.320> now<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.830> don't<00:02:40.980> time<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
time to go back now if you don't time it

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.060 
time to go back now if you don't time it
correctly<00:02:41.490> they<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.209> still<00:02:42.690> block<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.680> so

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
correctly they can still block that so

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.380 
correctly they can still block that so
in<00:02:44.220> which<00:02:44.400> case<00:02:44.430> you're<00:02:44.820> probably<00:02:44.880> gonna<00:02:45.180> want

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
in which case you're probably gonna want

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.970 
in which case you're probably gonna want
to<00:02:45.480> mix<00:02:45.720> them<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.140> little<00:02:46.230> bit<00:02:46.470> by<00:02:46.620> doing

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
to mix them up a little bit by doing

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.850 
to mix them up a little bit by doing
this<00:02:47.160> quite<00:02:47.459> often<00:02:47.700> when<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.600> reach<00:02:49.350> up<00:02:49.380> like

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
this quite often when you reach up like

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.190 
this quite often when you reach up like
that<00:02:50.100> do<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> mix<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:51.600> swoop<00:02:52.050> them

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
that do the mix up and then swoop them

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.170 
that do the mix up and then swoop them
down<00:02:52.380> low<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.160> way<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.489> get<00:02:53.640> used<00:02:53.940> to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
down low so that way they get used to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.250 
down low so that way they get used to
blocking

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
blocking

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.650 
blocking
low<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.550> find<00:02:56.820> them<00:02:57.000> blocking<00:02:57.270> low<00:02:57.630> a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
low and if you find them blocking low a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.390 
low and if you find them blocking low a
lot<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.320> what<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.560> can<00:02:58.709> do<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.280> use

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
lot and what you can do is you can use

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280 
lot and what you can do is you can use
your<00:02:59.520> third<00:02:59.880> special<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:01.080> third

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
your third special and the third

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.720 
your third special and the third
pressure<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:02.310> cool<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.550> something

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
pressure is really cool and something

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.160 
pressure is really cool and something
you<00:03:02.880> really<00:03:03.209> do<00:03:03.330> need<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> take<00:03:03.720> advantage<00:03:04.050> of

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
you really do need to take advantage of

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.630 
you really do need to take advantage of
but<00:03:04.560> before<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:04.860> go<00:03:04.980> into<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.190> let<00:03:05.400> me<00:03:05.459> show

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
but before I go into that let me show

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.790 
but before I go into that let me show
you<00:03:05.700> actually<00:03:06.260> comboing<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.440> into<00:03:07.650> your

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
you actually comboing this into your

whatever you need to do up but what's

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
even better about the third special is

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.830 
even better about the third special is
that<00:04:38.930> if<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.229> use<00:04:39.260> lights<00:04:40.570> attack<00:04:41.570> or<00:04:41.780> a

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
that if you use lights attack or a

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.320 
that if you use lights attack or a
medium<00:04:42.290> attack<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.770> get<00:04:42.949> different<00:04:43.580> moves<00:04:43.820> so

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
medium attack you get different moves so

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.180 
medium attack you get different moves so
the<00:04:44.360> light<00:04:44.720> attack<00:04:45.020> is<00:04:45.229> this<00:04:45.380> slide<00:04:45.740> which<00:04:46.160> is

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
the light attack is this slide which is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.400 
the light attack is this slide which is
great<00:04:46.910> especially<00:04:47.600> if<00:04:47.990> you're<00:04:48.110> using<00:04:48.260> this

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
great especially if you're using this

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.890 
great especially if you're using this
ability<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.889> lot<00:04:49.160> for<00:04:49.460> overheads<00:04:50.300> like<00:04:50.630> that

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
ability a lot for overheads like that

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.780 
ability a lot for overheads like that
which<00:04:51.110> is<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.500> medium<00:04:51.919> attack<00:04:52.190> which<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.699> can

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
which is the medium attack which you can

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.980 
which is the medium attack which you can
use<00:04:52.880> if<00:04:53.000> they're<00:04:53.120> blocking<00:04:53.419> low<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.750> lot

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
use if they're blocking low a lot

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.810 
use if they're blocking low a lot
remember<00:04:54.229> how<00:04:54.350> I<00:04:54.380> said<00:04:54.740> we<00:04:54.949> doing<00:04:55.370> this<00:04:55.430> mix<00:04:55.669> up

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
remember how I said we doing this mix up

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.129 
remember how I said we doing this mix up
a<00:04:55.910> lot<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.210> might<00:04:56.330> force<00:04:56.690> your<00:04:56.810> opponent<00:04:56.840> to

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
a lot you might force your opponent to

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.080 
a lot you might force your opponent to
start<00:04:57.350> blocking<00:04:57.620> low<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.039> lot<00:04:58.400> or<00:04:58.669> maybe<00:04:58.970> if

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
start blocking low a lot or maybe if

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.370 
start blocking low a lot or maybe if
you're<00:04:59.150> just<00:04:59.330> going<00:04:59.510> for<00:04:59.660> swoops<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.199> stuff

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
you're just going for swoops and stuff

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.129 
you're just going for swoops and stuff
like<00:05:00.500> that<00:05:01.000> then<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.510> know<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.690> might<00:05:02.930> want

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
like that then you know you might want

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.650 
like that then you know you might want
to<00:05:03.199> hit<00:05:03.350> them<00:05:03.530> with<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:04.310> yield<00:05:04.550> in<00:05:04.880> overhead

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
to hit them with the yield in overhead

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.110 
to hit them with the yield in overhead
and<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.770> know<00:05:06.860> get<00:05:07.010> some<00:05:07.100> good<00:05:07.340> damage<00:05:07.639> that

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
and you know get some good damage that

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.909 
and you know get some good damage that
way<00:05:08.240> you<00:05:08.419> can<00:05:08.570> also<00:05:09.789> -<00:05:10.789> -<00:05:11.720> cancel<00:05:12.080> that<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.440> not

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
way you can also - - cancel that and not

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.670 
way you can also - - cancel that and not
use<00:05:13.130> your<00:05:13.250> super<00:05:13.639> um<00:05:14.210> but<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.780> can't<00:05:15.020> -<00:05:15.229> cancel

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
use your super um but you can't - cancel

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.409 
use your super um but you can't - cancel
that<00:05:15.800> as<00:05:15.949> well<00:05:16.160> it's<00:05:16.550> maybe<00:05:16.729> set<00:05:17.030> yourself<00:05:17.330> up

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
that as well it's maybe set yourself up

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.520 
that as well it's maybe set yourself up
and<00:05:17.539> maybe<00:05:17.660> knock<00:05:17.960> your<00:05:18.139> opponent<00:05:18.470> off

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530

to be really really helpful because even
when<00:05:28.430> they<00:05:28.520> start<00:05:28.820> blocking<00:05:29.120> low<00:05:29.389> you<00:05:29.780> can

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
when they start blocking low you can

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.779 
when they start blocking low you can
really<00:05:30.320> play<00:05:30.590> some<00:05:30.889> mind<00:05:31.130> games<00:05:31.250> by<00:05:31.550> just

really play some mind games by just

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.000 
really play some mind games by just
going<00:05:31.970> for<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.300> overhead<00:05:32.780> here<00:05:33.169> or<00:05:33.380> you<00:05:33.919> know

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
going for the overhead here or you know

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.260 
going for the overhead here or you know
doing<00:05:34.340> anything<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.669> need<00:05:34.820> to<00:05:34.910> do<00:05:35.000> you<00:05:35.150> can

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
doing anything you need to do you can

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.420 
doing anything you need to do you can
even<00:05:35.510> just<00:05:35.660> feint<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.620> a<00:05:36.770> few<00:05:37.070> times<00:05:37.280> you<00:05:37.400> know

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
even just feint it a few times you know

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.529 
even just feint it a few times you know
that's<00:05:37.700> one<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.030> things<00:05:38.240> that<00:05:38.389> people

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
that's one of the things that people

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.990 
that's one of the things that people
don't<00:05:38.900> really<00:05:38.990> do<00:05:39.289> too<00:05:39.500> much<00:05:39.650> is<00:05:39.860> one<00:05:40.849> of<00:05:40.940> the

don't really do too much is one of the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.040 
don't really do too much is one of the
most<00:05:41.180> powerful<00:05:41.300> things<00:05:41.510> you<00:05:41.660> can<00:05:41.810> do<00:05:41.870> in<00:05:41.990> a

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
most powerful things you can do in a

most powerful things you can do in a
fighting<00:05:42.229> game<00:05:42.380> is<00:05:42.530> using<00:05:42.919> an<00:05:43.010> ability<00:05:43.250> but

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
fighting game is using an ability but

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.580 
fighting game is using an ability but
not<00:05:44.599> using<00:05:44.900> it<00:05:45.080> that<00:05:45.229> it<00:05:45.289> make<00:05:45.380> sense<00:05:45.470> for

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
not using it that it make sense for

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.320 
not using it that it make sense for
example<00:05:45.740> I<00:05:46.160> can<00:05:46.520> come<00:05:46.669> at<00:05:46.789> you<00:05:46.910> like<00:05:47.030> this<00:05:47.120> all

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
the time for sure to get defensive you

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.260 
the time for sure to get defensive you
know<00:05:48.979> maybe<00:05:49.130> you<00:05:49.280> start<00:05:49.460> blocking<00:05:49.729> low<00:05:50.030> I

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
know maybe you start blocking low I

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.490 
know maybe you start blocking low I
start<00:05:50.660> getting<00:05:50.870> into<00:05:51.020> your<00:05:51.110> head<00:05:51.200> I'm<00:05:51.349> like<00:05:51.470> I

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
any time I'm going to go ahead and go

any time I'm going to go ahead and go
for<00:05:55.460> it<00:05:55.639> he's<00:05:55.789> I<00:05:55.910> notice<00:05:56.240> he's<00:05:56.330> blocking<00:05:56.539> low<00:05:56.750> a

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
for it he's I notice he's blocking low a

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.330 
for it he's I notice he's blocking low a
lot<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.080> next<00:05:57.229> time<00:05:57.349> I<00:05:57.470> go<00:05:57.650> up<00:05:57.680> I<00:05:57.949> might<00:05:58.190> want

lot so next time I go up I might want

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.529 
lot so next time I go up I might want
you<00:05:58.490> with<00:05:58.610> that<00:05:58.729> overhead<00:05:59.090> you<00:05:59.270> know<00:05:59.300> what<00:05:59.479> I

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
you with that overhead you know what I

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.659 
you with that overhead you know what I
mean<00:05:59.720> and<00:06:00.320> if<00:06:00.470> you<00:06:00.560> see<00:06:00.800> you<00:06:01.220> can<00:06:01.370> actually

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
mean and if you see you can actually

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.219 
mean and if you see you can actually
cancel<00:06:01.910> your<00:06:02.180> -<00:06:02.419> so<00:06:02.720> instead<00:06:02.900> of<00:06:02.960> going<00:06:03.080> that

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
cancel your - so instead of going that

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.520 
full way putting yourself in harm's way
what<00:06:05.330> you<00:06:05.419> can<00:06:05.510> do<00:06:05.570> is<00:06:05.660> just<00:06:05.930> -<00:06:06.169> backwards

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
what you can do is just - backwards

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.980 
what you can do is just - backwards
you'll<00:06:07.400> stop<00:06:07.669> your<00:06:07.699> -<00:06:08.030> so<00:06:08.330> you<00:06:08.389> can<00:06:08.599> fake<00:06:08.810> them

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
you'll stop your - so you can fake them

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.420 
you'll stop your - so you can fake them
out<00:06:09.139> a<00:06:09.169> lot<00:06:09.410> now<00:06:09.740> of<00:06:09.830> course<00:06:09.949> that's<00:06:10.070> gonna<00:06:10.190> put

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
out a lot now of course that's gonna put

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.580 
out a lot now of course that's gonna put
that<00:06:10.490> ability<00:06:10.910> on<00:06:11.000> cooldown<00:06:11.440> so<00:06:12.440> that's

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
that ability on cooldown so that's

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.689 
that ability on cooldown so that's
something<00:06:12.740> you<00:06:12.830> don't<00:06:12.949> want<00:06:13.130> to<00:06:13.160> look<00:06:13.310> out<00:06:13.460> for

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
something you don't want to look out for

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.420 
something you don't want to look out for
now<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:15.080> upper<00:06:15.349> credibility<00:06:15.860> I<00:06:15.889> think<00:06:16.190> is<00:06:16.280> one

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
now the upper credibility I think is one

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.909 
now the upper credibility I think is one
of<00:06:16.539> edges<00:06:17.539> best<00:06:17.900> abilities<00:06:18.349> because<00:06:18.650> when

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
of edges best abilities because when

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.469 
of edges best abilities because when
you're<00:06:19.039> coming<00:06:19.370> up<00:06:19.550> from<00:06:19.699> the<00:06:19.760> ground<00:06:19.940> as<00:06:20.419> a

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
in the corner a lot using this ability

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.379
