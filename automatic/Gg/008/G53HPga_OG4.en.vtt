so<00:02:02.009> details<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:03.060> quite<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:03.600> the

so details are quite for you at the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.069 
so details are quite for you at the
moment<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.409> seems<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:04.950> interesting

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
moment but this seems really interesting

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.680 
moment but this seems really interesting
so<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.560> third<00:02:07.860> general<00:02:08.670> change<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.360> i<00:02:09.390> found

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
so the third general change that i found

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.320 
so the third general change that i found
interesting<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.670> mythic<00:02:11.670> dungeons

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
interesting is that mythic dungeons

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.320 
interesting is that mythic dungeons
I<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.070> honest<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.610> something<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.120> was

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
I to be honest this is something I was

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.480 
I to be honest this is something I was
you<00:02:15.690> know<00:02:15.720> looking<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.350> actually<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.370> know

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
you know looking for actually a you know

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.150 
you know looking for actually a you know
it's<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.910> mythic<00:02:18.300> setting<00:02:18.630> for<00:02:18.840> dungeons<00:02:19.230> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it's a mythic setting for dungeons so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.830 
it's a mythic setting for dungeons so
time<00:02:20.670> constraint<00:02:21.030> really<00:02:21.300> stopped<00:02:21.540> me<00:02:21.690> from

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
time constraint really stopped me from

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.890 
time constraint really stopped me from
doing<00:02:21.930> even<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.670> know<00:02:23.760> normal<00:02:24.540> difficulty

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
doing even you know normal difficulty

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.330 
doing even you know normal difficulty
raids<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.680> was<00:02:25.920> hoping<00:02:26.040> they<00:02:26.280> could

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
raids so I was hoping they could

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.490 
raids so I was hoping they could
implement<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.210> Alpha<00:02:27.630> are<00:02:27.690> queuing<00:02:28.200> system

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
implement the Alpha are queuing system

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.370 
implement the Alpha are queuing system
for<00:02:28.680> normal<00:02:29.100> modes<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:30.150> upping<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.990> mold<00:02:31.230> for

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
for normal modes but upping the mold for

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.620 
for normal modes but upping the mold for
dungeons<00:02:31.770> will<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.190> well<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.240> top

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
dungeons will do as well so top

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.620 
dungeons will do as well so top
difficulty<00:02:34.590> dungeons<00:02:34.980> have<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:36.090> lockout

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
difficulty dungeons have a lockout

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.560 
difficulty dungeons have a lockout
schedule<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.320> raids<00:02:37.970> with<00:02:38.970> gear<00:02:39.270> jobs

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
schedule just like raids with gear jobs

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.950

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
at item levels of 680 so this is finally

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.550 
at item levels of 680 so this is finally
something<00:02:43.350> for<00:02:43.620> me<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.740> do<00:02:43.980> PvE<00:02:44.430> wise<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
last general change that is I like to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.240 
last general change that is I like to
mention<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.030> PvP<00:02:51.959> gear<00:02:52.200> caps<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.800> Blizzard

562 690 will scale up to six ninety

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.840 
562 690 will scale up to six ninety
while<00:03:02.910> gear<00:03:03.390> going<00:03:03.750> over<00:03:04.140> level<00:03:04.410> 7<00:03:04.740> 15<00:03:05.250> will

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.650 

okay<00:03:19.950> now<00:03:20.220> let's<00:03:20.489> get<00:03:20.670> into<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.180> changes<00:03:21.390> that

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
okay now let's get into the changes that

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.840 
okay now let's get into the changes that
might<00:03:21.959> affect<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.440> guides<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:23.070> have<00:03:23.370> floated

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
might affect the guides I have floated

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.670 
might affect the guides I have floated
so<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.390> course<00:03:24.570> none<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.019> these<00:03:25.140> are<00:03:25.170> final

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
so of course none of these are final

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.620 
so of course none of these are final
until<00:03:25.950> Blizzard<00:03:26.340> actually<00:03:26.790> patches<00:03:27.000> our<00:03:27.450> lab

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
until Blizzard actually patches our lab

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.380 
until Blizzard actually patches our lab
clients<00:03:28.050> with<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.350> new<00:03:28.560> content<00:03:29.390> it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
clients with the new content it's

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.520 
clients with the new content it's
something<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:30.780> can<00:03:30.930> play<00:03:31.080> around<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.470> your

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
something you can play around in your

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.100 
something you can play around in your
heads<00:03:31.830> but<00:03:32.340> then<00:03:32.489> again<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.970> would<00:03:33.330> be<00:03:33.540> final

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
heads but then again it would be final

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.530 
heads but then again it would be final
so<00:03:34.800> they're<00:03:35.340> all<00:03:35.489> pretty<00:03:35.670> straightforward<00:03:35.940> so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
so they're all pretty straightforward so

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.140 
so they're all pretty straightforward so
I'll<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:36.750> go<00:03:37.380> through<00:03:37.620> them<00:03:37.800> quickly<00:03:38.150> for

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
I'll just go through them quickly for

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.790 
I'll just go through them quickly for
warriors<00:03:39.450> at<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> moment<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.320> is<00:03:40.350> only<00:03:40.530> one

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
warriors at the moment there is only one

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.860 
warriors at the moment there is only one
change<00:03:41.130> planned<00:03:41.640> for<00:03:42.360> them<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.750> I'm

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
change planned for them that I'm

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.720 
change planned for them that I'm
interested<00:03:43.200> in<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:43.769> that's<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.190> change<00:03:44.489> in

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
interested in so that's a change in

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.330 
interested in so that's a change in
defensive<00:03:45.180> stance<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.680> stance<00:03:46.920> will<00:03:47.190> be

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
defensive stance the stance will be

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.890 
defensive stance the stance will be
buffed<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.790> twenty<00:03:48.120> five<00:03:48.269> percent<00:03:48.300> damage

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
buffed to twenty five percent damage

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.440 
buffed to twenty five percent damage
reduction<00:03:49.410> from<00:03:50.070> twenty<00:03:51.030> percent<00:03:51.300> damage

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
reduction from twenty percent damage

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.960 
reduction from twenty percent damage
reduction<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.260> that's<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.620> good<00:03:53.400> change<00:03:53.700> for

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
reduction so that's a good change for

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.440 
reduction so that's a good change for
all<00:03:54.800> protection<00:03:55.800> warriors<00:03:56.130> or<00:03:56.330> even<00:03:57.330> those

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
all protection warriors or even those

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.790 
all protection warriors or even those
warriors<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.320> switch<00:03:58.620> into

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
warriors that like to switch into

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.550 
warriors that like to switch into

defensive stance when in pvp for arms in

fury druids the class well the classes

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.640

for 40 seconds instead of 20 seconds and

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.830 
for 40 seconds instead of 20 seconds and
I<00:05:12.580> think<00:05:12.640> that<00:05:12.910> this<00:05:13.090> is<00:05:13.150> really<00:05:13.420> good<00:05:13.690> because

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
I think that this is really good because

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.030 
I think that this is really good because
you<00:05:14.080> know<00:05:14.170> there<00:05:14.350> have<00:05:14.440> been<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.590> number<00:05:14.770> of

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
you know there have been a number of

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.250 
you know there have been a number of
situations<00:05:15.220> I've<00:05:15.700> noticed<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:16.210> while<00:05:17.080> you

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
situations I've noticed that while you

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.040 
situations I've noticed that while you
do<00:05:17.380> get<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.650> proc<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:19.030> sometimes<00:05:19.450> prox<00:05:19.810> in<00:05:19.990> the

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
do get the proc it sometimes prox in the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.330 
do get the proc it sometimes prox in the
moments<00:05:20.380> where<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:20.590> don't<00:05:20.710> really<00:05:20.950> need<00:05:21.190> the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
moments where you don't really need the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.600 
moments where you don't really need the
healing<00:05:21.730> or<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.450> effect<00:05:23.230> itself<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:24.190> this<00:05:24.550> is

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
healing or the effect itself so this is

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.460 
healing or the effect itself so this is
good<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:24.910> have<00:05:25.180> an<00:05:25.330> additional<00:05:25.750> 20<00:05:26.050> seconds

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
good you have an additional 20 seconds

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.100 
good you have an additional 20 seconds
to<00:05:26.650> keep<00:05:26.920> the<00:05:27.490> proc<00:05:28.170> and<00:05:30.090> quite<00:05:31.090> possibly<00:05:31.120> of<00:05:31.810> I

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
to keep the proc and quite possibly of I

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.690 
to keep the proc and quite possibly of I
will<00:05:32.290> at<00:05:32.380> least<00:05:32.530> for<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.920> moment<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.280> last

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
will at least for the moment the last

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.420 
will at least for the moment the last
one<00:05:34.330> is<00:05:34.660> for<00:05:35.020> death<00:05:35.200> Knights<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:35.860> there<00:05:36.250> are<00:05:36.370> a

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
one is for death Knights so there are a

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.550 
one is for death Knights so there are a
number<00:05:36.520> of<00:05:36.760> changes<00:05:37.060> also<00:05:37.360> for<00:05:37.720> them<00:05:37.900> but

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
number of changes also for them but

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.260 
number of changes also for them but
there's<00:05:39.040> really<00:05:39.250> only<00:05:39.340> one<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.940> interests

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
there's really only one that interests

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.460 
there's really only one that interests
me<00:05:40.420> so<00:05:40.540> that's<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.290> change<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.950> any<00:05:42.820> magic

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.050 
animatic at Magic Shell the ability will
