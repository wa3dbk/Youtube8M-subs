 First of all this is a nasty and strong theme 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.920
 Kryrona of Moldsider Tack 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:27.350
 There are a lot of people using this very 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.820
 I think it's the strongest of the clans, but it is a world 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.829
 Well, you will do this guy be enough 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.160

 I Nde and 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:54.310
 I think the student line and the headlines are a bit high 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.950
 I think that there are many people who endure at home 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.900
 The average price of the guy is 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.520
 Well this time 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.230

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.370
 Oh dear 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.470
 It had been traded 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.630
 It is 643 yen but amazon etc 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:44.420
 I think Yahoo Oak will be able to get it cheaply 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:48.020
 Or in how well m of themes that can be used in the following also cheap 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.450
 It was about 500 yen polishing when the good thing price was the cheapest 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.230
 Well now 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.760

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.640
 In the Amazon or Yahoo! 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.750
 It may be found for about 500 yen 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:12.039
 Once in a while 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.039
 I think that I might be able to use it than my own Noriko world this time 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.080
 Yes 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.080
 There is a high frequency of use like Baldo 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.700

 The average rate for this is 440 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.690

 Pretty strong guy and Well cheaper than there 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.200
 I think it's good 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.470
 I have a key p from the doctor 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.010

 In the average example and 4401000 yen of guy 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.490

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:29.950
 Contend with but the next is I do not know well 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:32.350
 In a recent Kedomo I do not know whether these were different to the grade of the game center are saying of their own 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.870
 The person who uses it is fine 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:45.960
 The average rate for the guy is 503 yen 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:49.270
 But I think it's well pretty well-balanced numbers in mid-to guy offense 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:55.650
 Power is 7 out of 8 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.650
