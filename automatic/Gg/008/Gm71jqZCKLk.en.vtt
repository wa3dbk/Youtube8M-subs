00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
not as much of a head start as everybody

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.759 
not as much of a head start as everybody
else<00:03:23.489> but<00:03:23.730> uh<00:03:23.760> yeah<00:03:24.420> once<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.200> get<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.440> leg<00:03:25.590> back

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
learned personally over the lot of your

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.199

first<00:03:50.400> two<00:03:50.489> years<00:03:50.700> in<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.880> league<00:03:51.060> that

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
first two years in the league that

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.060 
first two years in the league that
you're<00:03:51.390> going<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.750> take<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.709> third

year<00:03:53.340> as<00:03:53.489> you're<00:03:53.670> competing<00:03:54.049> um<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.110> think<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
year as you're competing um I think the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.370 
year as you're competing um I think the
big<00:03:55.980> part<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.630> getting<00:03:57.630> out<00:03:57.720> there<00:03:57.780> you

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
big part is just getting out there you

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.900 
big part is just getting out there you
know<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.680> competition<00:03:58.980> knowing<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.610> love<00:03:59.760> as

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
know the competition knowing the love as

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.550 
know the competition knowing the love as
far<00:04:00.120> as<00:04:00.209> playing<00:04:00.360> against<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:01.410> know<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
far as playing against you know the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.890 
far as playing against you know the
receivers<00:04:02.400> quarterbacks<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.660> I've<00:04:03.750> had

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
receivers quarterbacks and that I've had

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.330 
receivers quarterbacks and that I've had
the<00:04:04.019> chance<00:04:04.200> playing<00:04:04.530> against<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:05.130> think

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
the chance playing against and I think

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.620 
the chance playing against and I think
that's<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.610> main<00:04:05.760> thing<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:06.090> just<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
that's the main thing is just the

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.880 
that's the main thing is just the
experience<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.380> know<00:04:07.440> there's<00:04:07.620> nothing<00:04:07.739> like

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
getting out there on Sundays as a the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.009 
getting out there on Sundays as a the
big<00:04:14.400> part<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:15.239> know<00:04:15.329> it's<00:04:15.510> getting<00:04:15.720> more

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
big part you know it's getting more

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.630 
big part you know it's getting more
plain<00:04:16.470> telling<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.160> know<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.370> Sunday

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
plain telling that you know and Sunday

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.039 
plain telling that you know and Sunday
isn't<00:04:17.820> even<00:04:18.390> last<00:04:18.600> year<00:04:18.660> getting<00:04:18.930> more

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
isn't even last year getting more

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.229 
isn't even last year getting more
playing<00:04:19.229> time<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:20.160> was<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.519> best<00:04:21.030> part

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
playing time and that was the best part

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.460 
playing time and that was the best part
and<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.419> think<00:04:21.599> that's<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> huge<00:04:22.109> part<00:04:22.320> it's

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
and I think that's the huge part it's

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.960 
and I think that's the huge part it's
just<00:04:22.500> like<00:04:22.800> seeing<00:04:23.490> all<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.849> different

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
just like seeing all the different

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.460 
just like seeing all the different
routes<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.390> get<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.599> go<00:04:24.720> up<00:04:24.750> against<00:04:25.140> and<00:04:25.320> then

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
routes you get to go up against and then

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.780 
routes you get to go up against and then
going<00:04:25.979> up<00:04:26.070> against<00:04:26.280> them<00:04:26.400> again

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
going up against them again

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.340 
going up against them again
you<00:04:27.030> know<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.330> that's<00:04:27.450> what<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:27.780> every

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
you know and that's what it is every

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.630 
you know and that's what it is every
year<00:04:28.380> you're<00:04:28.710> not<00:04:28.770> kind<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.100> seeing<00:04:29.340> more<00:04:29.550> and

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
year you're not kind of seeing more and

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.460 
year you're not kind of seeing more and
more<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.090> then<00:04:30.600> he<00:04:30.750> gets<00:04:30.930> easier<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.350> easier

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
more and then he gets easier and easier

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.900 
more and then he gets easier and easier
and<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:31.830> know<00:04:31.920> saying<00:04:32.160> everything<00:04:32.640> slows
