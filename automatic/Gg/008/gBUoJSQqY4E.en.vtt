all right well our next question comes

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.990 
all right well our next question comes
from<00:00:07.680> another<00:00:07.980> one<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.280> our<00:00:08.490> users<00:00:08.849> on

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
from another one of our users on

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.720 
from another one of our users on
Facebook<00:00:09.290> they<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.559> itchy<00:00:10.830> skin

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.010 
doesn't help with the itching is there
any<00:00:16.199> chance<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.890> curing<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.490> or<00:00:17.820> or<00:00:18.359> coming

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
any chance of curing this or or coming

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.420 
any chance of curing this or or coming
to<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> solution<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.770> imagine<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.250> could<00:00:20.369> be

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
to a solution I imagine that could be

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.849 
to a solution I imagine that could be
quite<00:00:20.609> annoying<00:00:21.170> Jesus<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.410> drive<00:00:22.650> people

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
quite annoying Jesus can drive people

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.849 
quite annoying Jesus can drive people
mad<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.930> obviously<00:00:25.320> he

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
mad and you know and obviously he

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.200 
mad and you know and obviously he
doesn't<00:00:26.099> scratch<00:00:26.490> where<00:00:26.789> doesn't<00:00:27.150> itch

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
doesn't scratch where doesn't itch

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.700 
doesn't scratch where doesn't itch
because<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.570> leads<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.019> other<00:00:28.170> problems

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
because that leads to other problems

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.130 
because that leads to other problems
remember<00:00:29.550> also<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.880> itchiness<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.750> often

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
remember also that itchiness is often

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.900 
remember also that itchiness is often
caused<00:00:31.380> by<00:00:31.590> histamine<00:00:31.980> release<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
caused by histamine release and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.080 
caused by histamine release and
histamine<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> chemical<00:00:34.399> substance<00:00:35.399> part

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
histamine is a chemical substance part

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
histamine is a chemical substance part
of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> inflammatory<00:00:36.630> response<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
of the inflammatory response that is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.440 
of the inflammatory response that is
deposited<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.460> under<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> skin<00:00:39.210> which

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
deposited just under the skin which

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.720 
deposited just under the skin which
leads<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.010> itchiness<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
leads to the the itchiness and the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.610 
leads to the the itchiness and the
sensitivity<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.420> those<00:00:42.690> receptors<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
sensitivity of those receptors in the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
sensitivity of those receptors in the
skin<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.430> force<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
skin that force you to is for the you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.360 
skin that force you to is for the you
know<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.930> lead<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.350> fingers<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> spot

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
know to lead your fingers to the spot

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.060 
know to lead your fingers to the spot
yes<00:00:47.610> yeah<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.809> very<00:00:49.379> important<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> realize

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
yes yeah so very important to realize

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.590 
yes yeah so very important to realize
the<00:00:50.399> different<00:00:50.700> things<00:00:50.820> obviously<00:00:50.969> allergies

the different things obviously allergies

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.209 
the different things obviously allergies

eastern levels drop in ladies for
example<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.640> call<00:01:23.820> atrophic

thyroid conditions where with the
thyroid<00:01:32.670> hormones<00:01:33.060> being<00:01:33.329> abnormal<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
thyroid hormones being abnormal you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
thyroid hormones being abnormal you
develop<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.250> dry<00:01:35.490> skin<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
develop a really really dry skin and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
develop a really really dry skin and
then<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.840> course<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> host<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.159> other

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
then of course there be a host of other

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
then of course there be a host of other
systemic<00:01:38.759> diseases<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.350> result<00:01:40.650> from

systemic diseases that can result from

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
systemic diseases that can result from
you<00:01:41.100> being<00:01:41.310> dehydrated<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.299> associated<00:01:42.780> with

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
you being dehydrated and associated with

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.560 
you being dehydrated and associated with
kidney<00:01:43.409> damage<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:43.950> liver<00:01:44.070> damage<00:01:44.399> etc<00:01:45.030> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
kidney damage or liver damage etc so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.450 
kidney damage or liver damage etc so
very<00:01:45.960> important<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> realize<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> dry<00:01:47.399> skin

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
very important to realize that dry skin

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.940 
very important to realize that dry skin
could<00:01:47.880> mean<00:01:48.119> many<00:01:48.329> different<00:01:48.479> things<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
could mean many different things so a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.830 
could mean many different things so a
lot<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> different<00:01:50.549> contributors<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.659> guess

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
lot of different contributors I guess

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560 
lot of different contributors I guess
when<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.110> comes<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.409> dry<00:01:52.619> skin<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.090> if

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
when it comes to dry skin and if you if
