going to jump right into it rear window
defrost<00:00:17.900> there's<00:00:18.080> nothing<00:00:18.410> more<00:00:18.560> than<00:00:18.770> wires

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
defrost there's nothing more than wires

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.659 
defrost there's nothing more than wires
gone<00:00:20.840> across<00:00:21.079> your<00:00:21.380> window<00:00:21.710> that<00:00:21.950> you<00:00:22.489> pass

gone across your window that you pass

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.450 
gone across your window that you pass
electrical<00:00:23.149> current<00:00:23.480> through<00:00:24.099> they<00:00:25.099> get<00:00:25.250> hot

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
electrical current through they get hot

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.089 
electrical current through they get hot
and<00:00:25.790> the<00:00:26.360> heat<00:00:26.540> of<00:00:26.689> course<00:00:26.869> defrost<00:00:27.770> the<00:00:27.950> back

and the heat of course defrost the back

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.819 
and the heat of course defrost the back
window<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.489> Falls<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.090> ice<00:00:29.649> we're<00:00:30.649> going<00:00:30.770> to

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
window and Falls the ice we're going to

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.350 
window and Falls the ice we're going to
put<00:00:30.980> these<00:00:31.099> together<00:00:31.279> these<00:00:31.640> are<00:00:31.849> electrical

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
put these together these are electrical

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.610 
put these together these are electrical
connections<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:32.989> we're<00:00:33.140> going<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.290> put<00:00:33.500> these

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
connections so we're going to put these

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.270 
connections so we're going to put these
together<00:00:33.800> with<00:00:34.870> 60/40<00:00:36.010> electrical<00:00:37.010> solder

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
together with 60/40 electrical solder

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.180 
together with 60/40 electrical solder
not<00:00:37.940> plumbing<00:00:38.810> solder<00:00:39.050> or<00:00:39.470> anything<00:00:39.950> like

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
not plumbing solder or anything like

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.800 
not plumbing solder or anything like
that<00:00:40.390> so<00:00:41.410> first<00:00:42.410> thing<00:00:42.560> we're<00:00:42.680> going<00:00:42.800> to<00:00:42.860> do<00:00:43.010> is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
that so first thing we're going to do is

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.930 
that so first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:00:44.810> going<00:00:44.900> to<00:00:44.960> clean<00:00:45.290> up<00:00:45.530> where<00:00:46.280> these<00:00:46.580> are

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
we're going to clean up where these are

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.240 
we're going to clean up where these are
going<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.360> connect<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:47.930> I<00:00:47.960> like<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.350> polish<00:00:49.070> up

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
going to connect and I like to polish up

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.860 
going to connect and I like to polish up
the<00:00:49.310> connections<00:00:49.850> with<00:00:50.630> a<00:00:50.780> pencil<00:00:51.050> eraser

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
the connections with a pencil eraser

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.810 
the connections with a pencil eraser
what's<00:00:53.870> going<00:00:54.110> on<00:00:54.430> because<00:00:55.430> if<00:00:55.700> you<00:00:55.760> don't

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
what's going on because if you don't

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.260 
what's going on because if you don't
have<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:56.150> clean<00:00:56.450> connection<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.470> solder<00:00:58.270> won't

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
have a clean connection the solder won't

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.990 
have a clean connection the solder won't
stick

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
stick

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.370 
stick
so<00:01:02.000> once<00:01:02.239> I<00:01:02.360> have<00:01:02.540> these<00:01:02.690> cleaned<00:01:03.079> up<00:01:03.230> and

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
so once I have these cleaned up and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.749 
so once I have these cleaned up and
actually<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:03.710> has<00:01:03.860> got<00:01:04.009> a<00:01:04.040> lot<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.250> solder<00:01:04.640> on

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
actually this has got a lot of solder on

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.020 
actually this has got a lot of solder on
it<00:01:04.970> I'm<00:01:05.210> gonna<00:01:05.360> use<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.930> my<00:01:05.960> advantage<00:01:06.079> so

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
it I'm gonna use that to my advantage so

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.490 
it I'm gonna use that to my advantage so
I'm<00:01:08.030> gonna<00:01:08.210> come<00:01:08.420> back<00:01:08.600> here<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.140> I'm<00:01:09.320> gonna

are your term mix they're usually quite

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.000 
are your term mix they're usually quite
healthy<00:01:15.770> on<00:01:16.810> corroded<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:18.140> I've<00:01:18.260> done<00:01:18.470> is

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
healthy on corroded what I've done is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.940 
healthy on corroded what I've done is
I've<00:01:19.250> taken<00:01:19.280> these<00:01:19.700> already<00:01:19.970> over<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.950> wire

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
I've taken these already over to a wire

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.640 
I've taken these already over to a wire
wheel<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.580> I<00:01:22.640> put<00:01:22.880> into<00:01:23.030> my<00:01:23.840> drill<00:01:24.110> press<00:01:24.380> you

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
wheel that I put into my drill press you

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.880 
wheel that I put into my drill press you
could<00:01:25.370> use<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.520> regular<00:01:25.760> drill<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.930> I<00:01:27.680> just

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
could use a regular drill and I just

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.260 
could use a regular drill and I just
polish<00:01:28.250> these<00:01:28.280> things<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.000> they're

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
polish these things so that they're

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.410 
polish these things so that they're
going<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.570> be<00:01:30.610> smooth<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.790> clean<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.299> give

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
going to be smooth and clean and give

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.719 
going to be smooth and clean and give
the<00:01:32.570> solder<00:01:32.869> something<00:01:33.799> to<00:01:33.920> adhere<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:36.729> see

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
the solder something to adhere to so see

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.920 
the solder something to adhere to so see
if<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.909> can<00:01:38.060> get<00:01:38.180> through<00:01:38.360> this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.450 

alright<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.860> there's<00:01:43.010> two<00:01:43.130> things<00:01:43.159> we're

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
alright so there's two things we're

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.030 
alright so there's two things we're
going<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.640> do<00:01:44.500> we're<00:01:45.500> going<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.680> load<00:01:45.860> this

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
going to do we're going to load this

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.530 
going to do we're going to load this
thing<00:01:46.100> up<00:01:46.310> we're<00:01:47.060> going<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.240> load<00:01:47.390> these

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
thing up we're going to load these

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.940 
thing up we're going to load these
connections<00:01:48.080> up<00:01:48.229> here<00:01:48.500> with<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.970> solder<00:01:50.950> so

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
connections up here with the solder so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.649 
connections up here with the solder so
that<00:01:52.130> when<00:01:52.280> we<00:01:52.400> go<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.610> attach<00:01:53.150> this<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.450> the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
that when we go to attach this to the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.330 
that when we go to attach this to the
back<00:01:53.810> window<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.470> solder<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.950> going<00:01:55.220> to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
back window the solder is going to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.539 
back window the solder is going to
already<00:01:55.490> be<00:01:55.670> where<00:01:56.000> we<00:01:56.119> need<00:01:56.150> it<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:58.400> do

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
already be where we need it and to do

quite generously solder over to the back

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.940 
quite generously solder over to the back
edge<00:02:12.319> connector

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
edge connector

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.690 
edge connector
that<00:02:14.069> one<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.340> done<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:18.150> oh<00:02:18.660> my<00:02:18.930> god<00:02:19.670> one<00:02:20.670> day

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
that one is done and oh my god one day

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.790 
that one is done and oh my god one day
I'm<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.150> grab<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> tripod<00:02:22.200> for<00:02:22.680> this

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
I'm going to grab a tripod for this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.800 
I'm going to grab a tripod for this
camera<00:02:25.790> all<00:02:26.790> right<00:02:26.879> let's<00:02:27.239> see<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.569> can<00:02:27.720> do

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
camera all right let's see if I can do

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.150 
camera all right let's see if I can do
this<00:02:27.989> while<00:02:28.170> looking<00:02:28.470> through<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.890> little

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
this while looking through the little

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.900 
this while looking through the little
LCD<00:02:29.519> window<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:30.120> my<00:02:30.269> camera<00:02:31.670> maybe

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
LCD window of my camera maybe

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.470 
LCD window of my camera maybe
alright<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:37.270> solder<00:02:38.270> flows<00:02:38.690> towards<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.410> heat

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
alright so solder flows towards the heat

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.810 
alright so solder flows towards the heat
so<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.660> trick<00:02:41.930> here<00:02:41.960> is<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.380> get<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
so the trick here is to get this and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.030 
so the trick here is to get this and
this<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.120> sliding<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.630> over<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.960> my<00:02:45.860> little

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
this is sliding all over the my little

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.210 
this is sliding all over the my little
table<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:48.440> other<00:02:48.470> one<00:02:48.740> worked<00:02:48.920> out<00:02:49.040> so

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
table the other one worked out so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.350 
table the other one worked out so
perfectly<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.940> one's<00:02:50.150> not<00:02:50.300> working

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
perfectly this one's not working

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.350 
perfectly this one's not working
cooperating<00:02:51.290> at<00:02:51.410> all<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:53.360> trick<00:02:53.600> here<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:53.870> to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
cooperating at all the trick here is to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.360 
cooperating at all the trick here is to
keep<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.570> connection<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.290> point<00:02:57.560> that

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.650 

eat<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.550> connection<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.180> point<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
eat the connection to the point that the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.710 
eat the connection to the point that the
solder<00:03:02.930> will<00:03:03.230> flow<00:03:04.209> load<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.360> thing<00:03:05.540> up<00:03:05.690> with

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
solder will flow load this thing up with

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.510 
solder will flow load this thing up with
solder<00:03:06.110> we're<00:03:06.800> going<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.980> go<00:03:07.100> ahead<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.400> put

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
solder we're going to go ahead and put

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.600 
solder we're going to go ahead and put
some<00:03:07.550> solder<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:09.130> back<00:03:10.130> window<00:03:10.459> as

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
some solder on to the back window as

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.440 
some solder on to the back window as
well<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.890> once<00:03:13.100> we<00:03:13.250> have<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.880> working<00:03:14.150> to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
well and once we have that working to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.540 
well and once we have that working to
our<00:03:14.570> advantage

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
our advantage

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.990 
our advantage
we'll<00:03:16.550> just<00:03:16.820> put<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.270> two<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.900> place<00:03:18.970> do<00:03:19.970> not

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
we'll just put the two in place do not

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.330 
we'll just put the two in place do not
hold<00:03:20.450> them<00:03:20.600> with<00:03:20.720> your<00:03:20.900> hands<00:03:21.350> I<00:03:21.530> wish<00:03:22.190> this

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
hold them with your hands I wish this

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.690 
hold them with your hands I wish this
was<00:03:22.660> there<00:03:23.660> we<00:03:23.840> go<00:03:27.010> I'm<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.220> going<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.370> load

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
was there we go I'm just going to load

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.190 
was there we go I'm just going to load
the<00:03:28.940> heck<00:03:29.209> out<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.540> thing<00:03:29.660> with<00:03:29.930> solder

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
the heck out of that thing with solder

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.729 
the heck out of that thing with solder
so<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.220> have<00:03:31.400> plenty<00:03:31.610> for<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.000> window<00:03:32.739> and

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
so that I have plenty for the window and

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.930 
so that I have plenty for the window and
when<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.070> uh<00:03:34.390> when<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.510> cools<00:03:36.700> we'll<00:03:37.700> take

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
when it uh when it cools we'll take

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.530 
when it uh when it cools we'll take
these<00:03:39.220> see<00:03:40.220> if<00:03:40.310> we<00:03:40.430> could<00:03:40.549> put<00:03:40.730> some<00:03:42.250> mm<00:03:43.540> solder

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
these see if we could put some mm solder

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.770 
these see if we could put some mm solder
on<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:44.870> back<00:03:45.140> window<00:03:45.500> where<00:03:45.680> we<00:03:45.709> need<00:03:46.010> it

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
on the back window where we need it

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.650 
on the back window where we need it
again<00:03:47.780> Oh<00:03:48.100> Scott<00:03:50.110> make<00:03:51.110> sure<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.440> we're<00:03:51.590> not

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
again Oh Scott make sure that we're not

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.630 
again Oh Scott make sure that we're not
cause<00:03:53.660> any<00:03:53.959> more<00:03:54.200> harm<00:03:54.260> than<00:03:54.769> we<00:03:54.950> know<00:03:55.310> we<00:03:55.459> need

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
cause any more harm than we know we need

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:04.479 
cause any more harm than we know we need
to<00:04:01.090> all<00:04:02.090> right<00:04:02.330> see<00:04:02.600> how<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.780> solder<00:04:03.340> stuck<00:04:04.340> to

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
to all right see how the solder stuck to

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.150 
to all right see how the solder stuck to
that<00:04:04.519> nice<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.090> cleanly<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:06.709> means<00:04:06.980> where

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
that nice and cleanly that means where

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.710 
that nice and cleanly that means where
we<00:04:07.280> come<00:04:07.430> up<00:04:07.580> with<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.820> cut<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.299> connective

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
we come up with the cut the connective

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.670 
we come up with the cut the connective
on<00:04:08.840> there<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:10.070> too<00:04:10.430> will<00:04:11.120> adhere<00:04:11.299> nicely

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.979 

solder<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:16.010> solder

without

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
without

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:32.490 
without
now<00:04:24.759> killing<00:04:25.120> myself<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:30.190> if<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.610> see<00:04:31.500> the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
now killing myself so if you see the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:48.839 
now killing myself so if you see the
solder<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.009> sticking<00:04:45.270> okay<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:47.759> there's<00:04:48.759> no

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
solder is sticking okay so there's no

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.100 
solder is sticking okay so there's no
way<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.090> could<00:04:49.300> have<00:04:49.360> hold<00:04:49.569> held<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.900> camera

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
way I could have hold held the camera

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.379 
way I could have hold held the camera
and<00:04:50.349> done<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.590> soldering<00:04:50.949> but<00:04:51.389> we're

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
and done the soldering but we're

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.200 
and done the soldering but we're
soldered<00:04:52.810> in<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.139> the<00:04:53.770> big<00:04:53.919> test<00:04:54.190> here<00:04:54.490> is<00:04:54.669> I'm

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
soldered in and the big test here is I'm

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.260 
soldered in and the big test here is I'm
going<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.419> connect<00:04:55.750> my<00:04:57.120> ohmmeter

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
going to connect my ohmmeter

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.290 
going to connect my ohmmeter
to<00:04:59.110> one<00:04:59.289> side<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.919> check<00:05:00.129> resistance<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.210> the

on<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:26.169> secret<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.650> soldering<00:05:27.009> and<00:05:27.219> simple

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
on the secret to soldering and simple

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.100 
on the secret to soldering and simple
you<00:05:27.669> got<00:05:27.759> to<00:05:27.880> have<00:05:28.000> very<00:05:28.180> clean<00:05:28.509> connections

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
you got to have very clean connections

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.260 
you got to have very clean connections
and<00:05:29.349> you<00:05:30.039> have<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.340> get<00:05:30.460> all<00:05:30.639> parts<00:05:31.090> of<00:05:31.180> the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
and you have to get all parts of the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.730 
and you have to get all parts of the
connections<00:05:31.690> hot<00:05:31.900> enough<00:05:32.169> so<00:05:32.380> that<00:05:32.500> the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
connections hot enough so that the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.120 
connections hot enough so that the
solder<00:05:33.069> will<00:05:33.190> flow<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:34.139> then<00:05:35.139> just<00:05:35.770> take<00:05:35.949> away

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
solder will flow and then just take away

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.189 
solder will flow and then just take away
the<00:05:36.490> soldering<00:05:37.090> iron<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.659> hold<00:05:37.810> everything

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
the soldering iron and hold everything

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.459 
the soldering iron and hold everything
still<00:05:38.580> what<00:05:39.580> you<00:05:39.699> want<00:05:39.880> is<00:05:39.969> a<00:05:40.000> nice<00:05:40.469> shiny

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
still what you want is a nice shiny

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.490 
still what you want is a nice shiny
looking<00:05:41.919> solder<00:05:42.219> joint<00:05:43.050> otherwise<00:05:44.050> if<00:05:44.349> it

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
looking solder joint otherwise if it

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.760 
looking solder joint otherwise if it
looks<00:05:44.710> cloudy<00:05:45.669> or<00:05:46.150> you<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.900> move<00:05:47.259> it<00:05:47.469> while<00:05:47.590> it

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
looks cloudy or you to move it while it

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.189 
looks cloudy or you to move it while it
was<00:05:48.000> while<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.029> was<00:05:49.180> still<00:05:49.389> hot<00:05:49.449> you're<00:05:50.080> going

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
was while it was still hot you're going

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.839 
was while it was still hot you're going
to<00:05:50.259> have<00:05:50.409> a<00:05:50.440> cold<00:05:50.740> solder<00:05:51.009> joint<00:05:51.400> not<00:05:51.520> actually

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
to have a cold solder joint not actually

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.070 
to have a cold solder joint not actually
it's<00:05:51.940> not<00:05:52.029> going<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.270> hold<00:05:52.360> very<00:05:52.659> well<00:05:52.750> and<00:05:53.020> you

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
it's not going to hold very well and you

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.390 
it's not going to hold very well and you
just<00:05:53.139> need<00:05:53.409> to<00:05:53.469> get<00:05:53.560> in<00:05:53.710> there<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:53.949> reaking<00:05:54.279> it

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
just need to get in there and reaking it

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.059 
just need to get in there and reaking it
so<00:05:56.039> we're<00:05:57.039> good<00:05:57.300> another<00:05:58.300> repair<00:05:58.919> down<00:05:59.919> the

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
so we're good another repair down the

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.869 
so we're good another repair down the
drain<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.810> moving<00:06:01.810> on<00:06:01.930> to<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.199> next<00:06:02.879> disaster

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
drain and moving on to the next disaster

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.789 
drain and moving on to the next disaster
of<00:06:03.969> the<00:06:04.060> minute<00:06:04.620> thank<00:06:05.620> you<00:06:05.830> hope<00:06:06.340> this<00:06:06.520> helps
