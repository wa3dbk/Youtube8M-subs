00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.740
 today I want to show you what 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.870
 it's a Japanese bathroom I do not want to hurt 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.890
 susceptibilities so I warn you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.890
 which is a men's room 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.470
 well I understand that there are two 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.900
 types of Japanese baths are the ones 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.370
 traditional and the others are the style 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.840
 Western but they are Japanese 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.030
 and the sound they just heard 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.689
 because I get too close to 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.370
 urinary and good the lever let run 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.320
 the water automatically 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.270
 I'm going to show you interiorly how it is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 the toilet the number is quite 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 technological, these correspond to the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.489
 Typical Japanese bathrooms but with style 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.050
 western since they are quite 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.510
 modern have the toilet paper have 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.970
 a device connected to the plug 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.070
 since they are electric 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.420
 and here has a series of buttons that do not 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 I have an idea what they are for 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.680
 these bathrooms have this lid that is 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.190
 season although now for the summer 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.770
 and these buttons are off us 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.330
 allow to maneuver the caps of the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.330
 toilets for example I'm going to close it 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.170
 fully automatic 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.850
 the other buttons serve to open those 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.850
 tapas let's try the next one 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.659
 and finally we approved this last 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.689
 these other buttons that are at 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.520
 the left serve to lower let 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.520
 run the water from the toilet 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.390
 the good Japanese are characterized by 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.369
 be quite technological and safe more 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.420
 of one must have seen similar baths 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.970
 in airports 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.950
 this device allows us to see the time 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.039
 and also control the temperature and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.840
 water pressure this is to leave for 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.520
 stop the water and start from others a 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.380
 Men's bathroom has the option to 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.120
 women 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.130
 to these buttons that much 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.230
 continuation are for a hygiene a 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.170
 little more personal 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.720
 and at different pressure to personally 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.190
 I've never used them for a little fear 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.190
 I prefer the traditional style 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.650
 Now I want to make a small 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.080
 experiment so that you can 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.660
 appreciate how it works like these 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.930
 bathrooms work with a sensor 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.770
 movement I'm going to place my hand here already 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.380
 you will imagine 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.980
 what comes next 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.659
 Let's see 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.659
 in this way it works 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.040
 and when one has finished using these 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.630
 bathrooms 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.000
 you can simply withdraw as the 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.410
 toilet makes the work glass for you 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.960
 and let the water run so 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.600
 automatic the other type of bathrooms that 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.770
 traditional Japanese style what 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.770
 I will show in another video
