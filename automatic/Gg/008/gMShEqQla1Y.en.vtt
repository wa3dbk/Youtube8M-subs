00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.080
 Hi guys, who have a problem with 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.120
 computer is overheating year 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.190
 Look what I've put together to be able to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.120
 reduce the temperature of the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:21.260
 First step computer I bought 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.260
 this bench with the bench 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 I put a spoon pulling the air 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:41.730
 from the computer and put another 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.450
 Kohler down below so I do not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.450
 show now 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.170
 put 1 scoop on this I bought did 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.990
 something dark 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:17.259
 up here because this part is 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.909
 of the computer that I then did the course 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.799
 to be able to breathe and put 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.460
 This college here and this one on the way out 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:31.479
 his 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:36.100
 namely 1 234 with crop was very 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 good now to give cool chilled and is 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:48.550
 That's when I did a vivid zinha 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.950
 I put a school, you have to open a 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.119
 notebook underneath have to leave and so 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.119
 does not give much result 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.860
 she was in trouble and turned off 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.170
 now this problem has been fixed 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.600
 it really was the heat it's almost time 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:11.400
 passing through the time has passed in the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:16.569
 truth any doubt is just post and one 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.849
 notebook was in trouble 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.760
 I'll put it here to see the temperature 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.760
 theirs is not to see you 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.280
 ilan 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:15.420
 light blue is scoring 47 degrees 48 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.460
 however it will reduce it back to 47 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.890
 then to 46 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.450
 remembering that it already gives a warm 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:29.550
 I understand 46 degree motorcycle now I do not know 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:34.470
 if I already had cpu of the 45 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:40.670
 processing 27 is already getting so damn hot and 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.670
 That's it, people, it was all good thanks to Grace.
