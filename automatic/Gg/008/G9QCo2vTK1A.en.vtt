00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.170 
hundred and eighty degrees and slip it
right<00:01:28.630> back<00:01:28.900> on<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.680> then<00:01:30.520> here's<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.820> trick

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
right back on and then here's the trick

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.130 
right back on and then here's the trick
that<00:01:31.210> everybody<00:01:31.720> bitch<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.170> about<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:33.610> bolt

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that everybody bitch is about this bolt

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.270 
that everybody bitch is about this bolt
doesn't<00:01:35.140> want<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.350> go<00:01:35.470> back<00:01:35.680> in<00:01:35.950> because

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
doesn't want to go back in because

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.310 
doesn't want to go back in because
there's<00:01:36.460> not<00:01:36.640> room<00:01:36.970> but<00:01:37.630> here's<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:38.050> trick

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
there's not room but here's the trick

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.540 
there's not room but here's the trick
and<00:01:38.470> this<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.740> going<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.979> be<00:01:39.070> kind<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.340> hard<00:01:39.490> to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
and this is going to be kind of hard to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.180 
and this is going to be kind of hard to
show<00:01:39.670> with<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.880> camera<00:01:43.360> but<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:44.190> want

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
show with with the camera but you want

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:56.070 
show with with the camera but you want
to<00:01:45.280> move<00:01:45.399> your<00:01:45.460> shifter<00:01:54.390> you're<00:01:55.390> gonna<00:01:55.660> move

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
to move your shifter you're gonna move

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.710 
to move your shifter you're gonna move
your<00:01:56.229> shifter<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.810> at<00:01:58.960> an<00:01:59.080> angle<00:01:59.640> and

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
your shifter so it's at an angle and

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.060 
your shifter so it's at an angle and
this<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:01.780> really<00:02:02.200> difficult<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.710> do<00:02:02.830> with<00:02:02.950> this

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
this is really difficult to do with this

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.300 
this is really difficult to do with this
faring<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:05.170> if<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.380> keep<00:02:05.710> your<00:02:05.860> shifter

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
faring and if you keep your shifter

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.759 
faring and if you keep your shifter
where<00:02:07.180> it's<00:02:07.330> at<00:02:07.479> an<00:02:07.570> angle<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:08.259> bolt<00:02:08.560> will

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
where it's at an angle that bolt will

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.620 
where it's at an angle that bolt will
slip<00:02:09.009> right<00:02:09.220> back<00:02:09.429> in<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.940> then<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.600> just

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
slip right back in and then you just

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.630 
slip right back in and then you just
tighten<00:02:11.019> it<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.620> like<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.100> was<00:02:12.250> earlier

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
tighten it like you like it was earlier

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.789 
tighten it like you like it was earlier
so<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:13.660> not<00:02:13.840> hard<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.590> like

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
so it is not hard to get in like

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.300 
so it is not hard to get in like
everybody<00:02:15.220> complains<00:02:15.670> about<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:17.070> that's<00:02:18.070> all

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
everybody complains about and that's all

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.520 
everybody complains about and that's all
