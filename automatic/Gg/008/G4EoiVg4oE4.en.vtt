00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
that's to say difficulty and inspiration

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.340 
that's to say difficulty and inspiration
there<00:00:12.260> is<00:00:12.380> a<00:00:12.410> sound<00:00:12.710> during<00:00:13.340> inspiration

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
there is a sound during inspiration

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.560 
there is a sound during inspiration

following total thyroidectomy which of
the<00:00:17.720> following<00:00:17.869> is<00:00:18.230> likely<00:00:18.560> expected<00:00:19.310> during

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
the following is likely expected during

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.109 
the following is likely expected during
trans<00:00:20.210> nozzle<00:00:20.890> endoscopy<00:00:21.890> here<00:00:22.550> we<00:00:22.730> have<00:00:22.939> to

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
trans nozzle endoscopy here we have to

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.230 
trans nozzle endoscopy here we have to
look<00:00:23.240> for<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.840> nerve<00:00:24.380> injury<00:00:24.650> that<00:00:25.580> might<00:00:25.910> have

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
look for a nerve injury that might have

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.560 
look for a nerve injury that might have
resulted<00:00:26.750> in<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:27.460> Strider<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.419> nerve

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
resulted in this Strider of the nerve

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.980 
resulted in this Strider of the nerve
injuries<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.320> might<00:00:30.939> complicate

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
injuries that might complicate

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.200 
injuries that might complicate
thyroidectomy<00:00:32.990> we<00:00:33.770> have<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.280> injury<00:00:34.820> of<00:00:35.030> the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
thyroidectomy we have the injury of the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.720 
thyroidectomy we have the injury of the
recurrent<00:00:35.900> laryngeal<00:00:36.050> nerve<00:00:36.650> injury<00:00:37.220> of<00:00:37.520> the

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
recurrent laryngeal nerve injury of the

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.840 
recurrent laryngeal nerve injury of the
external<00:00:38.090> laryngeal<00:00:38.420> nerve<00:00:39.020> injury<00:00:39.650> of<00:00:39.950> the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
external laryngeal nerve injury of the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.540 
external laryngeal nerve injury of the
sympathetic<00:00:41.720> trunk<00:00:42.200> these<00:00:43.010> are<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.370> most

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
sympathetic trunk these are the most

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.960 
sympathetic trunk these are the most
likely<00:00:43.850> common<00:00:44.390> nerve<00:00:45.020> injuries<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.760> let's

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
likely common nerve injuries so let's

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.240 
likely common nerve injuries so let's
look<00:00:47.150> at<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.480> options<00:00:47.660> inability<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.650> elevate

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
look at the options inability to elevate

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.090 
look at the options inability to elevate
the<00:00:49.460> soft<00:00:49.730> palate<00:00:50.650> elevation<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.890> soft

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
the soft palate elevation of the soft

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.400 
the soft palate elevation of the soft
palate<00:00:52.190> requires<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.720> action<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:54.260> the

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
palate requires the action of the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.560 
palate requires the action of the
pharyngeal<00:00:54.860> plexus<00:00:55.430> which<00:00:55.610> is<00:00:55.820> contributed

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
pharyngeal plexus which is contributed

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.340 
pharyngeal plexus which is contributed
to<00:00:56.600> by<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.590> vagus<00:00:57.950> nerve<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.900> vagus<00:01:00.170> nerve

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
to by the vagus nerve so the vagus nerve

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.830 
to by the vagus nerve so the vagus nerve
is<00:01:00.500> less<00:01:01.460> likely<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.910> be<00:01:02.090> injured<00:01:02.270> here<00:01:02.660> it's

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
is less likely to be injured here it's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.630 
is less likely to be injured here it's
the<00:01:03.020> branches<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.710> vagus<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:04.220> might<00:01:04.430> be

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
the branches of the vagus that might be

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.910 
the branches of the vagus that might be
injured<00:01:04.970> as<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:05.750> mentioned<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.380> external

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
injured as I mentioned the external

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.740 
injured as I mentioned the external

recurrent laryngeal nerve is injured
during<00:01:51.860> thyroidectomy<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:53.960> likely<00:01:54.229> to

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
during thyroidectomy and it is likely to

during thyroidectomy and it is likely to
be<00:01:54.560> injured<00:01:54.770> during<00:01:55.250> thyroidectomy<00:01:56.120> because

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
be injured during thyroidectomy because

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.180 
be injured during thyroidectomy because
it<00:01:56.570> is<00:01:56.690> closely<00:01:57.020> related<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.860> inferior

it is closely related to the inferior
thyroid<00:01:58.400> artery<00:01:59.299> then<00:02:00.170> this<00:02:00.409> results<00:02:00.920> in

thyroid artery then this results in

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.539 
thyroid artery then this results in

paralysis of the vocal fold vocal folds

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.450 
paralysis of the vocal fold vocal folds
they<00:02:05.330> add<00:02:05.659> duct<00:02:06.170> tadoule<00:02:06.530> information<00:02:07.310> and

they add duct tadoule information and

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.119 
they add duct tadoule information and
then<00:02:08.209> afterwards<00:02:08.840> they<00:02:09.110> are<00:02:09.289> abducted<00:02:09.950> so

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
then afterwards they are abducted so

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.970 
then afterwards they are abducted so
leaving<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:11.120> wide<00:02:11.390> space<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.440> between<00:02:12.590> them

then<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.689> vocal<00:02:18.049> cords<00:02:18.409> will<00:02:18.650> be

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
then the vocal cords will be

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.370 
then the vocal cords will be
what<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:19.850> call<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.210> cadaveric<00:02:20.510> position<00:02:21.170> it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
what we call the cadaveric position it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.430 
what we call the cadaveric position it
is<00:02:21.890> midway<00:02:22.310> between<00:02:22.420> adduction<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.750> between

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
is midway between adduction and between

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.980 
is midway between adduction and between
abduction<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.460> this<00:02:26.150> will<00:02:26.360> result<00:02:26.840> in

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
abduction and this will result in

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.980 
abduction and this will result in
narrowing<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.340> Rema<00:02:29.090> gloated<00:02:29.570> this<00:02:29.720> and

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
narrowing of the Rema gloated this and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.400 
narrowing of the Rema gloated this and
therefore<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:31.460> will<00:02:31.730> result<00:02:32.180> in<00:02:32.480> difficulty

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
therefore this will result in difficulty

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.040 
therefore this will result in difficulty
