00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.750
 android x86 is an adapted version of the 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.270
 android to run on notebooks and pcs 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.520
 the operating system was modified by 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.160
 a team of enthusiasts and leads to 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.820
 kitkat version for computers 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.970
 but will it work the installation is well 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.060
 simply go to the official page of the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.010
 download the iso and burn it and a 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.620
 cd or thumb drive 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.379
 when putting the machine with this image a 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.100
 menu with several options should appear in the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.740
 screen 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.900
 the main ones are the live cd for 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.150
 use the system without installing 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.360
 I installed the floor to install the 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.460
 definite form in the android machine 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.790
 you should configure everything automatically 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.770
 but it may not recognize everything in one 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.410
 of the machines we tested it did not 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.050
 installed iff by requiring an adapter 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.110
 to work 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.560
 the system interface is the same as 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.810
 practically any android 4.4 pure 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.060
 there are no thirds or programs 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.670
 unnecessary beyond those present 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.159
 on the system from the beginning the applications 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.120
 systems also work without many 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.100
 problems 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.250
 the place is still the main tour 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.369
 source of applications but not everything can 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.070
 to be installed an example of this is the ocs 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.790
 ep as the program is not supported on 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.560
 version of android for tablets 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.720
 some applications are not adapted 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.720
 to the large screen as is the case with 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.240
 facebook that stretches - and makes it difficult 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.430
 reading the content but several 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.030
 programs work very well as 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.189
 google plus firm and gmail work with 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.259
 more than one program at a time will be 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.049
 very different than on windows 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.729
 android does not offer a system 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.830
 multitasking, leaving the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.479
 applications that are not active in 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.790
 second plan 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.340
 already one of the most interesting 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.649
 system with respect to windows is the bar 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.170
 notifications with all your 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.329
 useful resources like letting you know 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.030
 a facebook messenger conversation a 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:20.250
 arrival of an email the weather forecast 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.349
 to use android with keyboard and mouse is so 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.599
 easy to use windows 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.010
 gesture with the mouse also 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.870
 work well 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.290
 the same way you use the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.540
 interface applications living on 28 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.299
 already searches and voice commands does not 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.760
 worked in our tests the notebook 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.060
 was only able to identify the command ok 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.489
 google use the system on a screen 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.769
 touchscreen is even better beyond you 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.590
 be able to use android in the same way as 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.349
 already accustomed can also perform 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.359
 certain tasks with the keyboard and the 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.239
 mouse are more convenient for 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.370
 certain cases 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.379
 although the camera captures photos by 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.180
 some unknown error they stayed 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.030
 all corrupted 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.370
 the keyboard is automatically recognized 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.129
 but you need to change the layout for the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.409
 some Brazilian plugins do not 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.689
 are supported by the system 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.389
 disrupts web browsing in 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:21.239
 some websites 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.169
 playing on an x86 system can be good and 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.900
 bad 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.730
 some games have gone much better on him 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.799
 with the use of a keyboard and mouse 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.620
 mainly games that only require 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.400
 that you click like candy daycare and 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.489
 clash of flames but it will be difficult to play 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.109
 games that need more controls 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.620
 mainly because 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.780
 all recognize the keyboard or mouse in 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.239
 touchscreen screens there is no secret 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.609
 everything will work just like any 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.540
 tablet or smartphone equipped with the 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.419
 android 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.930
 however some games did not adapt 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:00.540
 to the x86 system and simply do not 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.930
 scenarios as in the case of the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.930
 sims 3 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.390
 install android on a pc does not stop 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.270
 be especially interesting for 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.720
 who likes the system but in practice 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.090
 It can be cool just out of curiosity. 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.500
 since the absence of a system 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.870
 multitasking can get in the way 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.410
 even if google already offers to chrome 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.230
 west for notebooks with x86 architecture 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.240
 the system only runs web applications and 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.010
 the extensive range of 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.290
 android apps 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.930
 between the trumps of the android in relation 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.330
 windows is the notification bar 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.760
 integration between applications and 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.460
 variety of programs 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.710
 if you are a worthwhile enthusiast 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.550
 install windows butt and enjoy the 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.530
 benefits of each system 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.970
