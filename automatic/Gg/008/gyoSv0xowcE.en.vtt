going on I didn't know if I wanted ones
have<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.610> Fanny<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> don't<00:00:54.539> like

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
have my Fanny because I don't like

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.900 
have my Fanny because I don't like
clutter<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> lot<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
clutter I do not like to have a lot of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.119 
clutter I do not like to have a lot of
mess<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:58.199> everything<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.739> super

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
mess I like everything to be super

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.729 
mess I like everything to be super
organized<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> figured<00:01:01.140> instead<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.620> me

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
organized so I figured instead of me

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
organized so I figured instead of me
having<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.160> 15<00:01:02.640> different<00:01:03.000> pieces<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.809> would

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
having like 15 different pieces it would

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
having like 15 different pieces it would
be<00:01:04.110> easier<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.500> me<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:04.979> stuff<00:01:05.400> here

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
be easier for me to have my stuff here

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.760 
be easier for me to have my stuff here
so<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.510> gonna<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.869> ahead<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.200> start<00:01:07.500> breaking

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so I'm gonna go ahead and start breaking

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.469 
so I'm gonna go ahead and start breaking
everything<00:01:08.310> down<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.820> guys<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.330> ahead

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
everything down so you guys can go ahead

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.090 
everything down so you guys can go ahead
and<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.900> how<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> works<00:01:10.619> okay<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.810> first

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
and see how this works okay so first

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.719 
and see how this works okay so first
this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.369> piece<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.830> then<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.340> next

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
this is one piece and then then the next

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.030 
this is one piece and then then the next
piece<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> separate<00:01:19.560> piece<00:01:22.040> so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
piece is actually a separate piece so

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.080 
piece is actually a separate piece so
here's<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:24.500> compartment<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.520> here<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
here's one compartment and then here is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.609 
here's one compartment and then here is
the<00:01:27.119> second<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:29.180> okay<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.439> kind

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
the second one okay if I know it's kind
