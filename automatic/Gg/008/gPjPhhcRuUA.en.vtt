 representing the brand yamaha agritech de 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:31.380
 already 12 years ago and on this long road 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.510
 our great concern has always been to 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.380
 technical assistance our company has 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.510

 parts and technical assistance 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.730
 very well remembered I think this is a 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.070
 fundamental and most important point 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.710
 the company by the board of directors 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.850
 really worth mentioning here in which 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.910
 structure 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.590
 the mechanic training with the tooling and 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.120
 with every apparatus to give a good 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.520
 technical assistance 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.160
 four years ago we started a 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.560
 partnership with technical assistance to 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.300
 is located on the register and when the 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.710
 people talk in four years are four 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.750
 years of mechanical dedication training 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.330

 we have in the valley region 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:29.230
 I think this idea is for us to start 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:31.990
 to put is these units and so the 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.600
