00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
just wonder what kind of legs it would

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
just wonder what kind of legs it would
have<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.699> mean<00:00:53.909> here's<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> thing<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559

have I mean here's the thing it's a the
$99<00:00:56.129> console<00:00:56.639> it<00:00:56.940> has<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> Tegra<00:00:57.839> 3<00:00:57.870> chipset<00:00:58.589> so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
$99 console it has a Tegra 3 chipset so

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.129 
$99 console it has a Tegra 3 chipset so
it's<00:00:59.129> basically<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.519> same<00:00:59.989> processor<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:01.139 
it's basically the same processor and

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's basically the same processor and
video<00:01:01.199> card<00:01:01.619> that<00:01:01.769> runs<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.159> new<00:01:02.249> google

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
video card that runs the new google

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.359 
video card that runs the new google
nexus<00:01:03.149> tablet<00:01:03.869> and<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.159> eight

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
nexus tablet and then it's got eight

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.340 
nexus tablet and then it's got eight
gigs<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> internal<00:01:05.820> storage<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:06.540> maybe

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
gigs of internal storage which maybe

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.670 
gigs of internal storage which maybe
doesn't<00:01:07.650> sound<00:01:07.800> like<00:01:07.950> enough<00:01:08.160> to<00:01:08.220> me<00:01:08.370> and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
doesn't sound like enough to me and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.660 
doesn't sound like enough to me and
that's<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.040> supposed<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.400> super

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
that's it it's supposed to be super

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.130 
that's it it's supposed to be super
hackable<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.720> open<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
hackable like you can open it with a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
hackable like you can open it with a
regular<00:01:13.320> screwdriver<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.490> make<00:01:15.000> your

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
regular screwdriver and just make your

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
regular screwdriver and just make your
own<00:01:15.350> peripherals<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.440> it<00:01:16.800> do<00:01:17.610> whatever<00:01:17.760> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
own peripherals for it do whatever you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.490 
own peripherals for it do whatever you
can<00:01:18.090> supposed<00:01:18.510> to<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.630> easy<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> root<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.410> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
can supposed to be easy to root so you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.110 
can supposed to be easy to root so you
can<00:01:19.620> put<00:01:19.740> full<00:01:20.040> android<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.730> so<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
can put full android on it so if you

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.850 
can put full android on it so if you
want<00:01:21.270> regular<00:01:21.600> Android<00:01:21.900> apps<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.410> think<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
want regular Android apps I think it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
want regular Android apps I think it
sounds<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.190> neat<00:01:23.430> hobbyist<00:01:24.000> hacker<00:01:24.300> thing

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
sounds like a neat hobbyist hacker thing

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.810 
sounds like a neat hobbyist hacker thing
but<00:01:25.260> I<00:01:25.290> really<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.800> wonder<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.760> a
