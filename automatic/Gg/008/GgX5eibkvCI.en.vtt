out there kind of looks like we're

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.880 
out there kind of looks like we're
flying<00:02:32.330> unfortunately<00:02:33.170> when<00:02:33.320> not<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:33.709> if<00:02:33.800> you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
can see the clouds passing underneath

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.540

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
airplane propped up on its little stilts

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.949 
airplane propped up on its little stilts
as<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.819> can<00:03:26.940> see<00:03:27.120> there<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.720> adds<00:03:27.870> a

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
as you can see there and it adds a

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.350 
as you can see there and it adds a
little<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.489> little<00:03:29.489> cunt<00:03:29.790> next<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.300> don't

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
little a little cunt next to it I don't

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.699 
little a little cunt next to it I don't
know<00:03:30.480> if<00:03:30.569> this<00:03:30.660> was<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:30.989> originally<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.500> don't

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
know if this was here originally I don't

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.339 
know if this was here originally I don't
think<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.980> was<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.940> might<00:03:36.269> have<00:03:36.420> been<00:03:36.540> as<00:03:37.170> in

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
think it was it might have been as in

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.720 
think it was it might have been as in
you<00:03:37.440> call<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> quantum<00:03:38.069> yeah<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.280> don't<00:03:38.370> think<00:03:38.519> it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
you call a quantum yeah I don't think it

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.030 
you call a quantum yeah I don't think it
was<00:03:38.819> because<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.330> added<00:03:39.599> like<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> little<00:03:40.080> air

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
was because it's added like a little air

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.839 
was because it's added like a little air
traffic<00:03:41.580> control<00:03:41.940> system<00:03:42.330> here<00:03:43.220> which<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.519> a

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
traffic control system here which is a

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.490 
traffic control system here which is a
bit<00:03:45.060> odd<00:03:45.180> considering<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.170> looks<00:03:46.410> like

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
bit odd considering that it looks like

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.600 
bit odd considering that it looks like
it's<00:03:46.769> crash-landed<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:49.290> yeah<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.680> flat<00:03:49.950> then

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
it's crash-landed so yeah the flat then

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.190 
it's crash-landed so yeah the flat then
why<00:03:50.760> does<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:50.970> green<00:03:51.239> glow<00:03:51.450> oh<00:03:51.810> it's<00:03:52.110> the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
why does a green glow oh it's the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.979 
why does a green glow oh it's the
mushrooms<00:03:52.650> yet<00:03:52.829> oh<00:03:53.040> well<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:54.329> but<00:03:54.840> yeah

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
mushrooms yet oh well the but yeah

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.420 
mushrooms yet oh well the but yeah
that's<00:03:55.110> just<00:03:55.230> pretty<00:03:55.500> cool<00:03:55.769> I'm<00:03:56.160> gonna<00:03:56.280> go

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
that's just pretty cool I'm gonna go

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.979 
that's just pretty cool I'm gonna go
take<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:56.640> look<00:03:56.790> at<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.030> rest<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.450> now<00:03:58.280> we

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
take a look at the rest of it now we

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.479 
take a look at the rest of it now we
close<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.110> door<00:04:01.290> here<00:04:01.440> for<00:04:01.590> added<00:04:01.799> effect<00:04:01.890> now

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
close the door here for added effect now

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.530 
close the door here for added effect now
I<00:04:02.700> think<00:04:03.000> this<00:04:03.209> room<00:04:03.420> was<00:04:03.540> broken<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:05.540> know

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
I think this room was broken I know

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.710 
I think this room was broken I know
what's<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.780> deal<00:04:06.870> with<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:08.630> think<00:04:09.630> it's

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
what's the deal with this I think it's

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.030 
what's the deal with this I think it's
because<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.170> can<00:04:10.319> actually<00:04:10.349> access<00:04:10.859> the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
because you can actually access the

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.080 
because you can actually access the
other<00:04:11.280> side<00:04:11.459> but<00:04:11.670> we're<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:11.819> going<00:04:12.030> to

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
other side but we're just going to

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.199 
other side but we're just going to
ignore<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.540> for<00:04:12.750> now<00:04:13.639> again<00:04:14.639> it<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.940> just<00:04:15.150> a

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
ignore that for now again it is just a

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.860 
ignore that for now again it is just a
very<00:04:15.420> small<00:04:15.540> mod<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:16.769> uh<00:04:17.239> it's<00:04:18.239> pretty<00:04:18.419> cool<00:04:18.600> I

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
very small mod but uh it's pretty cool I

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.370 
very small mod but uh it's pretty cool I
reckon<00:04:19.430> if<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.519> can't<00:04:20.789> get<00:04:21.150> any<00:04:21.329> other<00:04:21.570> extra

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
reckon if I can't get any other extra

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.400 
reckon if I can't get any other extra
areas<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:23.190> work<00:04:23.400> for<00:04:24.030> some<00:04:24.210> reason<00:04:24.539> or<00:04:24.690> if<00:04:25.080> just

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
areas to work for some reason or if just

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.560 
areas to work for some reason or if just
you<00:04:26.190> want<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.430> nice<00:04:26.580> little<00:04:26.820> thing<00:04:27.060> with<00:04:27.270> store

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
you want a nice little thing with store

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.390 
you want a nice little thing with store
and<00:04:27.750> just<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.350> can<00:04:29.039> live<00:04:29.190> here<00:04:29.310> I

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
and just have you can live here I

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.240 
and just have you can live here I
suppose<00:04:29.789> but<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.050> see<00:04:31.229> here<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:31.620> leads

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
suppose but you can see here this leads

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.240 
suppose but you can see here this leads
to<00:04:32.310> another<00:04:32.639> area<00:04:33.770> which<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.889> pretty<00:04:35.039> cool

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
to another area which is pretty cool

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.159 
to another area which is pretty cool
just<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.610> nice<00:04:35.789> little<00:04:35.820> back<00:04:36.270> area<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.960> would<00:04:37.050> be

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
just a nice little back area it would be

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.230 
just a nice little back area it would be
nice<00:04:37.320> if<00:04:37.350> they<00:04:37.650> had<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.830> storage<00:04:38.610> up<00:04:38.760> here<00:04:38.789> you

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
nice if they had a storage up here you

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.340 
nice if they had a storage up here you
know<00:04:39.270> if<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.539> could<00:04:39.630> actually<00:04:39.810> use<00:04:39.990> these

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
know if you could actually use these

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.180 
know if you could actually use these
bits<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.770> store<00:04:40.800> things<00:04:41.450> there<00:04:42.450> are<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.600> bit

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
bits to store things there are a bit

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.550 
bits to store things there are a bit
glitchy<00:04:44.190> textures<00:04:44.820> but<00:04:45.090> we<00:04:45.450> can<00:04:45.570> ignore<00:04:45.720> that

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
glitchy textures but we can ignore that

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.590 
glitchy textures but we can ignore that
so<00:04:48.560> yeah<00:04:48.860> there's<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.310> was<00:04:49.850> an<00:04:50.000> extra<00:04:50.330> baked

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
so yeah there's a was an extra baked

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.650 
so yeah there's a was an extra baked
somewhere<00:04:51.790> which<00:04:52.790> I'm<00:04:52.910> gonna<00:04:53.060> try<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.389> find

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
somewhere which I'm gonna try and find

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.580 
somewhere which I'm gonna try and find
if<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.290> can<00:04:54.440> actually<00:04:54.560> move<00:04:56.139> know<00:04:57.139> where<00:04:57.380> that's

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
if I can actually move know where that's

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.960 
if I can actually move know where that's
located<00:04:57.650> though<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.340> think<00:04:58.580> we<00:04:59.300> have<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.479> go<00:05:00.970> on

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
located though I think we have to go on

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.320 
located though I think we have to go on
there<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.270> think<00:05:02.419> we<00:05:02.479> have<00:05:02.510> to<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.750> back<00:05:02.900> up<00:05:03.050> here

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
there I think we have to go back up here

there I think we have to go back up here
and<00:05:05.330> go<00:05:05.510> through<00:05:05.810> this<00:05:06.169> one<00:05:09.160> no<00:05:10.160> I've<00:05:10.699> already
