00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.250
 in this little video tutorial we 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.460
 consider the wired connection process 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.540
 siren gsm alarm wagon 30 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 most often we buy 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.590
 wired internal light sound 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.140
 siren l d 95 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.130
 so we will look at the process 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.210
 connect 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.080
 just by her example as we see them and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.590
 there are two wires 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.899
 black must be connected to minus 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.270
 red to pluses in order to 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.140
 properly connect 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.140
 use the scheme 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.559
 look at the diagram see that the output of the siren 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.600
 has the name exit 6 if you count by 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:01:00.660
 connector then it is third from the top and plus y 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 us on connector number nine therefore 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:14.820
 connect the black wire to the third 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:15.409
 If the connector was counted from above 1 2 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470
 3 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:26.390
 unscrew and connect black 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.390
 the conductor to it we twist 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.200
 we do the same with plus 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.820
 conductor which is red 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.280
 according to the scheme 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.840
 we need to connect it to the connector number 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.620
 nine is counting 9 connector and perform 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.620
 connection 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.259
 but this connection is wired 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.610
 light siren gsm alarms 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.610
 wagon 30 finished
