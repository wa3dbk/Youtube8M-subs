00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.059
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.369
 second matchday beko basketball 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.480
 bundesliga to assume is the 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:26.080
 polar bears Bremerhaven with 87 to 47 more 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.119
 page headcoach kevin o team of 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.019
 polar bears bremerhaven with the first 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.750
 to play statement 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.559
 They have 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.640
 right shows again masterfully 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.629
 present sciences mainly 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.100
 not played well defense and there 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.620
 are a great and I have to do it all 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.860
 clearly my daddy say last game 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.860
 the rest, there is no excuse and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.350
 we kept up and because afterwards 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.050
 it was gone down and too many 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.880
 ball losses for simple things 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.350
 that we can not do because now 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.970
 fit or rebound planks 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.310
 Game system have all visit well too 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.860
 but still make a not so good 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:26.110
 because it is damn hard 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.530
 the coop on 6526 is your game 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.430
 win 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.790
 Thereafter , Thorsten says not 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.159
 25 gates four players twice the cord 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.610
 What were the main numbers from 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.009
 his view had first thanks for the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.740
 Congratulations I am very glad that we 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.250
 have presented to us today as 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.130
 for me that was the reason for the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.810
 Clear victory that was really in the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.770
 defense compared with the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.310
 Thursdays play a significant 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.869
 shovel on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.459
 most offensive we have tried 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.080
 the bremerhaven quickinfo jobs too 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.310
 we got that and we succeeded 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.400
 Of course, we have got our hands on us 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.810
 played 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 I think the bremerhavener have one 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.900
 very strong first five but then too 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.300
 very young second 5 and we have 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.769
 of course, so impression tries offensive 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.310
 expand 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.170
 that the bank has to play more 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.269
 speaks that states we have problems 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.040
 just get that with the sense 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.370
 Well done and that has us then 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.959
 of course played in the cards 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.530
 Defensive it was pretty good 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:49.680
 we have shown today often 24 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.549
 Seconds happened offensively faith 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.010
 I can also quite a time 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.500
 play a little better because they are fooling 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.060
 24 is about the true achievement 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.380
 away 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.260
 I think we can play faster 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.010
 I think we can do it with less 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.890
 dribblings get along but to the present 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.560
 time is clear that offensive with us 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.380
 not everything is going well because we have the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.560
 had many changes in the squad 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.600
 because of the injuries so that one 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.769
 build on the defensive power 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.690
 you have to do that 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.829
 and I'm sure offensive 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.030
 The machine will still be a bit 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.360
 be better chosen in the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.700
 a higher one in the next few weeks 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.190
 short word to two premier edgar user 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.840
 Today with Philipp later at the first 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.819
 times to sell falls 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.640
 both 2 team trainings with the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.530
 team and at philips - 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.610
 you should not set up then already 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.910
 but he did it well 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.220
 the same goes for edgar very much 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.190

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.980
 personality of the incredibly motivated 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.840
 he was incredibly annoyed that he 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.209
 because the ball losses had that too 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.430
 really wise come about 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.110
 but shortly afterwards he showed 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.970
 why we chose him 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.430
 an absolute enrichment for this 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.410
