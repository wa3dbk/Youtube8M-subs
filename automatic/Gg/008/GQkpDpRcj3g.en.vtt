hey guys welcome back to another moveset
video<00:00:03.090> it's<00:00:03.750> been<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> while<00:00:04.589> since<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:05.009> last

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
video it's been a while since my last

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.709 
video it's been a while since my last
video<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:07.130> yeah<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.160> apologize<00:00:08.370> for<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.880> but

video and yeah I apologize for that but

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.560 
video and yeah I apologize for that but
I'm<00:00:10.620> here<00:00:10.830> with<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> new<00:00:11.910> move<00:00:12.090> set<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.420> this

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
I'm here with a new move set and this

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.160 
I'm here with a new move set and this
can<00:00:12.780> be

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
can be

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.680 
can be
krookodile<00:00:14.070> he's<00:00:15.059> probably<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
krookodile he's probably one of the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.960 
krookodile he's probably one of the
coolest<00:00:16.139> 5th<00:00:16.350> gen<00:00:16.560> Pokemon<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.160> even<00:00:17.820> as

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
coolest 5th gen Pokemon and even as

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.439 
coolest 5th gen Pokemon and even as
Moxie<00:00:18.720> which<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.140> probably<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.270> one<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
Moxie which is probably like one of the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
Moxie which is probably like one of the
best<00:00:21.630> abilities<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.070> may<00:00:23.250> seem<00:00:23.519> like

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
best abilities so it may seem like

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.960 
best abilities so it may seem like
really<00:00:24.320> bad<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.189> set<00:00:26.400> up<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.609> sweep

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
really bad but if you can set up a sweep

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.000 
really bad but if you can set up a sweep
Moxie<00:00:27.750> will<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.680> help

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
Moxie will be like really help

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.550 
Moxie will be like really help
especially<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.640> lots<00:00:29.789> bulkier<00:00:30.179> Pokemon<00:00:30.660> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
especially for lots bulkier Pokemon so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.150 
especially for lots bulkier Pokemon so
this<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.830> using<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.160> home<00:00:32.340> clause<00:00:34.100> now<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
this is using a home clause now the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
this is using a home clause now the
problem<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.910> set<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.780> not

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
problem with this set is that it's not

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.580 
problem with this set is that it's not
exactly<00:00:37.170> fast<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> invest<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.590> things

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
exactly fast so I invest a lot of things

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.650 
exactly fast so I invest a lot of things
into<00:00:42.260> speed<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.460> problem<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
into speed but the problem with that is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
into speed but the problem with that is
a<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.219> things<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.520> speed<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
a lot of things out speed you and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
a lot of things out speed you and
they're<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.719> able<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> take<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> out

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
they're going to be able to take you out

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.299 
they're going to be able to take you out
so<00:00:50.510> yeah<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:52.140> sort<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.920> big

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so yeah it's that's sort of a big

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.430 
so yeah it's that's sort of a big
problem<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.750> he<00:00:54.780> uses<00:00:55.020> Iron<00:00:55.230> Tail

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
problem with it but he uses Iron Tail

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.290 
problem with it but he uses Iron Tail
stone<00:00:55.739> edge<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.070> crunch<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:56.789> normally<00:00:57.270> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
stone edge and crunch now normally I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.729 
stone edge and crunch now normally I
don't<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.780> little<00:00:57.960> accuracy<00:00:58.379> moves<00:00:58.590> like

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
don't like little accuracy moves like

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.299 
don't like little accuracy moves like
Stone<00:00:58.980> Edge<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.340> Iron<00:00:59.640> Tail<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.870> if<00:01:01.129> if<00:01:02.129> you

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Stone Edge or Iron Tail but if if you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
Stone Edge or Iron Tail but if if you
set<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.670> home<00:01:02.850> clause<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.449> Iron<00:01:04.110> Tail<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
set up a home clause then Iron Tail and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.030 
set up a home clause then Iron Tail and
Stone<00:01:04.650> Edge<00:01:05.299> they<00:01:06.299> practically<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> 100%

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
Stone Edge they practically have a 100%

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.780 
Stone Edge they practically have a 100%
chance<00:01:08.390> Stone<00:01:09.390> Edge<00:01:09.540> does<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:10.020> 100%<00:01:10.530> chance

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
chance Stone Edge does have 100% chance

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.740 
chance Stone Edge does have 100% chance
Irondale<00:01:11.790> actually<00:01:12.119> has<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> ninety<00:01:12.570> nine

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
Irondale actually has a ninety nine

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020 
Irondale actually has a ninety nine
point<00:01:12.990> seventy<00:01:13.470> five<00:01:13.710> percent<00:01:14.220> chance<00:01:14.700> that's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
point seventy five percent chance that's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
point seventy five percent chance that's
if<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.080> miss<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> Hoenn<00:01:16.920> clause

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
if you miss it with the Hoenn clause

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.390 
if you miss it with the Hoenn clause
boost<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.750> hacks<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
boost then that is hacks like to the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.539 
boost then that is hacks like to the
extreme<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> crunch<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.040> snap<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.400> don't

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
extreme and crunch just for snap I don't

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.880 
extreme and crunch just for snap I don't
know<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> stronger<00:01:24.240> dark<00:01:24.509> physical<00:01:25.259> move<00:01:25.470> other

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
know a stronger dark physical move other

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.670 
know a stronger dark physical move other
than<00:01:26.070> foul<00:01:26.430> play<00:01:26.729> which<00:01:26.970> isn't<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.450> work<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
than foul play which isn't really work I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.700 
than foul play which isn't really work I
guess<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.850> run<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> knockoff<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
guess you can run a knockoff but the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.929 
guess you can run a knockoff but the
reason<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> don't<00:01:32.130> want<00:01:32.250> earthquake<00:01:32.759> is

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
reason I don't want earthquake is

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.600 
reason I don't want earthquake is
because<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.650> has<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> hundred<00:01:35.250> percent

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
because it just has a hundred percent

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.280 
because it just has a hundred percent
accuracy<00:01:36.090> already<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.900> could<00:01:37.020> replace

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
accuracy already you could replace

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.679 
accuracy already you could replace
crunch<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.189> earthquake<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.000> want<00:01:39.329> but

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
crunch with earthquake if you want but

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.030 
crunch with earthquake if you want but
yeah<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.960> usually<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.649> psychic

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
yeah this is usually just for psychic

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
yeah this is usually just for psychic
types<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:45.320> yeah<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.670> boys<00:01:47.850> with

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
types and yeah you can the boys with

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.280 
types and yeah you can the boys with
earthquake<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:48.840> that's<00:01:48.960> actually

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
earthquake I think that's actually

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.609 
earthquake I think that's actually
probably<00:01:49.439> better<00:01:51.140> now<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.380> about

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
probably better now that I think about

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.120 
probably better now that I think about
it<00:01:52.890> because<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.180> there's<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.450> flying-type

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
it because if there's a flying-type

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.469 
it because if there's a flying-type
she's<00:01:56.130> stone<00:01:56.340> edge<00:01:57.770> yeah<00:01:59.180> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.299> better

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
she's stone edge yeah this is better

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.319 
she's stone edge yeah this is better
perfect<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.040> home<00:02:02.520> clause<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.000> boost<00:02:03.180> your

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
perfect and home clause to boost your

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.600 
perfect and home clause to boost your
accuracy<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.810> attack<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:05.219> gonna<00:02:05.340> allow<00:02:05.460> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
accuracy and attack it's gonna allow you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.639 
accuracy and attack it's gonna allow you
to<00:02:05.820> sweep<00:02:06.119> teams<00:02:06.479> quite<00:02:07.020> well<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.500> don't

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
to sweep teams quite well if they don't

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.570 
to sweep teams quite well if they don't
have<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> fast<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.599> but

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
have a fast one but

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.150 
have a fast one but
the<00:02:11.060> problem<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.720> speed<00:02:12.110> that's<00:02:12.980> why

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
the problem is the speed that's why

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.060 
the problem is the speed that's why
usually<00:02:14.200> Pokemon<00:02:15.200> with<00:02:15.320> moxie<00:02:15.770> are<00:02:15.830> better

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
usually Pokemon with moxie are better

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.680 
usually Pokemon with moxie are better
with<00:02:16.340> dragon<00:02:17.000> dance<00:02:17.180> because<00:02:17.420> they<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:17.630> a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
with dragon dance because they get a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.450 
with dragon dance because they get a
speed<00:02:17.990> boost<00:02:18.020> or<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.380> quiver<00:02:18.560> dancer<00:02:18.950> like<00:02:19.190> that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
speed boost or a quiver dancer like that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.240 
speed boost or a quiver dancer like that
but<00:02:20.410> we're<00:02:21.410> not<00:02:21.560> clover<00:02:21.860> dance<00:02:22.010> because

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
but we're not clover dance because

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.320 
but we're not clover dance because
that's<00:02:22.400> special<00:02:22.820> but<00:02:23.590> yeah<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:25.190> works<00:02:25.730> cuz

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
that's special but yeah it works cuz

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.960 
that's special but yeah it works cuz
Krueger<00:02:27.110> dial<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.440> not<00:02:27.800> too<00:02:28.130> slow<00:02:28.460> it's

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
Krueger dial is not too slow it's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.570 
Krueger dial is not too slow it's
actually<00:02:29.240> pretty<00:02:29.360> fast<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.340> this

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
actually pretty fast but this all this

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.940 
actually pretty fast but this all this
boosts<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.570> all<00:02:32.690> these<00:02:32.840> boosts<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.770> should

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
boosts with all these boosts you should

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.250 
boosts with all these boosts you should
be<00:02:34.040> able<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.280> beat<00:02:34.580> most<00:02:34.760> Pokemon<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.170> not

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
be able to beat most Pokemon so it's not

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.280 
be able to beat most Pokemon so it's not
too<00:02:36.410> bad<00:02:36.530> especially<00:02:36.740> in<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.460> you<00:02:38.290> he's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
too bad especially in you you he's

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.680 
too bad especially in you you he's
actually<00:02:39.560> can<00:02:40.040> do<00:02:40.190> quite<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.820> quite<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
actually can do quite this quite the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.380 
actually can do quite this quite the
stuff<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.670> even<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:43.760> you're<00:02:43.880> not<00:02:43.970> faster<00:02:44.360> than

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
stuff and even if you're not faster than

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.800 
stuff and even if you're not faster than
them<00:02:44.720> he<00:02:45.350> is<00:02:45.590> quite<00:02:45.890> bulky<00:02:46.160> as<00:02:46.520> well<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.060> maybe

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
them he is quite bulky as well so maybe

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.330 
them he is quite bulky as well so maybe
you<00:02:47.960> can<00:02:48.140> tank<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.590> attacks<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.070> hit<00:02:49.190> them

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
you can tank the attacks and hit them

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.330 
you can tank the attacks and hit them
back<00:02:49.490> but<00:02:50.330> yeah<00:02:50.570> he's<00:02:51.380> really<00:02:51.560> only<00:02:51.770> reliable

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
back but yeah he's really only reliable

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.630 
back but yeah he's really only reliable
against<00:02:52.790> certain<00:02:53.480> teams<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.020> are<00:02:54.140> really

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
against certain teams that are really

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.280 
against certain teams that are really
bulky<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.760> slow<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:57.440> yeah<00:02:58.400> than<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.910> he's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
bulky and slow but yeah than that he's

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.880 
bulky and slow but yeah than that he's
cuckoo<00:03:00.290> dial<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:01.250> really<00:03:01.490> good<00:03:01.670> um<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.890> yeah

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
cuckoo dial it's really good um and yeah

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.070 
cuckoo dial it's really good um and yeah
I<00:03:03.920> won't<00:03:04.250> be<00:03:04.400> able<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.640> show<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:05.240> battle

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
I won't be able to show a battle

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.660 
I won't be able to show a battle
demonstration<00:03:06.800> for<00:03:07.310> this<00:03:07.430> video<00:03:07.760> however<00:03:08.480> but

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
demonstration for this video however but

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.130 
demonstration for this video however but
maybe<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.270> future<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.810> just<00:03:11.960> do<00:03:12.110> a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
maybe in the future if I just do a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.770 
maybe in the future if I just do a
session<00:03:12.530> where<00:03:12.860> I'm<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.340> gonna<00:03:13.490> battle<00:03:13.820> you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
session where I'm just gonna battle you

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.500 
session where I'm just gonna battle you
might<00:03:15.200> see<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.680> guy<00:03:15.860> in<00:03:15.980> action<00:03:16.100> but<00:03:16.550> he's

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
might see this guy in action but he's

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.120 
might see this guy in action but he's
pretty<00:03:17.630> good<00:03:18.820> I've<00:03:19.820> tested<00:03:20.240> it<00:03:20.270> out<00:03:20.920> maybe<00:03:21.920> you

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
pretty good I've tested it out maybe you

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
pretty good I've tested it out maybe you
guys<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.459> test<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.760> out<00:03:22.850> as<00:03:23.120> well<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.800> yeah

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
guys can test it out as well and yeah

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.300 
guys can test it out as well and yeah
it's<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:26.480> actually<00:03:26.840> fairly<00:03:27.290> good<00:03:27.440> um<00:03:27.920> I

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
it's it's actually fairly good um I

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.790 
it's it's actually fairly good um I
really<00:03:29.120> like<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.540> it's<00:03:29.780> probably<00:03:30.380> one<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
really like it it's probably one of the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.340 
really like it it's probably one of the
better<00:03:31.730> sets<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.330> I<00:03:32.390> just<00:03:32.600> made<00:03:32.840> up<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.230> the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
better sets that I just made up on the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
better sets that I just made up on the
spot<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.950> just<00:03:34.610> like<00:03:34.760> thought<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.270> theory<00:03:36.370> this

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
spot I just like thought in theory this

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.460 
spot I just like thought in theory this
would<00:03:37.550> work<00:03:37.790> but<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.990> know<00:03:39.080> open<00:03:39.410> a

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
would work but you know open a

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.270 
would work but you know open a
calculator<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:41.709> tend<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.770> open<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.070> lot<00:03:43.160> of

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
calculator I tend to open a lot of

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.680 
calculator I tend to open a lot of
calculators<00:03:43.760> in<00:03:43.910> these<00:03:44.030> battles<00:03:44.180> but<00:03:44.450> look<00:03:44.600> at

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
calculators in these battles but look at

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.440 
calculators in these battles but look at
this<00:03:44.780> stone<00:03:45.680> just<00:03:45.980> eighty<00:03:46.190> accuracy<00:03:46.640> times

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
this stone just eighty accuracy times

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.830 
this stone just eighty accuracy times
1.33<00:03:48.290> which<00:03:49.100> is<00:03:49.340> how<00:03:50.060> much<00:03:50.209> home<00:03:50.420> clock<00:03:50.600> gives

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
1.33 which is how much home clock gives

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.510 
1.33 which is how much home clock gives
you<00:03:51.280> 106<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:52.580> 100%<00:03:53.030> chance<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:54.310> 75<00:03:55.310> which

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
you 106 so it's 100% chance and 75 which

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.350 
you 106 so it's 100% chance and 75 which
is<00:03:55.550> Iron<00:03:55.850> Tail

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
is Iron Tail

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.440 
is Iron Tail
time<00:03:57.140> times<00:03:57.860> 1.33<00:03:59.890> 99.75<00:04:00.890> accuracy<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:02.240> is

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
time times 1.33 99.75 accuracy that is

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.820 
time times 1.33 99.75 accuracy that is
pretty<00:04:02.870> good<00:04:03.850> if<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:05.060> miss<00:04:05.270> then<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:05.959> don't

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
pretty good if you miss then I don't

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.470 
pretty good if you miss then I don't
even<00:04:06.860> know<00:04:07.040> what<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.220> say<00:04:07.390> that's<00:04:08.390> just

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
even know what to say that's just

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.500 
even know what to say that's just
horrible<00:04:09.410> but<00:04:10.010> iron<00:04:10.250> down<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.610> much<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.360> only

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
horrible but iron down so much the only

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.930 
horrible but iron down so much the only
problem<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:11.930> if<00:04:12.110> you<00:04:12.260> have<00:04:12.650> cuckoo<00:04:13.489> dial<00:04:13.670> and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
really a point you can just run we can't

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330 
really a point you can just run we can't
learn<00:04:38.420> it<00:04:38.540> sort<00:04:38.720> of<00:04:38.750> sense<00:04:38.990> but<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:40.220> could

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
learn it sort of sense but you could

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.590 
learn it sort of sense but you could
just<00:04:40.490> one<00:04:40.610> earthquake<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.210> crunch<00:04:41.450> there's

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
just one earthquake and crunch there's

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.920 
just one earthquake and crunch there's
no<00:04:41.690> point<00:04:41.900> of<00:04:41.990> Iron<00:04:42.170> Tail<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:44.420> reason<00:04:44.810> for

no point of Iron Tail the reason for

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.440 
no point of Iron Tail the reason for
Iron<00:04:45.320> Tail<00:04:45.500> is<00:04:45.830> for<00:04:46.370> those<00:04:46.520> fairy<00:04:46.820> types

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
Iron Tail is for those fairy types

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.780 
Iron Tail is for those fairy types
he's<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.660> dark-type<00:04:47.960> he<00:04:48.770> takes<00:04:48.980> them<00:04:49.310> some

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
he's a dark-type he takes them some

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.320 
he's a dark-type he takes them some
damage<00:04:50.240> from<00:04:50.410> fairies<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:51.620> using<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.550> you

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
damage from fairies you using and you

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.630 
damage from fairies you using and you
can<00:04:53.360> kill<00:04:53.690> them<00:04:54.070> pretty<00:04:55.070> simple

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.550 

grass<00:04:58.640> types<00:04:58.940> aren't<00:04:59.480> really<00:04:59.840> easy<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.410> take

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
grass types aren't really easy to take

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.430 
grass types aren't really easy to take
care<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.800> water<00:05:01.550> types<00:05:01.820> earthquake<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.630> stone

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
care of water types earthquake and stone

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.670 
care of water types earthquake and stone
edge<00:05:03.620> work<00:05:03.920> against<00:05:04.370> them<00:05:05.260> but<00:05:06.260> Iron<00:05:06.410> Tail<00:05:06.560> is

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
edge work against them but Iron Tail is

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.960 
edge work against them but Iron Tail is
also<00:05:06.890> good<00:05:07.010> on<00:05:07.040> grass<00:05:07.280> types<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.640> guess<00:05:07.790> because

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
also good on grass types I guess because

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.620 
also good on grass types I guess because
it's<00:05:08.390> not<00:05:08.570> resisted<00:05:09.140> like<00:05:09.950> unlike<00:05:10.880> earthquake

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
it's not resisted like unlike earthquake

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.200 
it's not resisted like unlike earthquake
and<00:05:11.810> Stonehenge<00:05:12.050> but<00:05:12.560> he's<00:05:13.520> not<00:05:13.640> that<00:05:13.700> bad<00:05:14.000> if

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
and Stonehenge but he's not that bad if

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.420 
and Stonehenge but he's not that bad if
you<00:05:14.300> can<00:05:14.480> get<00:05:15.110> some<00:05:15.350> kills<00:05:15.620> your<00:05:15.830> Moxie<00:05:16.250> boost

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
you can get some kills your Moxie boost

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.930 
you can get some kills your Moxie boost
