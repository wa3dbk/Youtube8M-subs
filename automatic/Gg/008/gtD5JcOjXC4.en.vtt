00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
right and whilst they're more expensive

right and whilst they're more expensive
I<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.960> argue<00:01:10.320> they're<00:01:10.470> better

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
I have actually argue they're better

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
I have actually argue they're better
value<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.040> money<00:01:11.250> yes<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> toy

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
value for money yes because with a toy

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
value for money yes because with a toy
dealer<00:01:13.260> you're<00:01:13.979> actually<00:01:14.369> getting<00:01:14.520> much<00:01:15.060> much

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
dealer you're actually getting much much

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.990 
dealer you're actually getting much much
better<00:01:15.630> grade<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> quite<00:01:17.009> better<00:01:17.250> quality<00:01:17.759> but

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
better grade of quite better quality but

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149 
better grade of quite better quality but
of<00:01:18.240> course<00:01:18.570> they're<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.780> expensive<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.740> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
of course they're more expensive but in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.289 
of course they're more expensive but in
terms<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.520> value<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.820> money<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.150> you're

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
terms of value for money I think you're

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
terms of value for money I think you're
getting<00:01:21.479> better<00:01:21.630> value<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.140> money<00:01:22.320> there

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
getting better value for money there

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.660 
getting better value for money there
the<00:01:23.400> other<00:01:23.549> thing<00:01:23.880> perhaps<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.540> look<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.960> is

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
the other thing perhaps to look at is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.190 
the other thing perhaps to look at is
once<00:01:26.670> you've<00:01:27.030> got<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.390> couple<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.840> coin<00:01:28.049> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
once you've got a couple of coin you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.499 
once you've got a couple of coin you
wanted<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> spend<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.100> bit<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:29.610> let's<00:01:30.150> say<00:01:30.329> for

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
wanted to spend a bit more let's say for

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
wanted to spend a bit more let's say for
instance<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.930> want<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.229> spend<00:01:31.530> 200<00:01:32.100> quid<00:01:32.400> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
instance you want to spend 200 quid you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.929 
instance you want to spend 200 quid you
could<00:01:33.360> buy<00:01:34.350> 10<00:01:34.920> 20<00:01:35.759> quid<00:01:35.970> fish<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:38.159> way<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> look

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
could buy 10 20 quid fish the way I look

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.710 
could buy 10 20 quid fish the way I look
at<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> I'd<00:01:39.390> probably<00:01:39.600> recommend<00:01:40.229> buying<00:01:40.890> one

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
at it I'd probably recommend buying one

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
at it I'd probably recommend buying one
200<00:01:42.720> pound<00:01:42.960> fish<00:01:43.280> rather<00:01:44.280> than<00:01:44.490> having<00:01:44.670> ten

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
200 pound fish rather than having ten

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.130 
200 pound fish rather than having ten
that<00:01:45.869> might<00:01:46.640> develop<00:01:47.640> them<00:01:48.000> turn<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.479> okay

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that might develop them turn out okay

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.899 
that might develop them turn out okay
the<00:01:49.649> chances<00:01:50.100> are<00:01:50.220> none<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.430> them<00:01:50.670> will

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the chances are none of them will

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.780 
the chances are none of them will
whereas<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.020> 200<00:01:52.560> pound<00:01:52.770> fish<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.369> far

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
whereas the one 200 pound fish is far

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.630 
whereas the one 200 pound fish is far
more<00:01:53.970> likely<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.170> don't<00:01:55.590> spend<00:01:55.979> 200<00:01:56.490> quid

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
more likely to but don't spend 200 quid
