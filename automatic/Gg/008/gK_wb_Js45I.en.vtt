00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
a one graphic card you are limited to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.060 
a one graphic card you are limited to
have<00:00:23.730> only<00:00:24.199> depending<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> model<00:00:25.560> attica

card you're only to show you for example

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.420 
card you're only to show you for example
in<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.650> case<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:32.160> graphic<00:00:32.579> card<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.880> GTX<00:00:33.690> 4

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
in this case my graphic card is a GTX 4

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.150 
in this case my graphic card is a GTX 4
470<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:36.090> almost<00:00:36.410> almost<00:00:37.410> three<00:00:37.710> years<00:00:37.739> old

470 it's almost almost three years old
so<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.329> case<00:00:39.540> I'm<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:39.870> limited<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.790> two

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
so in this case I'm just limited to two

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.930 
so in this case I'm just limited to two
options<00:00:41.969> either<00:00:42.750> two<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.649> TV<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.489> one

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.420 
DVI in combination with one HDMI port
and<00:00:50.750> since<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:51.930> doing<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> lot<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> software

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and since I'm doing a lot of software

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.029 
and since I'm doing a lot of software
development<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.410> really<00:00:55.410> feel<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> need<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
development I really feel the need to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.860 
development I really feel the need to
add<00:00:56.309> another<00:00:56.460> graphic<00:00:57.030> card<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:57.480> system<00:00:57.840> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
add another graphic card to my system so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.920 
add another graphic card to my system so
I<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.949> two<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.489> four<00:00:59.760> monitors<00:01:00.210> so

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

well guys I install the graphic card and
suprisingly<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:55.170> operating<00:01:55.830> system<00:01:56.160> and<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
suprisingly the operating system and the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.520 
suprisingly the operating system and the
Nvidia's<00:01:57.240> driver<00:01:58.580> automatically<00:01:59.580> find<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
Nvidia's driver automatically find the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
Nvidia's driver automatically find the
graphic<00:02:01.530> card<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.580> automatically<00:02:03.360> also

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
graphic card and it automatically also

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.500 
graphic card and it automatically also
find<00:02:03.900> my<00:02:04.190> third<00:02:05.190> monitor<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.940> one<00:02:06.479> on

anything so just everything got
automatically<00:02:12.330> done<00:02:12.540> now<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.990> three

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
automatically done now I have three

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.680 
automatically done now I have three
monitors<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.670> two<00:02:14.820> graphic<00:02:15.209> cards<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
monitors I have two graphic cards and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.930 
monitors I have two graphic cards and
three<00:02:15.900> monitors<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:17.160> believe<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.580> can<00:02:17.610> add

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
three monitors and I believe I can add

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.870 
three monitors and I believe I can add
one<00:02:18.209> other<00:02:18.360> monitor<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.160> total<00:02:20.459> for<00:02:20.700> what

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
one other monitor so in a total for what

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.900 
one other monitor so in a total for what
I<00:02:20.910> think<00:02:21.090> I'm<00:02:21.330> okay<00:02:21.540> with<00:02:21.720> three<00:02:22.470> monitors<00:02:22.910> so

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I think I'm okay with three monitors so

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.699 
I think I'm okay with three monitors so
the<00:02:24.270> Terra<00:02:24.510> monitor<00:02:24.810> setup<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.230> quite<00:02:25.440> good

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the Terra monitor setup is quite good

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.250 
the Terra monitor setup is quite good
for<00:02:26.000> people<00:02:27.000> who<00:02:27.060> are<00:02:27.150> working<00:02:27.360> with<00:02:27.690> graphics

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
for people who are working with graphics

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.040 
for people who are working with graphics
and<00:02:28.790> people<00:02:29.790> working<00:02:30.180> with<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.450> spreadsheets

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
and people working with the spreadsheets

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.990 
and people working with the spreadsheets
and<00:02:31.830> also<00:02:32.310> programmers<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.850> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
and also programmers because you do the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.940 
and also programmers because you do the
programming<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.540> your<00:02:36.720> main<00:02:36.930> window<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:37.800> on

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
programming on your main window then on

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.940 
programming on your main window then on
your<00:02:38.130> left<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.610> may<00:02:38.820> have<00:02:39.030> your<00:02:39.950> debugging

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
your left you may have your debugging

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.990 
your left you may have your debugging
window<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.790> right<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.080> your

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
window on the right you can have your

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.030 
window on the right you can have your
memory<00:02:45.000> trace<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.660> stuff<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.380> it's

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
memory trace and stuff like that so it's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.460 
memory trace and stuff like that so it's
a<00:02:47.220> good<00:02:47.489> idea<00:02:48.060> if<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.390> are<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.660> productive<00:02:49.290> guy

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
a good idea if you are a productive guy

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.150 
a good idea if you are a productive guy
so<00:02:49.860> go<00:02:50.760> ahead<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:50.970> try<00:02:51.530> triple<00:02:52.530> mitre<00:02:52.709> setup

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
so go ahead and try triple mitre setup

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.460 
so go ahead and try triple mitre setup
as<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.120> see<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.480> my<00:02:54.690> main<00:02:54.900> monitor<00:02:55.080> is

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
as you can see that my main monitor is

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.449 
as you can see that my main monitor is
23<00:02:56.280> inches<00:02:56.370> by<00:02:56.850> samsung<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:58.070> think<00:02:59.070> it's<00:02:59.220> cause

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
23 inches by samsung I think it's cause

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.259 
23 inches by samsung I think it's cause
for<00:02:59.640> like<00:02:59.850> 140<00:03:00.750> 30<00:03:01.049> years<00:03:01.350> nowadays<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
for like 140 30 years nowadays and the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.110 
for like 140 30 years nowadays and the
left<00:03:03.570> one<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> right<00:03:03.959> corner<00:03:04.370> just<00:03:05.370> very

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
left one on the right corner just very

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.930 
left one on the right corner just very
old<00:03:06.360> 17<00:03:07.080> inch<00:03:07.230> monitors<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.010> picked<00:03:08.850> them

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
old 17 inch monitors then I picked them

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.110 
old 17 inch monitors then I picked them
up<00:03:09.090> for<00:03:09.390> like<00:03:09.630> 30<00:03:10.620> euros<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.100> both<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:12.000> am

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
up for like 30 euros for both and I am

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.300 
up for like 30 euros for both and I am
really<00:03:12.269> happy<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.840> setup<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.440> think<00:03:14.220> it

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
really happy with the setup I think it

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.050 
really happy with the setup I think it
will<00:03:14.430> help<00:03:14.610> me<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.989> more<00:03:16.019> productive<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.060> if

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
will help me to be more productive so if

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.640 
will help me to be more productive so if
you<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.480> video<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:18.870> give<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.440> thumb

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
up and if you didn't like it give it a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.820 
up and if you didn't like it give it a
dislike<00:03:22.500> now<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.280> don't<00:03:23.400> care<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.420> yeah<00:03:25.260> see<00:03:25.739> you

dislike now I don't care so yeah see you
next<00:03:26.040> time<00:03:26.160> bye

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.490 

okay<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.080> was<00:03:32.320> just<00:03:32.410> kidding<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:33.210> really<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
okay I was just kidding but really the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.400 
okay I was just kidding but really the
Nvidia<00:03:35.980> control<00:03:36.130> panel<00:03:36.340> was<00:03:37.410> tested

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
Nvidia control panel was tested

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.100 
Nvidia control panel was tested
everything<00:03:38.890> on<00:03:39.340> itself<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.330> didn't<00:03:40.810> have

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
everything on itself and I didn't have

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.760 
everything on itself and I didn't have
to<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.350> anything

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
to do anything

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.300 
to do anything
and<00:03:42.540> let's<00:03:43.540> see<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.230> just<00:03:44.380> wanted<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.980> show<00:03:45.280> you

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
and let's see I just wanted to show you

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.000 
and let's see I just wanted to show you
the<00:03:45.580> some<00:03:45.880> options<00:03:46.360> you<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.350> see<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.590> have<00:03:47.830> two

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
the some options you can see I have two

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.990 
the some options you can see I have two
monitors<00:03:48.310> now<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:49.600> main<00:03:50.410> monitor<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.280> 23

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
monitors now the main monitor is the 23

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000 
monitors now the main monitor is the 23
inch<00:03:52.210> fighter<00:03:52.480> that<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.170> saw<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.620> was<00:03:53.800> in<00:03:53.920> the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
inch fighter that you saw it was in the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.540 
inch fighter that you saw it was in the
middle

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
middle

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.730 
middle
another<00:03:55.300> sunghak<00:03:55.720> monitor<00:03:55.990> was<00:03:56.260> on<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.500> left

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
another sunghak monitor was on the left

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.270 
another sunghak monitor was on the left
and<00:03:57.040> then<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:58.630> right<00:03:58.660> one<00:03:59.080> is<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.410> HP<00:03:59.710> model

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
and then the right one is the HP model

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.140 
and then the right one is the HP model
so<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.180> can<00:04:01.500> individually<00:04:02.970> choose<00:04:03.970> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
so you can individually choose the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.110 
so you can individually choose the
resolutions<00:04:04.750> but<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:06.400> best<00:04:06.610> option<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.090> to

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
resolutions but the best option is to

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.770 
resolutions but the best option is to
keep<00:04:07.840> them<00:04:08.050> on<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.290> native<00:04:08.650> resolution<00:04:09.780> and

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
keep them on the native resolution and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.810 
keep them on the native resolution and
one<00:04:11.470> very<00:04:12.220> cool<00:04:12.460> thing<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.430> go<00:04:15.580> to<00:04:15.610> the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
one very cool thing is if you go to the

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.270 
one very cool thing is if you go to the
physics<00:04:16.299> configuration<00:04:17.080> then<00:04:17.799> you<00:04:17.890> can<00:04:18.070> see

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
physics configuration then you can see

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.940 
physics configuration then you can see
that<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.640> can<00:04:18.820> choose<00:04:19.000> between<00:04:19.709> your<00:04:20.709> main

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
that you can choose between your main

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.780 
that you can choose between your main
graphic<00:04:21.370> card<00:04:21.580> in<00:04:22.000> case<00:04:22.180> mine<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:22.930> gtx<00:04:23.890> 470

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
graphic card in case mine is gtx 470

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.240 
graphic card in case mine is gtx 470
that<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:25.870> obviously<00:04:26.290> much<00:04:26.590> more<00:04:26.770> powerful

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
that is obviously much more powerful

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.670 
that is obviously much more powerful
than<00:04:27.400> GT<00:04:28.000> 610<00:04:28.720> but<00:04:29.380> just<00:04:29.830> for<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.040> case<00:04:30.520> of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
than GT 610 but just for a case of

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.520 
than GT 610 but just for a case of
testing<00:04:32.680> i'm<00:04:32.860> i<00:04:33.460> set<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.300> physics<00:04:35.080> processor

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
testing i'm i set the physics processor

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.120 
testing i'm i set the physics processor
to<00:04:35.980> be<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.370> GT<00:04:36.880> 610<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:38.050> what<00:04:38.350> did<00:04:38.530> what<00:04:38.950> this

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
to be on GT 610 so what did what this

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.820 
to be on GT 610 so what did what this
means<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.550> that<00:04:39.750> if<00:04:40.750> any<00:04:40.990> game<00:04:41.230> is<00:04:41.440> requiring

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
means is that if any game is requiring

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.350 
means is that if any game is requiring
physics<00:04:42.370> sir<00:04:42.910> then<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:45.250> physic<00:04:45.850> processing

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
physics sir then the physic processing

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.210 
physics sir then the physic processing
will<00:04:46.540> be<00:04:46.630> done<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.110> second<00:04:47.680> graphic<00:04:47.920> card

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
will be done on the second graphic card

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.390 
will be done on the second graphic card
i<00:04:48.400> just<00:04:48.640> add<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:50.910> then<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.860> 470<00:04:53.860> will<00:04:54.010> be<00:04:54.190> more

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
i just add and then the 470 will be more

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.530 
i just add and then the 470 will be more
free<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.820> do<00:04:55.030> some<00:04:55.210> other<00:04:55.330> stuff<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:55.960> i<00:04:56.230> think

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
free to do some other stuff so i think

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.280 
free to do some other stuff so i think
the<00:04:58.540> chip<00:04:58.750> card<00:04:58.960> like<00:04:59.230> this<00:04:59.410> can<00:04:59.920> be<00:05:00.070> used<00:05:00.250> as<00:05:00.490> a

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
the chip card like this can be used as a

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.620 
the chip card like this can be used as a
dedicated<00:05:02.290> physics<00:05:03.040> processor<00:05:03.580> i<00:05:03.820> think<00:05:04.510> it's

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
dedicated physics processor i think it's

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.870 
dedicated physics processor i think it's
a<00:05:04.720> cool<00:05:04.930> thing<00:05:04.960> i<00:05:05.320> don't<00:05:05.680> know<00:05:05.770> how<00:05:05.950> powerful

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
a cool thing i don't know how powerful

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.880 
a cool thing i don't know how powerful
it<00:05:07.000> is<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.330> anyway<00:05:08.080> there<00:05:08.320> are<00:05:08.440> not<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.650> lot<00:05:08.770> of

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
it is and anyway there are not a lot of

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.160 
it is and anyway there are not a lot of
games<00:05:09.760> out<00:05:10.060> there<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.450> support<00:05:10.810> physics

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
games out there that support physics

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.390 
games out there that support physics
it's<00:05:12.160> just<00:05:12.600> like<00:05:13.600> less<00:05:14.500> than<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:14.740> number<00:05:15.130> of

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
it's just like less than a number of

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.570 
it's just like less than a number of
your<00:05:15.880> fingers<00:05:16.330> but<00:05:16.570> anyway<00:05:17.470> we'll<00:05:18.220> see<00:05:18.250> how<00:05:18.430> it

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
your fingers but anyway we'll see how it

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.460 
your fingers but anyway we'll see how it
goes<00:05:18.810> so<00:05:20.220> hope<00:05:21.220> you<00:05:21.370> enjoyed<00:05:21.670> this<00:05:21.790> video<00:05:22.060> and

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
goes so hope you enjoyed this video and

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.190 
goes so hope you enjoyed this video and
see<00:05:23.470> you<00:05:23.530> guys<00:05:23.590> later<00:05:23.710> bye
