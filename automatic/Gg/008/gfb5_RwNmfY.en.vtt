the year against spread they were 3 and
15<00:00:49.649> against<00:00:50.250> spread<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.090> last<00:00:51.329> 18<00:00:51.719> games

so<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> Spurs<00:00:52.980> here<00:00:53.160> my<00:00:53.280> even<00:00:53.550> at

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
so you like the Spurs here my even at

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.869 
so you like the Spurs here my even at
minus-9<00:00:54.170> do<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.199> also<00:00:55.469> like<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> under<00:00:56.129> 191

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
minus-9 do I also like the under 191

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.010 
minus-9 do I also like the under 191
when<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> roll<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.750> fur<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
when I'm going to roll of this fur is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
when I'm going to roll of this fur is
minus<00:00:58.379> 9i<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.100> could<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.430> closed<00:00:59.699> for

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
minus 9i think it could be closed for

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
minus 9i think it could be closed for
Washington<00:01:00.539> Lakers<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:01.050> playing<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
Washington Lakers I'm playing with a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650 
Washington Lakers I'm playing with a
high<00:01:01.649> level<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> energy<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:03.000> their<00:01:03.210> bench<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
high level of energy but their bench is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.140 
high level of energy but their bench is
not<00:01:04.019> much<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.530> Bezier<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.250> way<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.729> think

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
not much of a Bezier in that way I think

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.940 
not much of a Bezier in that way I think
the<00:01:06.240> Spurs<00:01:06.450> bench<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> much<00:01:07.170> deeper<00:01:07.470> i<00:01:07.680> think

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the Spurs bench is much deeper i think

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.109 
the Spurs bench is much deeper i think
when<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.460> third<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.850> fourth

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
when we get to that third or fourth

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.580 
when we get to that third or fourth
quarter<00:01:09.510> i<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.170> when<00:01:10.260> you're<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
quarter i think is when you're going to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
quarter i think is when you're going to
see<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> Spurs<00:01:11.159> ball<00:01:11.430> mount<00:01:11.729> win<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.090> game<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
see the Spurs ball mount win this game I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.490 
see the Spurs ball mount win this game I
think<00:01:12.450> they're<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> win<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.080> game<00:01:13.290> by

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
think they're going to win this game by

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.950 
think they're going to win this game by
14<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.159> 16<00:01:14.580> points<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.150> think<00:01:15.210> nine<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.750> about

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
14 to 16 points so I think nine is about

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.719 
14 to 16 points so I think nine is about
the<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.229> number<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.460> fiddle

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the right number I think it will fiddle

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
the right number I think it will fiddle
around<00:01:17.850> nine<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:19.020> most<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> game<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
around nine for most of the game that I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.499 
around nine for most of the game that I
think<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> towards<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> end<00:01:20.790> you're<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
think it towards the end you're going to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.080 
think it towards the end you're going to
see<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:22.049> experienced<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.979> more<00:01:23.490> healthier

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
see a more experienced a more healthier

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.170 
see a more experienced a more healthier
or<00:01:24.360> fresh<00:01:25.049> leg<00:01:25.409> routine<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> lakers<00:01:26.970> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
or fresh leg routine when the lakers you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819 
or fresh leg routine when the lakers you
got<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> remember<00:01:27.479> every<00:01:27.990> game<00:01:28.200> counted<00:01:28.680> for

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
got to remember every game counted for

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.800 
got to remember every game counted for
them<00:01:28.950> down<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> stretch<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.270> they're<00:01:30.420> gassed

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
them down the stretch so they're gassed

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.510 
them down the stretch so they're gassed
and<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.229> lost<00:01:31.409> their<00:01:31.680> best<00:01:31.860> player<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.460> see

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and they lost their best player they see

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.149 
and they lost their best player they see
a<00:01:32.729> national<00:01:33.270> questionable<00:01:33.900> zero<00:01:34.590> bench<00:01:34.950> on

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
a national questionable zero bench on

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.800 
a national questionable zero bench on
that<00:01:35.340> Laker<00:01:35.579> team<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> Spurs

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that Laker team and then you got a Spurs

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.390 
that Laker team and then you got a Spurs
team<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.380> healthy<00:01:37.740> they've<00:01:37.950> been<00:01:38.070> able<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
team that's healthy they've been able to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.179 
team that's healthy they've been able to
rest<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> last<00:01:39.090> 10<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> 15<00:01:39.930> games<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.829> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
rest for the last 10 to 15 games and you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
rest for the last 10 to 15 games and you
got<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> best<00:01:41.610> coach<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.119> NBA<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.810> think

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
got the best coach in the NBA I think

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.590 
got the best coach in the NBA I think
the<00:01:43.439> lakers<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.030> destroyed<00:01:45.420> in

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the lakers are going to get destroyed in

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.789 
the lakers are going to get destroyed in
this<00:01:45.689> first<00:01:45.930> game<00:01:46.110> i<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.439> lose<00:01:46.649> by

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
this first game i think they lose by

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.800 
this first game i think they lose by
about<00:01:47.009> 15<00:01:47.490> points<00:01:47.880> no<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.479> tend<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> agree

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
about 15 points no I would tend to agree

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.929 
about 15 points no I would tend to agree
with<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.110> obviously<00:01:49.860> recommending<00:01:50.579> fading

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
with that obviously recommending fading

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.160 
with that obviously recommending fading
the<00:01:51.030> Lakers<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> something<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.110> people

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the Lakers is something that people

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.080 
the Lakers is something that people
would<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.340> probably<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.850> good<00:01:54.030> idea

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
would think is probably a good idea

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.660 
would think is probably a good idea
there<00:01:54.689> were<00:01:54.780> 34<00:01:55.290> 46<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.130> two<00:01:56.280> against<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
there were 34 46 and two against the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
there were 34 46 and two against the
spread<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.630> year<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:58.079> thought<00:01:58.320> my

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
spread on the year but my thought my

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.350 
spread on the year but my thought my
only<00:01:58.770> thought<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.369> only<00:01:59.520> concern<00:01:59.909> is<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.119> may

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
only thought my only concern is that may

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.810 
only thought my only concern is that may
be<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.509> lot<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.100> overvaluation<00:02:02.100> had<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> do

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
be a lot of that overvaluation had to do

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.730 
be a lot of that overvaluation had to do
with<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.450> Kobe<00:02:04.140> Bryant<00:02:04.469> being<00:02:04.619> in

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
with just you know Kobe Bryant being in

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.050 
with just you know Kobe Bryant being in
the<00:02:04.799> lineup<00:02:04.979> people<00:02:05.399> loving<00:02:05.640> about<00:02:05.729> uncle

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the lineup people loving about uncle

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.459 
the lineup people loving about uncle
Brian<00:02:06.360> maybe<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.780> thinking<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.079> now<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
Brian maybe I'm thinking that now that

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.109 
Brian maybe I'm thinking that now that
he's<00:02:07.560> out<00:02:07.770> they'll<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:09.030> know

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
he's out they'll be you know

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.520 
he's out they'll be you know
appropriately<00:02:09.660> valued<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.200> anything

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
appropriately valued or if anything

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.930 
appropriately valued or if anything
maybe<00:02:10.739> under<00:02:11.099> red<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.489> don't<00:02:11.640> think<00:02:11.790> that's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
maybe under red you don't think that's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.580 
maybe under red you don't think that's
the<00:02:12.030> case

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
the case

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.589 
the case
it's<00:02:13.250> an<00:02:13.459> interesting<00:02:13.730> point<00:02:14.150> because<00:02:14.300> their

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
it's an interesting point because their

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.330 
it's an interesting point because their
team<00:02:15.110> has<00:02:15.290> completely<00:02:15.680> changed<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.280> we

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
team has completely changed and we

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.100 
team has completely changed and we
figured<00:02:16.700> out<00:02:16.819> get<00:02:17.000> white<00:02:17.330> Howard<00:02:17.690> was<00:02:17.900> in

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
figured out get white Howard was in

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.259 
figured out get white Howard was in
Orlando<00:02:18.650> when<00:02:18.890> he<00:02:19.040> was<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.370> superstar<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.150> now

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
Orlando when he was the superstar so now

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.300 
Orlando when he was the superstar so now
this<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.420> kind<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.810> Dwight<00:02:21.050> Howard<00:02:21.410> theme<00:02:21.800> but

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
this is kind of Dwight Howard theme but

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.280 
this is kind of Dwight Howard theme but
can<00:02:22.519> they<00:02:22.670> really<00:02:22.970> get<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.390> together<00:02:23.540> against

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
can they really get it together against

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.290 
can they really get it together against
the<00:02:24.349> really<00:02:24.680> experienced<00:02:25.250> panel<00:02:25.970> Antonio

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
the really experienced panel Antonio

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.759 
the really experienced panel Antonio
team<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.690> lakers<00:02:26.840> had<00:02:27.200> some<00:02:27.440> meaningful

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
team the lakers had some meaningful

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.199 
team the lakers had some meaningful
games<00:02:28.129> down<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.459> stretch<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:28.879> they<00:02:29.000> really

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
games down the stretch but they really

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.610 
games down the stretch but they really
never<00:02:29.480> beat<00:02:29.840> me<00:02:30.019> buddy<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.410> really

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
never beat me buddy that really

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.589 
never beat me buddy that really
impressed<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.220> about<00:02:31.700> Houston<00:02:32.239> Lynn<00:02:32.420> was

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
impressed you about Houston Lynn was

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.119 
impressed you about Houston Lynn was
somewhat<00:02:32.959> impressive<00:02:33.349> last<00:02:33.680> night<00:02:33.890> but

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
somewhat impressive last night but

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.320 
somewhat impressive last night but
neither<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.459> those<00:02:34.580> teams<00:02:34.849> really<00:02:35.090> had<00:02:35.299> a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
neither of those teams really had a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.539 
neither of those teams really had a
whole<00:02:35.660> lot<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.110> line<00:02:36.260> other<00:02:36.830> than<00:02:37.069> seating

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
whole lot on the line other than seating

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.309 
whole lot on the line other than seating
I<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:38.209> don't<00:02:38.420> think<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.720> lakers<00:02:38.930> are<00:02:39.140> going

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
I just don't think the lakers are going

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.720 
I just don't think the lakers are going
to<00:02:39.379> be<00:02:39.470> able<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.799> put<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.010> together<00:02:40.220> quick

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
to be able to put it together quick

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.460 
to be able to put it together quick
enough<00:02:41.000> they<00:02:41.420> hang<00:02:41.569> with<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> really<00:02:42.200> savvy

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
enough they hang with a really savvy

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.320 
enough they hang with a really savvy
veteran<00:02:43.010> team<00:02:43.250> like<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:43.549> for<00:02:43.819> some<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.239> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
veteran team like this for some of the
