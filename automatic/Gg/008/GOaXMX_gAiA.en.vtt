00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.839
 apparently the creator of fineza fredys 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.839
 it does not stop us from getting excited with what 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:11.710
 he does now scott has left us a 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.870
 new fainÃ© title 64 this time the 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.090
 changes are the following letters 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.240
 they say scott game appear from a 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.360
 color between pink and dark purple and what 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.910
 more important is the image that your 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.910
 hat and a bowtie but the color 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.040
 purple now if we give a little more of 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.529
 shine will look like on the bottom 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.980
 right there is a sentence in English that 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.050
 translated into Spanish says property of and 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.140
 then initials appear which 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.720
 are the row r maybe the initial 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.960
 freddy and then we have the words 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.990
 terminals which are the e and the r 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.360
 maybe from the words fassberg good 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.610
 this is what we can see from this 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.000
 picture now what I think of the 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.820
 image is that maybe this is a color 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.579
 confusing between ros and purple so I have 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.960
 two theories the first one is that when we 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.970
 shows the purple hat 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.070
 understand that maybe the freddy purple 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.860
 has to do with something very important the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.310
 story as you will see I think that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.460
 it will be a nightmare that is located in the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.460
 first pizzeria but good now the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.070
 second theory is the same but it only 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.930
 modify some parts you remember that 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.750
 when we increase the brightness it was seen 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.180
 enigmatic phrase good but also 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.280
 change the color of the hat to a pink 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.009
 very similar to the pink man the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.440
 finest afraid 2 so this makes me 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.170
 think that this character has to do 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.660
 fredy with purple and with history 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.030
 no one really knows only that this is missing 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.880
 leave us more clues so that maybe 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.280
 let's solve this mystery there is a 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.320
 curious fact in the teaser no longer 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.840
 shows the release date 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.880
 maybe the good change only he knows 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.210
 but the very great likes the video has 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.310
 liked to share it with everyone
