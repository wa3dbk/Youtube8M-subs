strawberry compote so a compote is a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.790 
strawberry compote so a compote is a
little<00:00:24.390> bit<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> jam<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.410> as<00:00:25.590> much

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
little bit like a jam it's not as much

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.630 
little bit like a jam it's not as much
sheer<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.580> almost<00:00:27.980> half<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.369> sugar<00:00:29.609> that

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
sheer it's almost half of the sugar that

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.630 
sheer it's almost half of the sugar that
you<00:00:29.880> would<00:00:30.029> find<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.449> jam<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.489> what

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you would find in a jam so that's what

so now we are going to make a panna
cotta<00:01:49.090> in<00:01:49.630> three<00:01:50.230> second<00:01:50.680> basically<00:01:51.090> this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
cotta in three second basically this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.820 
cotta in three second basically this
makes<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.010> easy<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.250> use<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.680> you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
makes it so easy to use that you

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.550 
makes it so easy to use that you
basically<00:01:56.980> just<00:01:57.280> put<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:58.260> inside<00:01:59.260> of<00:01:59.290> the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
basically just put that inside of the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.050 
basically just put that inside of the
pot<00:01:59.770> bring<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.700> boil<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:02.700> pour<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:03.970> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
pot bring it to boil and pour it in the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.480 
pot bring it to boil and pour it in the
container<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:05.380> one<00:02:05.590> we're<00:02:06.010> going<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.190> let<00:02:06.400> it

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
container this one we're going to let it

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.210 
container this one we're going to let it
cool<00:02:06.670> down<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.540> cooler<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.050> just<00:02:08.979> top<00:02:09.190> it

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
cool down in the cooler and just top it

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.790 
cool down in the cooler and just top it
