00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
problem is to identify the pest when the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.800 
problem is to identify the pest when the
sago<00:01:19.350> scale<00:01:19.740> came<00:01:20.070> over<00:01:20.490> many<00:01:21.149> people<00:01:21.570> thought

sago scale came over many people thought

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
sago scale came over many people thought
and<00:01:23.060> rightly<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.799> they<00:01:25.799> had<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.010> downing

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and rightly so that they had a downing

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.430 
and rightly so that they had a downing
or<00:01:26.610> powdery<00:01:26.970> mildew<00:01:27.360> problem<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> disease

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
or powdery mildew problem a disease

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.440 
or powdery mildew problem a disease
problem<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.370> were<00:01:29.430> using<00:01:29.670> fungicides

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
problem so they were using fungicides

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
problem so they were using fungicides
and<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.170> does<00:01:31.350> look<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.799> serious<00:01:32.460> case<00:01:32.640> of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and it does look like a serious case of

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.990 
and it does look like a serious case of
powdery<00:01:33.270> mildew<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.670> fungicides<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.880> not

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
powdery mildew so fungicides will not

which is typical for scale insects but
what's<00:03:20.650> not<00:03:20.830> too<00:03:21.130> typical

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
what's not too typical

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.870

well hidden away under the Brax as you

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.840 
well hidden away under the Brax as you

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.530 
well as doing well on the root system
this<00:03:39.040> makes<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.430> very<00:03:39.460> difficult<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.240> control

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
this makes it very difficult to control

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.350 
this makes it very difficult to control

place<00:03:48.250> let's<00:03:48.760> take<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> look<00:03:49.270> at<00:03:49.420> this<00:03:49.540> female

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
place let's take a look at this female

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.820 
place let's take a look at this female
flower<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.940> got<00:03:52.150> an<00:03:52.300> outrageous<00:03:52.990> population

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
flower it's got an outrageous population

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.700 
flower it's got an outrageous population
and<00:03:54.310> as<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.610> can<00:03:54.730> see<00:03:54.940> on<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.210> flowering<00:03:55.870> head

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
and as you can see on the flowering head

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.390 
and as you can see on the flowering head
here<00:03:57.630> we<00:03:58.630> noticed<00:03:59.050> even<00:03:59.260> some<00:03:59.650> on<00:03:59.830> out<00:04:00.100> of<00:04:00.250> our

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
here we noticed even some on out of our

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.950 
here we noticed even some on out of our
clean<00:04:00.820> potatoes<00:04:01.570> we<00:04:02.530> opened<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:04.120> flower<00:04:04.570> up

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
clean potatoes we opened the flower up

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.340 
clean potatoes we opened the flower up
and<00:04:05.470> noticed<00:04:06.070> that<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.700> was<00:04:07.000> just<00:04:07.870> inundated

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
and noticed that it was just inundated

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.550 
and noticed that it was just inundated
with<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.100> scale<00:04:09.960> we're<00:04:10.960> gonna<00:04:11.050> see<00:04:11.380> where

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
with the scale we're gonna see where

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.290 
with the scale we're gonna see where
these<00:04:11.770> little<00:04:11.950> scale<00:04:12.460> insects<00:04:12.910> are<00:04:13.060> hidden

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
these little scale insects are hidden

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.500 
these little scale insects are hidden
away<00:04:13.420> there<00:04:14.230> beneath<00:04:14.590> all<00:04:15.430> it's<00:04:15.790> covering<00:04:16.330> on

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
away there beneath all it's covering on

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:24.630 
away there beneath all it's covering on
the<00:04:16.570> trunk

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.390 

so<00:04:25.640> you<00:04:25.730> have<00:04:25.880> all<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:26.180> wooly<00:04:26.570> stuff<00:04:27.400> that's

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
so you have all this wooly stuff that's

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.940 
so you have all this wooly stuff that's
wrapped<00:04:28.700> around<00:04:28.850> these<00:04:29.150> Brax

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
wrapped around these Brax

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.570 
wrapped around these Brax
and<00:04:31.090> it's<00:04:32.090> not<00:04:32.210> too<00:04:32.360> bad<00:04:32.600> this<00:04:32.840> time<00:04:33.580> often

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
and it's not too bad this time often

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.550 
and it's not too bad this time often
you'll<00:04:34.880> see<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.090> scale<00:04:35.450> insects<00:04:35.930> underneath

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
you'll see the scale insects underneath

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.260 
you'll see the scale insects underneath
this<00:04:36.710> wooly<00:04:37.010> stuff<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.610> then<00:04:37.700> you<00:04:37.850> peel<00:04:38.120> these

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
this wooly stuff and then you peel these

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.980 
this wooly stuff and then you peel these
Brax<00:04:38.630> off<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.850> you'll<00:04:41.810> see<00:04:42.020> scale<00:04:42.320> insects

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
Brax off and you'll see scale insects

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.990 
Brax off and you'll see scale insects
around<00:04:44.990> those<00:04:45.260> parts<00:04:45.770> if<00:04:46.520> you're<00:04:46.760> going<00:04:46.880> to

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
control this insect you need to remove

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.270 
control this insect you need to remove
these<00:04:48.980> pups<00:04:49.510> these<00:04:50.510> offshoots<00:04:51.140> which<00:04:52.100> are

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
these pups these offshoots which are

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:02.330 
these pups these offshoots which are
scale<00:04:52.790> magnets<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:58.660> then

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.270 

you<00:05:02.910> can<00:05:03.090> see<00:05:03.360> they<00:05:03.840> just<00:05:03.870> swarm<00:05:04.380> on<00:05:04.710> this

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
you can see they just swarm on this

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:15.220 
you can see they just swarm on this
tender<00:05:05.639> growth

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.620 

all<00:05:16.230> right<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:16.680> it's<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.670> scale<00:05:18.030> insects<00:05:18.390> also

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
all right so it's the scale insects also

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.620 
all right so it's the scale insects also
on<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.200> roots<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:20.100> makes<00:05:20.370> it<00:05:20.550> very<00:05:21.270> very

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
on the roots so that makes it very very

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.230 
on the roots so that makes it very very
hard<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:22.050> control<00:05:22.400> that's<00:05:23.400> why<00:05:23.700> this<00:05:23.760> scales

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
hard to control that's why this scales

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.750 
hard to control that's why this scales
been<00:05:24.840> so<00:05:25.050> successful<00:05:25.770> in<00:05:25.920> eradicating<00:05:26.190> our

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
been so successful in eradicating our

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.600 
been so successful in eradicating our
say<00:05:27.000> goes<00:05:27.320> because<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.560> scale<00:05:29.010> insect<00:05:29.460> is

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
say goes because the scale insect is

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.840 
say goes because the scale insect is
feeding<00:05:30.000> everywhere<00:05:30.480> on<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.840> plant<00:05:31.170> a

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
feeding everywhere on the plant a

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.880 
feeding everywhere on the plant a
systemic<00:05:32.850> insecticide<00:05:33.540> is<00:05:33.750> needed<00:05:34.230> how<00:05:34.770> does

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
systemic insecticide is needed how does

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.070 
systemic insecticide is needed how does
the<00:05:35.010> systemic<00:05:35.520> work<00:05:35.730> it's<00:05:36.300> applied<00:05:36.600> as<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.810> soil

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
the systemic work it's applied as a soil

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
drench the roots pick up the insecticide

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.450 
drench the roots pick up the insecticide
and<00:05:40.080> translocate<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:40.950> throughout<00:05:41.250> the<00:05:41.430> entire

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
tank truck system so the foliage

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.790 
tank truck system so the foliage
treatments<00:05:57.000> aren't<00:05:57.240> going<00:05:57.480> to<00:05:57.600> impact<00:05:58.140> the

treatments aren't going to impact the

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.340 
treatments aren't going to impact the
populations<00:05:59.460> on<00:05:59.640> the<00:05:59.790> roots<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.420> on<00:06:00.870> hidden

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.620 
populations on the roots and on hidden
underneath<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.920> stuff<00:06:02.190> on<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.490> trunk<00:06:02.790> so<00:06:03.120> you

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
underneath the stuff on the trunk so you

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.290 
underneath the stuff on the trunk so you
need<00:06:03.780> to<00:06:03.900> go<00:06:04.050> in<00:06:04.200> with<00:06:04.230> a<00:06:04.410> systemic<00:06:05.300> that's

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
need to go in with a systemic that's

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.230 
need to go in with a systemic that's
gonna<00:06:06.660> reach<00:06:06.960> all<00:06:07.230> parts<00:06:07.620> of<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.890> plant<00:06:08.240> you

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
gonna reach all parts of the plant you

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.210 
gonna reach all parts of the plant you
have<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:09.900> give<00:06:10.020> it<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.140> holistic<00:06:10.710> approach

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
have to give it a holistic approach

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.940 
have to give it a holistic approach
treatment<00:06:13.370> so<00:06:14.370> besides<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:15.060> soil<00:06:15.420> treatment

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
treatment so besides the soil treatment

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.320 
treatment so besides the soil treatment
we<00:06:16.950> can<00:06:16.980> also<00:06:17.280> look<00:06:17.520> at<00:06:17.700> attacking<00:06:18.090> the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
we can also look at attacking the

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.210 
we can also look at attacking the
