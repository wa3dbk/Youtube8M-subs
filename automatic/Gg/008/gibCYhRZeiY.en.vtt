beginning<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.829> allow<00:00:55.980> such

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
beginning if we will not allow such

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.040 
beginning if we will not allow such
thing<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:57.000> let<00:00:57.239> them<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.570> such<00:00:57.809> thing

and<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.430> will<00:00:59.640> discourage<00:01:00.030> them

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and if they do it will discourage them

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.799 
and if they do it will discourage them
to<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> definite<00:01:02.809> mark

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to do it so there is a definite mark

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
to do it so there is a definite mark
that<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.320> pinpointed<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.159> will<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.460> allow<00:01:05.670> or

that we pinpointed we will not allow or

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.179 
that we pinpointed we will not allow or
will<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.540> beyond<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.890> sense

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
will not go beyond so in that sense

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
will not go beyond so in that sense
sometime<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.670> feel<00:01:09.150> key<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.510> are<00:01:09.570> restricted

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
