the population explosion was in the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the world's resources and we would enter

and the number of things have changed to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.819 
and the number of things have changed to
make<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> more<00:00:42.480> important<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.140> development

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
look at very carefully in our initiative

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.969 
look at very carefully in our initiative
