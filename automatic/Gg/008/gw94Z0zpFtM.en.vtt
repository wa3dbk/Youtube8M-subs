00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.850
 the united states drill is going to welcome this new real cap of 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.059
 deaths that he disagrees with and on this occasion he can make the introduction to 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:09.720
 shadows in the drawing 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.890
 and generally in the real world too 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.420
 to show the basic principles and then be able to educate our own 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.579
 shades 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.690
 so good that you found nothing 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.800
 an image that pretty much explains what it is or the shadows and what helps 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.919
 quite the past 9 April when we are looking 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.249
 same the first thing to do when we have when we are going to start 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.019
 a drawing 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.800
 whether he is yes we are as a model d 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 the real world is moving that we're going to achieve 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.600
 there is always 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.120
 by art scientists the light source does not take it out 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.400
 you have to see where the light comes from not exactly we have to be seeing the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.630
 zoologist we have to even him our drawing or a focus whatever 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.920
 but simply see what direction it comes from 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.570
 and good saved almerÃ­a in this case we have as an example a sphere 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.080
 and in that school there are several percent and shadows and illuminations we want another to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.550
 watch 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.390
 this time that d from here in means the brightest bag and the time 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.570
 in case of staying almost where you wait 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.860
 since he is hitting the light directly 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.970
 around this one of this one in the itc is the half tone 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.890
 and it's a little darker 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.630
 i more massa can be in the shade 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.300
 that is the darkest of the he waits 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.240
 and what is the furthest thing from the search and maybe percent this part 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.690
 of the estuary is hiding this other part of the sphere that's why it's also 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.560
 East is other costs us 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.780
 Kennedy is but obviously the method by which the half tone 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.480
 others a very very interesting jury has out 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.540
 there is a reflection 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.670
 what to say this the light is touching against it floor is bouncing hasel 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.960
 sphere 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.650
 this is how by repression to be nothing happens because if the recession is 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.219
 plus 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.680
 related to the light of how I hope that 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.469
 so then percent this repression 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.250
 the zone when the clear wait is going to see bava of the repression of this material to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.840
 material 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.510
 and in this case it would be almost as bright as dancing 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.239
 after repression as they put them healed 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.349
 since this is the part behind the wait 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.029
 so remember the air 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.499
 half tone 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.909
 some reflection if the boat allows it 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.199
 and again the shadow here 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.669
 here we have a new element 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:35.959
 that is more this projected or married shadow that depends a lot on the position 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.330
 of the light of those of the octet that is lending the shadow 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.420
 and d the object that is receiving this case we could imagine that it is a table 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.659
 to a floor 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.659
 if he does have an irregular surface he will see 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.249
 slightly a very different one can also make the shadow to project the 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.059
 object 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.189
 and all that we have opened by the PSOE 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.609
 now since we know this let's see some different types of 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.609
 Illuminations and shadows for example better a studio photo 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:07.139
 here we can see that we are so obvious but there are several sources of 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.429
 light in this image 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.659
 here at least you can criticize 2 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.749
 thus 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.049
 just this side is living one from here to here 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.930
 and here another one that is looking at this side is more intense as of account of 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:21.459
 that 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.439
 because here there is a good 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.489
 portion of shadow that is lending kyle girl in red 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.780
 and as of account, there's nothing k and that's why he's lending himself to this 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.389
 side because the shadow must be more out like this 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.639
 if nothing else come here light 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.450
 same 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.219
 up there is a speaker from the one who is coming from the top down 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.719
 you can realize this because the girls' forehead is pretty 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.529
 illuminated can also be that 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:51.719
 and if there were no saluzzi that will have more shadow on the forehead it will not be seen 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.349
 also as we are seeing it here 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.409
 in addition we can also realize that there is a strong light above if not 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.479
 let's oppose mackenzie we just cast a shadow 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.899
 like here below him from the sofa cushion 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:06.289
 and well that's how a country identifies light and light in which 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.459
 produces the works 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.889
 now let's see this afternoon is very interesting a natural landscape here the 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.799
 only light that we are going to see is the sun's door the sun and the one reflected by the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.829
 When the road collides with the road, they are bouncing off the 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.000
 beams of light up expensive not as intense as 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.749
 can not be single and so we can observe it for example the bottom 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:28.870
 of the trees 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.360
 we have some light 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.400
 and here where it does not reach so much in the path of the pine sun broken much then 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.129
 are posco euros that I can make the difference and we went to what 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.400
 I usually have them here there is a 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.990
 pretty marked 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.650
 source of the academics enough voices 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.759
 the light of the sky in the light of the flashes 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.460
 is producing a great interest quite interesting the guitarist that 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.039
 we want here 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.550
 in a corner is not that the guitarist beats different shades of color 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.300
 hair all the hair is the same 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.370
 but you must have hundreds of colors in different colors and different shades in the shade 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.110
 What do you have in your hair? 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.889
 that's why it slowed down but surely still cut some of 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.889
 they would see what they are entel is highly the same hue 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.360
 and well this we are going to see also gives us the state we are already passed to the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.319
 adedy gatell 5 barea the tones 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.009
 and keep it realistic 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.370
 and well so far the introductory dubra of the shadows I hope that 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.050
 this you in photos on the internet or the photos that you have on April 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.999
 hundred wally bynes where they come from 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.550
 of light sources and why 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.550
 based on the shadows it has and on which it also depends 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.539
 but hey thank you very much for watching the video in the following by Alvaro is 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.089
 drawing something to beat them forward and well let's look at real sqp
