00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.840
[music]

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.660
&gt;&gt;If one place could have it all, it's Seattle.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:20.340
[music]

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.160
&gt;&gt;And right in the middle of the Emerald City,
50,000 students attend the University of Washington.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.900
&gt;&gt;Welcome to the University of Washington.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.880
[motorcycle revs]

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.180
&gt;&gt;I love this University! Anyway, I only
got about two minutes and 20 seconds to show

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.120
you around, so let's get started.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.420
[cheering and music]

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.500
First of all, the campus is gorgeous.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.991
Eventually you'll run into everyone you know
in the Liberal Arts Quad. Especially in the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.200
spring when our famous cherry trees are in
bloom.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.980
And all across campus, you'll see 150 years
of great architectural design.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.740
This is Suzzallo Library. It was built to
be the heart of the University and students

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.890
love the reading room. It's really ornate.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.940
&gt;&gt;Shhh!

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.440
&gt;&gt;...and kind of quiet. Anyway, lots to see.
Let's get going.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.000
[music and siren]

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.400
It's a beautiful day to save lives. And our
world-changing medical research helps make

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.750
that happen.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.380
Your doctor might be a Husky too. The UW School
of Medicine is #1 in the country for primary

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.780
care physicians. And when Huskies aren't curing
diseases, they're solving the World's other

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.700
problems.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.460
[music and waves]

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.620
&gt;&gt;See here how the angles diverge a lot at
the end.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.900
[music]

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.340
&gt;&gt;Give me a default gateway please Bryan.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.950
&gt;&gt;Researchers in the College of Education
are revitalizing the Head Start Program to

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.970
give all kids a shot at college some day.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.780
Where they might learn to become visionary
leaders here at UW's Foster School of Business.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.740
Or become creative media geniuses. And FYI...

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.720
[music]

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.180
great things happen on UW's Bothell and Tacoma
campuses as well.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.740
This is our mascot Dubs...as in Huskies. Anyway,
we're almost out of time so before we go,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.020
I wanna say... [motorcycle horn honking]

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.520
&gt;&gt;Go Huskies!

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.080
&gt;&gt;Go Huskies!

00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:00.040
[audience cheering and music]
