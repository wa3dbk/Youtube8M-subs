episode<00:00:48.560> and<00:00:48.829> yet<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:49.280> makes<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.579> certain<00:00:49.730> kind

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
episode and yet it makes a certain kind

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.000 
episode and yet it makes a certain kind
of<00:00:50.149> sense<00:00:50.450> every<00:00:51.110> season<00:00:51.350> has<00:00:51.560> made<00:00:51.800> it<00:00:51.920> a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
of sense every season has made it a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.130 
of sense every season has made it a
point<00:00:52.220> of<00:00:52.340> reference<00:00:52.520> Nightmare<00:00:53.210> Moon<00:00:53.480> she

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
point of reference Nightmare Moon she

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.540 
point of reference Nightmare Moon she
was<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.470> villain<00:00:54.770> that<00:00:54.800> started<00:00:55.250> it<00:00:55.370> all<00:00:55.489> and

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
was the villain that started it all and

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.889 
was the villain that started it all and
if<00:00:55.880> we're<00:00:56.030> going<00:00:56.149> to<00:00:56.210> introduce<00:00:56.570> an<00:00:56.720> even

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
if we're going to introduce an even

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.720

higher<00:00:57.079> level<00:00:57.110> of<00:00:57.620> villain<00:00:57.980> then<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:58.550> good

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
higher level of villain then it's good

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.670 
higher level of villain then it's good
to<00:00:58.820> go<00:00:58.940> back<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.239> square<00:00:59.420> one<00:00:59.690> I<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:00.500> rather
