00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.290
 today I bring you a super fast mini video 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.769
 of how you see in the title, as it has 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.889
 died my mouse to see still follow 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.000
 working continues to work but very 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.470
 bad now I will show it briefly and it is 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.830
 that what happened that was playing 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.359
 and I was recording and my mouse if not 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 you have seen my setup of the area 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 game has next to the click of the click 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.430
 left of the right two buttons 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.079
 to regulate the pp and the sensitivity and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.680
 then clear many times when you do 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.960
 click to be so together the buttons 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.780
 then climb down or sensitivity 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.820
 then what was hitting you and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 it gave the one to lower sensitivity the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.750
 I will have given more than once surely and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.240
 it's gone down too much and not the guy got 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.910
 moved and did not hit 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.100
 you can already imagine that pisses me off today 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.539
 it gives a good 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.539
 a good whack the mouse 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.550
 oh by the way, do not tell me that the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.920
 partner I will not monetize the video 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.270
 simply more funny and result 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.040
 I wanted him to know and the reason and look at 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.540
 see if you notice, I'm going to turn the mouse 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.910
 I'm not going to stop it at any time 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.070
 and you will see how you see it locks you see 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.270
 you see, I'm not stopping it and if 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.700
 it locks up from time to time it gets stuck I do not know 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.530
 If you can fix it or have me 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.460
 we look at how you work like this you can not 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.920
 play so I have care 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:39.119
 I'm going to see if I have my old mouse and with 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.119
 the money that in this video 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:55.300
 with the moment in the bounce map already 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.119
 you know very much one of my most favorite 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.180
 not to mention the one that most along with that of 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.760
 temper because with two or three blocks already 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.400
 we can reach the islands 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.619
 here to do quick killings 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.250
 let's go to see if one does not come to see 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.250
 how are we? 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.220
 perfect I've taken the apacheta because 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.220
 as there are as many as reactive 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.490
 it also goes quite well clear that I 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.850
 it can burst 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.910
 although I 'm going right now 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.740
 perfect 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.320
 Today I'm going to fashion for Italian fashion 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.930
 after saying so many nonsense we go 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.020
 to burst let's try it is already 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.020
 coming 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.310
 do not 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.800
 like the shit off the coast
