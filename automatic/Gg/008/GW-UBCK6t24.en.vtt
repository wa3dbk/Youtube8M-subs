00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.350 
start to come out you're gonna hold down
it'll<00:01:01.930> go<00:01:02.680> into<00:01:03.309> an<00:01:03.460> overhead<00:01:03.879> that<00:01:04.030> gives<00:01:04.239> you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
it'll go into an overhead that gives you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.950 
it'll go into an overhead that gives you
bounce

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
bounce

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.990 
bounce
alright<00:01:05.799> so<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.010> combo<00:01:06.340> look<00:01:06.490> like<00:01:06.640> this<00:01:06.820> so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
alright so the combo look like this so

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.390 
alright so the combo look like this so
far<00:01:09.750> now<00:01:10.750> make<00:01:11.049> sure<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.470> don't<00:01:11.680> press<00:01:11.950> down

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
far now make sure you don't press down

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.630 
far now make sure you don't press down
until<00:01:12.729> after<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:14.229> animation<00:01:14.799> starts<00:01:15.280> for<00:01:15.580> the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
until after the animation starts for the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.130 
until after the animation starts for the
stone<00:01:15.909> punch<00:01:16.210> because<00:01:16.450> if<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:16.840> press<00:01:17.110> down

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
stone punch because if you press down

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.350 
stone punch because if you press down
before<00:01:17.890> it<00:01:17.979> comes<00:01:18.190> out<00:01:18.369> it'll<00:01:18.729> cancel<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
before it comes out it'll cancel the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.230 
before it comes out it'll cancel the
move<00:01:19.540> out<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:21.159> won't<00:01:21.369> even<00:01:21.490> come<00:01:21.790> out<00:01:21.970> so

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
move out and it won't even come out so

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.630 
move out and it won't even come out so
now<00:01:23.049> from<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.470> bounce<00:01:23.710> you're<00:01:23.979> gonna<00:01:24.100> go<00:01:24.340> into

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
now from the bounce you're gonna go into

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.200 
now from the bounce you're gonna go into
a<00:01:24.670> neutral<00:01:25.150> jump<00:01:25.510> one<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.850> reason<00:01:28.090> why

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
a neutral jump one and the reason why

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.470 
a neutral jump one and the reason why
I'm<00:01:28.360> saying<00:01:28.600> one<00:01:28.930> instead<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.410> two<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:29.800> because

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
I'm saying one instead of two is because

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.600 
I'm saying one instead of two is because
one<00:01:31.480> has<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.110> little<00:01:32.380> less<00:01:32.620> frames<00:01:33.010> when<00:01:33.490> it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
one has a little less frames when it

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.310 
one has a little less frames when it
comes<00:01:33.820> out<00:01:34.030> so<00:01:34.060> it's<00:01:34.300> easier<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.840> catch<00:01:35.110> him

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
comes out so it's easier to catch him

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.460 
comes out so it's easier to catch him
now<00:01:36.250> from<00:01:36.670> there<00:01:36.910> you're<00:01:37.090> gonna<00:01:37.180> go<00:01:37.480> into<00:01:38.320> his

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
now from there you're gonna go into his

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.649 
now from there you're gonna go into his
rocky<00:01:38.830> start<00:01:39.370> a<00:01:39.700> string<00:01:40.270> with<00:01:40.540> back<00:01:40.990> one<00:01:41.380> two

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
rocky start a string with back one two

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.749 
rocky start a string with back one two
and<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.500> gonna<00:01:43.619> cancel<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.310> into

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and you're gonna cancel that into

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.660 
and you're gonna cancel that into
another<00:01:44.880> stone<00:01:45.509> punch<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:46.560> to
