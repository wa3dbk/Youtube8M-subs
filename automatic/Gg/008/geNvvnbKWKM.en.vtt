00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi i have fans how are you jose 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.700
 techno fanatic dotcom and today we go 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.400
 to talk about an application 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.440
 what is called is what allows you to record 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.519
 slow motion video so let's go with 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.050
 the video so you can see 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.050
 how can we use this tool 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 we go 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.690
 here we find the application 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.129
 is what you are going to be able to get 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.140
 the application for free as 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.120
 also the paid version that are going to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 have much more options let's do 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.280
 click on the application and you are going to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.110
 be able to import the videos from your channel 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.699
 robot or directly from itunes from 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.470
 here we are going to delay a little 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.510
 you are going to have this icon that you 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.050
 they will click there and they will be able to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.220
 look for your channel roll or just like 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.040
 you have been able to see can go 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.559
 directly to the camera and be able to film 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.000
 and then edit but in this case as 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.570
 us that we have some videos 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.290
 let's go to this button here choose 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.530
 the video of this rock camera and once 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.540
 that we choose the video will matter 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 where is it that the imported we close here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.369
 we choose the video that has been imported 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.689
 pink move it this way let's 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.340
 make an approach to make it more 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.340
 easy at the moment explain you 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.270
 you are going to have the option here of 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.850
 click on the edit part to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.560
 edit and you will be able to choose the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.899
 part that you want to move 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.130
 in slow motion for example here we go to 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.060
 choose what I want the part that I am 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.060
 just jumping there 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.180
 and then you are going to have the option 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.890
 to go which means it's to erase all 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 the back and start the video of 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.850
 in slow motion and speed and it means that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.790
 from there it will start slow motion and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.130
 the above is not going to be deleted and we 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.080
 let's put speed out at the moment of 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.509
 that we landed because if we put 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.700
 erase all the rest then speed out 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.259
 and it means that the video will continue 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.459
 as you can see forgiveness is 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.350
 then then what you can 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.239
 do for example as I told you guys 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.730
 they will be able to place it in slow motion 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.950
 150 percent 40 percent 25 percent 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.480
 hundred and can reach up to one thousand marks 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.030
 per second as they can also do it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.160
 faster up to one to four is more 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.200
 quick the video in this case we are going to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.959
 choose up to one thousand frames per second 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.890
 and what we are going to do here is to choose the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.959
 option 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.970
 optics the flow that comes to be the effect 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.500
 that one can perform you have 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.570
 seen that there are three effects then 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.459
 let's wait for this to end 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.100
 process so that you can see the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.080
 final result finished the process what 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.360
 The only thing we do is give 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.020
 to finish and you are going to have 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.000
 the video they just edited and with the 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.950
 effect that we have indicated you do and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.900
 here we go to teach you how 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.050
 is this video that we just 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.050
 perform 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.040
 as you have been able to see is very 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.079
 entertaining this application especially 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.090
 if you are people who do 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.489
 extreme sport they will be able to perform 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.799
 this kind of videos in slow motion 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.200
 using your mobile device I have 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.280
 tried to look for this application in the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.019
 narco android apps 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.090
 unfortunately I did not find it in my 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.700
 first option was to make this video 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.319
 in the nexus 4 but as he said no 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.410
 I found the application to be able to 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.750
 perform this done and in any case 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.509
 you have been able to appreciate that this 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.750
 Video can be shared using 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.770
 facebook youtube and itunes emails between 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.690
 other things so you 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.599
 they will practically be able to make this 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.039
 type of effects and share them in 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.460
 social networks or via email 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:39.039
 in a matter of minutes also 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.300
 I made a video in slow motion at 50 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.259
 percent and I wanted to show them to 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.419
 you so that you can see 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.949
 also how one can create this type 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.949
 of effects so let's go forget 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.420
 I wish you liked this video I do not know 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.950
