I I don't have a tape deck for it so I

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.530 
I I don't have a tape deck for it so I
haven't<00:04:14.400> been<00:04:14.459> able<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.700> use<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:14.880> tape<00:04:15.299> as<00:04:15.510> a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
haven't been able to use that tape as a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.140 
haven't been able to use that tape as a

hopefully that tape deck will work and

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.949 
hopefully that tape deck will work and

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:51.369 
excited about it and I didn't really

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.909 
excited about it and I didn't really
know<00:06:51.639> why<00:06:51.819> and<00:06:52.179> I<00:06:52.509> went<00:06:52.719> back<00:06:52.929> and<00:06:53.199> just<00:06:53.649> picked

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
know why and I went back and just picked

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.379 
know why and I went back and just picked
it<00:06:54.009> up<00:06:54.129> again<00:06:54.309> because<00:06:54.580> my<00:06:54.699> friends<00:06:55.209> have<00:06:55.300> been

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389
