nearly<00:00:01.290> every<00:00:01.860> sport<00:00:02.280> where<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.610> have<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.389> race

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
nearly every sport where you have a race

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.349 
nearly every sport where you have a race
against<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.350> clock<00:00:04.580> the<00:00:05.580> variables<00:00:06.089> for<00:00:06.270> the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
against the clock the variables for the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.540 
against the clock the variables for the
athletes<00:00:06.870> are<00:00:07.080> kept<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> minimum<00:00:07.529> so<00:00:08.309> when<00:00:08.519> I

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
athletes are kept to a minimum so when I

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.190 
athletes are kept to a minimum so when I
think<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:08.940> sports<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.540> race<00:00:09.780> against<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
think of sports that race against the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.620 
think of sports that race against the
clock<00:00:10.260> like<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.950> luge<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.519> winter<00:00:12.030> sport<00:00:12.389> or

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
clock like the luge in winter sport or

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.039 
clock like the luge in winter sport or
100<00:00:13.469> meter<00:00:13.650> sprint<00:00:14.599> or<00:00:15.599> anything<00:00:15.870> like<00:00:15.900> that

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
100 meter sprint or anything like that

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.680 
100 meter sprint or anything like that
the<00:00:16.890> track<00:00:17.190> very<00:00:17.580> rarely<00:00:17.880> changes<00:00:18.390> or<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the track very rarely changes or the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.349 
the track very rarely changes or the
weather<00:00:19.529> conditions<00:00:20.070> don't<00:00:20.640> vary<00:00:20.939> too<00:00:21.180> much

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
weather conditions don't vary too much

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.929 
weather conditions don't vary too much
so<00:00:22.260> here<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> sport<00:00:23.039> where<00:00:23.460> you're

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
so here you have a sport where you're

so here you have a sport where you're
racing<00:00:24.269> against<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> clock<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:24.960> then

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
racing against the clock but then

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.420 
racing against the clock but then
everything<00:00:25.350> else<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> working<00:00:25.859> against<00:00:26.340> you
