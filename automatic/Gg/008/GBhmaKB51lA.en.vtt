system<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.729> imagine<00:01:50.850> what<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.329> would

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
system can you imagine what that would

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.859 
system can you imagine what that would
feel<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.899> sitting<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.649> your<00:01:52.829> deck<00:01:53.540> we<00:01:54.540> never

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
feel like sitting on your deck we never

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.050 
feel like sitting on your deck we never
before<00:01:55.380> been<00:01:55.560> able<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.979> study<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.430> storm<00:01:56.820> system

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
before been able to study a storm system

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.690 
before been able to study a storm system
of<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.570> magnitude<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> infrared<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.490> we

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
of this magnitude in the infrared so we

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.999 
of this magnitude in the infrared so we
are<00:02:00.000> very<00:02:00.390> fortunate<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.320> time<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.799> have

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
are very fortunate at this time to have

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.980 
are very fortunate at this time to have
a<00:02:02.040> spacecraft<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.880> orbit<00:02:03.000> allowing<00:02:03.810> us<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
a spacecraft in orbit allowing us to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440 
a spacecraft in orbit allowing us to
make<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> historical<00:02:05.189> record<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.210> great
