 for those who do not know what it is is not 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.010
 nothing but to show the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.380
 updates that are on the wire i 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.730
 enhancements upgrades and miscellaneous things 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.810
 so the first thing I want you to do 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 see this square on the notion 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.700
 will start for us cholera concern a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.820
 moment bam muni al 9 girls we have 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.680
 a uniqueness at 9 finally after two months 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 about I managed to bring the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.559
 town hall from 8 to 9 and beat apart 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.270
 the walls and some incredible cassatina 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.770
 guys so that he might have connected 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.970
 in this video for the first time is enough 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.770
 that goes to see the previous videos 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.630
 entry to place will see my growth 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 really vertical the first time 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.320
 I would like to sing I think I had the moon e 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.869
 at 7 and it was really completely 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.580
 opposite to this now finally we are 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.130
 become a little stronger a little more pro 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.040
 let's say then the news is 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.140
 simply the first queen queen 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 boys archers cost 40k one thing 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.460
 incredible is very strong and I brought it 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.729
 already at 2 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.620
 i did the arch hicks then what is that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.200
 they were the news okay obviously tower 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.409
 of the new archer and I've already brought it to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.140
 5 I have to bring it to 10 and then 11 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.930
 for max do it with this money and then i'm 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.640
 making a first set camp 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 gives me five more units which is one thing 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.830
 strafiga and then a ok then I made the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.540
 laboratory I made the factory of 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.350
 spells at 4 so I can 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.210
 create four spells and no more three 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.760
 the new lab guys that i am 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.189
 doing look at the archers a little at 6 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.220
 raga 6 million elixirs in fact if 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.510
 look practically empty nests elixir 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.130
 in the beginning now, however, it will take ten 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.770
 days in fact will increase even slightly 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.990
 unfortunately they are still to be done 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 and I will have the first archers then I will make barbarians 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.229
 and then g from this is the sequence that vi 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.209
 advice as you saw they 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.130
 killed by joining goblin lots 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.290
 because I never use them and the healer 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.090
 because I never use them but rest assured that 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.470
 I'll do those then the others too 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.760
 these are four improvements 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.510
 slaves as I said 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.959
 very often 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.549
 on the clan the four masons who are there 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.430
 also the other here the fake but not 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.260
 I move the camp and we have the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.700
 sorcerer's tower at 2 that among three 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.590
 hours and a half is over I will start it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.260
 immediately two more or maybe I'll do 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.329
 something else then in two days me 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.640
 will end the second arc hicks between gag and 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.349
 cost 3 million together with the documents between 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.810
 however , by spending a casino in March, it is 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.190
 right so I'm bringing in two days 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.680
 and 15 hours pulls the last defense and real 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.420
 3 which leads where to take it 7 that too 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.700
 for max arles or doing the last head 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.840
 so all the news has been done 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.159
 ah no I forgot this the second 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.409
 black auger this is one thing 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.909
 really really fidal 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.739
 said this guys with this base not 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.859
 I feel bad even though sometimes I was 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.690
 in an exaggerated way we see here of 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.569
 tension as you see lately no 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.459
 you see it often attack only a few 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.560
 because since I moved to 9 e 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.859
 they attack less specimens sometimes they do me 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.419
 attacks with reggina re max in twitter 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.400
 7 and various things so it's a tough thing I have 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.829
 fucked up girls because I didn't 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.750
 I remembered that every six days it seems to me 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.530
 reset the war 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.000
 I'll show you I'll show you 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.829
 burroghs and we are going to see not me 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.510
 show the details see said the non 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.310
 have ball to details that are not 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.889
 available to see the last war 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.510
 that we have won two or three stars 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.340
 I had made six total stars I would have 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.340
 wanted to show some attacks because 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.980
 there are many of mine 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.300
 members of the clan who want to 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:03.360
 greet you indeed among other things greet 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.819
 the turbo and in any case raga I was saying 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.530
 that there is little active people let's say 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.330
 at this time, however, the clan is a lot 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.980
 active and could not show i 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.840
 details there is one guys especially yes 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.030
 calls alpina mit which is practically a 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.160
 sorry myths for two months 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.560
 that in the clan even more is a great one 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.449
 very trustworthy and very strong 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.729
 never let me see his attack because 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.290
 i never ever have anything time in ours 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.000
 tool dark guys I showed you that 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.340
 we have raised many things 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.260
 obviously now I would like to show 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.610
 some attack something strative 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.620
 but not in this video 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.060
 if you want to see some cool attack 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.560
 title below in the comments put the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.630
 thumbs up now I want you 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.040
 leave with three questions rather than that 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.300
 now I want to leave you guys with 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.760
 three of my ideas that could be useful 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.289
 to improve the game to improve 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.479
 clash of leeds 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.190
 then tell me in the comments if you share 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.430
 my ideas and then maybe I know about you 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.320
 ago you make me under in the comments me 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.150
 write things for you instead would be from 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.660
 do to improve because it offers ago 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.490
 just 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.380
 in the meantime don't worry about writing 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.599
 charlie ford ghost let trend not 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.550
 in any case, let us in any case be ok 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.039
 first thing that I will improve in absolute 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.810
 it's this I do n't understand why when 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.710
 we are going to raid an attack a 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.560
 another to another base I don't understand 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.479
 because the troops don't come back 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.070
 those that didn't die just me 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.620
 I would do this improvement 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.599
 the possibility of receiving returns 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.010
 let all the troops return that also 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.570
 if placed in the battlefield they are not 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.849
 dead in my opinion would be one thing 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.200
 the second thing is really tigano 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.479
 that I would add that I don't know the 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.740
 difficulty for the supercell to do 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.990
 this I would add the 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.330
 possibility of attacking a friendly base 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.340
 obviously without causing any damage but 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.010
 being able to choose which village without 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.990
 any kind of snobs or hacks or various things 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.849
 obviously normally after in the rule 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.630
 of the game to be able to attack a base 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.700
 chosen by us from a friend to a friend 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.290
 and even see if any friends there 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.390
 attack that moment right now 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.950
 do this update note 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.450
 it would be one thing you will have pussy challenged in between 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.340
 friends, various things 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.230
 and then another thing to add that I 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.150
 I would do but it's not very simple I don't know if 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.850
 everyone agrees to be able to choose 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.440
 where to send troops because a lot 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.600
 we often see that we put barbarians 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.790
 i do all the backs to do it all the 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.410
 outline and do not stick to the center 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.900
 actually there is the world I know is enough 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.970
 maybe put a jump spell like the 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.990
 jump potion or if not break the walls e 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.610
 they will go inside 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.070
 automatically but maybe be able to 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.690
 select woman a scam can go 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.300
 because in strategy motorcycle games 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.490
 in my opinion the fairer it is that one can succeed in 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.080
 check the army more 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.730
 let me know in the comments what it is 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.960
 think of my three proposals to be able to 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.940
 improve clash 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.190
 I leave you in the comments to tell me 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.810
 if what do you think especially you who 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.540
 what better remains in this game than 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.550
 I think it remains a great product 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.920
 remembering that it is a free to play said 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.570
 this guy I don't tread on villas anymore 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.130
 of invitation go to the description that there is 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.110
 the link of my facebook page e 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.390
 sign up for many that the place often 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.950
 news news updates various things 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.110
 which I can't do up so fast 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.060
 youtube di vito leave a nice I like 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.120
 a comment precisely on what it is 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.010
 was mentioned in the video from clash of 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.240
 france and random is everything 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.240
 enjoy guys
