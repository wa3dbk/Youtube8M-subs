00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
sketch it doesn't have to be very

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.170 
sketch it doesn't have to be very
detailed<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:17.369> if<00:00:17.490> I'm<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.940> draw<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
flags to kind of fly around it I might

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.250 
flags to kind of fly around it I might
draw<00:00:25.800> something<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.519> looks<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:28.519> and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
little notes like this would be flags

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.119
