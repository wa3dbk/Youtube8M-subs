new genetic information and for
evolution<00:00:08.890> yes<00:00:09.580> we<00:00:09.880> need<00:00:10.140> new<00:00:11.140> genetic

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
evolution yes we need new genetic

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.650 
evolution yes we need new genetic

the<00:00:16.150> big<00:00:16.299> question

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
the big question

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.820 
the big question
Darwin's<00:00:18.480> assumed<00:00:19.480> that<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.170> increase<00:00:20.650> in

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
Darwin's assumed that the increase in

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.050 
Darwin's assumed that the increase in
information<00:00:21.630> comes<00:00:22.630> from<00:00:23.520> natural<00:00:24.520> selection

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
information comes from natural selection

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.099 
information comes from natural selection
but<00:00:25.990> natural<00:00:26.500> selection<00:00:27.480> reduces<00:00:28.480> genetic

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
but natural selection reduces genetic

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.900 
but natural selection reduces genetic
information<00:00:29.380> and<00:00:29.859> we<00:00:30.070> know<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:30.490> from<00:00:30.670> all

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
information and we know this from all

the<00:00:31.090> genetic<00:00:31.420> population<00:00:31.990> studies<00:00:32.379> that<00:00:32.529> we

the genetic population studies that we

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.799 
the genetic population studies that we
have<00:00:32.909> generally<00:00:33.909> we<00:00:34.359> are<00:00:34.449> afraid<00:00:34.690> of

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
have generally we are afraid of

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.009 
have generally we are afraid of
mutations<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:37.030> don't<00:00:37.239> want<00:00:37.449> to<00:00:37.569> have<00:00:37.719> too<00:00:37.899> many

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
mutations we don't want to have too many

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.989 
mutations we don't want to have too many
x-rays<00:00:38.499> we<00:00:38.859> don't<00:00:39.039> want<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.309> have<00:00:39.429> Chernobyl

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:39.999 
x-rays we don't want to have Chernobyl

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.520 
x-rays we don't want to have Chernobyl
we<00:00:40.239> don't<00:00:40.420> want<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.719> have<00:00:40.870> mutagenic

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
we don't want to have mutagenic

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.489 
we don't want to have mutagenic
substances<00:00:42.399> like<00:00:42.989> asbestos<00:00:43.989> around<00:00:44.319> us

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
substances like asbestos around us

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.369 
substances like asbestos around us
wherever<00:00:45.159> so<00:00:45.879> we<00:00:46.120> are<00:00:46.210> avoiding<00:00:46.539> mutations

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
wherever so we are avoiding mutations

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.399 
wherever so we are avoiding mutations
because<00:00:48.190> we<00:00:48.519> know<00:00:48.699> that<00:00:48.729> mutations<00:00:49.600> spoiled

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
because we know that mutations spoiled

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.389 
because we know that mutations spoiled
we<00:00:51.190> do<00:00:51.370> not<00:00:51.519> know<00:00:51.879> of<00:00:52.149> as<00:00:52.510> any<00:00:53.190> mutation<00:00:54.190> which

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
we do not know of as any mutation which

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.849 
we do not know of as any mutation which
is<00:00:54.549> positive<00:00:55.179> so<00:00:55.809> you're<00:00:56.019> saying<00:00:56.319> that<00:00:56.409> the

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
is positive so you're saying that the

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.189 
is positive so you're saying that the
idea<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.339> there<00:00:57.549> could<00:00:57.670> be<00:00:57.699> random

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
idea that there could be random

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.020 
idea that there could be random
mutations<00:00:59.199> caused<00:00:59.589> by<00:00:59.889> ultraviolet<00:01:00.639> lights

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
mutations caused by ultraviolet lights

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.449 
mutations caused by ultraviolet lights
or<00:01:01.389> radiation<00:01:02.170> or<00:01:02.319> some<00:01:02.559> extreme<00:01:03.280> of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
never been observed is there we have

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.130 
never been observed is there we have

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.460 
never observed a change a genetic change
by<00:01:14.710> mutation<00:01:15.280> which<00:01:15.970> produced<00:01:16.480> something<00:01:16.900> new

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
by mutation which produced something new

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.960 
by mutation which produced something new
and<00:01:17.770> positive<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:19.240> even<00:01:19.870> if<00:01:19.990> that's<00:01:20.110> true<00:01:20.320> then

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and positive so even if that's true then

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.660 
and positive so even if that's true then
Darwinism<00:01:22.020> collapses<00:01:23.020> exactly<00:01:23.560> when<00:01:24.340> we<00:01:24.460> look

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.480 
system that can handle random changes so
if<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.140> do<00:02:09.289> that<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.830> cell<00:02:10.039> has<00:02:10.250> that

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
if you do that and the cell has that

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.730 
if you do that and the cell has that
kind<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:10.789> stuff<00:02:11.090> then<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.900> whole<00:02:12.050> idea<00:02:12.440> that

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
kind of stuff then the whole idea that

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.400 
kind of stuff then the whole idea that
the<00:02:13.490> driving<00:02:13.940> force<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.720> evolution<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.380> a

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the driving force of evolution is a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.800 
the driving force of evolution is a
random<00:02:15.860> change<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.790> loses<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> lot<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.570> its

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
random change that loses a lot of its

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.410 
random change that loses a lot of its
plausibility
