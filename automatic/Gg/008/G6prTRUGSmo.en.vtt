00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.070
 hello friends in today's video I love you 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.410
 teach how to make these easy and 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.660
 original necklaces the truth that they are 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.650
 super simple to do we need very 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.650
 little materials 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.910
 we will simply need 2 meters of 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.500
 trapillo and some metal beads 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.500
 let's see how to make them 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.790
 The first thing we are going to do is place 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.579
 the trapillo on our hand of the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.250
 next shape we hold it with our finger 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.879
 thumb and we passed the hood from behind 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.730
 of the ring finger in front of the finger 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.460
 little finger and again behind the finger 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.339
 little finger in front of the ring finger and we give 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.079
 new turn down a little bit and 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.809
 now we can make the first child 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.119
 which is done by passing the saucer that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.690
 is in the bottom part 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.600
 from above and we squeeze all of us back to 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.240
 pass the cloth through both fingers and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.790
 again and again we made a knot in 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.920
 fishing ground 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.410
 we tighten well and we do the same thing again 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.770
 same we passed the trapillo by the two 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.420
 fingers 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.420
 and we do the same 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.750
 and we are squeezing everything well 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.130
 and now and just keep doing 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.130
 the same thing all the time 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.950
 that is to say thus being a kind of 30 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.250
 you see that it is super fast and the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 result is spectacular because I'm going to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.940
 keep doing it until you get the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.940
 holding the length that interests me 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.110
 ah 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.099
 and once you 've braided the piece that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.650
 I just wanted to take out the trapillo 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.750
 of the fingers and the two holes that 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.150
 we are left to the end of the thread 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.990
 and so we squeeze well and we would stay 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.990
 closed 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.350
 look how beautiful it looks and now I what 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.750
 I'm going to do is put my tubes 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.750
 metal ornament on each side 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.340
 yes 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 there we would have the first placed and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.560
 now the other 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.110
 and look at how simple and 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.900
 original we have fired and necklace 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.319
 precious and we can also 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.120
 use as a bracelet and we can do it 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.269

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.190
