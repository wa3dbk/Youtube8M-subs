00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.830 
electromagnet right so when you push the
brake<00:04:21.769> pedal<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:22.640> its<00:04:22.760> power<00:04:22.970> through<00:04:23.750> the

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
brake pedal so its power through the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.080 
brake pedal so its power through the
wire<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.620> then<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:25.010> son<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.400> a<00:04:25.580> bitch<00:04:25.730> is<00:04:25.760> it

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
wire and then that son of a bitch is it

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.920 
wire and then that son of a bitch is it
on<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.390> the<00:04:26.480> inside<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:26.900> this<00:04:27.340> right<00:04:28.340> so<00:04:28.610> then

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
on to the inside of this right so then

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.800 
on to the inside of this right so then
does<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:29.990> turning<00:04:30.620> action<00:04:31.010> of<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.810> friggin

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
does the turning action of that friggin

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.710 
does the turning action of that friggin
wedge<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.680> this<00:04:33.890> little<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:35.180> know<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.420> arm

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
wedge is this little you know the arm

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.020 
wedge is this little you know the arm
will<00:04:35.960> son<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.410> bitch<00:04:36.620> into<00:04:36.920> there<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.370> it'll
