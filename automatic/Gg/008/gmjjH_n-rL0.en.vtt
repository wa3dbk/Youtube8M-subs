hey<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.199> FJ<00:00:01.740> I<00:00:02.070> just<00:00:02.429> wanted<00:00:02.669> to

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hey guys this is FJ I just wanted to

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.640 
hey guys this is FJ I just wanted to
make<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> really<00:00:03.360> quick<00:00:03.540> comparison<00:00:04.170> video<00:00:04.440> for

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
make a really quick comparison video for

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.120 
make a really quick comparison video for
you<00:00:04.710> guys

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
you guys

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.360 
you guys
comparing<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.120> electric<00:00:06.629> eg<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.950> only

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
comparing the electric eg to the only

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.810 
comparing the electric eg to the only
canopy<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.540> Oakley<00:00:09.990> robot<00:00:10.460> I'm<00:00:11.460> going<00:00:11.759> to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
canopy and the Oakley robot I'm going to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.730 
canopy and the Oakley robot I'm going to
compare<00:00:12.090> them<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.360> different<00:00:13.049> categories

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
compare them with different categories

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.589 
compare them with different categories
first<00:00:14.130> category<00:00:14.700> would<00:00:14.849> be<00:00:14.910> field<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.420> view

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
first category would be field of view

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.320 
first category would be field of view
the<00:00:16.289> largest<00:00:16.470> would<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> electric<00:00:17.760> eg<00:00:18.090> -

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the largest would be the electric eg -

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.109 
the largest would be the electric eg -
the<00:00:19.109> canopy<00:00:19.560> comes<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.250> close<00:00:20.460> second<00:00:20.939> but

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the canopy comes in a close second but

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.310 
the canopy comes in a close second but
you'll<00:00:21.330> notice<00:00:21.630> when<00:00:21.930> you're<00:00:22.080> looking

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
you'll notice when you're looking

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
you'll notice when you're looking
through<00:00:22.529> them<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> frame<00:00:23.430> inside<00:00:23.789> is

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
through them the frame inside is

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.420 
through them the frame inside is
actually<00:00:24.359> thicker<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.740> isn't<00:00:26.130> quite<00:00:26.160> as

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
actually thicker so it isn't quite as

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.370 
actually thicker so it isn't quite as
the<00:00:26.490> largest<00:00:26.820> deal<00:00:27.029> under<00:00:27.210> 82<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the largest deal under 82 and the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.529 
the largest deal under 82 and the
crowbar<00:00:29.070> would<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> smallest<00:00:29.849> from<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
crowbar would be the smallest from the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
crowbar would be the smallest from the
outside<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> lens<00:00:31.439> doesn't<00:00:31.890> look<00:00:32.070> like

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
outside of the lens doesn't look like

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
outside of the lens doesn't look like
it's<00:00:32.340> pretty<00:00:32.460> big<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.059> again<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> frame

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it's pretty big but again the frame

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.540 
it's pretty big but again the frame
inside<00:00:34.320> you'll<00:00:34.530> notice<00:00:34.860> there's<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> lot<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
inside you'll notice there's a lot of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.920 
inside you'll notice there's a lot of
freight<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.880> resting<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.300> underneath<00:00:36.660> is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
freight and resting and underneath is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
freight and resting and underneath is
actually<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:37.680> second<00:00:38.610> category<00:00:39.000> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
actually my second category of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420 
actually my second category of
comparison<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.170> go<00:00:40.290> over<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:41.129> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
comparison that I can go over it is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.360 
comparison that I can go over it is
comfort<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> durability<00:00:42.980> it's<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> bit<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
comfort and durability it's a bit of a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.069 
comfort and durability it's a bit of a
trade-off<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.969> regard<00:00:45.270> simply<00:00:45.809> because

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
trade-off in that regard simply because

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.560 
trade-off in that regard simply because
of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.410> electric<00:00:46.980> eg<00:00:47.280> -<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.300> flimsy

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
of the electric eg - is more flimsy

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
of the electric eg - is more flimsy
where<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.410> might<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.100> as

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
where you might think that's not as

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
where you might think that's not as
durable<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:51.300> actually<00:00:51.750> quite<00:00:51.989> comfortable

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
durable it's actually quite comfortable

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.840 
durable it's actually quite comfortable
to<00:00:52.500> wear<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.370> warm<00:00:53.550> saved

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

flex a little bit when you put them on

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.740 
flex a little bit when you put them on
they<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.260> feel<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.680> little<00:01:01.890> bit<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.250> sturdy

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
they just feel a little bit more sturdy

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.759 
they just feel a little bit more sturdy
especially<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> profile<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> smaller

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
rigid on your face so that goes to say

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.210 
rigid on your face so that goes to say
in<00:01:12.689> terms<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> durability<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> frame<00:01:13.979> but

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
in terms of durability of the frame but

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
in terms of durability of the frame but
in<00:01:14.939> terms<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> comfort<00:01:15.689> they're<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.290> very

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
in terms of comfort they're all very

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.370 
in terms of comfort they're all very
comfortable<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.130> wear<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:18.000> find<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> all

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
comfortable to wear I do find that all

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.920 
comfortable to wear I do find that all
these<00:01:19.710> cushioning<00:01:20.280> system<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.930> higher

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
quality than electrics and electrics is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.960 
quality than electrics and electrics is

a two layer foam system awareness

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.910 
a two layer foam system awareness
hopefully<00:01:27.420> has<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:28.140> three<00:01:28.409> layer<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.740> foam

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920

I do feel that the oakley's provide a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
bit more of a sealed fit this feels more

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.560 
bit more of a sealed fit this feels more
substantial<00:01:37.409> once<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.130> your<00:01:38.250> face<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:39.240> having

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
said that on warmer temperatures I find

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
said that on warmer temperatures I find
old<00:01:42.090> leans<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:43.049> more<00:01:43.200> hot

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
old leans to be a little bit more hot
than<00:01:43.560> your<00:01:43.740> basement<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.280> said<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.610> guess

sweat<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:45.390> bit<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:45.930> wearing<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
sweat a little bit more when wearing the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.069 
sweat a little bit more when wearing the
police<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.700> hotter<00:01:47.970> day<00:01:48.240> particularly

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
police so I'm hotter day particularly

police so I'm hotter day particularly
this<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.829> lot<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.040> humidity<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.579> tend<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> wear

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
this a lot of humidity I tend to wear

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.060 
this a lot of humidity I tend to wear
the<00:01:51.689> electric<00:01:52.049> eg<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.530> simply<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.579> kind<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
the electric eg to simply be kind of

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.470 
the electric eg to simply be kind of
just<00:01:54.190> doesn't<00:01:54.490> feel<00:01:54.580> as<00:01:54.730> heavy<00:01:54.880> on<00:01:55.090> my<00:01:55.240> face

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
just doesn't feel as heavy on my face

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.560 
just doesn't feel as heavy on my face
but<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.680> colder<00:01:57.190> day<00:01:57.220> I<00:01:57.700> would<00:01:58.060> switch<00:01:58.300> over<00:01:58.420> to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
but a colder day I would switch over to

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.910 
but a colder day I would switch over to
the<00:01:58.720> open<00:01:58.960> these<00:01:59.050> because<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.440> feel<00:01:59.620> a<00:01:59.650> lot<00:01:59.860> more

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the open these because I feel a lot more

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.670 
the open these because I feel a lot more
insulated<00:02:00.550> there<00:02:01.140> now<00:02:02.140> in<00:02:02.350> terms<00:02:02.560> of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
insulated there now in terms of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
ventilation and anti-fog I have to say

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.760 
ventilation and anti-fog I have to say
that<00:02:06.370> oh<00:02:06.550> please<00:02:06.729> is<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.210> lot<00:02:07.450> better<00:02:07.690> looks<00:02:08.500> and

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
that oh please is a lot better looks and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.770 
that oh please is a lot better looks and
feels<00:02:09.070> to<00:02:09.160> be<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.429> higher<00:02:09.610> quality<00:02:09.780> they

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
feels to be of higher quality they

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.380 
feels to be of higher quality they
perform<00:02:11.290> as<00:02:11.440> well<00:02:11.530> but<00:02:12.370> at<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.580> same<00:02:12.760> time<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
perform as well but at the same time the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.000 
perform as well but at the same time the
perforations<00:02:13.870> look<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.500> be<00:02:14.590> more<00:02:14.770> substantial

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
perforations look to be more substantial

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.360 
perforations look to be more substantial
than<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.670> electric<00:02:16.180> eg<00:02:16.480> tubes<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.530> where<00:02:17.920> you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
than the electric eg tubes so where you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.830 
than the electric eg tubes so where you
will<00:02:18.580> see<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.180> there's<00:02:19.330> quite<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.600> bit<00:02:19.810> of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
will see that there's quite a bit of

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.170 
will see that there's quite a bit of
ventilation<00:02:20.320> options<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.550> electric<00:02:21.940> ET

hopefully<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.470> sort<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:23.860> takes<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.220> cake

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
hopefully it just sort of takes the cake

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.690 
hopefully it just sort of takes the cake
on<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:25.020> anti-fog<00:02:26.020> as<00:02:26.230> well<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:27.280> coating<00:02:27.610> is

on that anti-fog as well the coating is

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.550 
on that anti-fog as well the coating is
inside<00:02:28.030> from<00:02:28.330> what<00:02:28.480> I've<00:02:28.600> noticed<00:02:28.810> hopefully

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
inside from what I've noticed hopefully

does<00:02:29.739> handle<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.160> moisture<00:02:30.489> better<00:02:30.700> now<00:02:30.970> in

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
does handle the moisture better now in

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.240 
does handle the moisture better now in
terms<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.480> optics<00:02:31.959> again<00:02:32.500> I'd<00:02:32.770> have<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.100> give

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
terms of optics again I'd have to give

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.830 
terms of optics again I'd have to give
it<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.489> Oakley<00:02:33.850> when<00:02:34.450> you're<00:02:34.570> looking<00:02:34.780> through

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
it to Oakley when you're looking through

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.120 
it to Oakley when you're looking through
these<00:02:35.110> while<00:02:35.260> you're<00:02:35.410> out<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.709> hill<00:02:35.920> so

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
these while you're out of the hill so

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.040 
these while you're out of the hill so
just<00:02:36.670> notice<00:02:36.910> there's<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.690> little<00:02:37.930> bit

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
just notice there's just a little bit

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.479 
just notice there's just a little bit
better<00:02:38.200> clarity<00:02:38.860> when<00:02:39.130> you're<00:02:39.250> looking

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
better clarity when you're looking

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.070 
better clarity when you're looking
through<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.760> overview<00:02:40.000> bottles<00:02:40.510> everything

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
through the overview bottles everything

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.260 
through the overview bottles everything
just<00:02:41.320> looks<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.340> should<00:02:42.370> was<00:02:43.000> very

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
just looks like it should was very

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.600 
just looks like it should was very
little<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.930> no<00:02:43.959> deformations<00:02:44.950> at<00:02:45.100> all<00:02:45.250> or<00:02:45.459> any

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
little to no deformations at all or any

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.680 
little to no deformations at all or any
kind<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:45.970> one<00:02:46.269> thing

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
kind of one thing

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.449 
kind of one thing
there<00:02:46.930> are<00:02:47.050> all<00:02:47.140> spiracle<00:02:47.739> lenses<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:48.250> they<00:02:48.280> do

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
there are all spiracle lenses so they do

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.820 
there are all spiracle lenses so they do
a<00:02:48.550> very<00:02:48.790> good<00:02:48.880> job<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.510> terms<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.930> not<00:02:50.140> work<00:02:50.650> in

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
a very good job in terms of not work in

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.640 
a very good job in terms of not work in
your<00:02:50.980> field<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.400> vision<00:02:51.519> but<00:02:52.300> optics<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.440> know

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
your field of vision but optics you know

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.890 
your field of vision but optics you know
always<00:02:53.980> known<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.400> their<00:02:54.489> optics<00:02:54.900> electric

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
always known for their optics electric

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.750 
always known for their optics electric
it<00:02:56.050> just<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.350> feels<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.650> bit<00:02:56.890> more<00:02:56.950> plastic<00:02:57.580> meat

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
it just it feels a bit more plastic meat

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.699 
it just it feels a bit more plastic meat
that<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.299> just<00:02:58.510> not<00:02:58.660> as<00:02:58.780> much<00:02:58.930> technology<00:02:59.230> here

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
that is just not as much technology here

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.650 
that is just not as much technology here
behind<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.160> hopefully<00:03:00.610> as<00:03:00.850> lenses<00:03:01.180> feel<00:03:01.420> very

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
behind it hopefully as lenses feel very

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.479 
behind it hopefully as lenses feel very
substantial<00:03:02.290> they<00:03:02.769> actually<00:03:03.070> feel<00:03:03.250> bigger

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
substantial they actually feel bigger

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.229 
substantial they actually feel bigger
too<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.269> they<00:03:04.600> feel<00:03:04.750> more<00:03:04.930> durable<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.380> one

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
too and they feel more durable this one

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.910 
too and they feel more durable this one
lastly<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.269> want<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.510> talk<00:03:07.690> about<00:03:07.870> fit<00:03:08.290> now

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
lastly I want to talk about fit now

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.250 
lastly I want to talk about fit now
amination<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.760> have<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> smaller<00:03:10.540> nose<00:03:10.840> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
amination so I have a smaller nose and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.229 
amination so I have a smaller nose and
I've<00:03:12.100> mentioned<00:03:12.489> this<00:03:12.549> in<00:03:12.610> my<00:03:12.730> other<00:03:12.940> video

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
I've mentioned this in my other video

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.660 
I've mentioned this in my other video
and<00:03:13.299> talking<00:03:13.840> about<00:03:13.900> goggles<00:03:14.410> but<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.920> needed

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
and talking about goggles but I needed

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.840 
and talking about goggles but I needed
to<00:03:16.000> purchase<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:17.410> Asian<00:03:17.980> fit<00:03:18.220> models<00:03:18.640> here

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
to purchase the Asian fit models here

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.550 
to purchase the Asian fit models here
for<00:03:19.060> hopefully<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:19.930> order<00:03:20.140> for<00:03:20.290> them<00:03:20.410> to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.069 
for hopefully in order for them to
really<00:03:20.860> insulate<00:03:21.280> my<00:03:21.610> nose<00:03:21.820> if<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.810> were<00:03:22.930> the

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
really insulate my nose if I were the

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.110 
really insulate my nose if I were the
electric<00:03:23.410> 82's<00:03:23.920> on<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.220> cold<00:03:24.459> day<00:03:24.670> on<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.940> very

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
electric 82's on a cold day on a very

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.900 
electric 82's on a cold day on a very
windy<00:03:25.269> day<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.260> wear<00:03:26.440> them<00:03:26.590> how<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.040> probably

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
windy day and I wear them how I probably

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.580 
windy day and I wear them how I probably
should<00:03:28.420> be<00:03:28.450> wearing<00:03:28.750> them<00:03:29.019> but<00:03:29.440> there's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
should be wearing them but there's

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.949 
should be wearing them but there's
definitely<00:03:29.680> space<00:03:30.220> above<00:03:30.670> my<00:03:30.730> nose<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.810> will

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
definitely space above my nose that will

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.199 
definitely space above my nose that will
let<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.350> lot<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.560> cold<00:03:32.769> air<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.760> what<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:33.970> tend

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
let in a lot of cold air so what I tend

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.759 
let in a lot of cold air so what I tend
to<00:03:34.299> do<00:03:34.450> with<00:03:34.600> Elektra<00:03:35.079> is<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.440> wear<00:03:35.620> them

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
to do with Elektra is like wear them

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.000 
to do with Elektra is like wear them
lower<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.180> ER<00:03:37.360> xual<00:03:37.900> padding<00:03:38.860> that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
lower so that the ER xual padding that

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.620 
lower so that the ER xual padding that
would<00:03:39.190> rest<00:03:39.430> enough<00:03:39.670> up<00:03:39.790> here<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.209> Virginia

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
would rest enough up here and Virginia

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.970 
would rest enough up here and Virginia
knows<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:41.140> would<00:03:41.230> actually<00:03:41.410> dress<00:03:41.739> all<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
knows it would actually dress all the

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.220 
knows it would actually dress all the
different<00:03:42.400> windows<00:03:42.519> now<00:03:43.420> because<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
different windows now because the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.350 
different windows now because the
Elector<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.739> still<00:03:45.010> quite<00:03:45.640> large<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:46.090> terms<00:03:46.299> of

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
Elector is still quite large in terms of

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.610 
Elector is still quite large in terms of
field<00:03:46.570> of<00:03:46.660> view<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.019> doesn't<00:03:47.049> really<00:03:47.440> affect

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
field of view it doesn't really affect

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.640 
field of view it doesn't really affect
my<00:03:48.100> comfort<00:03:48.760> or<00:03:49.269> my<00:03:50.019> overall<00:03:50.500> impression

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
my comfort or my overall impression

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.270 
my comfort or my overall impression
the<00:03:52.209> convoy<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.690> still<00:03:54.080> left<00:03:54.620> them<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.830> lot<00:03:55.010> and

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
the convoy I still left them a lot and

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.520 
the convoy I still left them a lot and
that's<00:03:55.940> why<00:03:56.150> I<00:03:56.209> actually<00:03:56.420> have<00:03:56.840> two<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.050> them<00:03:57.260> I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
that's why I actually have two of them I

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.380 
that's why I actually have two of them I
have<00:03:58.010> one<00:03:58.160> for<00:03:58.459> day<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:58.819> I<00:03:58.879> have<00:03:59.030> one<00:03:59.180> tonight

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
have one for day and I have one tonight

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.759 
have one for day and I have one tonight
as<00:03:59.629> well<00:04:00.069> but<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:02.209> agent<00:04:02.599> fit<00:04:02.870> really<00:04:03.620> does

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
as well but the agent fit really does

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:04.990 
as well but the agent fit really does
make<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:03.980> difference<00:04:04.099> when<00:04:04.610> you're<00:04:04.700> wearing

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
make a difference when you're wearing

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.850 
make a difference when you're wearing
them<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.540> have<00:04:05.629> a<00:04:05.660> small<00:04:05.959> nose<00:04:06.170> you<00:04:06.800> can

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
them and you have a small nose you can

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.710 
them and you have a small nose you can
wear<00:04:07.099> them<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.400> way<00:04:07.519> should<00:04:07.879> on<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.360> goggle

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
wear them the way should on the goggle

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.180 
wear them the way should on the goggle
where<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.930> bridge<00:04:09.140> is<00:04:09.170> supposed<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.739> be<00:04:09.890> you

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
where the bridge is supposed to be you

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.800 
where the bridge is supposed to be you
can<00:04:10.310> wear<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:10.580> properly<00:04:10.940> on<00:04:11.180> your<00:04:11.330> face<00:04:11.510> and

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
can wear that properly on your face and

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.440 
can wear that properly on your face and
the<00:04:12.560> agent<00:04:12.980> fit<00:04:13.220> really<00:04:13.790> just<00:04:13.970> provides<00:04:14.299> a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
the agent fit really just provides a

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.910 
the agent fit really just provides a
little<00:04:14.480> bit<00:04:14.750> thicker<00:04:14.989> foam<00:04:15.319> padding<00:04:15.769> around

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
little bit thicker foam padding around

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.939 
little bit thicker foam padding around
the<00:04:16.220> nose<00:04:16.820> so<00:04:17.720> that<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:18.229> really<00:04:18.380> just<00:04:18.590> feels<00:04:18.739> in

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
the nose so that it really just feels in

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.590 
the nose so that it really just feels in
those<00:04:19.100> spaces<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.820> electric<00:04:20.299> gently

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
those spaces that the electric gently

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.900 
those spaces that the electric gently
tap<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:21.500> if<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.739> buys<00:04:21.889> for<00:04:22.160> me<00:04:22.220> hopefully<00:04:22.550> does

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
tap so if it buys for me hopefully does

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.500 
tap so if it buys for me hopefully does
win<00:04:23.120> there

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
win there

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.260 
win there
so<00:04:24.470> overall<00:04:25.190> which<00:04:25.490> one's<00:04:25.700> my<00:04:25.850> favorite

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
so overall which one's my favorite

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.230 
so overall which one's my favorite
actually<00:04:27.110> I'm<00:04:27.229> not<00:04:27.380> quite<00:04:27.440> sure<00:04:27.970> that's<00:04:28.970> why<00:04:29.180> I

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
actually I'm not quite sure that's why I

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.670 
actually I'm not quite sure that's why I
have<00:04:29.389> them<00:04:29.570> all<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.750> haven't<00:04:30.050> converted<00:04:30.410> them

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
have them all I haven't converted them

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.680 
have them all I haven't converted them
these<00:04:31.280> are<00:04:31.370> probably<00:04:31.910> gonna<00:04:32.030> all<00:04:32.270> stay<00:04:32.300> with

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
these are probably gonna all stay with

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.570 
these are probably gonna all stay with
me<00:04:32.840> depending<00:04:33.800> on<00:04:33.950> my<00:04:34.010> preference<00:04:34.370> for<00:04:34.520> the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
me depending on my preference for the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.790 
me depending on my preference for the
day<00:04:34.729> random<00:04:35.150> temperature<00:04:35.720> or<00:04:36.110> light

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
day random temperature or light

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.129 
day random temperature or light
hopefully<00:04:37.700> crowbar<00:04:38.150> although<00:04:38.810> it's<00:04:38.990> not

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
hopefully crowbar although it's not

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.080 
hopefully crowbar although it's not
quite<00:04:39.410> as<00:04:39.560> large<00:04:39.830> field<00:04:40.220> of<00:04:40.340> view<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.850> really

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
quite as large field of view I really

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.120 
quite as large field of view I really
like<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:41.540> style<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.930> these<00:04:41.990> goggles<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.710> the

like the style of these goggles and the
overall<00:04:43.370> shape<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:44.510> looks<00:04:44.600> really<00:04:44.870> cool<00:04:45.050> a

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
overall shape it looks really cool a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.610 
overall shape it looks really cool a
canopy<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.850> tried<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.750> get<00:04:47.870> something<00:04:48.289> that<00:04:48.470> was

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
canopy I tried to get something that was

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.379 
canopy I tried to get something that was
going<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.190> provide<00:04:49.340> me<00:04:49.699> with<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.880> same<00:04:50.150> kind

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
going to provide me with the same kind

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.770 
going to provide me with the same kind
of<00:04:50.449> optical<00:04:51.050> quality<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:51.800> durability<00:04:52.190> and

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
of optical quality and durability and

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.290 
of optical quality and durability and
ventilation<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.020> foam<00:04:54.800> padding<00:04:55.250> as<00:04:55.520> rhobar

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
ventilation and foam padding as rhobar

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.390 
ventilation and foam padding as rhobar
but<00:04:56.960> I<00:04:56.990> didn't<00:04:57.320> want<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.560> give<00:04:57.740> up<00:04:57.919> field<00:04:58.220> of

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
but I didn't want to give up field of

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.400 
but I didn't want to give up field of
vision<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:58.880> that's<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.780> happy<00:05:00.050> medium<00:05:00.380> there

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
vision so that's the happy medium there
