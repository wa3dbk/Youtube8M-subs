favourites because of the home advantage
but<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.180> I'll<00:00:36.300> both<00:00:36.450> go<00:00:36.660> far<00:00:36.899> how<00:00:37.320> much

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
but I think I'll both go far how much

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.740 
but I think I'll both go far how much
impact<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.120> climate<00:00:39.420> will

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
impact do you really think climate will

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.110 
impact do you really think climate will
have<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.710> well<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.250> Gran<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.579> play<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
have on how well in Gran will play I

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.729 
have on how well in Gran will play I
think<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.600> would<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.719> quite<00:00:42.930> tough<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.500> think

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
think it would be quite tough I think

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
think it would be quite tough I think
England<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.460> they're<00:00:45.149> quite<00:00:45.329> fortunate<00:00:45.570> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
England are they're quite fortunate in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.000 
England are they're quite fortunate in
that<00:00:45.930> they've<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> relatively<00:00:46.739> young

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that they've got a relatively young

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.770 
that they've got a relatively young
squad<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.820> they'll<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.149> able<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> perhaps

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
squad so they'll be able to perhaps

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
squad so they'll be able to perhaps
adapt<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> conditions<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:50.700> bit

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
adapt to the conditions a little bit

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.310 
adapt to the conditions a little bit
better<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.300> they'll<00:00:51.480> never<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> same

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
better but they'll never have the same

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.799 
better but they'll never have the same
advantage<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.730> likes<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.090> Brazil<00:00:54.510> or

followed<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.930> then<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.830> had<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.520> sit<00:02:03.729> down<00:02:03.970> for

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
followed and then I had to sit down for

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.690 
followed and then I had to sit down for
tests<00:02:04.810> measuring<00:02:05.410> reaction<00:02:06.130> times<00:02:06.400> and

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
tests measuring reaction times and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.880 
tests measuring reaction times and
memory<00:02:07.119> first<00:02:07.510> one<00:02:07.750> we<00:02:07.869> have<00:02:08.020> is<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> reaction

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
memory first one we have is a reaction

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.920 
memory first one we have is a reaction
time<00:02:09.070> test<00:02:10.740> test<00:02:11.740> complete<00:02:12.480> excellent<00:02:13.480> we

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
time test test complete excellent we

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.680 
time test test complete excellent we
have<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.530> more<00:02:14.739> for<00:02:15.070> memory<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.000> game<00:02:16.239> for

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
have one more for memory and a game for

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.930 
have one more for memory and a game for
attention<00:02:17.140> okay<00:02:17.830> yes<00:02:18.160> we're<00:02:18.370> going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.640> do<00:02:18.820> the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
attention okay yes we're going to do the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.030 
attention okay yes we're going to do the
memory<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.480> my<00:02:19.660> memories<00:02:20.050> probably<00:02:20.530> better

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
memory to my memories probably better

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800 
memory to my memories probably better
than<00:02:21.190> my<00:02:21.340> attention<00:02:21.790> yeah<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.390> spatial

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
than my attention yeah this is spatial

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.110 
than my attention yeah this is spatial
memory<00:02:22.989> specifically<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.370> may<00:02:24.760> be<00:02:24.820> useful

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
memory specifically so it may be useful

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.540 
memory specifically so it may be useful
in<00:02:25.480> team<00:02:25.720> sports<00:02:26.080> okay<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.770> can<00:02:27.070> remember

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
in team sports okay you can remember

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.540 
in team sports okay you can remember
very<00:02:27.580> well<00:02:27.850> though<00:02:28.150> everybody<00:02:32.250> after<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.310> break

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
very well though everybody after a break

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.910 
very well though everybody after a break
that<00:02:33.910> wasn't<00:02:34.390> long<00:02:34.510> enough<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.080> was<00:02:35.530> back<00:02:35.709> in

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
that wasn't long enough I was back in

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.280 
that wasn't long enough I was back in
the<00:02:35.980> room<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.430> redo<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.060> sequence<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:38.080> this

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the room to redo the sequence but this

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.320 
the room to redo the sequence but this
time<00:02:38.530> in<00:02:38.800> temperatures<00:02:39.160> equivalent<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.180> what

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
time in temperatures equivalent to what

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.120 
time in temperatures equivalent to what
England<00:02:40.720> will<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:40.959> playing<00:02:41.320> in<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.830> now<00:02:42.010> we're

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
England will be playing in so now we're

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.800 
England will be playing in so now we're
going<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.280> repeat<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.640> test<00:02:42.850> papi<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.570> it's

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
going to repeat the test papi so it's

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.470 
going to repeat the test papi so it's
going<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.959> be<00:02:44.050> at<00:02:44.320> 30<00:02:44.620> degrees<00:02:45.070> instead<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.090> 20

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
going to be at 30 degrees instead of 20

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.210 
going to be at 30 degrees instead of 20
where<00:02:46.959> we<00:02:47.049> were<00:02:47.200> before<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.100> little

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
where we were before so this is a little

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.160 
where we were before so this is a little
bit<00:02:48.549> hotter<00:02:48.760> it's<00:02:49.480> also<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.780> little<00:02:49.900> bit<00:02:49.989> more

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
bit hotter it's also a little bit more

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.020 
bit hotter it's also a little bit more
humid<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.769> humidity's<00:02:51.370> around<00:02:51.640> seventy

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
humid so the humidity's around seventy

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.910 
humid so the humidity's around seventy
percent<00:02:52.150> relative<00:02:52.450> humidity<00:02:53.080> compared<00:02:53.830> to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
percent relative humidity compared to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.759 
percent relative humidity compared to
thirty<00:02:54.160> percent<00:02:54.459> relative<00:02:54.670> humidity<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.769> it

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
thirty percent relative humidity and it

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.390 
thirty percent relative humidity and it
got<00:02:57.040> harder<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:58.350> harder<00:02:59.350> how<00:03:00.280> are<00:03:00.340> you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
got harder and harder how are you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.420 
got harder and harder how are you
feeling<00:03:00.459> now<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.150> 10<00:03:01.330> minutes<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:02.190> Stefan<00:03:03.190> I'm

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
feeling now in 10 minutes in Stefan I'm

sweaty and I how long have I got left 15

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.430 
sweaty and I how long have I got left 15
minutes<00:03:10.450> oh<00:03:12.090> very<00:03:13.090> hot<00:03:13.500> 8<00:03:14.500> yeah<00:03:16.230> fair<00:03:17.230> and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
minutes oh very hot 8 yeah fair and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.410

after<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.600> grueling<00:03:21.630> hour<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.620> exercise<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.610> was

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
after a grueling hour of exercise I was

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.060 
after a grueling hour of exercise I was
ready<00:03:24.150> for<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> results<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.650> can<00:03:25.830> see<00:03:26.010> you

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
ready for the results you can see you

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.770 
ready for the results you can see you
even<00:03:26.190> after<00:03:26.430> 10<00:03:26.790> minutes<00:03:27.120> here<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.540> our

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
even after 10 minutes here in our

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.110 
even after 10 minutes here in our
pension<00:03:28.350> your<00:03:28.890> heart<00:03:29.070> was<00:03:29.250> already<00:03:29.640> beating

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
pension your heart was already beating

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.820 
pension your heart was already beating
faster<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.840> at<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.110> end<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> pool

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
faster and at the end of the pool

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.550 
faster and at the end of the pool
condition<00:03:32.460> yeah<00:03:33.240> even<00:03:33.870> though<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.080> kept<00:03:34.380> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
condition yeah even though you kept the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.320 
condition yeah even though you kept the
exercise<00:03:35.010> up<00:03:35.190> quite<00:03:35.460> well<00:03:35.490> your<00:03:35.970> heart<00:03:36.150> and

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
exercise up quite well your heart and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.640 
exercise up quite well your heart and
your<00:03:36.420> body<00:03:36.510> was<00:03:36.870> having<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.260> work<00:03:37.410> much<00:03:37.620> harder

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
your body was having to work much harder

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.860 
your body was having to work much harder
so<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.610> shows<00:03:38.820> us<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.420> England<00:03:39.810> team

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
so this shows us that the England team

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.480 
so this shows us that the England team
when<00:03:40.170> they<00:03:40.200> perform<00:03:40.680> they'll<00:03:41.100> be<00:03:41.190> working

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
when they perform they'll be working

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.170 
when they perform they'll be working
double<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.240> hard<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:43.350> keep<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:43.850> fair<00:03:44.850> as<00:03:45.060> they

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
double is hard to keep as fair as they

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.730 
double is hard to keep as fair as they
would<00:03:45.360> have<00:03:45.450> been<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.930> usual<00:03:46.380> game<00:03:46.560> if

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
would have been in the usual game if

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.710 
would have been in the usual game if
their<00:03:46.890> brain<00:03:47.130> internal<00:03:47.790> physiology<00:03:48.000> will<00:03:48.600> be

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
their brain internal physiology will be

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.540 
their brain internal physiology will be
working<00:03:49.140> quite<00:03:49.290> hard<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.860> make<00:03:50.040> up<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:50.460> your

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
working quite hard to make up for your

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.180 
working quite hard to make up for your
extra<00:03:50.940> heat<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.330> humidity<00:03:51.420> years<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.680> there

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
extra heat and humidity years so there

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.520 
extra heat and humidity years so there
you<00:03:53.310> have<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.490> proven<00:03:54.420> evidence<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.080> take<00:03:55.290> into

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
you have it proven evidence to take into

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.860 
you have it proven evidence to take into
account<00:03:55.920> climate<00:03:56.310> change<00:03:56.820> before<00:03:57.150> placing

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
account climate change before placing

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.190 
account climate change before placing
your<00:03:58.020> bets<00:03:58.170> good<00:03:58.980> luck
