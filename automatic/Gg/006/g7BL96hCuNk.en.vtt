00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 are you still looking for coins 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:04.890
 www.justconnect.eu albe link is in the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.720
 Description 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.189
 then you want it doesn't pay the heart code 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.440
 all with capital letters 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.519
 to use from 5% short in last time 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.990
 the team or else a fucking tering who 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.990
 this is the biggest one 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 Sure but then I could do that here 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.539
 care about docker documents at the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.949
 ultimate fantasy edition 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.779
 and this is my team and it has one 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.230
 few striking choices 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 I chose a team purely on class but me 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.180
 I was laughed at now in Forma lex and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.530
 I was ridiculed in shape 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.450
 alex alex too absolute 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.690
 is took in shape per well or and I got 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.300
 derided in shape or a perfect 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.160
 that show so bad after i determined 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.329
 was of course their wrong about mine 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 players to prove 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.870
 I decided to start the tournament 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 first opponent had this one reasonable 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.260
 good 4222 series yes that but i had to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.399
 play the snow 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.170
 meeus I now have all the goodies and I 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.420
 give it to me and to your shoot 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.880
 for 0 1 then berber is great because of this and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 babbitt or who everyone criticized 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.210
 002 then scores corpses here again 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.710
 by coming to i couldn't really tell how he did 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.610
 comes through with the release he scores with 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.780
 barbeau 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.130
 but that is kind of spoiled but on that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.170
 I will, of course, continue again 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.820
 because he is not actually he is 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.320
 here again with giovinco and scores 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
 again with ibarbo 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.680
 yes 2 2 but I will continue because I 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.509
 naturally to your sander and boots 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.240
 He gives the ball to Toulalan 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.280
 and occasionally countries CPM scores and so I am the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.259
 first match of this tournament with a 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.329
 great state of prix against two and 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 then it's about time for the 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.570
 quarter final of the tournament 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.340
 one hundred times sports teams with opponents 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.439
 he has fashion house the 5star scanner 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.299
 informs Turkish Turkish 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.890
 a very good and creative hi-bit 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.470
 if i own it but i am now with 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.149
 babbitt or faÃ§ade akz and that is 0 1 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.649
 but also for theodoor with sturgeon shoots 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.869
 him believes in and stands this 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.450
 a why am I again with you 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.100
 Berbatov as my own when you're there 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.659
 but by the way it is really great and he 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.310
 the two scores a man who has one 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 corner headed with with basha 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.719
 and so I am three before one seems 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.000
 everything on a rose nothing seems wrong 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.250
 and then he comes through here with you 14 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.599
 steurs know what real strong shoots 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.489
 inside and so it says three and two 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.970
 then the ruler comes by sitting him 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.890
 in front of 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.330
 on god i don't know who but how you bond 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.260
 is for their player and that's how the team stands 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.600
 three 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.200
 then he is running with it 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.880
 sterling and city but nothing is left 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.320
 written as i do it with you are you 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.450
 rockets what we are comfortable with and me 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.580
 score if there are four 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.110
 kemal still had 10 minutes and I am 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.020
 because of this with dimitar berbatov that must 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.640
 one per job is through and it is missing 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.120
 and that's how I'm used to this match 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.650
 with a great comeback at parkinn 4 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.660
 and this means that I am almost through the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.330
 semi final because this is already my best 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.950
 performance so far but in the go 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.990
 then we go club 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.120
 I mean, of course, the ultimate panther 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.890
 we will compete in the semi-final 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.180
 probably the most 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.200
 frightening team what ever I have 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.790
 seen 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.100
 and the reason you're closer and against and 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.270
 you're going to see it now it's so corny 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.700
 chemistry 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.959
 with a random so in the hope that final 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.430
 you just go around the corner and get new ideas 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.680
 have coffee has bad opponent 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.510
 or that fucked up so she grows 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.970
 was huge about what is going to happen for sure 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.920
 him here with a 0 came by nani 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.470
 because of course really was what 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.660
 happens now really titles his team was 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.860
 so bad and mine is so good 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.600
 so then you still think you have to hunt 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.400
 professionally this can only be happy 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.030
 I have the bean james wood 3 here is me 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.530
 I was free and I scored 1 on 1 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.120
 cheers to trigger is really a big one 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.440
 normal card shop there must he scores here 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.519
 also the twins 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.200
 bringing the lead more 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.269
 technical need i really needed that 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.290
 it really isn't fun to do 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.300
 purely because I didn't know what to do 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.100
 expect more so I get three 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.380
 object and gender and so it seems 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.690
 game against reasonable plays then is 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.370
 but so that I still come to perry two 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.709
 I am so here with your input 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.690
 ears man so beach and it almost costs 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.090
 Never miss him in this match with 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.239
 3 against 2 which of course is a great one 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.040
 result and so I can just continue to 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.200
 the final I am right in the third 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.299
 I can make the script through 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.790
 win ultimate fantasy and then it is 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.160
 as far as we are going to play the final of the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.260
 Soon my chance to cup in a third time 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.650
 to memo of the ultimate fantasy 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.120
 within 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.100
 he just falls there 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.680
 so i am no more worse than in the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.330
 your net did not rank against this 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.000
 shy camry makes you your soul 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.560
 often for tony jovic beaks you know 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.789
 between good enough team that I knew 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.490
 sure I just had to pay attention 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.750
 and 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.669
 not that i'm this match way before 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.289
 I come here soon by the who who 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.310
 calling or trying to shoot 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.550

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.900

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.270

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.360

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.470

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.310

 cross pad and I know lockers and grab the 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.669
 ball and will never be caught up again 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.669
 and that's a job like that 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.560
 0 3 incredible track of course in the 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.330
