about<00:00:02.429> mini<00:00:02.730> bicycle<00:00:03.090> pumps<00:00:04.160> until<00:00:05.160> I

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
about mini bicycle pumps until I

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.849 
about mini bicycle pumps until I
stumbled<00:00:06.480> upon<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.690> website<00:00:07.080> which<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.410> will<00:00:07.440> put

stumbled upon a website which I will put

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.339 
stumbled upon a website which I will put
in<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.639> links<00:00:08.940> up<00:00:09.660> there<00:00:10.639> I<00:00:11.900> didn't<00:00:12.900> know<00:00:13.019> that

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
in the links up there I didn't know that

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.379 
in the links up there I didn't know that
many<00:00:14.130> bicycle<00:00:14.610> pumps<00:00:14.790> could<00:00:14.910> accommodate

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
many bicycle pumps could accommodate

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.260 
many bicycle pumps could accommodate
both<00:00:15.660> Presta<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.440> Schrader<00:00:16.800> valves<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
both Presta and Schrader valves if you

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.490 
both Presta and Schrader valves if you
don't<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.690> Preston<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.230> trader

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
don't know what Preston and trader

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.920 
don't know what Preston and trader
valves<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.100> I'll<00:00:20.490> post<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.180> link<00:00:21.359> also<00:00:21.750> up

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
valves are I'll post a link also up

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.660 
valves are I'll post a link also up
there<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.130> check<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
there so that you can check out the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.900 
there so that you can check out the
difference<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> basically<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
difference so basically what you do you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.569 
difference so basically what you do you
unscrew<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:28.439> cap<00:00:28.650> over<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:31.309> little<00:00:32.309> tough

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
unscrew the cap over here little tough

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.520 
unscrew the cap over here little tough
to<00:00:32.610> get<00:00:32.820> there<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.120> go<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to get there you go this is just a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.319 
to get there you go this is just a
protection<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> cap<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.120> just

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
protection for the cap you can just

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.000 
protection for the cap you can just
ignore<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.660> I'll<00:00:36.989> take<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> off<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.920> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
ignore that I'll take that off so you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.990 
ignore that I'll take that off so you
take<00:00:38.190> off<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.550> front<00:00:38.790> end<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.899> unscrew<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
take off the front end you unscrew it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.319 
take off the front end you unscrew it
there<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.090> go<00:00:42.270> fell<00:00:42.660> off<00:00:43.280> here<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
there you go fell off here you go so the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.180 
there you go fell off here you go so the
front<00:00:45.510> part<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.050> off<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:47.100> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
front part of this is off and then you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
front part of this is off and then you
need<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> rubber<00:00:47.850> part<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.480> off

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
need to get the rubber part in here off

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.729 
need to get the rubber part in here off
so<00:00:48.809> what<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.160> lift<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.739> handle

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
so what you do is just lift the handle

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.630 
so what you do is just lift the handle
there<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.129> go<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.680> comes<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:58.640> then

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
there you go so it comes out and then

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
there you go so it comes out and then
with<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.180> come<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.750> blue<00:01:01.020> f---ing

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
with it will come a little blue f---ing

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.330 
with it will come a little blue f---ing
if<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.379> doesn't<00:01:01.620> come<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.859> it

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
if it doesn't come up with it

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.179 
if it doesn't come up with it
you<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.670> tap<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.780> what<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> had<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> use<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you just tap it or what I had to use the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789 
you just tap it or what I had to use the
first<00:01:05.369> time<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> pair<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.080> pliers<00:01:07.320> from

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
first time or just a pair of pliers from

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.960 
first time or just a pair of pliers from
my<00:01:07.979> multi-tool<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.240> yank<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.850> now

if you take a good look at this hold on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.450 
if you take a good look at this hold on
let<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.650> hold<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.130> my

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.280 

pliers<00:01:20.030> there<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.510> go<00:01:20.690> so<00:01:20.960> if<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.110> take<00:01:21.260> a

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
pliers there you go so if you take a

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.330 
pliers there you go so if you take a
look<00:01:21.470> at<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:23.570> end<00:01:23.810> over<00:01:24.020> here<00:01:24.050> is<00:01:24.410> for

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
look at this this end over here is for

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.550 
look at this this end over here is for
Schrader<00:01:25.640> valves<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.050> can<00:01:27.200> push<00:01:27.350> down

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
Schrader valves so that it can push down

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.840 
Schrader valves so that it can push down
on<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.830> pin<00:01:28.040> whereas<00:01:28.910> if<00:01:29.120> this<00:01:29.390> end<00:01:29.630> over<00:01:29.870> here

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
on the pin whereas if this end over here

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.010 
on the pin whereas if this end over here
this<00:01:31.850> n<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.630> for<00:01:33.050> press<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.620> valves<00:01:33.920> because

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
this n is for press the valves because

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.440 
this n is for press the valves because
the<00:01:36.020> pin<00:01:36.260> is<00:01:36.470> loosened<00:01:37.400> by<00:01:37.550> hand<00:01:37.790> you<00:01:38.330> don't

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
the pin is loosened by hand you don't

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.380 
the pin is loosened by hand you don't
need<00:01:38.660> a<00:01:38.930> little<00:01:39.830> piece<00:01:40.580> of<00:01:40.610> plastic<00:01:41.060> pushing

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
need a little piece of plastic pushing

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.920 
need a little piece of plastic pushing
down<00:01:41.510> on<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.750> pin<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:43.340> depending<00:01:44.180> on<00:01:44.300> which

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
down on the pin so depending on which

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.750 
down on the pin so depending on which
valve<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.440> need<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.680> pump<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.280> can<00:01:46.430> put<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.670> in

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
valve you need to pump you can put it in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
valve you need to pump you can put it in
this<00:01:46.940> way<00:01:47.119> for<00:01:47.360> Presta<00:01:48.640> with<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:53.630> rubber

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
this way for Presta with the rubber

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.660 
this way for Presta with the rubber
going<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.869> like<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.140> or<00:01:57.410> if<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.160> need<00:01:58.369> to

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
going in like that or if you need to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.730 
going in like that or if you need to
pump<00:01:59.420> something<00:01:59.630> with<00:01:59.869> a<00:01:59.899> Schrader<00:02:00.200> valve<00:02:00.380> and

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
pump something with a Schrader valve and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.889 
pump something with a Schrader valve and
Schrader<00:02:00.920> valves<00:02:01.250> will<00:02:01.430> be<00:02:01.580> most<00:02:02.210> mountain

this<00:02:12.739> little<00:02:13.370> pin<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.150> was<00:02:14.239> using<00:02:14.390> as<00:02:14.570> a

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
this little pin that I was using as a

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.560 
this little pin that I was using as a
pointer<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.370> if<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.730> need<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.270> pump<00:02:17.450> the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
pointer and so if you need to pump the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.180 
pointer and so if you need to pump the
Schrader<00:02:17.780> valve<00:02:17.870> it's<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.680> same<00:02:18.860> thing<00:02:19.070> you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
Schrader valve it's the same thing you

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.900 
Schrader valve it's the same thing you
take<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:21.080> piece<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.290> rubber<00:02:21.560> you'll<00:02:22.520> see<00:02:22.760> on

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
take the piece of rubber you'll see on

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.250 
take the piece of rubber you'll see on
the<00:02:23.000> piece<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.270> rubber<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.660> big<00:02:23.900> circle

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
the piece of rubber that is a big circle

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.199 
the piece of rubber that is a big circle
and<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.470> small<00:02:24.709> circle<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.160> big<00:02:25.340> circle<00:02:25.760> goes

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
and a small circle the big circle goes

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.440 
and a small circle the big circle goes
with<00:02:26.600> Presta<00:02:27.370> whereas<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> small<00:02:28.820> circle<00:02:29.239> goes

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
with Presta whereas a small circle goes

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.979 
with Presta whereas a small circle goes
with<00:02:29.630> Schrader<00:02:30.910> there<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.090> go<00:02:32.299> so<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.750> pit

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
with Schrader there you go so you pit

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.190 
with Schrader there you go so you pit
them<00:02:33.140> together<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.709> like<00:02:33.950> before<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:36.080> you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
them together just like before and you

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.280 
them together just like before and you
put<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.010> way<00:02:37.160> will<00:02:37.370> be<00:02:38.170> like<00:02:39.170> I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
put it in so this way will be like I

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.610 
put it in so this way will be like I
said<00:02:39.940> for<00:02:40.940> Schrader<00:02:41.269> whereas<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.230> big<00:02:42.410> end

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
said for Schrader whereas the big end

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.160 
said for Schrader whereas the big end
for<00:02:42.980> Presta<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.299> depending<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.840> what<00:02:45.019> you

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
for Presta and so depending on what you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.620 
for Presta and so depending on what you
need<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.320> use<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.950> can<00:02:46.100> accommodate<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.760> which

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630
