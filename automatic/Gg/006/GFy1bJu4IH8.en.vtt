bit<00:00:42.390> better<00:00:42.510> I'd<00:00:42.780> say<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.260> more<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.680> less<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
bit better I'd say it's more or less the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.610 
bit better I'd say it's more or less the
same<00:00:44.610> amount<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.629> guess<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.410> less

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.369 
same amount that's my guess more or less
more<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.399> less<00:00:47.730> either<00:00:48.329> more<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.170> less

I'd say this is a maybe a little bit

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.759 
I'd say this is a maybe a little bit
less<00:01:02.910> than<00:01:03.149> last<00:01:03.390> time<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.650> to
