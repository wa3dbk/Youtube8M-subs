00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.929
 hi friends and today i have this 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.080
 Uncommon will be unpacking 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.650
 say not unpacking just anboxing 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:28.880
 Here is such a thing is a cooler with 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:32.420
 cooler for my computer 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.340
 why I bought it well first of all 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:42.440
 started about two months ago my 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:46.980
 the old cooler started to buzz very much 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 can say like a tractor i usually 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 computer in the hands of the workshop as myself 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.789
 I did not understand this and we can say that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.699
 Now I do not understand they said there that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.899
 need to change the fan said 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.150
 say I bought was a fan 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:11.850
 7 centimeters square set did not pass 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.939
 and two weeks as a new fan too 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 began to buzz contract 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.270
 Well, I began to scour the internet to search 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:28.439
 replacement what can be done such a case 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:32.729
 and stumbled upon just such a thing for 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:38.340
 I will have a new kind of refrigerator 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.650
 call him so there we will see 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.890
 but briefly say that there is copper 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.950
 tubes and they're inside 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.310
 seemingly filled with liquid nitrogen 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.740
 it's better cooled and the temperature 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.399
 cooling is better the fan itself is here 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.390
 more 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.390
 ninety two millimeters 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.740
 firm here zalman 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:11.440
 Modelka I do not remember exactly here on the box 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.440
 not written where 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.520
 specifications 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:22.430
 if anyone is interested if the camera 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:27.590
 will focus can read well 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.580
 let's see what's inside the store I'm sure 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.690
 I've seen it all but I want to show you 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:38.000
 instruction instruction of course on 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.660
 Chinese because here here on 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.100
 the box says what is produced in 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.230
 China but I went through all the Chinese sites 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.000
 Nowhere on the Chinese website such here 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.570
 cooler I did not find instructions for 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.570
 installation 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:05.060
 Of course this is all I do not read yet 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.740
 This cooler fits like a processor 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.730
 intel and processor am d box 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.810
 blank don't know what some say glue 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.100
 they say to remove moisture so here 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.100
 this is an adapter 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:28.209
 so this is for the intel processor and so 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.720
 there are still bolts 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.810
 this one is also not intended here 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:40.280
 this is thermal grease well, and thermal grease too 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.910
 branded zelman think enough for 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.900
 installations 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:49.010
 I have the same processor 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:52.980
 quad and extra 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.849
 equipment to install this 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.709
 cooler with a cooler 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.709
 everything is in place 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:15.480
 that's how it looks so handsome 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:18.269
 large 4 pin 4 point connector this 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.519
 very good because somewhere I read 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.320
 that 4 maple gives the opportunity 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.510
 adjust fan rotation more 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.280
 big turns less turn it like 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.750
 already need to be for the processor itself 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.340
 for installation I just need 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.930
 unscrew one or two bolts 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.090
 release a little bit of this smear 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.350
 here thermal paste set on the old and 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:53.660
 screw me on old install on 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:59.940
 cpu and spin ninety two 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:03.539
 millimeter ninety two millimeters 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.660
 fan diameter 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:09.950
 and here if you can see such here 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.020
 extra small blades this 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:18.360
 made the shape of shark fins for better 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:21.740
 air distribution well let's see how 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.120
 she will cool me I hope 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.050
 installation, too, take off on video will give you 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.320
 show that this should be easy 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.979
 easy and a kettle like me should 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.310
 install it all yourself in it 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:41.710
 load 50 percent discount on 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:46.780
 here's an additional fan 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:50.200
 what and for what's on my coke 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.020
 there was no fan on the back wall 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.960
 one more extra warm blow 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:02.650
 air from the hull here too 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.470
 Chinese of course there is everything 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:11.500
 English 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:14.380
 instructions specifications q master not 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.280
 I know it is not visible but there are already three 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:21.340
 pin here we will connect it 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:26.290
 directly to the power supply itself 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:29.680
 and for this there is an adapter included 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.690
 and it will all be very cool and very 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.880
 the main thing 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:41.800
 cost me all this happiness here how would you 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:45.880
 Thought how much it cost is only 20 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.830
 bucks so many will say then you 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.280
 improve your computer buy yourself 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.440
 laptop finance 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.810
 I have no financially now to buy 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.060
 laptop yes it's a dream that's all you want 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.450
 I think it will be in the future 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.090
 for now we will improve what 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.640
 I have an old one and so to whom 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.100
