 couple of days back from this gold 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.220
 mix 2015 to pull together the sums of 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.260
 this fair since it was the first one 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.669

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.430
 I was more impressed by this fair 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.709
 what I liked and what I hope for 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.319
 future meanwhile talking about the fair I must 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.060
 to say that it is a fair is really huge 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.579
 in addition to our beautiful pavilion 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.680
 full of beautiful stands in addition to the stands 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.659
 There were a lot of style networks 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.340
 beautiful I don't know one that I remember 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.680
 because it hit me a lot was super 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.269
 technological and superfigo was that of 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.889
 italian video games academy that is 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.750
 practically these guys were there 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.760
 we can see how they were created 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.290
 huge video games in which 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.880
 they designed the characters of the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.739
 video games and talking to one of them 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.940
 he told me he has for courses in October 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.010
 so if it should go wrong with 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.270
 the associated university charge me over 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.010
 to our beautiful can say that the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.389
 comic ball where I saw sio 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.610
 boys and then I wanted to make a little one 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.260
 consideration of what I did 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.210
 al romics was the first time in my life 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.820
 that I stated on a stage to make a 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.039
 online 30-minute internship anyway 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.080
 put a lot of tension on me 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.150
 this time I preferred to do 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.740
 gameplay simply because it was the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.539
 first time all I went up on a stage 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.630
 and I wanted for a moment to test the soil 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.039
 see what emotions you feel when you got on 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.590
 a stage and the jem and I must say that it is a 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.900
 pool yet id of emotions that really you 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.670
 they take renato almost before going up 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.130
 on the stage however I have to say that it is once 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.050
 climbed I really started doing the 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.000
 it was so much more so with gianpi 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.980
 simple and I'm sure to the romics of 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.870
 October I will be able to bring you too 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.190
 something a little bit more studied 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.730
 as they did for example against 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.590
 server 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.090
 I also turned the people back 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.610

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.300
