yeah anyways let's see the tale set in
oh<00:02:37.340> no<00:02:38.340> that's<00:02:38.460> how<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.700> fly<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.260> here's<00:02:40.260> how<00:02:40.350> to

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
oh no that's how to fly it here's how to

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.650 
oh no that's how to fly it here's how to
wings<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.910> actually<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:43.260> stick<00:02:43.800> em<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.100> here

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
wings in actually just stick em in here

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.250 
wings in actually just stick em in here
see<00:02:45.660> if<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.840> do<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.910> ok<00:02:47.910> take<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.930> I

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
see if I do that ok take it like that I

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.940 
see if I do that ok take it like that I
guess<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:51.690> put<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.410> grid<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.800> them

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
guess just put it in the grid on them

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.060 
guess just put it in the grid on them
just<00:02:52.980> put<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:53.460> minute<00:02:54.410> need<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.560> handle<00:02:55.950> do

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
just put one minute need to handle do

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:07.250 
just put one minute need to handle do
this<00:02:56.220> oh<00:02:59.630> just<00:03:00.630> slide<00:03:01.020> right<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.620> think<00:03:06.260> you
