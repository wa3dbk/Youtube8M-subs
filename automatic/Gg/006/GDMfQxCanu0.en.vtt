00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.540
 today for me changed the link to the first 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.610
 is that you hear change the link abrasion 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.010
 He had three or four years is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
 first I remember when we 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.890
 they made the way of the Inca that had 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.330
 a possibility to split changes 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.640
 in line with such an important career 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.050
 for us as a person and what 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.300
 means the mine link to for a pilot 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.160
 here in Peru being the most 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.789
 emblematic of the country we went from all 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.789
 both ways 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.360
 what we as pilots and have in 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 Inka roads is a hard experience 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.370
 there are many days that go by without sleep 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.800
 it's a race that consists of seven days 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.660
 as intervals of a day of repair 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.190
 / special and special that you go from a 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.190
 town or from one city ​​to another 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.050
 that makes it a tough race to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.850
 you physically last for the team that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.980
 goes with you and those have to leave 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.620
 before and wait for you during the special 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.789
 to put gasoline or tire changes 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.040
 or any problem that may occur 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.920
 during this special and we the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.710
 pilots we slept a little less than 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.840
 normal since the games are six of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.750
 the morning very early in the morning 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.320
 to reach the destination before 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.320
 let the day end 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.619
 for me the truck is something very 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.350
 important and it's a different feeling 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:33.040
 everyone is a toyota land cruiser is pj 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.570
 60 the 83 I have it since I was 16 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.600
 years and little by little we have gone 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.190
 transforming the truck up to 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.190
 what is now not that is the toxic 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.909
 toyota is reliable but that we have 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.070
 chosen this and apart from this kind of 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.009
 trucks of this time we 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.869
 We believe that it is something very tough and 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.869
 hard that holds a lot of machete 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.810
 I want to invite all lovers of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.729
 the irons and those who just 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.850
 know that you are aware of this 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.289
 I walk the link to 2015 that promises 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.659
 a lot of new things so they are 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.659
 attentive and follow us there we go on the route
