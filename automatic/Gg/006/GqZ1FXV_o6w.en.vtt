00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
pretty much just like an audio jack just

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.319 
pretty much just like an audio jack just
plugged<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.620> headphone<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.149> do

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
can feel that it's loose and then you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.299 
can feel that it's loose and then you
jiggle<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> around<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.360> pull<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.070> as

plastic<00:01:44.310> piece<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
plastic piece right here and you have to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.749 
plastic piece right here and you have to
kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.000> line<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.619> headset<00:01:50.490> in

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759

kind of line that up with the headset in
the<00:01:51.079> back<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.320> just

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the back right here so I think you just

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.870

got<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.770> turn<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> side<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.549> this

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
got to turn it to the side like this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.310 
got to turn it to the side like this
again<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.570> took<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.810> out

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
again like you took it out

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.170 
again like you took it out
line<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.549> bit<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.149> just

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
line it up a little bit and then just

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.959 
line it up a little bit and then just
pull<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> right<00:02:01.020> back<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:02.130> make<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:02.759> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
pull it right back in to make it back to
