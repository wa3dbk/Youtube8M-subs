00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
there there's not a lot of a full-court

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
effective press okay so I'm going to

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.410 
effective press okay so I'm going to
talk<00:02:39.159> really<00:02:39.549> quickly<00:02:39.849> about<00:02:39.970> his<00:02:40.239> two

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
talk really quickly about his two

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.509 
talk really quickly about his two
presses<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> double<00:02:41.439> fist<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.829> diamond<00:02:42.220> double

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
presses a double fist and diamond double

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.640 
presses a double fist and diamond double
fist<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:42.909> the<00:02:42.940> man-to-man<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.840> diamond<00:02:44.530> is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
fist is the man-to-man and diamond is

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.550 
fist is the man-to-man and diamond is
your<00:02:44.799> one<00:02:44.980> two<00:02:45.220> one<00:02:45.430> one<00:02:45.459> one<00:02:46.560> full-court

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
your one two one one one full-court

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.530 
your one two one one one full-court
matchup<00:02:48.010> press<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.579> so<00:02:49.030> they<00:02:49.209> use<00:02:49.389> those

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
matchup press and so they use those

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.629 
matchup press and so they use those
interchangeably<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.739> what<00:02:51.099> I<00:02:51.129> think<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.459> neat

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
interchangeably and what I think is neat

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.569 
interchangeably and what I think is neat
is<00:02:51.849> once<00:02:52.440> they'll<00:02:53.440> switch<00:02:53.739> those<00:02:53.950> presses<00:02:54.430> up

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
is once they'll switch those presses up

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.309 
is once they'll switch those presses up
so<00:02:55.000> if<00:02:55.150> somebody<00:02:55.480> starts<00:02:55.810> figuring<00:02:55.989> out<00:02:56.290> a

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
so if somebody starts figuring out a

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.229 
so if somebody starts figuring out a
little<00:02:56.530> bit<00:02:56.739> about<00:02:56.859> the<00:02:57.069> one-to-one<00:02:57.459> one<00:02:57.940> or

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
little bit about the one-to-one one or

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.050 
little bit about the one-to-one one or
they<00:02:58.780> start<00:02:58.989> bringing<00:02:59.230> people<00:02:59.409> up<00:02:59.980> they<00:03:00.790> bring

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
they start bringing people up they bring

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.089 
they start bringing people up they bring
four<00:03:01.359> across<00:03:01.629> up<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.349> it<00:03:02.470> gets<00:03:02.590> bunched<00:03:02.889> up

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
four across up and it gets bunched up

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.500 
four across up and it gets bunched up
well<00:03:03.609> then<00:03:03.730> they'll<00:03:03.849> switch<00:03:04.060> back<00:03:04.269> into

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
well then they'll switch back into

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.849 
well then they'll switch back into
double<00:03:04.840> fist<00:03:05.049> because<00:03:05.170> now<00:03:05.409> they<00:03:05.560> got<00:03:05.680> all

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
double fist because now they got all

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.770 
double fist because now they got all
these<00:03:05.950> people<00:03:06.190> bunched<00:03:06.639> up<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.060> now<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
these people bunched up and now is the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.960 
these people bunched up and now is the
time<00:03:07.989> when<00:03:08.709> double<00:03:09.159> fist<00:03:09.370> would<00:03:09.519> actually<00:03:09.849> be

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
time when double fist would actually be

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.490 
time when double fist would actually be
more<00:03:10.120> effective<00:03:10.569> than<00:03:10.659> the<00:03:10.690> one-to-one<00:03:11.109> one

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
more effective than the one-to-one one

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.649 
more effective than the one-to-one one
on<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.370> diamond<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.970> one-to-one<00:03:13.269> one<00:03:13.540> he

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
on the diamond the one-to-one one he

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.449 
on the diamond the one-to-one one he
does<00:03:13.870> talk<00:03:14.139> about<00:03:14.470> different<00:03:14.859> press<00:03:15.099> breaks

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
does talk about different press breaks

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.030 
does talk about different press breaks
that<00:03:16.419> you<00:03:16.449> will<00:03:16.720> face<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.319> know<00:03:17.410> two<00:03:17.470> up<00:03:17.769> three

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
the double fist so that's the reason I

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.319 
the double fist so that's the reason I
wouldn't<00:03:44.530> give<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.190> full<00:03:45.370> ten<00:03:45.790> but

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
wouldn't give it the full ten but

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.970 
wouldn't give it the full ten but
otherwise<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.989> details<00:03:47.410> are<00:03:47.620> there<00:03:47.799> that

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
otherwise the details are there that

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.069 
otherwise the details are there that
what<00:03:48.400> he<00:03:48.459> emphasizes<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.389> make<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.690> successful

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
what he emphasizes to make it successful

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.199 
what he emphasizes to make it successful
was<00:03:50.440> there<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.919> so<00:03:51.669> I<00:03:51.699> think<00:03:51.849> it's<00:03:52.030> well<00:03:52.180> worth

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
was there and so I think it's well worth

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.140 
was there and so I think it's well worth
