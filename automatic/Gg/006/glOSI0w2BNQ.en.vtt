rind<00:02:23.320> off<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:25.120> that's<00:02:25.270> what<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.480> call<00:02:25.750> it

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
rind off I think that's what you call it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.010 
rind off I think that's what you call it
around<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:26.910> we're<00:02:27.910> left<00:02:28.120> with<00:02:28.510> this

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
around and then we're left with this

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.000 
around and then we're left with this
round<00:02:29.850> pineapple<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.570> i<00:02:31.960> have<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.830> square

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
round pineapple so i have the square

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.310 
round pineapple so i have the square
part<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:34.000> see<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.330> center<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:34.960> the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
part and you can see the center of the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.440 
part and you can see the center of the
pineapple<00:02:35.560> when<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.040> get<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.550> point<00:02:36.850> you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
pineapple when you get to that point you

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.450 
pineapple when you get to that point you
can<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.080> core<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.130> can<00:02:39.310> also

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.640 
can see the core of it and you can also
feel<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.420> harder<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.110> there<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.530> it's
