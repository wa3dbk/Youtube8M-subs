00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.730
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.860
 new cinema this time it's about a 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.629
 corner of the elegant ned 66 and 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.840
 we started as always by the cries of 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.840
 war 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.290
 frightened 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.050
 I have you 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.919
 you can give up if you want 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.550
 this is how the future looks 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.550
 the dance 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:54.570
 and we're going to do it in the shape of a cannon 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.570
 to see if something changes 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.020
 I arrived scared 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.840
 I have you 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.970
 you can give up if you want 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.300
 that's how the future paints the dance 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.080
 and laughter 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.710
 we go to the spells recharging 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.350
 here we see how it moves in the form of 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.909
 crossbow 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.909
 and how is the character 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.630
 here in the form of a hammer 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.340
 not a false step 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.340
 the other tags in the form of more brightness 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.700
 the q 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.600
 I never look back 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.600
 the w 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.210
 and the e 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.800
 we go in canyon form here we see the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.800
 cannon -shaped autotaxis 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.160
 the things 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.420
 the w 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.420
 deep and forward 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.850
 the et and the co 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.870
 we go to record the recovery without 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.870
 fear 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.459
 recovery in the form of a cannon 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.459
 hammer forgiveness 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.020
 and finally death 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.020
 So far this corner I hope you 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.020
 have liked and until the next video 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 Thank you
