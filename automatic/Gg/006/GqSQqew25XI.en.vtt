00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
decisions I'm playing for the game and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.479 
decisions I'm playing for the game and
I'm<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> know<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.770> don't<00:00:44.370> think

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
I'm like you know what I don't think

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.889 
I'm like you know what I don't think
that<00:00:44.579> was<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> good<00:00:44.820> choice<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.840> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that was a good choice and I go back in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.690 
that was a good choice and I go back in
and<00:00:46.530> restart<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> way<00:00:47.489> from<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
and restart that and go to way from that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.650 
and restart that and go to way from that
decision<00:00:48.000> no<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> can't<00:00:49.219> know<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
decision no you can't know and and the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
decision no you can't know and and the
reason<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> can

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
reason is it's not because that can

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
reason is it's not because that can
happen<00:00:53.309> none<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> them<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.149> bad<00:00:54.510> outcomes<00:00:55.110> I'm

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
happen none of them are bad outcomes I'm

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.200 
happen none of them are bad outcomes I'm
guessing<00:00:55.980> most<00:00:56.160> people<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> keep<00:00:56.910> everyone

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
guessing most people go to keep everyone

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.569 
guessing most people go to keep everyone
alive<00:00:57.350> but<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.469> don't<00:00:58.649> always<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:59.280> what's

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
alive but you don't always know what's

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
alive but you don't always know what's
happening<00:00:59.670> with<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> butterfly<00:01:00.600> effect<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
happening with a butterfly effect it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
happening with a butterfly effect it
could<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> short<00:01:02.489> term<00:01:02.670> it's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
could look like in the short term it's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
could look like in the short term it's
absolutely<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.140> worst<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.589> ever<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.220> you

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
absolutely the worst thing ever but you

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.950 
absolutely the worst thing ever but you
know<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:06.000> further<00:01:06.180> down<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.570> line<00:01:06.720> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
know a little further down the line it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.030 
know a little further down the line it
might<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.320> said<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> best<00:01:07.890> thing<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
might have said it's the best thing you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.649 
might have said it's the best thing you
could<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.250> done<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
could have done so is this one of the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.000 
could have done so is this one of the
totems<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.350> heads<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:10.590> had<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.920> we

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
totems the little heads all had that we

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
totems the little heads all had that we
just<00:01:11.130> saw<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> collect<00:01:11.850> yes<00:01:12.150> that's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
just saw that you collect yes that's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.670 
just saw that you collect yes that's
that's<00:01:12.689> completely<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.530> what

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that's completely it so what what

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
that's completely it so what what
happens<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.130> these<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> they're

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
happens with these is that they're

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
happens with these is that they're

do<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.189> top<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.639> one<00:03:03.939> of<00:03:04.030> them<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.209> just

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
do on top of it one of them is just

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.629 
do on top of it one of them is just
nighttime<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.079> know<00:03:05.169> nighttime<00:03:05.680> nighttime

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
nighttime you know nighttime nighttime

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.460 
nighttime you know nighttime nighttime
in<00:03:06.760> games<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.180> harder<00:03:07.540> than<00:03:07.659> it<00:03:07.750> looks<00:03:07.810> it's

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
in games is harder than it looks it's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.869 
in games is harder than it looks it's
you<00:03:08.590> think<00:03:08.799> just<00:03:08.980> dial<00:03:09.189> down<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.400> life<00:03:09.669> but

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
you think just dial down the life but

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.210 
you think just dial down the life but
you<00:03:10.030> can't<00:03:10.689> do<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.019> in<00:03:11.260> order<00:03:11.919> to<00:03:12.099> get

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
you can't do that in order to get

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.670 
you can't do that in order to get
darkness<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.569> can<00:03:13.720> see<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:13.959> this<00:03:14.079> real

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
darkness as you can see in this real

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.280 
darkness as you can see in this real
darkness<00:03:15.040> but<00:03:15.459> but<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.359> can<00:03:16.569> see<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.079> stuff

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
darkness but but you can see the stuff

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.960 
darkness but but you can see the stuff
that's<00:03:17.470> going<00:03:17.709> on<00:03:17.769> as<00:03:17.889> well<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.639> have<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.879> have

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
that's going on as well you have to have

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.240 
that's going on as well you have to have
high<00:03:19.120> contrast<00:03:19.659> lines<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.620> same<00:03:20.769> as<00:03:20.919> movies

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
high contrast lines the same as movies

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.800 
high contrast lines the same as movies
so<00:03:21.729> we've<00:03:21.879> had<00:03:21.909> to<00:03:22.030> come<00:03:22.209> up<00:03:22.239> with<00:03:22.329> a<00:03:22.449> lighting

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
so we've had to come up with a lighting

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.330 
so we've had to come up with a lighting
system<00:03:22.989> we've<00:03:23.680> got<00:03:23.799> some<00:03:23.919> really<00:03:24.159> clever

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
system we've got some really clever

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.309 
system we've got some really clever
engineers<00:03:24.909> at<00:03:25.120> super<00:03:25.329> massive<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:26.049> they've

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
engineers at super massive and they've

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.680 
engineers at super massive and they've
come<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:26.829> with<00:03:26.919> this<00:03:27.099> system<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.690> genuinely

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
come up with this system that genuinely

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.580 
come up with this system that genuinely
I<00:03:28.780> don't<00:03:28.959> think<00:03:29.079> I've<00:03:29.169> seen<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.409> any<00:03:29.530> other

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
I don't think I've seen in any other

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.069 
I don't think I've seen in any other
game<00:03:29.829> now<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.599> other<00:03:31.720> thing<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.900> we've
