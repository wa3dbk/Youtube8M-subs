you got a to cory catfish to algae

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.740 
you got a to cory catfish to algae
eaters<00:02:28.599> algae<00:02:29.260> down<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:30.610> live<00:02:31.120> plants

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
eaters algae down all live plants

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.509 
eaters algae down all live plants
another<00:02:32.260> bio<00:02:32.530> wheel<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.040> one's<00:02:33.220> bigger<00:02:33.430> than

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
another bio wheel this one's bigger than

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.229 
another bio wheel this one's bigger than
the<00:02:33.819> one<00:02:34.180> below<00:02:35.340> yeah<00:02:36.340> got<00:02:36.700> some<00:02:36.880> duckweed

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
the one below yeah got some duckweed

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.729 
the one below yeah got some duckweed
floating<00:02:37.630> up<00:02:37.750> there<00:02:38.040> let's<00:02:39.040> check<00:02:39.340> out<00:02:40.739> sort

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
floating up there let's check out sort

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.490 
floating up there let's check out sort
of<00:02:41.800> plan<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.660> won't<00:02:43.660> sprout<00:02:43.870> off<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.200> big<00:02:44.350> one

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
of plan I won't sprout off the big one

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.039 
of plan I won't sprout off the big one
in<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.650> back<00:02:44.940> got<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:45.970> redness<00:02:46.360> see<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.900> not

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
in the back got a redness see it's not

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.130 
in the back got a redness see it's not
doing<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.650> good<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:49.269> one's<00:02:49.480> right<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:49.959> the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
doing so good this one's right in the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.900 
doing so good this one's right in the
current<00:02:50.650> my<00:02:50.860> buddy<00:02:51.130> said<00:02:51.310> that's<00:02:51.459> pretty<00:02:51.670> bad

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
current my buddy said that's pretty bad

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.440 
current my buddy said that's pretty bad
so<00:02:52.920> bio<00:02:53.920> wheel<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.549> don't<00:02:54.850> think<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.269> best

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
so bio wheel I don't think is the best

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.210 
so bio wheel I don't think is the best
for<00:02:55.720> planted<00:02:56.049> tanks<00:02:56.380> because<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.950> how<00:02:57.069> much

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
for planted tanks because of how much

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.280 
for planted tanks because of how much
air<00:02:57.430> flow<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:58.000> want<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.510> water<00:02:58.750> flow<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.110> has

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
air flow it I want you water flow it has

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.140 
air flow it I want you water flow it has
so<00:02:59.739> all<00:02:59.920> my<00:03:00.040> only<00:03:00.340> plants<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:00.940> side<00:03:01.120> of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
so all my only plants on this side of

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.100 
so all my only plants on this side of
the<00:03:01.209> tank<00:03:01.920> want<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.220> wilt<00:03:03.549> away<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.269> this<00:03:04.840> side

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
the tank want to wilt away and this side

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.830 
the tank want to wilt away and this side
of<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.290> tank<00:03:05.470> they<00:03:05.739> want<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.130> flourish<00:03:06.840> so

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
of the tank they want to flourish so

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.199 
of the tank they want to flourish so
it's<00:03:08.200> almost<00:03:08.349> like<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.950> keep<00:03:09.130> fake<00:03:09.970> on

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
it's almost like I have to keep fake on

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.750 
it's almost like I have to keep fake on
this<00:03:10.420> side<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.930> real<00:03:11.920> on<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.250> side<00:03:12.489> but<00:03:12.730> I

over here I got some right there's my

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.539 
over here I got some right there's my
live<00:03:50.650> Brian<00:03:51.299> live<00:03:52.299> black<00:03:52.690> worms<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:54.100> food

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
live Brian live black worms on food

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.699 
live Brian live black worms on food
bacteria<00:03:55.269> flurries<00:03:55.720> from<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.930> plant<00:03:56.200> some

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
bacteria flurries from the plant some

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.710 
bacteria flurries from the plant some
food<00:03:56.980> for<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.280> bottom<00:03:57.609> feeder<00:03:57.819> some<00:03:58.209> prime<00:03:59.310> no

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
food for the bottom feeder some prime no

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.470 
food for the bottom feeder some prime no
no<00:04:01.720> bubble<00:04:02.290> diffuser<00:04:02.650> took<00:04:03.459> that<00:04:03.639> out<00:04:03.670> so<00:04:04.299> no

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
no bubble diffuser took that out so no

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.620 
no bubble diffuser took that out so no
sandstone<00:04:05.760> didn't<00:04:06.760> want<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.060> put<00:04:07.239> air<00:04:07.389> stone

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
sandstone didn't want to put air stone

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.840 
sandstone didn't want to put air stone
in<00:04:07.780> there<00:04:07.870> because<00:04:08.220> too<00:04:09.220> much<00:04:09.340> oxygen<00:04:09.549> in<00:04:09.790> the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
in there because too much oxygen in the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.449 
in there because too much oxygen in the
water<00:04:09.880> kill<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.329> plants<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.010> figured<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
water kill the plants so I figured the

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.220 
water kill the plants so I figured the
plants<00:04:12.790> alone<00:04:13.000> will<00:04:13.180> provide<00:04:13.480> enough<00:04:13.750> oxygen

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
plants alone will provide enough oxygen

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.120 
plants alone will provide enough oxygen
for<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.440> fish<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.840> buy<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> wheel<00:04:17.139> plenty

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
for the fish to buy a wheel plenty

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.729 
for the fish to buy a wheel plenty
enough<00:04:18.250> oxygen<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.599> that's<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.870> guys<00:04:19.930> hope<00:04:20.620> you

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
enough oxygen so that's it guys hope you

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.270 
enough oxygen so that's it guys hope you
like<00:04:20.919> them<00:04:21.039> see<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.120> later
