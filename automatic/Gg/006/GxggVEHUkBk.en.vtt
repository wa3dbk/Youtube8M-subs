00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.470
 and motional was made for the 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.210
 aesthetic and wellness institutions that 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.420
 they want to offer their customers 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.429
 an enormous added value to manual skills 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.400
 highly professional of its own 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.739
 masseurs and beauticians with all the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.630
 relaxation comfort of a treatment 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.090
 at 360 degrees 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.820
 I go to regenerating combinations of 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.710
 colors from the warmth of the water and has one 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.599
 surface able to accommodate the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.020
 customer's body in a hot 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.760
 hug distributing in weight 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.010
 supporting it with a graded push e 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.740
 counteracting the force of gravity 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.720
 a big bull fought match 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.910
 especially in the first part in the 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.680
 first half of the race however also in the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.130
 second, however, you played it 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.250
 quite well unfortunately 22 events a 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.650
 po these two avoidable failures that 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.500
 they then led to these two goals 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.010
 close the last 15 minutes 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.729
 yes I think you have centered the analysis in the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.200
 first time in my opinion in a game in 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.280
 a first time however balanced e 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.130
 fought 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.140
 we had the best goal balls 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.689
 where we could not be cynical 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.100
 be concrete in the second half below 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.899
 the appearance of the dribble came out 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.250
 a little bit more juventus but 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.590
 however it was foreseeable for us 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.079
 because we played with so many absents that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.960
 two games in a row over 4 5 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.329
 days since we can't play 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.890
 they could pay something but sorry 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.630
 because the goals of juventus came 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.140
 from they came from two of our naivety 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 which surely we could avoid here 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.729
 instead from the point of view of the scheme and after 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.069
 distant game system you played 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.619
 with a defense of 5 compared to yours 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.020
 usually due injury form you asked 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.349
 disposition who grandfather or own 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.510
 to go for a moment to parry but the 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.210
 choice 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.580
 in the first place it was made for absence of 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.830
 external because however it was barbarous 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.950
 having returned from Brazil he had done two 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.560
 workouts and therefore was not in 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.300
 condition to be able to play more than 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.040
 ten minutes a quarter of an hour Parisian 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.570
 he was with the national Amedeo era 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.040
 injured and therefore in ours 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.900
 module surely then we will have made a 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.450
 bit of effort and we went to do the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.400
 choice of playing mirror against 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.040
 of them and I think it was anyway 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.890
 apt because juventus think that 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.200
 removed those two situations did not have 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.490
 never worried gomis and corra michael 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.980
 on the post of the second half you will have done 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.200
 a little angry at the branch instead a little more 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.390
 turned off usually because of the injury 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.460
 at the ankle he reported after the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.990
 in short, Russia is still something 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.950
 bad luck of services was definitely 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.100
 when you take a pole 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.230
 if at a whisker from the goal and therefore there is 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.770
 but this kind of regret is also 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.980
 true that 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.570
 to score goals and cannot be appealed to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.820
 bad luck but we need to be more precise 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.730
 don't be more concrete and we love today not 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.220
 you could ask for more because from 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.420
 when he returned from the national team 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.330
 real workouts had made them 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.680
 practically zero therefore also approved 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.290
 before the game to see if there is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.770
 he could make his teeth tight then 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.790
 certainly in the aspect 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.530
 intensity could not be achieved 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.940
 ask for more 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.070
 next week the game will be played 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.000
 return race a race that will be played 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.270
 I then win at Juventus and maybe 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.950
 will aim to make a 2 to 0 in the race e 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.160
 then go to overtime you can 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.660
 be possible but look at calculations later 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.250
 such a result cannot be achieved 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.040
 you can only do one 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.569
 finding that we have nothing to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.670
 lose and that Florentine Rome 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.409
 rome florentine rome milan il milan 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.239
 had won 2 at 0 the home game 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.579
 Roma made three goals so I think that 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.900
 in football everything is known and possible 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.730
 right that we believe in it until 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.490
 end however it goes 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.160
 we will go there to honor 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.810
 the performance because of two lost derbies 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.760
 maybe we didn't deserve to lose either 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.330
 one thanks to moreno longo 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.330
 thanks to you
