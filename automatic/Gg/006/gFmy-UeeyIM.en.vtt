00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
of the way here so that you could

possibly click these two buttons by

possibly click these two buttons by

accident so that's it that's a good
thing<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.859> think<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.689> one<00:02:54.689> of<00:02:54.719> those<00:02:54.870> things
