00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.940
 hello girls, how are you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 good as some may have seen us 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.640
 make a drawing in my whole belly 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.920
 weekend 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.070
 the people donate already made kinder egg already 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.410
 made a frog I've done several things more 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.660
 so today is a Thursday 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.130
 only the 34-week editor will then 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.660
 missing weekend for both the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 drawing that we want to do 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.190
 So we decided to do it today as it is. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.239
 holiday and you're home and we're 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.340
 do nothing 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.620
 We decided to go ahead with a drawing. 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.640
 make one today and one Sunday do the other 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.379
 also 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.239
 and then I'll be filming for you guys 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.160
 bit of him drawing in my 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.280
 belly does not shoot the whole drawing 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.079
 because for you to have a notion is final 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 last week I think it was us 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.969
 made a frog for example looks simple 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.770
 You look like this, you look super beautiful. 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.899
 of all that we have done it seems 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.359
 a simple drawing but in this drawing 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.610
 Simple, it took us three hours. 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.979
 so the video would be too long 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.799
 and exhausting so I'm going to shoot only a few 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.360
 pieces of the egg kinder we made 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.610
 It was on Easter Sunday we started 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.100
 at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and finished nine 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.420
 hours of the night so it seems 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.729
 simple but it is not 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.460
 is the line is you pint have to wait 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.340
 and then you have to erase some 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.670
 I'm sorry, that painting again is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.070
 exhausting but worth it is the creative 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.689
 It's something different that is something that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 when with time we go 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.509
 having memories will look at our 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.540
 cool 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.090
 Anyway, I advise anyone who has 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.189
 someone to point to do the same 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.250
 girls who ask me several times 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.140
 What ink do I use and use gouache paint? 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.540
 It does not hurt, it does not smell, I asked. 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.939
 my doctor and she released and also 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.090
 question if a bride he arts he was 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.100
 painter did not girls him and he did not know 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.049
 I could not draw 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 That's when we got started. 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.350
 first drawing was simpler was to 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.750
 basketball ball 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.099
 so he just counted on orange and made a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.170
 black risk 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.240
 He was so cool, so handsome. 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.560
 sounding like a ball he ended up 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.330
 catching taste 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.209
 and then each on each weekend that 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.790
 It was happening and it was the profession. 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.310
 making is more difficult drawings 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.470
 And then I'll show you he paints in the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 my belly for you to see have a 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.250
 more or less how he does it 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.250
 I hope you like the video 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.420
 This is one more than the people. 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.420
 O 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.080
 All right then 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.420
 O 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.030
 All right then 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.140
 ae 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.430
 O
