00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:10.500
 How to attract the attention of men to women 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 When you start playing and even in terms of how 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.170
 woman you will not adapt to the cliché, somehow think 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.070
 that is so accepted that so fashionable, God forbid! 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.350
 I speak now of banality. 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.190
 I don't think you do that, but just when you really 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.940
 understand what you are, you will stand on your pedestal and say: 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.410
 “I am so! 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.880
 I am a woman! 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.079
 Here is my diamond! ” 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:49.699
 Face your facets to shine with a decent diamond. 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.239
 That's when it is your man, exactly your 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.979
 a man will be much faster to isolate you among others 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:57.979
 women 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.799
 I'm not an analyst, but nonetheless, I'm a marketer. 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.659
 Marketer, this is about promotion, this is about competition, we 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.689
 We will talk with you today. 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.302
 Of course, in real life, and especially online, huge 

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:16.140
 competition, especially around successful men. 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.039
 I will tell you how to win it, how to win it. 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.609
 Do not win, but win the competition. 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:27.270
 But nevertheless, I want to say, you can win then, 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 when you play on your strengths. And 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.859
 play, it means 80% of its resource is temporary 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:45.909
 and life to invest only in their 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:46.909
 strengths 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.039
 Please put a plus sign, who deals 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.540
 self-development, personal growth, meditation, some 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.729
 Eastern practices, trainings and so on. 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.880
 You are great because it is a natural need. 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.390
 human according to Maslow's pyramid evolve. 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.690
 This is normal. 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.830
 How we start developing ourselves. 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.750
 Very often we start to feel ourselves and think 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.080
 I'm kinda good here. 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.970
 But with the time management I have a problem. 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.530
 Something I have over time, I can not manage it. 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.000
 We must learn to manage, to be even steeper. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.290
 Move, talk. 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.220
 Who thinks so? 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.220
 Oh! 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.790
 I do not really have something with oratory .. 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.220
 I don’t really need to present my art 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.220
 develop. 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.220
 See what happens. 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.630
 You are focused on your weaknesses with your head. 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.981
 and say, I still have a plug there, a plug there .. that's it 

00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:57.200
 everything needs to be tightened. 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.980
 That is, you go not from your strength, as a rule, but go 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.560
 from their weaknesses, weaknesses 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.940
 . And it often alienates you 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.590
 from being able to succeed as quickly as possible. 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.700
 Well, as taught in school. 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.700
 Yes, as in school. 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.470
 You need to know and mathematics, and Russian, and everything you need to know. 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.020
 And in the end, do not understand why you came. 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.980
 But this is the approach of our basic school. 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.450
 Because in America, there from school are taught 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.070
 child determine his strengths. 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.070
 Be able to present yourself. 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.550
 Therefore, there, in the west, a number of corporations 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.660
 because there people know what they have to go to. 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.330
 April! 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:54.290
 20% in weaknesses and 80% in strengths. 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.900
 This means you need to find your destination, your sphere, 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.200
 where you are so good and strong. 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.770
 And you will See where it comes from, you need to develop strong 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.830
 parties. 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.010
 Play even harder. 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.620
 And the weak, they catch up. 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.390
 Weaknesses will never become strong. 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.600
 There is a concept of team. 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.400
 You can build a team and take a person stronger. 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.880
 All the top managers of the company, what do you think is just 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.500
 so After all, not the gods burn pots. 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.750
 Every person has strengths and weaknesses, 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.960
 but only those who know their strengths have learned 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.360
 play them. 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.360
 They are upstairs. 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.010
 And they overlay their weak team. 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.030
 And that's all. 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.740
 Here you have all the secret secret. 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.050
 Now let's see how this applies in life. 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.840
 Take any example from marketing. 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.340
 Chocolates Kit-kat, Snickers and how many of them still have these 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.740
 chocolates. 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.740
 A bunch of. 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.370
 Let's look at the packaging that is written there. 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.540
 Our chocolate .. 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.740
 Remember this: our trains are the most trains 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.900
 in the world. 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.130
 Remember this one? 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.680
 Our chocolates are the most chocolate and our waffles are the most wafer. 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.710
 and the most crunchy. 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.820
 And our powder washes ... and our toothpaste is 12 ways 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.090
 teeth whitening whitening 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.290
 Do you understand what's the truth? 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.260
 Never on the powder will write: Careful! 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.660
 If you wash and put the powder 2 times more 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.980
 you get a hole right no one is coming 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.540
 In life, take an example, our Alla Borisovna Pugacheva 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.310
 our favorite singer who is a smart singer 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.570
 stage mastery voice soul. 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.450
 The way she plays songs and music is super. 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.180
 Well, what do you think, how much time she invested 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.930
 in your art? 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.470
 What is the time in your life? 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.570
 All 80, and maybe 90%. 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.169
 But, understand, Alla Borisovna never tried to us 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.780
 prove that she can become a prima ballerina 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.050
 Bolshoi Theater. 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.260
 She could do it. 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.450
 She could: "No, I will become a prima ballerina ..." And not 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.450
 would never have. 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:16.090
 Now you are very heavy, forgive me. 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.840
 Girls who taught math or physics will understand me 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.950
 at school or at college. 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.370
 You know, it is often said, we have in the Soviet Union 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.290
 leveling, we have no individuality and so 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.889
 further and now God is difficult for us to give something ...
