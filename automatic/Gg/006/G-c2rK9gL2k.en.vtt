like everyone's actually turned

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.430 
like everyone's actually turned
invisible<00:02:16.700> since<00:02:17.270> last<00:02:17.480> time<00:02:17.720> last<00:02:18.500> time<00:02:19.240> yeah

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
invisible since last time last time yeah

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.350 
invisible since last time last time yeah
it<00:02:21.440> wasn't<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.090> time

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
it wasn't like that but this time

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.210 
it wasn't like that but this time
everyone's<00:02:23.870> invisible<00:02:24.410> which<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.830> pretty

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
everyone's invisible which is pretty

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.620 
everyone's invisible which is pretty
cool<00:02:25.990> actually<00:02:26.990> no<00:02:27.140> they're<00:02:27.260> not<00:02:27.320> anymore

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
cool actually no they're not anymore

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.080 
cool actually no they're not anymore
maybe<00:02:29.500> they<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:29.680> all<00:02:29.950> had<00:02:30.160> invisibility

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
maybe they just all had invisibility

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.640 
maybe they just all had invisibility
potions<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:31.960> something<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.380> then<00:02:32.500> they

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
potions on or something and then they

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.710 
potions on or something and then they
decided<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.220> know<00:02:33.310> what<00:02:33.340> I'm<00:02:34.180> gonna<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:34.660> it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
decided you know what I'm gonna take it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.770 
decided you know what I'm gonna take it
off<00:02:34.960> now<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:36.160> guess<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.180> maybe<00:02:37.390> it's<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.570> for

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
off now I guess it maybe it's just for

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.330 
off now I guess it maybe it's just for
the<00:02:37.840> beginning<00:02:38.140> bit<00:02:38.320> that's<00:02:38.740> probably<00:02:39.130> why

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the beginning bit that's probably why

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.570 
the beginning bit that's probably why
I'm<00:02:40.000> not<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.330> too<00:02:40.450> shabby<00:02:40.720> not<00:02:41.530> too<00:02:41.980> shabby<00:02:42.370> at
