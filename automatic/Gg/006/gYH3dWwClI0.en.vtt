00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
that night and if I do that in the power

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.840 
that night and if I do that in the power
and<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.260> bat<00:02:52.830> speed<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.340> last<00:02:53.520> step<00:02:53.580> is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
and the bat speed and the last step is

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.090 
and the bat speed and the last step is
there<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.990> answer<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.500> watching<00:02:56.040> this

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
there so the answer is watching this

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.590 
there so the answer is watching this
