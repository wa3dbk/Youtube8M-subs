intimate environment and I think the

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.210 
intimate environment and I think the
experience<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.680> share<00:02:29.980> together

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
is one that's it's quite special really

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.729 
is one that's it's quite special really
and<00:02:33.040> there's<00:02:33.700> not<00:02:33.879> a<00:02:33.909> lot<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.299> trust<00:02:34.739> between

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
and there's not a lot of trust between

and there's not a lot of trust between
each<00:02:36.489> other's<00:02:36.790> ability<00:02:37.209> because<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.930> isn't
