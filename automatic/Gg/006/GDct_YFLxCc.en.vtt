supposed to resemble then we have this

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.440 
supposed to resemble then we have this
one<00:02:30.040> which<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.610> launch<00:02:30.790> weekend<00:02:31.209> and

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
we've seen this art before this land art

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.619 
we've seen this art before this land art
and<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:36.459> don't<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.849> what<00:02:37.030> land<00:02:37.299> is<00:02:37.420> going<00:02:37.569> to

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
and I don't know what land is going to

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.990 
and I don't know what land is going to
be<00:02:37.750> my<00:02:37.959> guess<00:02:38.799> would<00:02:39.099> be<00:02:39.159> I<00:02:40.019> would<00:02:41.019> say<00:02:41.409> one<00:02:41.709> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
be my guess would be I would say one of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.240 
be my guess would be I would say one of
these<00:02:43.000> choir<00:02:43.269> lands<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.409> it<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.620> also<00:02:44.709> be

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
these choir lands but it can also be

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.819 
these choir lands but it can also be
that<00:02:45.970> potential<00:02:46.840> enchantment<00:02:47.409> land<00:02:47.590> that

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
that potential enchantment land that

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.039 
that potential enchantment land that
people<00:02:48.129> have<00:02:48.220> been<00:02:48.340> talking<00:02:48.519> about<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:49.450> could

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
people have been talking about it could

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.589 
people have been talking about it could
be<00:02:50.650> related<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.549> that<00:02:52.000> we<00:02:52.150> speculate<00:02:52.569> on

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
be related to that that we speculate on

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.670 
be related to that that we speculate on
before<00:02:53.040> what's<00:02:54.040> weird<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.760> it's<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.359> this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
before what's weird is that it's in this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.140 
before what's weird is that it's in this
Leviathan<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:58.829> gateway<00:02:59.829> or<00:03:00.099> something<00:03:00.819> it's

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
Leviathan a gateway or something it's

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.699 
Leviathan a gateway or something it's
really<00:03:01.569> strange<00:03:01.930> i<00:03:02.109> can't<00:03:02.290> tell<00:03:02.440> if<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.560> a

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
really strange i can't tell if it's a

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.280 
really strange i can't tell if it's a
horn<00:03:03.040> or<00:03:03.340> if<00:03:03.579> it's<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.879> worm<00:03:04.329> or<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:05.019> it's<00:03:05.170> a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
horn or if it's a worm or if it's a

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.050 
horn or if it's a worm or if it's a
gateway<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:05.980> kind<00:03:06.129> of<00:03:06.159> floating<00:03:06.639> in<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.849> sky

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
gateway it's kind of floating in the sky

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.119 
gateway it's kind of floating in the sky
and<00:03:08.099> it's<00:03:09.099> like<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.310> gateway<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.879> world<00:03:10.180> here

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
and it's like a gateway to a world here

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.710 
and it's like a gateway to a world here
don't<00:03:12.129> really<00:03:12.400> know<00:03:12.579> what<00:03:12.819> this<00:03:12.970> exactly<00:03:13.510> is

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
don't really know what this exactly is

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.680 
don't really know what this exactly is
it<00:03:14.170> looks<00:03:14.409> really<00:03:14.709> cool<00:03:15.159> but<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.760> don't<00:03:15.849> know

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
it looks really cool but I don't know

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.059 
it looks really cool but I don't know
how<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.900> speculate<00:03:17.410> about<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.739> besides<00:03:17.829> the

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
how to speculate about it besides the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.349 
how to speculate about it besides the
fact<00:03:18.220> i<00:03:18.370> think<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.699> is<00:03:18.849> going<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.180> be<00:03:19.269> an

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
fact i think this is going to be an

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.680 
fact i think this is going to be an
actual<00:03:19.510> land<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.319> in<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.489> set<00:03:21.699> whether<00:03:21.910> scry

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
actual land and in the set whether scry

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.129 
actual land and in the set whether scry
or<00:03:22.989> otherwise<00:03:23.379> but<00:03:23.980> my<00:03:24.459> bet<00:03:24.940> would<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.150> on<00:03:25.510> some

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
or otherwise but my bet would be on some

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.740 
or otherwise but my bet would be on some
sort<00:03:26.199> of<00:03:26.379> utility<00:03:26.829> land<00:03:27.299> then<00:03:28.299> here<00:03:28.540> we<00:03:28.569> got

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
sort of utility land then here we got

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.599 
sort of utility land then here we got
some<00:03:28.930> minotaurs<00:03:29.349> running<00:03:29.829> downs<00:03:30.099> and<00:03:30.340> stuff

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
some minotaurs running downs and stuff

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.629 
some minotaurs running downs and stuff
we've<00:03:30.790> seen<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.090> before<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.709> r<00:03:32.889> OS<00:03:33.400> I

we've seen this before this is I r OS I

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.610 
we've seen this before this is I r OS I

Civil<00:03:48.699> you've<00:03:48.790> seen<00:03:48.970> multiple<00:03:49.209> arts<00:03:49.660> of<00:03:49.750> him

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
Civil you've seen multiple arts of him

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.020 
Civil you've seen multiple arts of him
before<00:03:50.319> and<00:03:50.560> my<00:03:51.160> guess<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.579> he's<00:03:51.730> going<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:51.940> be

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
before and my guess is he's going to be

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.629 
before and my guess is he's going to be
red<00:03:52.269> white<00:03:52.569> even<00:03:53.049> though<00:03:53.230> he<00:03:53.680> has<00:03:53.799> grow<00:03:54.129> colors

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
red white even though he has grow colors

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.180 
red white even though he has grow colors
that<00:03:55.269> would<00:03:55.389> be<00:03:55.510> my<00:03:55.659> bet<00:03:55.959> just<00:03:56.349> because<00:03:56.739> the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
that would be my bet just because the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.360 
that would be my bet just because the
rule<00:03:58.060> walk<00:03:58.389> the<00:03:58.930> gruel<00:03:59.169> God<00:03:59.799> thing<00:04:00.129> has
