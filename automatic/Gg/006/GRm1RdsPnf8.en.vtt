00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
through this way along the side along

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.879 
through this way along the side along
this<00:03:25.920> side<00:03:26.209> goes<00:03:27.209> up<00:03:27.239> this<00:03:27.630> way<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:30.200> out<00:03:31.200> and

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.490 
stuff so I was like ah where did I put
it<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.239> I<00:03:53.299> just<00:03:53.450> aside<00:03:53.689> put<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:53.989> here<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.349> can

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
it so I just aside put it here and I can

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.490 
it so I just aside put it here and I can
actually<00:03:54.620> see<00:03:54.829> it<00:03:54.859> very<00:03:55.430> well<00:03:56.200> here<00:03:57.200> I'll<00:03:57.319> show

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
actually see it very well here I'll show

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:16.949 
actually see it very well here I'll show
you<00:03:57.530> how<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.859> works

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.009 

I'll<00:04:17.470> just<00:04:17.650> warm<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.370> bike<00:04:18.549> up

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
I'll just warm the bike up

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.320 
I'll just warm the bike up
so<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.889> bike<00:04:21.069> has<00:04:21.280> warmed<00:04:21.669> up

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.469 

gear<00:04:25.330> down

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:56.220 

so<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.139> changes<00:04:29.409> to<00:04:29.590> one

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:05.390 

so<00:04:57.270> that's<00:04:58.270> working<00:04:58.570> fine

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.139 

so<00:05:05.790> that's<00:05:06.750> where<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.050> goes
