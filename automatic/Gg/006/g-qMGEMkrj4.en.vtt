00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.899
 I think it's great that Cheryl Cole's America containers are once the 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.379
 driver 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.599
 if this to do that says agreed to the package 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.169
 restaurant of a 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.650
 the cinemas are running 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.019
 I watch the series and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.339
 and since 2004 at tankink he is certainly here the first episode one wants 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.249
 I have to do a little better here 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.570
 weather of the past days 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.130
 not really 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.440
 next to you there also sitting on the terrace enjoying the sun the sitting 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.070
 opponents of tomorrow 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.490
 what kind of competition just family 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.510
 the game management a similar duel in the latter 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.860
 three matches in a water card points 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.020
 it is close together 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.920
 in principle, a regular must be able to win 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.090
 show all matches stunned 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.350
 annual power of germany 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.350
 yes i think there is pretty 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.080
 yes actually a bit comparable 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.270
 there they can also suffer from a good one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.510
 the fast attacker owned 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.460
 it's about four more points 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.230
 like us to waste 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.950
 15 hours in hotels it doesn't matter 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.810
 next to each other than agreed collegiality exceed the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.130
 press the rivalry 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.180
 bit to get only in the dining room and insights 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.490
 against acquaintance 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490
 it's a very good one anyway 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 current season of mad scientist in addition to radio 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.250
 so who is more likely to eat together and so on 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.880
 as a separate sensation 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.100
 you have 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.100
 a supporter in particular fifty countries 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.100
 just as he waits with which simple 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.909
 Merksem muscles and in conjunction with a win that resigned not 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.850
 so a quantity was busy in one go 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 I get your legs 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.770
 along with his age 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.080
 at my age and memory every success finally 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.089
 since 2007 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.479
 3 jacket 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.749
 read on right now I am second best player and put it 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.989
 goes north and it is also a map and not the state 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.609
 then it gets out 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:26.129
 a nice match
