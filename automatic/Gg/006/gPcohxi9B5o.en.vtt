00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hello everyone, how are you welcome to me? 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.069
 channel today I want to make you this new 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.559
 recipe that I learned recently and is a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.799
 cod nucleus as you can see already 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.660
 I have my lador cow cleaned here 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.600
 I have a half sopita 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.700
 I have a peeled carrot cut in 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.340
 sliced five cloves of garlic 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.940
 and it does everything more 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.789
 of preferences with that this is so that 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.059
 error you have is red 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.280
 the white onion can can be red 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.210
 and cilantro 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.470
 let's use that red paprika to give 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.880
 the salt color 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.330
 olive oil the go 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.910
 and pepper we start by heating the 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.950
 cauldron and we're going to throw 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.650
 two spoonfuls of olive oil 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.340
 to take advantage of water ingredients 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.340
 has suffered 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.590
 so that these tools of changed from 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.440
 color that we can use it on the onion 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.690
 now he hopes that everything suffered well 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.800
 until the onion that someone squishy if 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.600
 well mariana 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.570
 I will follow the casting 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.500
 institution of olives and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.500
 carrots 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.600
 they throw him and I have all the mental 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 and they are looking for it and pepper to taste and 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.120
 that is suffering everything I'm going to 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.400
 do is throw the bucket in the middle and 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.650
 zepita 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.630
 now I will continue the instrument in 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.909
 red powder to give it color 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.190
 and move since we have suffered all 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.150
 you can see 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.150
 I'm going to throw 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.460
 Cod 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.310
 and that's how our beautiful mixture is 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.060
 first the water depends on the quantity 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.810
 in recife de ballestar and to prove to 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.090
 be if you lack you can throw it 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.209
 I 'm going to take four tourists that 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.580
 this will be the water of the action is that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.580
 he's 34 so show you wake up 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.620
 the mix we're not going to say they're 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.380
 like two glasses of water because this 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.220
 equals 2 lecce 4 then they are can 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.230
 be two bases of the soul of these normals 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.909
 and we let it boil and then shaman 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.909
 two rice bases 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:08.610
 you have to throw ajinomoto that's 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.570
 which is like the headquarters hall so that 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.840
 It dissolves easily and is much more comfortable 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.040
 If you do not have that they can use an engine 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.129
 final 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.810
 as you can see I already milk my glasses 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.060
 of rice and now 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.270
 I'm going to give him a little move and I'm going 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.520
 to let dry and when dry 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.440
 we are going to cover and I am going to teach 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.570
 the process goes down in the fire 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.000
 since our rice dry as they can 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.640
 see you are going to take 1 spoonful 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.340
 more than olive oil before making it 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.160
 his half and cover with garlic 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.260
 aluminum since we have covered high 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.660
 we are going to give you 10 or 15 minutes 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.350
 it depends on the fire and you have to be 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.470
 checking ok 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.880
 I leave them and after our 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.740
 result has arrived at the time of 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.900
 check our cod achievement 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.710
 As you can see it's almost ready but 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.850
 let's give them 5 more minutes so that 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.980
 finished cooking and our core of 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.400
 cod is ready and I'm going to 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.889
 accompany with tostones tradition 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.520
 Dominican and I already taught him 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.379
 this looks very nice I hope that 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.319
 let's wait for it to cool down a bit since 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:37.319
 from the other sides and we will move 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.610
 then we 're going to take it out we're going to 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.620
 crush and put it back 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.200
 YÃ³rvit shares are ready for everything 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.360
