you<00:01:35.580> can<00:01:35.760> get<00:01:35.939> from<00:01:36.330> getting<00:01:36.450> 300<00:01:37.350> kills<00:01:37.619> with

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
you can get from getting 300 kills with

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.710 
you can get from getting 300 kills with
the<00:01:37.979> base<00:01:38.250> version<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> hbr<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the base version of the hbr so if you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
the base version of the hbr so if you
get<00:01:39.840> 300<00:01:40.229> kills<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> you'll<00:01:41.189> unlock<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
get 300 kills of it you'll unlock the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.450 
get 300 kills of it you'll unlock the
average<00:01:42.570> Joe<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> basically<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.250> these

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
average Joe then it basically has these

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.490 
average Joe then it basically has these
same<00:01:44.729> stats<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.720> only<00:01:45.930> difference<00:01:46.290> being

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
same stats the only difference being

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.710 
same stats the only difference being
that<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.860> doesn't<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.549> increased<00:01:48.420> fire

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.310 
that it doesn't have that increased fire
rate<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.170> same<00:01:49.799> damage<00:01:50.009> profile<00:01:50.520> 40<00:01:50.970> 33<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.750> 25

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
rate so same damage profile 40 33 and 25

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.950 
rate so same damage profile 40 33 and 25
it<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> 3<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> 4<00:01:53.520> shot<00:01:53.759> kill<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> does<00:01:54.810> not

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it is a 3 to 4 shot kill but it does not

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.109 
it is a 3 to 4 shot kill but it does not
have<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.409> fire<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.979> has<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> base<00:01:56.640> fire

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
have that fire in it has the base fire

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.469 
have that fire in it has the base fire
rate<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.020> hbr<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.860> 625<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
rate of the hbr at 625 and then the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.020 
rate of the hbr at 625 and then the
first<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:01.020> being<00:02:01.200> at<00:02:01.490> 857<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:02.790> another

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
first for being at 857 but then another

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.749 
first for being at 857 but then another
downside<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.900> does<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.290> 20%<00:02:05.220> wider

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
downside is that it does have 20% wider

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.179 
downside is that it does have 20% wider
hips<00:02:06.060> spread<00:02:06.210> than<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.600> base<00:02:06.810> version<00:02:07.189> 10%

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:08.189 
hips spread than the base version 10%

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.309 
hips spread than the base version 10%
more<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> insanity<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.140> good<00:02:10.289> thing

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
more for the insanity but the good thing

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.320 
more for the insanity but the good thing
is<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.860> can't<00:02:11.130> put<00:02:11.370> any<00:02:11.610> optics<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
is that you can't put any optics that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.760 
is that you can't put any optics that
you<00:02:12.450> wanted<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:12.900> there<00:02:13.470> are<00:02:13.500> no

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you wanted it so there are no

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
you wanted it so there are no
restrictions<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.790> if<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.120> said

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
restrictions with this so if that said

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.680 
restrictions with this so if that said
guys<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.380> only<00:02:16.790> HBR<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.480> going

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
guys this is the only HBR that is going

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.470 
guys this is the only HBR that is going
to<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.960> 3<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> 4<00:02:19.800> shot<00:02:20.070> kill<00:02:20.100> HBR<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.300> like

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to be a 3 to 4 shot kill HBR just like

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.210 
to be a 3 to 4 shot kill HBR just like
the<00:02:21.630> insanity<00:02:22.200> although<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.800> won't<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.190> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the insanity although it won't have that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.950 
the insanity although it won't have that
same<00:02:23.580> fire<00:02:23.850> rate<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.300> there's<00:02:24.750> really

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
same fire rate and there's really

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.200 
same fire rate and there's really
nothing<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.800> add<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.310> attachments<00:02:27.090> or

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
nothing you can add to attachments or

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.030 
nothing you can add to attachments or
anything<00:02:27.480> it'll<00:02:27.960> make<00:02:28.110> up<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.440> deficit

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
anything it'll make up for that deficit

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.920 
anything it'll make up for that deficit
when<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.280> comes<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.760> rate<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.060> fire<00:02:30.240> but<00:02:30.270> if

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
when it comes to the rate of fire but if

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.390 
when it comes to the rate of fire but if
you<00:02:31.110> are<00:02:31.260> looking<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> makeshift

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
you are looking for a makeshift

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.180 
you are looking for a makeshift
alternative<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.570> HBR<00:02:34.020> insanity<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.980> can

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
alternative to the HBR insanity you can

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.370 
alternative to the HBR insanity you can
get<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> HBR<00:02:36.120> average<00:02:36.600> Joe<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.110> it'll<00:02:37.290> be

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
get the HBR average Joe and it'll be

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.650 
get the HBR average Joe and it'll be
basically<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.070> same<00:02:38.280> damage<00:02:38.580> profile<00:02:39.240> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
basically the same damage profile the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.510 
basically the same damage profile the
same<00:02:39.930> range<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.530> fact<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.920> little<00:02:41.220> bit<00:02:41.310> better

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
same range in fact a little bit better

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.970 
same range in fact a little bit better
range<00:02:41.880> than<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.210> HBR<00:02:42.720> insanity<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.500> it'll<00:02:43.890> be

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
range than the HBR insanity and it'll be

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
range than the HBR insanity and it'll be
a<00:02:44.010> weapon<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.550> get<00:02:44.730> rather<00:02:45.060> easily<00:02:45.480> as

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
a weapon you can get rather easily as

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.810 
a weapon you can get rather easily as
well<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.290> don't<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.830> get<00:02:46.950> lucky<00:02:47.280> from<00:02:47.760> a

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
well you don't have to get lucky from a

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.640 
well you don't have to get lucky from a
Supply<00:02:48.210> Drop<00:02:48.240> now<00:02:48.810> while<00:02:48.960> there<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.230> only<00:02:49.410> one

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
Supply Drop now while there is only one

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.470 
Supply Drop now while there is only one
weapon<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.460> use<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.880> be<00:02:51.030> just<00:02:51.330> like

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
weapon that you can use to be just like

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.870 
weapon that you can use to be just like
the<00:02:51.600> insanity<00:02:52.170> there<00:02:52.620> actually<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.580> ton<00:02:53.850> of

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
the insanity there actually is a ton of

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.580 
the insanity there actually is a ton of
weapons<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.570> use<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.140> will<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.410> very

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
weapons you can use that will be very

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.860 
weapons you can use that will be very
similar<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.400> HBR<00:02:56.970> bear<00:02:57.270> fist<00:02:57.540> which<00:02:57.720> I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
similar to the HBR bear fist which I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.030 
similar to the HBR bear fist which I
don't<00:02:58.020> really<00:02:58.140> know<00:02:58.290> why<00:02:58.410> any<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.890> guys

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
don't really know why any of you guys

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.830 
don't really know why any of you guys
would<00:02:59.520> want<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.760> emulate<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.300> one<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.570> has<00:03:00.660> so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
would want to emulate that one it has so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.570 
would want to emulate that one it has so
many<00:03:00.900> downsides<00:03:01.230> what<00:03:01.770> let's<00:03:02.310> learn<00:03:02.430> about

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
many downsides what let's learn about

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.970 
many downsides what let's learn about
the<00:03:02.700> HBR<00:03:03.210> bear<00:03:03.390> fits<00:03:03.600> really<00:03:03.780> quickly<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.590> HBR

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
the HBR bear fits really quickly the HBR

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.450 
the HBR bear fits really quickly the HBR

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
weapon itself now the bare fist really

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.740 
weapon itself now the bare fist really
shouldn't<00:03:29.310> be<00:03:29.490> an<00:03:29.730> elite<00:03:30.209> weapon<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.630> my

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
shouldn't be an elite weapon in my

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.470 
shouldn't be an elite weapon in my
opinion<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.590> has<00:03:31.650> these<00:03:32.010> same<00:03:32.310> stats<00:03:32.670> as<00:03:32.940> all

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
opinion it has these same stats as all

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.000 
opinion it has these same stats as all
of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> other<00:03:33.870> weapons<00:03:34.110> with<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> exclusion

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
of the other weapons with the exclusion

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.240 
of the other weapons with the exclusion
being<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.940> HBR<00:03:36.600> super<00:03:37.110> light<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> HBR

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
being the HBR super light and the HBR

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.940 
being the HBR super light and the HBR
LED<00:03:38.850> launcher<00:03:39.630> both<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.470> those<00:03:40.560> are<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.860> only

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
LED launcher both of those are the only

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.470 
LED launcher both of those are the only
ones<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.430> can't<00:03:41.730> really<00:03:41.910> use<00:03:42.090> because

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
ones that you can't really use because

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.480 
ones that you can't really use because
they<00:03:42.630> do<00:03:42.690> have<00:03:43.050> either<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.680> slower<00:03:44.220> rate<00:03:44.459> of

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
they do have either a slower rate of

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.660 
they do have either a slower rate of
fire<00:03:44.610> or<00:03:45.030> they<00:03:45.390> have<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.930> decreased<00:03:46.709> damage<00:03:47.520> at

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
fire or they have a decreased damage at

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.970 
fire or they have a decreased damage at
its<00:03:47.820> maximum<00:03:48.300> range<00:03:48.330> but<00:03:48.900> apart<00:03:49.650> from<00:03:49.800> those

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
its maximum range but apart from those

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.730 
its maximum range but apart from those
two<00:03:50.040> every<00:03:50.910> single<00:03:51.240> other<00:03:51.390> HBR<00:03:52.020> is<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.260> better

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
two every single other HBR is a better

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.800 
two every single other HBR is a better
substitute<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.580> has<00:03:53.700> better<00:03:54.000> snaps<00:03:54.450> across

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810

substitute it has better snaps across
the<00:03:54.990> board<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.830> if<00:03:55.920> you're<00:03:56.040> looking<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.400> have

the board so if you're looking to have

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.280 
the board so if you're looking to have
something<00:03:56.880> similar<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.330> HBR<00:03:57.810> barefaced

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
something similar to the HBR barefaced

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.530 
something similar to the HBR barefaced
you<00:03:58.980> might<00:03:59.160> as<00:03:59.280> well<00:03:59.340> use<00:03:59.640> every<00:04:00.180> other<00:04:00.300> one

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
you might as well use every other one

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.480 
you might as well use every other one
again<00:04:01.200> besides<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.740> super<00:04:02.070> light<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
again besides the super light and the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.310 
again besides the super light and the
LED<00:04:02.670> launcher<00:04:03.120> they<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.720> better<00:04:03.930> stats

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
LED launcher they have better stats

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.310 
LED launcher they have better stats
technically<00:04:05.070> than<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.520> HBR<00:04:06.270> barefaced<00:04:06.690> which

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
technically than the HBR barefaced which

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.449 
technically than the HBR barefaced which
is<00:04:07.440> kind<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.650> prophetic<00:04:08.040> because<00:04:08.130> it's<00:04:08.340> an

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
is kind of prophetic because it's an
