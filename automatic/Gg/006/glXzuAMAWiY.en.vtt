00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.080
 well as it is my custom 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.290
 I will teach the lights and sounds of this set 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.990
 with my room lights off there 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.690
 outside a deluge of 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.970
 biblical proportions but that's not 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.310
 import 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.590
 the lights and sounds of this set are 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.279
 activate by pressing a small button below 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.279
 when you tighten it, this happens 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.700
 it's like a power sound and you're 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.450
 lights are curious because they are not activated 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.280
 by a button but by the movement 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.360
 you tilt the hornet to the right 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.360
 pass this 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.290
 if you activate the lights and sounds of the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.400
 machine gun if it's to the left 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.400
 pass this 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.880
 simply the sounds of 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.950
 flight 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.820
 and something curious about this set 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.970
 that when 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.830
 active lights and sounds you have to 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.479
 wait for it to go off for a while because 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.780
 if you are moving and moving it will happen 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.780
 this 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.860
 and the worst is that he is hypersensitive to 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.090
 any movement surprise 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.760
 that a little time does not solve and well 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.640
 now let's go to the conclusion well 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.210
 let's conclude this being by qualifying first 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.910
 The mini fix excellent mini fix to the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.940
 less in my opinion they give you three new 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.330
 figures excellent figures very well 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.180
 detailed in a great color the others 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.100
 even though we had already seen them 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.520
 they are also excellent figures that do not 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.690
 wants an elite extra storm or a silo 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.410
 of this color the mini fixes take a 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.550
 10 now the vehicles the vehicles 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:11.709
 they are pretty well done but they have 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.900
 a defect have some inconsistency 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.360
 because if we start to analyze the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.910
 corner what's the point of having two 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.140
 machine guns up here and one here 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.780
 below they combined the hornet style of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.000
 halo 3 together with the one of halo wars the one of 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.330
 halo wars had the machine gun here 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.990
 down 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 and the halo 3 here is supposed to 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.480
 They should have put only one 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.960
 either the halo wars stay with the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.000
 halo wars design or with halo 3 a 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.160
 my opinion is more made to the design of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.820
 halo 3 has more characteristics of that 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.160
 halo so here they should put a 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.100
 missile launchers but that was going to 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.350
 interfere with the lights and sounds still 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.690
 well it's not bad I know I 'm not saying that 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.920
 it is wrong vehicle simply to be 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.770
 it was a bit handy with that as to the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.960
 ban for yesterday for those who do not remember 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.450
 maybe because they did not play it for 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.740
 anything in halo wars ever ever 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.960
 drive on it go for yesterday from here 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.390
 this is simply a turret and 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.020
 made tour is not a cabin so that 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.600
 go to a miniplay in the game the 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.350
 mini fix go on this good side the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.870
 pilots or the pilot rather goes here 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.300
 here between the pilot and this has no 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.250
 nothing to see I thought that 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.950
 and they're going to correct this because in the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.980
 first good for yesterday was the same but not 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.920
 they corrected it is something that I did not like 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.840
 a lot because it takes away takes away certain 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.010
 consistency to the vehicle 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.140
 still well redesigned but I do not 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.360
 liked that they did not put lights and sounds in 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.370
 he is supposed to also have 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.040
 put lights and sounds would have 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.800
 liked it more than they would have put the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.290
 cockpit on this side where they 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.319
 I say that it goes and that in this part there 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.410
 had lights and sounds minimal lights 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.329
 so that they will light up you are thorns or 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.549
 this little eye that is where 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.490
 That would have been great shoot him 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.700
 would have given an excellent touch to this 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.960
 however in September that it removes 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:34.070
 vehicles take 18 the price there in 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.060
 usa costs 69 dollars 70 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.870
 put it here in Mexico I do not know 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.870
 I still have not arrived I hope it is not but 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.090
 I do not suppose it does not take long to arrive but 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.530
 it may come here at a price of 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:54.320
 1500 pesos more or less is a price something 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.630
 reasonable they'll give good mini FICA 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.500
 in fact excellent mini fix and good 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.470
 vehicles however I think you can 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.180
 go down a little more to the price so much here 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:12.530
 As in the USA, the price also takes 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.539
 an 8 now weapons weapons are something 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.370
 that you will not be disappointed at all 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:21.410
 this set 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:25.280
 that new sword the pink as I laugh 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.650
 seriously but but well it's a 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.270
 new part of the set also brings a 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.870
 rifle Halo 4 as an excellent weapon 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.389
 in my opinion a storm rifle a 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.760
 Ador thorn in new design and 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.800
 As for psuv weapons, nss is not 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.010
 nothing bad the truth is that they varied 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.550
 quite arsenal and that I loved the 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.000
 weapons are carried a 10 and finally the 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.860
 lights and sounds 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.160
 what do I have to say about the lights and 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.680
 good sounds that are very few and that 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.700
 it becomes even annoying to have 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.590
 that handle lights and lights and sounds 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.330
 because they are hypersensitive not 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.810
 you can move the hornet a little bit without 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.000
 they activate may not seem very 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.330
 credible from this point of view because 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.290
 It is not the same to say what you see 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:23.230
 same but believe me it's something very annoying 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.870
 have to accurately measure your 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.120
 movements so that those 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.880
 lights and sounds 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.580
 leaving aside that are not bad but 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.730
 I feel that they could put some 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.040
 how many more maybe I do not know of a 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.230
 explosion or something like that because the truth 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.620
 it's very simple the lights and sounds of 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:47.449
 this set are not something fantastic the 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.379
 they are true 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:53.849
 the lights and sounds are also carried 18 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:56.699
 Total rating 8 out of 10 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:59.429
 it's not a bad being at all it's good to be 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:02.309
 not very very good set and neither excellent 

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:05.249
 but it's a good set they 're going to give you a 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:08.039
 corner of a bayern totally 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:10.439
 redesigned with lots of details and 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:13.020
 new mini fish we are mini fiction what 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:15.689
 what's more worth the set seriously 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.679
 they are great the arsenal is also 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:22.619
 quite pretty well though I think 

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:25.979
 that they could put more or more things 

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:28.679
 details or more commitment to this set in 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:31.979
 as regards the lights and sounds and in 

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:34.589
 As for the bayern, I'm an angel 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.719
