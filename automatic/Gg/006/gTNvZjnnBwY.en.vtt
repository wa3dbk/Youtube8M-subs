what<00:00:15.059> I've<00:00:16.550> put<00:00:17.550> everything<00:00:17.730> together<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
what I've put everything together to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.779 
what I've put everything together to
make<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.289> work<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:22.580> just<00:00:23.580> finally

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
make it work so I just finally

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.810 
make it work so I just finally
interesting<00:00:24.539> more<00:00:24.720> than<00:00:24.900> elephant<00:00:25.820> this

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
interesting more than elephant this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.999 
interesting more than elephant this
thing<00:00:27.890> which<00:00:28.890> looks<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.939> em<00:00:30.710> it's<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
thing which looks with em it's a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.380 
thing which looks with em it's a
redstone<00:00:33.000> update<00:00:34.460> attack<00:00:35.460> there<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
redstone update attack there so if you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.600 
redstone update attack there so if you
update<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.980> block<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:39.030> any<00:00:40.610> redstone

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
update this block with any redstone

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.160 
update this block with any redstone
signal<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.930> think<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> will<00:00:45.629> update<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
signal I think then it will update and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
signal I think then it will update and
it'll<00:00:46.410> pull<00:00:46.950> back<00:00:47.329> now<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.660> live<00:00:48.840> with

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
it'll pull back now you can live with

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.569 
it'll pull back now you can live with
pressure<00:00:49.289> plates<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> buttons<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
pressure plates and buttons and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.420 
pressure plates and buttons and
everything<00:00:51.620> all<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.739> stuff<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.190> thought

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
everything all that stuff I thought

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.610 
everything all that stuff I thought
think<00:00:53.820> you've<00:00:53.969> probably<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> detector<00:00:55.410> rails

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
think you've probably the detector rails

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.799 
think you've probably the detector rails
as<00:00:55.829> well<00:00:55.980> every<00:00:56.219> any<00:00:56.399> red<00:00:56.789> stone<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.390> bake<00:00:57.600> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
as well every any red stone or bake that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.979 
as well every any red stone or bake that
should<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.739> trigger<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.750> thought

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
should do it trigger it and I thought

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.240 
should do it trigger it and I thought
you<00:01:01.170> put<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.789> wire<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.589> which

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you put that wire that up to this which

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.310 
you put that wire that up to this which
is<00:01:07.700> in<00:01:08.700> fact<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.270> shall<00:01:09.600> turn<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> start

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
is in fact I shall turn the start

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.250 
is in fact I shall turn the start
there's<00:01:10.530> no<00:01:10.799> point<00:01:11.100> having<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.369> nun<00:01:11.520> short<00:01:12.260> this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
there's no point having a nun short this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
mo junk is going to get on trying to fix

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.609 
mo junk is going to get on trying to fix
it<00:01:29.640> from<00:01:30.020> big<00:01:31.020> youtubers<00:01:31.710> asking<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.759> so

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
it from big youtubers asking to so

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.960 
it from big youtubers asking to so
hopefully<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.829> gets<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.549> fixed<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.759> yeah

hopefully that gets all fixed so yeah
I've<00:01:39.689> wired<00:01:40.430> everything<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:42.079> so<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:46.939> acting

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
I've wired everything up so this acting

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.889 
I've wired everything up so this acting
like<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.240> door<00:01:48.960> opens<00:01:49.579> fly<00:01:50.579> through<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.909> or

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
like that door opens fly through it or

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.399 
like that door opens fly through it or
through<00:01:52.290> whatever<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> closes<00:01:54.409> then

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
through whatever and then it closes then

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.280 
through whatever and then it closes then
I've<00:01:55.590> got<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:56.009> wyd<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.719> there's<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.140> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I've got it wyd up so so there's two of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.560 
I've got it wyd up so so there's two of
these<00:01:58.380> things<00:01:58.680> one<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.159> each<00:01:59.250> side<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.570> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
these things one for each side of the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.230 
these things one for each side of the
corridor<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> rooms<00:02:02.520> you're<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.909> whatever

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
corridor in the rooms you're in whatever

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.370 
corridor in the rooms you're in whatever
you<00:02:03.540> want<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.810> call<00:02:04.020> them<00:02:05.509> open

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
you want to call them open

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.340 
you want to call them open
azhar<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.180> can<00:02:10.300> see<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.930> time<00:02:11.170> we're

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
azhar and you can see the time we're

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
azhar and you can see the time we're
just<00:02:11.470> finishing<00:02:11.710> off<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.460> is<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:17.370> a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
just finishing off what this is is a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.450 
just finishing off what this is is a
redstone<00:02:18.820> update<00:02:19.530> sector<00:02:20.530> through<00:02:21.310> go

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
redstone update sector through go

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.590 
redstone update sector through go
through<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.850> war<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:23.650> thing<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.920> send

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
through the war and this thing is send

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.890 
through the war and this thing is send
this<00:02:25.600> thing<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:27.010> splitting<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:28.420> signal

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
this thing it it's splitting the signal

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.430 
this thing it it's splitting the signal
so<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:30.640> one<00:02:31.290> pulse<00:02:33.060> your<00:02:34.060> fire<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.930> off<00:02:35.110> it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
so with one pulse your fire and off it

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.940 
so with one pulse your fire and off it
goes<00:02:36.220> splits<00:02:37.030> two<00:02:37.210> ways<00:02:37.390> one<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:38.080> short<00:02:38.560> pulse

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
goes splits two ways one a short pulse

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.840 
goes splits two ways one a short pulse
going<00:02:39.820> straight<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.050> door<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.370> open<00:02:42.520> it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
going straight to the door to open it

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.470 
going straight to the door to open it
straight<00:02:43.150> away<00:02:43.620> then<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.480> longer

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
straight away then you have a longer

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.880 
straight away then you have a longer
pulse<00:02:46.900> which<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:48.460> closes<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.360> after<00:02:50.140> after<00:02:50.470> its

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
pulse which it closes it after after its

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.420 
pulse which it closes it after after its
open<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:52.540> long<00:02:53.110> pause<00:02:53.500> will<00:02:53.860> still<00:02:54.130> be<00:02:54.280> going

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
open this long pause will still be going

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.900 
open this long pause will still be going
after<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.240> short<00:02:55.510> pulse<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.900> gone<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.670> then

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
after the short pulse is gone and then

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.210 
after the short pulse is gone and then
that<00:02:58.390> will<00:02:58.510> send<00:02:58.720> another<00:02:59.080> post<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.710> the<00:03:00.010> door

you<00:06:26.920> see<00:06:27.280> what<00:06:27.460> needs<00:06:27.670> to<00:06:27.940> them<00:06:28.120> if<00:06:28.660> you<00:06:28.930> will

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
you see what needs to them if you will

you see what needs to them if you will
try<00:06:29.320> to<00:06:29.380> build<00:06:29.620> itself<00:06:29.980> it's<00:06:30.550> actually<00:06:30.670> yeah

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
try to build itself it's actually yeah

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.830 
try to build itself it's actually yeah
what's<00:06:32.680> about<00:06:32.800> it<00:06:32.920> I<00:06:33.540> can't<00:06:34.540> think<00:06:34.630> of

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
what's about it I can't think of

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.620 
what's about it I can't think of
anything<00:06:35.050> else<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.620> say<00:06:35.800> or<00:06:36.040> do<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.640> do<00:06:37.450> with

redstone related things up right

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.830 
redstone related things up right
probably<00:06:44.920> doing<00:06:45.430> it<00:06:45.550> though<00:06:45.760> you'll<00:06:46.630> have

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
probably doing it though you'll have

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.180
