those<00:00:40.200> types<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> things<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.890> that's<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.520> area

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700

that we have to improve you think with
the<00:00:44.399> summer<00:00:44.640> conditioning<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.450> think<00:00:45.660> they

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the summer conditioning I think they

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.080 
the summer conditioning I think they
just<00:00:45.809> don't<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.590> guess<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> adjustment<00:00:47.879> from<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
just don't I guess the adjustment from a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
just don't I guess the adjustment from a
conditioning<00:00:48.750> programs<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.230> actual<00:00:49.590> practice

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
conditioning programs an actual practice

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.529 
conditioning programs an actual practice
is<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.340> much<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.550> radical<00:00:50.940> than<00:00:51.210> people

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
is so much more radical than people

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.540 
is so much more radical than people
thought<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.260> happens<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.160> think

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
thought I think what happens is I think

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.889 
thought I think what happens is I think
they've<00:00:53.640> done<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> great<00:00:54.059> job<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.449> summer<00:00:54.750> with

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
they've done a great job all summer with

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.529 
they've done a great job all summer with
conditioning<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.250> amazing<00:00:57.059> when<00:00:57.449> you

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
conditioning but it's amazing when you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
conditioning but it's amazing when you
add<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.930> mental<00:00:58.289> component<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.160> you're

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
add the mental component and you're

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.470 
add the mental component and you're
actually<00:00:59.430> trying<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.969> think<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.390> you're

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
actually trying to think and you're

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
actually trying to think and you're
trying<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> process<00:01:00.960> information<00:01:01.350> while

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
trying to process information while

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
trying to process information while
you're<00:01:02.340> tired<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:03.120> you're<00:01:03.239> just

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you're tired when you're just

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.579 
you're tired when you're just
conditioning<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.019> summer<00:01:04.199> you're<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
conditioning is summer you're just

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.380 
conditioning is summer you're just
working<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.040> physically<00:01:05.850> getting<00:01:06.119> better

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
working on physically getting better

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
working on physically getting better
that's<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.170> thing<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.439> when<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.710> got<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that's one thing but when you got to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
that's one thing but when you got to
combine<00:01:08.159> knowing<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> plays<00:01:09.299> know<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> snap

to learn we have to learn how to
practice<00:01:23.340> fast<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.780> fast<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> same

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
practice fast and think fast at the same

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.310 
practice fast and think fast at the same
time<00:01:26.240> only<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:27.990> some<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> things

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320

time only what are some of the things
you<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> guys<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> these

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you want you guys to get out of these

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.539 
you want you guys to get out of these
practices<00:01:30.570> its<00:01:30.780> speed<00:01:30.960> its<00:01:31.530> fundamentals<00:01:32.310> its

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
practices its speed its fundamentals its

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.480

technique<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.409> obviously<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
technique you know obviously you know I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.920 
technique you know obviously you know I
think<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.630> much<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
think you can get just as much out of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.660 
think you can get just as much out of
these<00:01:37.079> practices<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.950> with<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> pads

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
these practices you can do with the pads

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.219 
these practices you can do with the pads
on<00:01:38.850> because<00:01:39.090> again<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.960> don't<00:01:40.140> go

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
on because again we don't we don't go

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.810 
on because again we don't we don't go
live<00:01:40.500> very<00:01:40.829> much<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.130> don't<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.579> ground

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
live very much we don't go to the ground

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940 
live very much we don't go to the ground
a<00:01:41.939> whole<00:01:42.090> lot<00:01:42.240> anyway<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.829> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
a whole lot anyway so I think if you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.350 
a whole lot anyway so I think if you
take<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.460> mentality<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:45.210> these

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
take the right mentality with these

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.819 
take the right mentality with these
types<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.689> practices<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.409> walkthroughs<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
types of practices and walkthroughs and

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.350 
types of practices and walkthroughs and
things<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> lot<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
things like that you get a lot out of it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.969 
things like that you get a lot out of it
and<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> lot<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.770> can

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and get a lot out of it you really can

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
and get a lot out of it you really can
you<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.299> could<00:01:51.479> make

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you know that you know you could make

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.940 
you know that you know you could make
the<00:01:51.630> argument<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.110> could<00:01:52.229> practices<00:01:52.770> like

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the argument you could practices like

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.380 
the argument you could practices like
this<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.280> year<00:01:53.430> long<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> still<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this all year long and still have the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.609 
this all year long and still have the
type<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.570> success<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:56.840> look<00:01:57.840> impressive<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
type of success you look impressive to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.679 
type of success you look impressive to
you<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> first<00:01:59.009> day<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.880> tell<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
you in the first day you tell the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.639 
you in the first day you tell the
veterans<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> young<00:02:01.649> guys<00:02:02.479> I<00:02:03.560> think<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
veterans of the young guys I think the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.289 
veterans of the young guys I think the
defensive<00:02:05.159> line<00:02:05.189> looks<00:02:05.700> completely

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
defensive line looks completely

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.330 
defensive line looks completely
different<00:02:06.659> they<00:02:07.020> really<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.220> much

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
different they really do there's so much

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.420

more<00:02:08.580> explosive<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.050> sudden<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.800> their<00:02:11.160> body

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
more explosive and sudden and their body

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280

their body

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.259 
their body
opposition<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.010> much<00:02:14.159> different<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.790> you
