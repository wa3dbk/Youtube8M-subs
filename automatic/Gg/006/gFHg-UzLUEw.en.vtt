00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.899 
Australians over here this year the year
and<00:01:25.500> there's<00:01:25.650> max<00:01:25.830> max<00:01:26.100> half<00:01:26.310> he<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.759> say

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and there's max max half he was to say

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
and there's max max half he was to say
you<00:01:26.970> won<00:01:27.210> last<00:01:27.390> week<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.890> great<00:01:29.070> style<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you won last week in in great style and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
you won last week in in great style and
he<00:01:29.759> was<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> fairly<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.900> cruising<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> way

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
he was a fairly much of cruising the way

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.450 
he was a fairly much of cruising the way
again<00:01:31.710> he's<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> whitewater

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
again he's from the whitewater

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.249 
again he's from the whitewater
background<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.000> could<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.180> put<00:01:33.810> at<00:01:33.930> ease<00:01:34.049> in

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
background so it could be put at ease in

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.679 
background so it could be put at ease in
the<00:01:34.320> choppy<00:01:34.530> water<00:01:34.770> mm-hmm<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> know

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the choppy water mm-hmm well you know

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.999 
the choppy water mm-hmm well you know
what's<00:01:36.869> coming<00:01:37.110> straight<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.439> behind<00:01:37.740> them

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
what's coming straight from behind them

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.830 
what's coming straight from behind them
and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.250> think<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.759> won't<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.450> much<00:01:39.659> effect

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and I think that won't have much effect

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
and I think that won't have much effect
here<00:01:40.200> except<00:01:40.500> speed<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> times<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.759> make

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
here except speed up the times and make

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
here except speed up the times and make
for<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> tiger<00:01:42.420> finish<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> end<00:01:43.350> best<00:01:44.040> time

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
for a tiger finish at the end best time

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.730 
for a tiger finish at the end best time
in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> world<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.820> three<00:01:45.030> minutes<00:01:45.210> 22.4<00:01:46.170> 85<00:01:46.500> by

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
in the world of three minutes 22.4 85 by

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.160 
in the world of three minutes 22.4 85 by
max<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.310> 2011<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.750> probably<00:01:49.049> not

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
max off in 2011 so it's probably not

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.389 
max off in 2011 so it's probably not
going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.530> fast<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.130> could<00:01:50.280> get

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
going to get that fast but we could get

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.770 
going to get that fast but we could get
a<00:01:50.460> reasonable

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.289 

also<00:01:55.530> knife<00:01:55.680> nice<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.190> fast<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.119> looks

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
also knife nice and fast there it looks

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.990 
also knife nice and fast there it looks
like<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.750> un<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.040> picture<00:01:59.369> he's<00:01:59.610> been

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
like a un you in your picture he's been

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.550 
like a un you in your picture he's been
around<00:02:00.270> three<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:00.510> four<00:02:00.690> years<00:02:00.810> now<00:02:00.930> how's<00:02:01.440> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
around three or four years now how's the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.320 
around three or four years now how's the
coin<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> top<00:02:02.670> he's<00:02:02.880> won<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> couple<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
coin got to the top he's won a couple of

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.960 
coin got to the top he's won a couple of
gold<00:02:03.509> cups<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:03.930> hasn't<00:02:04.170> achieved<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:05.729> lot<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
gold cups but hasn't achieved a lot of

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.370 
gold cups but hasn't achieved a lot of
quotes<00:02:06.150> out<00:02:06.420> probably<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.930> Olympics<00:02:07.290> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
quotes out probably in the Olympics this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740 
quotes out probably in the Olympics this
year<00:02:07.440> but<00:02:08.190> apart<00:02:08.520> from<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.729> he<00:02:08.940> should<00:02:09.660> be

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
year but apart from that he should be

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.400 
year but apart from that he should be
sure<00:02:09.869> he's<00:02:10.020> only<00:02:10.140> 15<00:02:10.709> year<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:12.230> see<00:02:13.230> been

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
sure he's only 15 year and you see been

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.830

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
fully over there in Lane two if I always

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.960 
fully over there in Lane two if I always
think<00:02:16.380> back<00:02:16.620> many<00:02:16.920> years<00:02:16.980> ago<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.489> he<00:02:17.610> won

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
think back many years ago when he won

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.510 
think back many years ago when he won
his<00:02:18.090> gold<00:02:18.330> medal<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.440> k1000<00:02:20.160> at<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.340> time

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.490 
so again they find ways to get the
intensity<00:06:17.910> in<00:06:18.030> training<00:06:18.360> Hernandez<00:06:19.050> gustas

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
intensity in training Hernandez gustas

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.920 
intensity in training Hernandez gustas
and<00:06:19.800> he<00:06:20.039> was<00:06:20.550> down<00:06:20.849> to<00:06:21.090> compete<00:06:21.360> last<00:06:21.539> week<00:06:21.810> but

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
and he was down to compete last week but

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.270 
and he was down to compete last week but
he<00:06:21.990> had<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.110> bit<00:06:22.259> of<00:06:22.289> a<00:06:22.380> chest<00:06:22.620> infection<00:06:22.710> which

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
he had a bit of a chest infection which

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.670 
he had a bit of a chest infection which
probably<00:06:23.669> took<00:06:23.849> him<00:06:24.000> a<00:06:24.090> few<00:06:24.349> days<00:06:25.349> to<00:06:25.410> get

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
probably took him a few days to get

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.099 
probably took him a few days to get
everybody
