00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:07.359
 Hello to all of you guys Today I will teach you to make the Central perspective 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.070
 of a square-based pyramid We will start from a projection to arrive at 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.060
 a central perspective Usually only the top view is needed 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070
 of our solid But we for greater completeness we will use 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.079
 also the front view Let's put letters on it 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.610
 We draw a horizontal line (called the land line) which is a few centimeters away 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 from the pyramid We identify the optical cone thus finding the station point (which coincides 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 with the point of view), ie the point from which we are observing the object. 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.130
 We also trace the perpendicular to the horizontal line identifying the points pe p ' 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.820
 For a good perspective it is good that the perpendicular is included within the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.680
 perspective cone; that the distance between pv and the pp 'is included 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.310
 between one and a half times the XY distance and twice the XY distance. 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 [make hand gestures to indicate the extremes] Then we draw lines at 45 ° on the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 horizontal line, thus identifying the points PD1 and PD2, ie point of distance 1 and point 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 of distance 2 Now we project the vertices of our solid 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.299
 on the land line naming them. Draw lines at 45 ° that pass through 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.369
 the significant vertices of the solid and arrive on the land line. 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.180
 We also name these points. The preparatory phase is complete. 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.860
 Now place the horizon line LO which will determine the height at which we are observing 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.800
 the solid. To the side we report the land line LT e 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 the Horizon line LO at a distance appropriately multiplied by the scale of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.380
 magnification choice. In our case we use the 1: 1 scale therefore 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.970
 we use the same distance. Whenever it is necessary to multiply 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.970
 for the chosen scale this symbol will appear to remind you. 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.670
 We trace a perpendicular in the central area that identifies the points pe p ' 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.450
 We now measure the distance between the point b and the point p in projection e (multiplying 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.470
 for the scale) we report the point b also in perspective. Same procedure for i 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.160
 points a, h, c, d. Small letters (which are the projections 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.360
 of the solid) go on the LT while the two distance points PD1 and PD2 go 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.599
 put with the same method on the LO. From now on we will mainly focus 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:13.129
 on the perspective. We combine the points b, h, c with p since they were 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.670
 vertical projections in perspective. We combine with PD2 because in projection it was 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.189
 obtained from a line parallel to that of PD2. 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:36.930
 With these lines we can now get some points of the base of the pyramid. 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.930
 The point D is found both on the line b and on the line a so it will be found at their 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:54.279
 intersection also in perspective. Similar reasoning for the point b that yes 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.330
 located both on line c and on line a. Now join point d to point PD1 because 

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:10.710
 in projection it was obtained from a line parallel to that of PD1. 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.710
 With a reasoning similar to the previous one we find the points C and A. 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.270
 Now we only need the top of our pyramid. 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:38.659
 From point h we trace a vertical line indicating the height of the pyramid (here 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.860
 multiply again by the scale). Then we lead to escape. 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.860
 From the intersection of the diagonals on the ground we draw a vertical line that intersects 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.020
 the line just drawn in point V. Thus we find the vertex of our pyramid. 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.020
 By combining the vertices we have thus completed our pyramid with a square base in perspective 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.689
 central. Discuss if there is something you do not have
