 under these advised by what feelings was that so accompanied now on 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.989
 to write my book about yourself 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.549
 Oh, you know, I do not think so much about it 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.369

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.559
 The trigger was that many customers back then many that Raser man 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.769
 in the biography of them would like to know more and to know 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.669
 then gap came up to me 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.519
 today it is also with the agency 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.519
 In the fight talks said that's a biography after all 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.290
 and I say there is Hundertmarck why not 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.290
 and now I'm such a person 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.129
 Time itself that's normal car org 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.879
 St since I had stressed but modest while doing so much fun that I am in 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.380
 the next week 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.910
 I'm strong at writing 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 you know, I do not always have to agree 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.690
 I am a doer 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.950
 and I always have to pin a predicate on what I need it 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.870
 no business card on the stands Harald Glöckler director fashion designer times 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.000
 Picture sour 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.139
 authors 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.170
 I'm just happy getting ahead is not it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.960
 suffice 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.110
 and percent 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.460
 I am very happy I am very happy that I am here 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.540
 I am very happy that she should be in 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.520
 ARD will feel like it but per cassette society like Ken Follett 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.110
 and that I am standing here at li-tec as well as a really great one 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.590
 relocate hurt a little 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.700
 Great family said something because you look so familiar 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.670
 also feels very professional center professional 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.100
 work 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 should be said of her when at the book fair 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.830
 Sensation is and percent 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.340
 an institution is very very important and percent 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.840
 and therefore 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.340
 I am also excited about it 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.610
 on photo MIG Bank 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 I wrote my life once 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 APA arrived very well 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.149
 until now, the proof was a wild soprano 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.260
 single let 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.930
 Precision and operated came 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.980
 was mostly that they say my god my book in the not finished with it 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.790
 will have to 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.730
 a book that is interesting 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.270
 and they were baffled by the honesty it got me again 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.769
 «We are Opel» IMF about the honesty of her book 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.769
 Soft candidates that are getting worse every year 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.919
 I think that's important even if I do not agree to a book 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:21.609
 just to write my life » 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.979
 when people participate 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.289
 I would also like to let that be worthy tuner you can never say class 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:28.729
 c not of it I do not speak 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.509
 should I think then you should already be such a demolition of life dar 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:34.319
 to jump in 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.289
 and make it a little bit amusing 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.539
 That's why it's a guidebook 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.209
 Eater bit distraction from everyday life 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.379
 and 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.529
 also in the middle of a wink but also with seriousness 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.899
 Harald Glöckler as a creator is a big topic but there are also some 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:55.999
 Passages that not only have to contribute to the cheerfulness Momsen swallow per cent 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:03:00.370
 this and cut the writing about yourself also a bit of therapy 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.369
 self-therapy 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.129
 Professional chefs made the intention to do what Therapy wanted to do Thessa 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.179
 It is of course always as the processing that is clear whether it is up 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.419
 In any case, it's difficult to get everything as before because that's what you have 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.630
 which I wrote down Serbia as well as others 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.059
 Lünen will have to be the man had a big bag processing luck 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.659
 but in the team piece you have of course 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.369
 just just bury yes 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:30.259
 Sbisa as well as the unnecessary open buried Holger Eichele need the in 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.869
 Disentis I also have a few things buried 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.869
 I got that out for the end it was 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.229
 because of course you let go a bit further Obama 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.919
 I can only tell you it was actually worse than it is 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.099
 Although from Tamaris I did not want to write a full letter 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.089
 I want to overstrain the people in everyone has theirs 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:52.239
 issues 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.829
 and his worries 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.229
 it is supposed to be a book center itself the poor lord of all poor child 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.759
 and then mine can win then we can do ourselves Völler 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.589
 I tried that 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.829
 always from 6 o'clock to bring these stories 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.189
 this vision 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.199
 and the thing ISAF succeeded well but on the one hand 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.819
 Of course you have to write this childhood 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.509
 Percent of one year would have been the trigger for everything and the up 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:16.199
 People 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.769
 say «Since many women are themselves difficult circumstances comes whom 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.729
 children 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.729
 believe in yourself believe in his 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.809
 World spaces 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:28.550
 put them over 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.110
 every day is an age well-known to restart 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.539
 and there is anyway Niklas yesterday is Subway tomorrow is not there yet 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.289
 and everyone has the chance to create and the team and the courage needed there 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.069
 do 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.460
 and percent that should be on the bottom of this book 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.719
 What's that 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.099
 a from the point of view of Harald Glööckler, the most impressive thing about today is scarce 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.930
 that they do not impress me too much is that 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.840
 most impressive 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.840
 So it does not impress too much though 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:59.889
 the 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.469
 impressed me are particularly valuable 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.350
 is not 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.090
 give only the possible people 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.059
 then actually 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:09.300
 my joy of life that I got 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.639
 I'm not impressed by the weather 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.270
 merit me that the joie de vivre is the overlapping life 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.150
 the higher God has given the cosmos 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.830
 how to go with Unity 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.480
 would have come bullish 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.939
 Politics I would have done little at the farms 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.490
 Unity Mountain might have perished and I would like to continue suffering and that 

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:28.089
 say do not let it get you down 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.089
 Humor is when you laugh anyway and percent 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.939
 you can play a big role, "says Sassmann 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:34.909
 Humor does not lose 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.650
 I think so already 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.969
 Sandra already said that she is working on Schmidt on bass again 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.009
 what is so on their mind what they want to get rid of 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.250
 Well, more and more counselors are still per cent advice life-wisdom

 Becherbach l4 life wisdom to quake year wisdom of life and 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.179

 trick how to make yourself beautiful as arrived 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.629
 How do you get the men where you want them? 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.629
 but also serious issues percent mainly because of 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.400
 I reach mine 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.250
 the Beeke Ribar browser plugin turns on the most important thing, how do I achieve it 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.800
 and just always lift out of my experience 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:21.589
 I can do to make her life more beautiful, but the main point 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.069
 he renounces 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:25.720
 you are a princess and just like 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.990
 Do that as you discover it 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.719
 Encourage her to accompany her with Princess 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.139
 and get life as a princess and believe me 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.619
 "If the toe is called and not always so easy 

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:40.719
 in life and the Queen does not have to templates every day either 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:41.780

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.180
 and all that in the book are so quiet wisdom tells the women chambers 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.180
 Wörz and one percent leaves duets and percent 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.769
 I'm now further that he is there that the man but already 

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:53.449
 written a lot 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.919
 but it's just natural of course it's mainly for the women 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.169
 I want to encourage them 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.999
 No say percent 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:03.819
 into life as a gift 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.020
 even if it is sometimes difficult 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.490

 I'll go from that »is given with their everyday life with love 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.279
 not bad and good this time 

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:19.419
 So you can do it if that's just too successful like that 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.539
 Current book we get used to permanent guest so be on the Frankfurter 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:25.600

 I have it then it is great for the whole book writing and me 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.770

 I do not know that either 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.020
