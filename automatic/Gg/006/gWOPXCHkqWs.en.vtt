00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 good morning has finally arrived 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.309
 time to unravel the mystery and that is 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.620
 what i'm using at this time 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.559
 that my hedgehogs are coming this way 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 beautiful curly then a small premise 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.190
 last year if you remember I had 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.890
 cut your hair very short a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.560
 December and I will never do it again 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.859
 since then I haven't cut it yet 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 I never even ticked him then or 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 the tips especially after arrested 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.100
 obviously quite dry I have to go 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.320
 to tick at least 3 cm we say 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.090
 so surely when I cut the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.700
 dry part then they will be enriched again 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.610
 more because sometimes I see the tips 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.770
 do a little trouble keeping hedgehog but 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.620
 let's go to us because he doesn't feel like 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.110
 talk three hours and what i am 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 used in this period 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.460
 premise number two the product that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.190
 helps tenham curly hair and he from 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.370
 only that it works in the sense that it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 same sky effect both using 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 these two products consider linear me 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.930
 I do not know if you remember them the lara 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.330
 balsam I finished it last night instead for 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.869
 of shampoo is still there for 12 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.950
 applications that therefore a part is not 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.560
 with natural we say as products here 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.810
 that for example with this combined of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.549
 Here this products from this game ve 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.430
 I'll talk about it then I still want to try it 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.100
 however, little effect with 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.670
 natural flaxseed shampoo b today the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.470
 alone and sweet orange with rituals 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.030
 very comic irreplaceable balm 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.180
 active concentrate of of workshops 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.759
 so let's go to Tuscany then 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.040
 first of all super super essential 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.540
 then untangle the hair very well 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.510
 I leave the mask on the balm for 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.240
 quite a while then having the tips 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.210
 a little dry or precisely in this 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.850
 period I apply with damp hair 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.750
 still oil tripods on the tips a 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.050
 drop of limino that can be or oil of 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.850
 coconut for example monoi oil that I am 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.990
 finishing up lately I'm using 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.300
 this macadamia network or the killing o 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.250
 in treatment that I had found in the 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.680
 glossybox in the last 3 shells I have 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.770
 always applied on the tips a 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.590
 little bit of this oil that leaves a 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.130
 very good fragrance is not natural 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.810
 this I know that silicon, however, acer 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.180
 in the sense I'm really finding myself 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.560
 well a bit like the morocco us who of 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.660
 sure it's not a natural product but 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.790
 objectively it has a great smell is a 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.709
 nice effect on the hair so I 'm in 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.660
 phase not completely natural for i 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.120
 hair in this period 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.110
 let's move on to the product that makes me these 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.239
 curly and it is this foam guys ce 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.200
 this is the product we made it 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.300
 then months ago I had received a try 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.900
 these two products of this brand 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.320
 besitos who of you has the subscription 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.780
 glossybox knows what I'm talking about 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.830
 and I had received this balm without it 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.989
 rinse 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.940
 and then they sent me this mousse 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.209
 definition searches for quite a while not 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.590
 I used then belonged to the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.810
 low but without rinsing this I have it 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.049
 called just a couple of times and not me 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.630
 like so much in the sense that it weighs down 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.470
 I used my hair too much 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.290
 one time 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.020
 because having them really very dry 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.730
 returned from the sea after the balm I had 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.260
 still some knots had used some 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.290
 of this actually came me 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.180
 untangled well, however, I feel too many 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.850
 then I feel too heavy hair at 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.700
 I don't like the roof but I have a ladder and 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.710
 12 months so anyway I'll keep it until 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.570
 next year because it can have 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.910
 an alternative application to this 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.210
 bad for the hair but we'll talk about it 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:01.320
 this one year but the mythical and she and her 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:07.080
 is this fades this foam here makes me i 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:09.300
 thus defined curly hair and la 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.350
 nice thing is that the hedgehog remains in the 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.540
 meaning names only last only one day 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:19.260
 this is where this is the mystery 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.340
 unveiled where you can find it I don't know 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.220
 in the sense that I looked on the site and there 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.080
 they are sales points in the Brescia area 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.790
 so if you are of those parts there are 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.520
 a couple of hairdressers who sell it 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.980
 otherwise you can buy online 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.220
 I wanted to complete the work to make you 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.690
 see the difference more or less than 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.830
 normal blurs that we capture 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.120
 consider that these fructis a 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.900
 150 milliliters of product 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.880
 here is this instead it has 300 then 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.460
 is a professional product let's say it is 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.340
 also the very professional dimension 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.760
 big so it will last me quite a while and not 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.530
 I probably didn't lose the thread of 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.040
 what I wanted to say rather than if not 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.389
 it uses time I would show you but 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.210
 flight to make a mess 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:14.110
 you will find out if you buy it for 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.870
 curiosity that has a very consistency 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.930
 much more substantial than the others 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.560
 spume is there once put in hand 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.350
 and then taken to rework the hair 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.979
 the nuanced while god this of fructis 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:32.470
 and I don't know how many are almost evanescent 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.990
 instead it is not a cream but an effect 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.850
 compact cream unlike this one 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.340
 foam just once 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.979
 sprayed in your hand if you wanted to do 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.320
 so you feel really very very 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.990
 very compact and maybe this one 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.520
 compactness of the product than from this 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.539
 held to hedgehog 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.979
 I tried the company as usual 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.410
 making the old woman I tried to get me 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.350
 there are no discount codes 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.650
 succeeded however if you go on the site there is already 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:06.970
 an ongoing promotion and promotion 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:10.560
 it is therefore if you buy two products that 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.630
 can also be two spume you will have the 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.919
 15 percent discount if any 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.070
 purchased 3 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:20.320
 there is also a gadget I signed besitos 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.389
 but oh well but go to the site there 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.030
 all written maybe I put the 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.039
 information I retrieved below 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.139
 in the info box so if I was wrong 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.030
 read below for pretty good anyway 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.039
 we have unveiled the mystery 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:38.740
 this is the famous product a foam e 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:41.580
 to me it looks beautiful they seem almost made 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.830
 with the iron I washed them last night, not 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.960
 nothing is confusing to dry the diffuser 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.430
 this is the effect I'm glad of 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.760
 this fades with the find of the beautiful 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:54.090
 products are always happy 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.830
 let me know if you want to find it around 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:00.620
 there by you or if you plan to take if 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.620
 you have already tried it and bold touch
