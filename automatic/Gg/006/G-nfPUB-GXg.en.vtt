middle of my paper now I'm going to take
one<00:01:02.690> end<00:01:02.930> of<00:01:03.830> this<00:01:04.370> paper<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.000> fold<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.590> just

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
one end of this paper and fold it just

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.190 
one end of this paper and fold it just
to<00:01:06.800> where<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.100> top<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.370> this<00:01:07.790> gets<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:09.020> that

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
to where the top of this gets to that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.700 
to where the top of this gets to that
line<00:01:09.410> and<00:01:09.850> I'm<00:01:10.850> going<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.090> put<00:01:11.300> this<00:01:11.450> end<00:01:11.720> to

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
line and I'm going to put this end to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.390 
line and I'm going to put this end to
match<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.310> make<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:13.729> straight<00:01:14.660> and<00:01:15.400> then

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
match it to make it straight and then

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
match it to make it straight and then
I'm<00:01:16.520> going<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.700> crease<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.090> paper

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 

now<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> same<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
now I'm going to do the same with the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
now I'm going to do the same with the
other<00:01:30.060> side

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.580 

so<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:37.229> should<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.340> house

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 

then<00:01:44.280> you're<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:44.969> this<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
then you're going to take this and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:56.740 
then you're going to take this and
you're<00:01:45.719> going<00:01:45.929> to<00:01:45.990> fold<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.469> like<00:01:47.299> this<00:01:49.399> so

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.800 

so<00:01:57.750> now<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.620> look<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.760> like<00:01:59.910> this<00:02:00.180> in

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so now it just look just like this in

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.930 
so now it just look just like this in
the<00:02:01.170> tip<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.680> should<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.070> still<00:02:02.460> should

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
the tip of this should be still should

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.290 
the tip of this should be still should
be<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> line<00:02:04.190> now<00:02:05.190> we're<00:02:05.910> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> take

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
be on the line now we're going to take

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.600 
be on the line now we're going to take
the<00:02:06.510> corners<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:07.080> this<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:08.250> we're<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the corners of this and we're going to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.090 
the corners of this and we're going to
put<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.940> about<00:02:09.119> right<00:02:09.630> on<00:02:09.990> this<00:02:10.410> line<00:02:10.830> I'm

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
put it about right on this line I'm

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.630 
put it about right on this line I'm
going<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> make<00:02:13.100> I'm<00:02:14.100> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.340> put<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.550> on

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.589 
going to make I'm going to put it on
that<00:02:14.670> line

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.009 

okay<00:02:18.939> I'm<00:02:19.939> going<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.150> put<00:02:20.299> it<00:02:20.390> right<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:20.870> the

okay I'm going to put it right in the

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.420 
okay I'm going to put it right in the
middle<00:02:22.959> now<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.439> then<00:02:24.560> flip<00:02:24.889> it<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.219> do<00:02:25.310> the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
middle now and then flip it and do the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.340 
middle now and then flip it and do the
same<00:02:25.639> at<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.939> other<00:02:25.969> side

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.170 

you<00:02:29.920> want<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.400> barely<00:02:30.610> touching<00:02:31.150> the

you want to just barely touching the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.390 
you want to just barely touching the
other<00:02:31.560> corner<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.710> tip<00:02:33.040> should<00:02:33.250> be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
other corner of this tip should be

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.670 
other corner of this tip should be
touching<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:34.450> other<00:02:34.480> one<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:35.380> you're<00:02:35.590> going

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
touching the other one now you're going

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.110 
touching the other one now you're going
to<00:02:35.770> unload<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.580> make<00:02:36.730> sure<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:36.970> don't

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
that will ruin it then the stuff that's

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.800 
that will ruin it then the stuff that's
right<00:02:44.620> here<00:02:44.890> there<00:02:45.370> should<00:02:45.550> be<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> little<00:02:45.910> tab

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
right here there should be a little tab

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.690 
right here there should be a little tab
right<00:02:47.140> here<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:47.950> take<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.250> tab

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
right here and you just take that tab

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.059 
right here and you just take that tab
and<00:02:48.940> flip<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.300> over<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:53.800> look<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.070> that

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
and flip it over now just look like that

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.069 
and flip it over now just look like that
now<00:02:56.610> we're<00:02:56.909> going<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.060> flip<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.420> over<00:02:57.599> and

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.610 

we're<00:03:01.079> going<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.230> fold<00:03:01.439> it<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.709> half<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.480> just

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
we're going to fold it in half so just

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.030 
we're going to fold it in half so just
and<00:03:04.620> we're<00:03:04.799> going<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:04.950> crease<00:03:05.370> it
