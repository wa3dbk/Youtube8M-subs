essentially<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:02.090> that's<00:05:02.960> when<00:05:03.110> things

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
essentially and that's when things

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.450 
essentially and that's when things
started<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.560> change<00:05:03.650> and<00:05:03.920> then<00:05:04.070> i<00:05:04.160> shifted

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
started to change and then i shifted

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.880 
started to change and then i shifted
over<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.730> cash<00:05:04.910> game<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.510> i<00:05:06.110> wrote<00:05:06.350> i<00:05:06.560> stayed

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
over to cash game and i wrote i stayed

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
able to do so well is because i had a

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.550 
able to do so well is because i had a
goal<00:05:56.090> in<00:05:56.270> mind<00:05:56.450> you<00:05:56.690> know<00:05:56.780> i<00:05:56.810> wanted<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.440> do

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
that and eventually what ended up

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.430 
that and eventually what ended up
happening<00:05:58.820> is<00:05:59.270> I<00:05:59.480> didn't<00:05:59.960> want<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.170> go<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.320> law
