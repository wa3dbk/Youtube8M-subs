 hello kids how are you today 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.749
 I bring a new minecraft video as 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:12.160
 you see the title is a trick to duplicate 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:15.129
 or not emerald iron diamonds and 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.620
 wood wood too so good as 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:21.130
 you will see we are in the latest version in 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.530
 the last of all and well the trick is 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.690
 very very simple but at the beginning you can 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.600
 that costs you the first thing that we have to 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.490
 to do is to put the block of what 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.600
 we want deep I do it in diamond 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.520
 and we have to put it apply to put them 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.640
 put us in the box where I go to 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.940
 leave the block and replant it and 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.120
 as you will see it has come out ok if you do not 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.140
 you have understood , I explain it again 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.440
 you catch it and you put yourself in it 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.280
 where the block will come out and what 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.140
 planteas easy but it may 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.149
 you have to be very quick, it's worth it 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.149
 Well then I do it with wood 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.840
