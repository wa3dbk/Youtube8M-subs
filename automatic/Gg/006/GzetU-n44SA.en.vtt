[ music ] 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.810
 A Breath of Fresh Air in the Orion Nebula. 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.180
Presented by Science at NASA. 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.880
Take a deep breath. 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.360
You just filled your lungs with about a thousand billion, 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.030
billion oxygen molecules. 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.360
There are "oxygen bars" in California where you can 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.110
actually pay for a deep breath of "O-2," but in most places 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.620
on Earth, molecular oxygen is free and abundant. 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.830
The gas makes up almost 21 percent of our planet's 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.790
atmosphere and is ubiquitous. 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.770
Astronomers have just announced the discovery of this same 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.470
gas in outer space. 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.710
"Here on Earth, oxygen was discovered in the 1770s," says 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.250
Paul Goldsmith of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450
Early chemists called it "fire air" because of its 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.980
combustible properties. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.170
"But it has taken us more than 230 years to finally say 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.320
with certainty that this very simple molecule also exists 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.560
in space." Goldsmith led a team of astronomers who used the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.650
European Space Agency's Hershel Space Telescope to search 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.010
for signs of molecular oxygen in star-forming clouds. 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.850
Hershel senses far-infrared radiation invisible to the 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.520
human eye. 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.210
It just so happens that molecular oxygen can be seen at 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.540
these long wavelengths. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.770
Goldsmith's team found the telltale signs of "O-2" near the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.530
core of the great Orion Nebula. 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.360
The "2" in "O-2" is crucial. 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.780
The oxygen we breathe on Earth is diatomic - that is, two 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.180
oxygen atoms joined together to form a dumbbell shaped molecule.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.390
 Single atoms of oxygen are highly reactive and can even be corrosive.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.290
 But when you put two oxygen atoms together - (breath in) 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.860
aaaah (breath out) - it's a breath of fresh air. 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.570
Astronomers have long known that the reactive atomic form 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.170
of oxygen is abundant in the universe. 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.450
It is found in gaseous nebulae, the atmospheres of stars, 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.570
and many other places. 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.180
This new discovery by Hershel shows at long last that the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.090
familiar diatomic form of oxygen is out there, too. 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.790
Curiously, the oxygen found by Goldsmith's team is not a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.490
free-floating gas. 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.870
It appears to be mixed up in an icy frosting which coats 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.760
grains of space dust in the nebula. 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.870
"This explains where some of the oxygen might be hiding," 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.450
says Goldsmith. 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.450
"But we didn't find large amounts of it, and still don't 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.890
understand what is so special about the spots where we find it.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.340
The universe still holds many secrets." Star-forming clouds 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.000
tend to be dusty places, so there could be lots more O-2 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.460
hiding out there. 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.090
Goldsmith says the team plans to continue their hunt for 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.100
this familiar gas in other clouds beyond the Orion Nebula. 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.320
Out there, he knows, is an elusive whiff of Earth among the stars.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.078
