 hey people welcome to mine 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.180
 new youtube channel 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.719
 I start the 11 8 new from today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.650
 project the project is called 100 hard days 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.570
 to succeed we have the start date 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 the 11 8 and 20 14 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 today and the goal 19 november with the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:32.450
 German short course championships are 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:34.680
 All in all, 100 hard days 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.350
 I would like to introduce such a little bit 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.320
 as I am with these 100 days together 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.629
 designed my trainers 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.020
 we begin starting today with 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.200
 a five-week preparatory phase 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.780
 paired with country training and 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.289
 Water training what we do on land 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.570
 become 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.079
 It will be the main part of us first 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.530
 do a general athletic workout 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:05.180
 thx with hull presented run 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.380
 coordinative exercises 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.750
 balance exercises also uphill runs 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.540
 then we will ride in parallel 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 We will do that two to three times 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.670
 week in the water do not go there like that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 extensively exercise four kilometers 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.939
 about and the intensities 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.869
 are limited to 15 to 20 meters 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.150
 after this general 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.299
 Preparation phase follows the main phase 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.320
 which in turn will last for six weeks 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.549
 this is going to be a really tough hard phase 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.640
 there we endure with force 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.759
 Beginning strength endurance becomes very 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 exhausting after that we will be fast 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.220
 Power on it and become parallel 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.750
 plus six to seven water units 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.600
 do 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.509
 there we will increase the intensity to 20 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.549
 screw up to 50 meters high 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.310
 and all with a size of four 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.520
 to five kilometers 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.370
 if I have survived this phase 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.850
 then it is already slow on the form 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.190
 to 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.260
 to what the form still comes is one 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.040
 two-week training camp in the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.470
 autumn holiday 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.750
 There we will again at small 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.690
 climaxed with eight to nine times 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.560
 Water training the week and will be 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.790
 there the intensities on 50 to 100 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.370
 meter high screw just like that 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.100
 endurance series yes, too 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.620
 fast power series in the water 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.720
 In addition to turn landrÃ¤tin 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.630
 depending on how is the water training 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.060
 but allows the main aspect is there 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.030
 now on the water training this 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.340
 Training camps behind us then have 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.990
 really starts the catering that is 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.200
 the form escalation for the German 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.640
 short course championship infoportal there 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.320
 the whole then very individual 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.300
 Designed catering is a very 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.610
 individual process everyone has to 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.240
 otherwise prepare differently intensively 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.020
 work out 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.240
 but in general we can say 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.640
 want an explosive power we want the 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.640
 Achieve speed that we end up with 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:30.620
 our target can swim fast 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.030
 and then I'm sure I can go in 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.540
 wuppertal be successful 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.780
 I would do it in the course of the next one 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.680
 week my first videos 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.430
 present 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.190
 there it will be the fitness fitness 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.700
 kitchen give it country exercising with 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.640
 Water training will give it video 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.019
 give diaries because I still remember 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.360
 still open if not all 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.940
 We'll bet we'll be engineering 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.209
 Imagine videos in the water we will 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.790
 as well as an exercise of the week 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.650
 present your home so that 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.269
 Of course, it's exciting to watch the whole thing 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.010
 maybe you can if you 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.900
 floating're interested you a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.900
 could go into the water little 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.910
 imitate things we will also and from 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.590
 to present videos to teach 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:24.320
 I try the channel a lot 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.360
 I try to be too creative for the channel 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.760
 Design it for the audience 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.289
 it will be attractive until then 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.810
 with me it is going off hard now 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.120
 first jog and then tax training 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.560
 one hour or lasting place 1 at 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.169
 The tus still eat a small sushi 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.500
 give and later I turn on 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.400
 video where i have something about me 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.479
