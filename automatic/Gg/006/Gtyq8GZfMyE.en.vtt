effectively a bit of a cop-out way but
you<00:03:35.560> know<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.829> gets<00:03:35.979> the<00:03:36.190> kills<00:03:36.549> done<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.940> I'm

bit lucky they're two runs and I kind of

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.330 
bit lucky they're two runs and I kind of
use<00:03:39.849> my<00:03:40.060> friendly<00:03:40.870> my<00:03:41.620> kind<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:41.919> team's

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
use my friendly my kind of team's

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.949 
use my friendly my kind of team's
position<00:03:42.669> to<00:03:43.180> see<00:03:43.359> where<00:03:43.569> they<00:03:43.690> are<00:03:43.840> because

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.009 
where they are and where they're
spawning<00:03:45.699> is<00:03:45.940> going<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.120> be<00:03:46.209> basically<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
spawning is going to be basically the

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.689 
spawning is going to be basically the
opposite<00:03:47.290> side<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.560> where<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.280> team<00:03:48.519> are

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
opposite side of where the team are

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.099 
opposite side of where the team are
spawning<00:03:49.229> the<00:03:50.229> den<00:03:50.440> meeting<00:03:50.829> so<00:03:50.979> I<00:03:51.010> try<00:03:51.340> to

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
spawning the den meeting so I try to

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.539 
spawning the den meeting so I try to
kind<00:03:53.109> of<00:03:53.260> use<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.620> mini<00:03:53.769> map<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.220> my<00:03:54.340> advantage

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
kind of use the mini map to my advantage

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.949 
kind of use the mini map to my advantage
because<00:03:54.819> a<00:03:55.000> mini-map<00:03:55.359> I<00:03:55.479> find<00:03:55.690> really<00:03:55.840> helpful

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
because a mini-map I find really helpful

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.080 
because a mini-map I find really helpful
you<00:03:56.409> probably<00:03:56.709> know<00:03:56.889> or<00:03:57.159> maybe<00:03:57.579> don't<00:03:57.879> but<00:03:58.030> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
you probably know or maybe don't but the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.539 
you probably know or maybe don't but the
mini-map<00:03:58.389> if<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.169> get<00:03:59.349> counter<00:03:59.680> UAV<00:03:59.799> done<00:04:00.280> kind

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
mini-map if I get counter UAV done kind

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.309 
mini-map if I get counter UAV done kind
of<00:04:00.609> stuff<00:04:00.909> to<00:04:01.120> be<00:04:01.180> on<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.329> cycle<00:04:01.659> I<00:04:01.780> never<00:04:01.989> really

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
of stuff to be on a cycle I never really

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.500 
of stuff to be on a cycle I never really
do<00:04:02.470> as<00:04:02.650> well<00:04:02.829> so<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.310> like<00:04:03.609> to<00:04:03.699> use<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.849> mini-map<00:04:04.329> a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
do as well so I like to use a mini-map a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.390 
do as well so I like to use a mini-map a
lot<00:04:04.629> and<00:04:04.780> there's<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.049> mob<00:04:05.290> from<00:04:05.799> first<00:04:06.099> kill<00:04:06.280> to

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
lot and there's a mob from first kill to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.250 
lot and there's a mob from first kill to
last<00:04:06.549> kill<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:06.939> a<00:04:07.060> one<00:04:07.269> minute<00:04:07.419> like<00:04:07.659> 41

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
last kill it's a one minute like 41

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.860 
last kill it's a one minute like 41
which<00:04:08.919> is<00:04:09.040> basically<00:04:09.310> 100<00:04:09.549> seconds<00:04:10.090> or<00:04:10.269> 101

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
which is basically 100 seconds or 101

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.689 
which is basically 100 seconds or 101
seconds<00:04:11.319> you<00:04:11.409> can<00:04:11.530> go<00:04:11.650> 101<00:04:12.129> seconds<00:04:12.430> I'm<00:04:12.519> to<00:04:12.579> go

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
seconds you can go 101 seconds I'm to go

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.759 
seconds you can go 101 seconds I'm to go
on<00:04:12.790> my<00:04:12.909> streaker<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:15.370> that's<00:04:15.609> really<00:04:15.879> my

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
on my streaker so that's really my

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.499 
on my streaker so that's really my
tactics<00:04:17.769> or<00:04:18.009> tic<00:04:18.280> tacs<00:04:18.549> depends<00:04:18.970> on<00:04:19.090> which<00:04:19.479> way

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
tactics or tic tacs depends on which way

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.939 
tactics or tic tacs depends on which way
you<00:04:19.720> want<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.959> call<00:04:20.079> it<00:04:20.109> for<00:04:20.560> doing<00:04:20.739> well<00:04:20.859> on

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
you want to call it for doing well on

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
you want to call it for doing well on
this<00:04:21.070> map<00:04:21.250> kind<00:04:21.430> of<00:04:21.519> go<00:04:21.639> around<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:21.940> outside

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
this map kind of go around the outside

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.760 
this map kind of go around the outside
and<00:04:22.270> wait<00:04:22.539> for<00:04:22.750> people<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.050> run<00:04:23.229> straighten

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
and wait for people to run straighten

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.430 
and wait for people to run straighten
though<00:04:23.860> and

but I got to say the scars a really good
gun<00:05:36.890> because<00:05:37.070> once<00:05:37.310> you<00:05:37.430> get<00:05:37.520> specialist<00:05:38.030> you

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
gun because once you get specialist you

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.400 
gun because once you get specialist you
get<00:05:38.300> kicked<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:38.840> have<00:05:38.960> all<00:05:39.140> of<00:05:39.200> the

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
get kicked so you have all of the

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.990 
get kicked so you have all of the
proficiencies<00:05:40.100> but<00:05:41.000> when<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.390> have<00:05:43.000> sake

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
proficiencies but when you have sake

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.580 
proficiencies but when you have sake
kick<00:05:44.270> in<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:44.540> first<00:05:44.750> place<00:05:44.930> you<00:05:45.050> won't<00:05:45.350> get

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
kick in the first place you won't get

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.630 
kick in the first place you won't get
the<00:05:45.680> two<00:05:45.800> attachments<00:05:46.310> when<00:05:46.430> you<00:05:46.520> get

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
the two attachments when you get

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.010 
the two attachments when you get
specialist<00:05:47.030> phone<00:05:47.180> so<00:05:47.450> it's<00:05:47.600> probably<00:05:47.780> more

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
specialist phone so it's probably more

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.110 
specialist phone so it's probably more
useful<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.470> you<00:05:48.650> specialists<00:05:49.160> a<00:05:49.250> sort<00:05:49.940> of<00:05:49.970> two

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120

useful to you specialists a sort of two
attachments<00:05:50.720> and<00:05:50.840> then<00:05:51.260> when<00:05:51.440> you<00:05:51.500> get<00:05:51.620> all

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
attachments and then when you get all

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.440 
attachments and then when you get all
the<00:05:51.980> proficiencies<00:05:52.640> you<00:05:52.820> get<00:05:53.000> kick<00:05:53.270> as<00:05:53.419> well

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
the proficiencies you get kick as well

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.570 
the proficiencies you get kick as well
so<00:05:54.200> instead<00:05:54.560> of<00:05:54.620> using<00:05:54.740> kids<00:05:55.250> in<00:05:55.340> the<00:05:55.400> first

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
so instead of using kids in the first

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.220 
so instead of using kids in the first
place<00:05:55.700> and<00:05:55.910> not<00:05:56.000> tending<00:05:56.300> to<00:05:56.419> attachments<00:05:57.020> you

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
place and not tending to attachments you

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.020 
place and not tending to attachments you
use<00:05:57.950> two<00:05:58.130> attachments<00:05:58.580> in<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:58.669> first<00:05:58.910> place

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
use two attachments in the first place

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.170 
use two attachments in the first place
and<00:05:59.300> then<00:05:59.360> get<00:05:59.690> kik<00:05:59.930> so<00:06:00.260> you<00:06:00.320> kind<00:06:01.190> of<00:06:01.250> you<00:06:01.940> end

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
and then get kik so you kind of you end

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.120 
and then get kik so you kind of you end
up<00:06:02.390> with<00:06:02.510> more<00:06:02.660> proficiencies<00:06:03.350> at<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.890> end<00:06:04.010> of
