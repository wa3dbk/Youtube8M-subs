00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.990 

hey<00:00:01.199> folks<00:00:01.439> i<00:00:02.040> thought<00:00:02.460> i<00:00:02.490> would<00:00:02.669> show<00:00:02.850> off

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hey folks i thought i would show off

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.990 
hey folks i thought i would show off
another<00:00:03.750> design<00:00:04.110> i<00:00:04.140> made<00:00:04.259> in<00:00:04.470> Minecraft<00:00:05.000> it's

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
another design i made in Minecraft it's

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.789 
another design i made in Minecraft it's
actually<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.390> working<00:00:06.810> nuclear<00:00:06.960> reactor<00:00:07.589> with

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
actually a working nuclear reactor with

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.160 
actually a working nuclear reactor with
active<00:00:08.130> cooling<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.849> uses<00:00:09.179> two<00:00:09.360> mods<00:00:09.599> one<00:00:10.050> is

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
active cooling it uses two mods one is

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.930 
active cooling it uses two mods one is
Industrial<00:00:10.620> Craft<00:00:10.710> two<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.340> reactor<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
Industrial Craft two for the reactor and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.970 
Industrial Craft two for the reactor and
the<00:00:12.509> other<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.840> red<00:00:13.110> power<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
the other is red power to for the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.760 
the other is red power to for the
cooling<00:00:14.340> system<00:00:14.750> I've<00:00:15.750> seen<00:00:15.929> other<00:00:16.109> people<00:00:16.320> do

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
cooling system I've seen other people do

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.130 
cooling system I've seen other people do
similar<00:00:17.279> designs<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> didn't<00:00:18.840> come<00:00:18.930> up<00:00:19.020> with

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
similar designs so I didn't come up with

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.820 
similar designs so I didn't come up with
this<00:00:19.230> idea<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.699> design<00:00:21.740> for<00:00:22.740> this

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
this idea but it is my design for this

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.769 
this idea but it is my design for this
particular<00:00:23.250> reactor<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.359> thought<00:00:24.539> I'd<00:00:24.660> go

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
particular reactor and I thought I'd go

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.839 
particular reactor and I thought I'd go
and<00:00:24.869> show<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.109> off<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> start<00:00:28.670> I'll<00:00:29.670> give<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
and show it off so start I'll give a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.749 
and show it off so start I'll give a
quick<00:00:30.119> quick<00:00:30.539> overview<00:00:30.859> it's<00:00:31.859> composed<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
quick quick overview it's composed of a

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.270 
quick quick overview it's composed of a
few<00:00:33.180> buildings<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.200> control<00:00:35.070> room

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
few buildings this is the control room

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.850 
few buildings this is the control room
over<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.469> containment<00:00:37.469> structure

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
over here is the containment structure

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.979 
over here is the containment structure
for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.100> reactor<00:00:38.550> itself<00:00:38.840> here's<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
for the reactor itself here's the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.900 
for the reactor itself here's the
cooling<00:00:40.290> tower<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.829> back<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> small

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
cooling tower and back here is a small

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.580 
cooling tower and back here is a small
building<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.480> used<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.809> store<00:00:43.050> store

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
building that I used to store store

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.760 
building that I used to store store
power<00:00:44.930> still<00:00:45.930> work<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.230> progress<00:00:46.379> i'm<00:00:46.680> not

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
power still work in progress i'm not

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.500 
power still work in progress i'm not
completely<00:00:46.980> happy<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.059> way<00:00:48.239> everything

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
completely happy with the way everything

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.229 
completely happy with the way everything
looks<00:00:48.780> yet<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.670> operational

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
looks yet but what it is all operational

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.830 
looks yet but what it is all operational
so<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> good<00:00:51.719> shot<00:00:51.930> off<00:00:52.340> here's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> control<00:00:53.699> room

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
so a good shot off here's a control room

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.389 
so a good shot off here's a control room
it's<00:00:54.840> pretty<00:00:55.230> simple<00:00:55.440> there's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> two<00:00:56.129> buttons

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it's pretty simple there's a two buttons

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's pretty simple there's a two buttons
there's<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> start<00:00:56.910> reactor<00:00:57.270> button<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.750> then

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
there's a start reactor button and then

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
there's a start reactor button and then
there's<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> stop<00:00:58.440> /<00:00:58.710> reset<00:00:59.100> button<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> then

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
there's a stop / reset button and then

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
there's a stop / reset button and then
there's<00:01:00.300> various<00:01:00.420> status<00:01:01.410> indicators

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
there's various status indicators

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
there's various status indicators
indicator<00:01:02.609> lights<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.809> i<00:01:03.870> were<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> hit

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
indicator lights so if i were to hit

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.929 
indicator lights so if i were to hit
start<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> reactor<00:01:05.549> starts<00:01:05.790> up

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
start you can see the reactor starts up

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.679 
start you can see the reactor starts up
the<00:01:05.970> yellow<00:01:06.270> light<00:01:06.420> starts<00:01:06.659> blinking

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the yellow light starts blinking

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.270 
the yellow light starts blinking
sometimes<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> doesn't<00:01:07.830> blink<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
sometimes it doesn't blink that's a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.929 
sometimes it doesn't blink that's a
that's<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.790> lag<00:01:08.970> thing<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:10.400> but<00:01:11.400> anyway<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that's a lag thing but but anyway it

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
that's a lag thing but but anyway it
links<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:13.110> basically<00:01:13.470> indicating

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
links and that's basically indicating

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
links and that's basically indicating
the<00:01:14.130> three<00:01:14.340> actors<00:01:14.549> warming<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.060> which<00:01:15.869> really

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the three actors warming up which really

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
the three actors warming up which really
means<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.409> reactor<00:01:16.710> hasn't<00:01:16.950> started<00:01:17.130> yet<00:01:17.250> but

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
means the reactor hasn't started yet but

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
means the reactor hasn't started yet but
the<00:01:17.670> clone<00:01:17.970> systems<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.290> grain<00:01:19.530> means<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the clone systems on so grain means that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
the clone systems on so grain means that
the<00:01:20.100> reactor<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> now<00:01:20.640> generating<00:01:21.119> power<00:01:21.270> it's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the reactor is now generating power it's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.560 
the reactor is now generating power it's
being<00:01:22.020> cold<00:01:22.229> actively<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.360> there's<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
being cold actively and then there's a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.630 
being cold actively and then there's a
couple<00:01:24.689> other<00:01:24.810> indicator<00:01:25.290> lights<00:01:25.640> currently

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
couple other indicator lights currently

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
couple other indicator lights currently
I<00:01:26.670> actually<00:01:26.850> purposely<00:01:27.330> took<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.960> bunch<00:01:28.229> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
I actually purposely took a bunch of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
I actually purposely took a bunch of
water<00:01:28.619> buckets<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> system<00:01:29.610> which<00:01:29.909> is

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
water buckets out of the system which is

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030 
water buckets out of the system which is
what<00:01:30.180> used<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> call<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.380> cause<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> default

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
what used to call it to cause a default

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
what used to call it to cause a default
and<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.210> few<00:01:33.570> seconds<00:01:33.930> you'll<00:01:34.020> see

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
and so here in a few seconds you'll see

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.480 
and so here in a few seconds you'll see
that<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> reactor<00:01:34.829> will<00:01:34.950> detect<00:01:35.310> that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that the reactor will detect that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.280 
that the reactor will detect that
there's<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.820> enough<00:01:36.090> cooling<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.170> shut

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
there's not enough cooling it will shut

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.859 
there's not enough cooling it will shut
itself<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.680> as<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> safety<00:01:38.369> feature<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
itself down as a safety feature and the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
itself down as a safety feature and the
red<00:01:40.020> lights<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.350> begin<00:01:40.590> blinking<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:42.000> then

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
red lights will begin blinking and then

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.670 
red lights will begin blinking and then
also<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> blue<00:01:42.570> light<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:42.750> blink<00:01:42.960> which

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
also the blue light will blink which

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.870 
also the blue light will blink which
indicates<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> reactor<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
indicates that the reactor is going to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370 
indicates that the reactor is going to
be<00:01:44.970> cooling<00:01:45.360> still<00:01:45.630> even<00:01:46.020> though<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.229> shut

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
be cooling still even though it's shut

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.410 
be cooling still even though it's shut
off<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.640> kind<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.090> you're<00:01:48.240> saying

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
off so that's kind of what you're saying

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
off so that's kind of what you're saying
now<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.290> reactor<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.740> basically<00:01:50.159> said

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
now is the reactor is basically said

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.819 
now is the reactor is basically said
okay<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> don't<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.149> enough<00:01:51.329> cooling<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.829> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
okay I don't have enough cooling and it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
okay I don't have enough cooling and it
can't<00:01:53.310> operate<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.729> safe<00:01:53.880> conditions<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
can't operate in a safe conditions so it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.209 
can't operate in a safe conditions so it
shuts<00:01:54.659> itself<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.890> red<00:01:56.040> lights

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
shuts itself down and the red lights

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.130 
shuts itself down and the red lights
indicate<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.840> were<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:57.990> hit

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
indicate that so if I were to hit

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.319 
indicate that so if I were to hit
restart<00:01:58.469> now<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.070> doesn't<00:01:59.460> allow<00:01:59.820> me<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.060> start

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
restart now it doesn't allow me to start

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.240 
restart now it doesn't allow me to start
because<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.439> fault<00:02:01.710> conditions<00:02:02.100> along

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
because it's a fault conditions along

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.440 
because it's a fault conditions along
the<00:02:02.369> way<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> restart<00:02:02.880> at<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.149> point<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.420> I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the way to restart at this point is I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.630 
the way to restart at this point is I
have<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.659> reset<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.140> which<00:02:05.130> actually<00:02:05.280> stops

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
have to reset it which actually stops

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.550 
have to reset it which actually stops
the<00:02:05.759> red<00:02:05.880> lights<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.469> were

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the red lights and then if I were

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440 
the red lights and then if I were
restarted<00:02:07.950> again<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.610> would<00:02:08.789> probably<00:02:09.060> fault

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
restarted again it would probably fault

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.020 
restarted again it would probably fault
again<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.190> what<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.700> after<00:02:11.910> i

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
again so what I have to do is after i

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.260 
again so what I have to do is after i
restart<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
restart it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.880 
restart it
which<00:02:13.600> you'll<00:02:13.750> see<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.930> starts<00:02:14.170> starts<00:02:14.560> up<00:02:14.740> I'm

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
which you'll see it starts starts up I'm

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.560 
which you'll see it starts starts up I'm
going<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.070> run<00:02:15.130> over<00:02:15.190> here<00:02:15.490> actually<00:02:16.180> man<00:02:16.420> run

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
going to run over here actually man run

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.590 
going to run over here actually man run
down<00:02:17.260> here<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.000> circuitry<00:02:19.420> which

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
down here this is the circuitry which

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.480 
down here this is the circuitry which
I'll<00:02:19.720> explain<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.990> little<00:02:20.140> bit<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.500> but<00:02:21.250> i<00:02:21.280> need

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
I'll explain a little bit and but i need

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.400 
I'll explain a little bit and but i need
to<00:02:21.520> put<00:02:22.000> pockets<00:02:22.720> into<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.140> system<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.690> once<00:02:26.350> i

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
to put pockets into the system so once i

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.260 
to put pockets into the system so once i
put<00:02:26.530> buckets<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.100> chest<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.030> can<00:02:28.150> see

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
put buckets in this chest you can see

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.250 
put buckets in this chest you can see
they<00:02:28.390> immediately<00:02:28.540> start<00:02:28.930> getting<00:02:29.110> pulled

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
they immediately start getting pulled

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.560 
they immediately start getting pulled
out<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.650> being<00:02:30.100> fed<00:02:30.370> up<00:02:30.580> above<00:02:31.150> us<00:02:31.330> which<00:02:31.450> is

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
out and being fed up above us which is

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.420 
out and being fed up above us which is
where<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.780> reactor<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.260> actually<00:02:33.160> even<00:02:33.310> that

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
where the reactor is actually even that

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.980 
where the reactor is actually even that
that<00:02:33.700> number<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.970> buckets<00:02:34.090> isn't<00:02:34.480> enough<00:02:34.690> I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
that number of buckets isn't enough I

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.790 
that number of buckets isn't enough I
need<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.440> grab<00:02:36.070> another<00:02:36.690> stack<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.840> them<00:02:39.390> and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
need to grab another stack of them and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.110 
need to grab another stack of them and
to<00:02:41.800> put<00:02:41.950> those<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.430> there<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.820> should<00:02:43.030> be

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
to put those in there that should be

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150 
to put those in there that should be
sufficient<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.680> can<00:02:44.770> see<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.890> bunch<00:02:45.100> of

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
sufficient so you can see a bunch of

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.500 
sufficient so you can see a bunch of
buckets<00:02:45.430> are<00:02:45.520> headed<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.120> then<00:02:46.270> there's<00:02:46.450> a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
buckets are headed up and then there's a

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.270 
buckets are headed up and then there's a
bunch<00:02:47.110> coming<00:02:47.320> down<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.890> which<00:02:48.100> I<00:02:48.190> will

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
bunch coming down to which I will

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.940 
bunch coming down to which I will
explain<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.730> second<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:50.380> reactor<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.740> above

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
explain in a second the reactor is above

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.220 
explain in a second the reactor is above
us<00:02:51.070> it's<00:02:51.280> up<00:02:51.400> here<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.450> here<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:52.870> now<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.080> can

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
us it's up here and here and now you can

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.270 
us it's up here and here and now you can
see<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.410> reactors<00:02:53.680> kind<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.920> pay<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.070> steady

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
see the reactors kind of pay the steady

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.490 
see the reactors kind of pay the steady
state<00:02:54.370> there's<00:02:55.150> buckets<00:02:55.630> empty<00:02:56.110> buckets

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
state there's buckets empty buckets

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.200 
state there's buckets empty buckets
coming<00:02:56.740> from<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.010> reactor<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:58.000> tube

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
coming from the reactor and this tube

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.470 
coming from the reactor and this tube
being<00:02:59.050> fed<00:02:59.490> out<00:03:00.490> here<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.120> there's<00:03:01.300> full

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
being fed out here and then there's full

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.960 
being fed out here and then there's full
ones<00:03:01.630> coming<00:03:01.870> back<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.580> empty<00:03:03.820> ones

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
ones coming back and so the empty ones

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.580 
ones coming back and so the empty ones
actually<00:03:04.150> end<00:03:04.450> up<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.990> cooling<00:03:05.260> tower<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
actually end up in the cooling tower and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.770 
actually end up in the cooling tower and
act<00:03:05.680> up<00:03:05.800> this<00:03:05.920> wall<00:03:06.130> away<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.520> can<00:03:06.670> see<00:03:06.850> but

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
act up this wall away so you can see but

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.450 
act up this wall away so you can see but
they<00:03:07.870> end<00:03:08.020> up<00:03:08.110> in<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.350> deployer<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.250> the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
they end up in this deployer so the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.620 
they end up in this deployer so the
empty<00:03:09.640> buckets<00:03:09.910> come<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.180> they<00:03:10.390> get<00:03:10.540> filled

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
empty buckets come in they get filled

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.980 
empty buckets come in they get filled
with<00:03:10.780> water<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.640> filter<00:03:13.120> will

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
with water and then this filter will

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.380 
with water and then this filter will
immediately<00:03:14.680> pull<00:03:15.190> full<00:03:15.700> buckets<00:03:16.000> out<00:03:16.150> and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
immediately pull full buckets out and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.840 
immediately pull full buckets out and
send<00:03:16.630> them<00:03:16.720> back<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:17.830> can<00:03:18.070> see<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.280> once

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
send them back so you can see that once

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.310 
send them back so you can see that once
it<00:03:18.970> again<00:03:19.240> once<00:03:19.420> at<00:03:19.540> steady<00:03:19.780> state<00:03:19.930> there's<00:03:20.260> a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
it again once at steady state there's a

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.949 
it again once at steady state there's a
stream<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.620> empty<00:03:21.010> buckets<00:03:21.630> coming<00:03:22.630> from<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
stream of empty buckets coming from the

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.540 
stream of empty buckets coming from the
reactor<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.590> pulled<00:03:23.950> up<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:24.190> being<00:03:24.400> fed

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
reactor and pulled up it's being fed

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.690 
reactor and pulled up it's being fed
back<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.800> reactor<00:03:27.130> itself<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.580> up

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
back to it so the reactor itself is up

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.140 
back to it so the reactor itself is up
here<00:03:27.940> it's<00:03:28.720> composed<00:03:28.990> of<00:03:29.170> five<00:03:29.320> chambers<00:03:30.150> and

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
here it's composed of five chambers and

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.990 
here it's composed of five chambers and
the<00:03:32.050> way<00:03:32.340> reactors<00:03:33.340> work<00:03:33.490> in<00:03:33.640> Industrial

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
the way reactors work in Industrial

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.730 
the way reactors work in Industrial
Craft<00:03:34.120> two<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.540> pretty<00:03:34.720> much<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.200> top<00:03:35.440> row<00:03:35.709> is

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
Craft two is pretty much the top row is

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.490 
Craft two is pretty much the top row is
the<00:03:36.070> only<00:03:36.190> thing<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.550> allows<00:03:36.930> buckets<00:03:37.930> to

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
the only thing that allows buckets to

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.690 
the only thing that allows buckets to
the<00:03:39.930> if<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.380> was<00:03:41.560> an<00:03:41.680> empty<00:03:41.920> reactor<00:03:42.370> only

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
the if this was an empty reactor only

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.490 
the if this was an empty reactor only
the<00:03:42.790> top<00:03:42.910> row<00:03:43.120> would<00:03:43.270> have<00:03:43.750> buckets<00:03:44.050> sometimes

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
the top row would have buckets sometimes

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.320 
the top row would have buckets sometimes
I<00:03:44.620> see<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:44.830> second<00:03:45.130> row<00:03:45.220> will<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.490> a<00:03:45.520> few<00:03:45.790> but

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
I see the second row will have a few but

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.810 
I see the second row will have a few but
anything<00:03:46.600> beyond<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.050> gets<00:03:47.260> ejected<00:03:47.380> out<00:03:47.820> I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
anything beyond that gets ejected out I

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.850 
anything beyond that gets ejected out I
actually<00:03:49.330> don't<00:03:49.570> have<00:03:49.750> this<00:03:49.840> filled<00:03:50.110> uranium

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
actually don't have this filled uranium

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.620 
actually don't have this filled uranium
there's<00:03:51.040> some<00:03:51.520> other<00:03:51.610> cells<00:03:52.090> depleted

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
there's some other cells depleted

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.850 
there's some other cells depleted
isotope<00:03:52.990> cells<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.650> I'm<00:03:53.830> rien<00:03:54.070> reaching<00:03:54.370> them

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
isotope cells and I'm rien reaching them

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.290 
isotope cells and I'm rien reaching them
but<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:56.890> could<00:03:57.130> fill<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.400> with<00:03:57.550> uranium<00:03:58.060> and

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
but I could fill this with uranium and

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.670 
but I could fill this with uranium and
it<00:03:58.360> would<00:03:58.480> generally<00:03:59.140> deal<00:03:59.290> okay<00:03:59.500> if<00:03:59.620> I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
it would generally deal okay if I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.080 
it would generally deal okay if I
actually<00:04:00.010> right<00:04:00.190> now<00:04:00.340> this<00:04:00.520> current<00:04:00.850> design

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
actually right now this current design

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.000 
actually right now this current design
it<00:04:01.420> can't<00:04:01.690> handle<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:02.170> completely<00:04:02.770> filled

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
it can't handle a completely filled

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.640 
it can't handle a completely filled
reactor<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.550> would<00:04:03.670> still<00:04:03.970> overheat<00:04:04.620> but<00:04:05.620> I

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
reactor it would still overheat but I

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.990 
reactor it would still overheat but I
could<00:04:05.830> actually<00:04:05.950> modify<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.610> make<00:04:06.880> it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
could actually modify it to make it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.910 
could actually modify it to make it
handle<00:04:07.600> that<00:04:07.720> but<00:04:08.140> this<00:04:08.260> generates<00:04:08.620> plenty<00:04:08.860> of

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
handle that but this generates plenty of

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.530 
handle that but this generates plenty of
power<00:04:09.040> for<00:04:09.160> me<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.270> can<00:04:10.390> see<00:04:10.510> that

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
power for me but you can see that

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.240 
power for me but you can see that
there's<00:04:10.870> buckets<00:04:11.260> coming<00:04:11.560> in<00:04:11.680> fill<00:04:12.070> buckets

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
there's buckets coming in fill buckets

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.520 
there's buckets coming in fill buckets
and<00:04:12.580> then<00:04:12.670> they<00:04:12.790> immediately<00:04:13.530> water

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
and then they immediately water

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.070 
and then they immediately water
evaporates<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.160> they<00:04:15.250> get<00:04:15.370> pulled<00:04:15.580> out<00:04:16.080> and

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
evaporates and they get pulled out and

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.020 
evaporates and they get pulled out and
that<00:04:17.380> just<00:04:17.590> happens<00:04:17.830> over<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.070> over<00:04:18.130> again<00:04:18.340> so

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
that just happens over and over again so

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.250 
that just happens over and over again so
that's<00:04:19.180> constantly<00:04:19.540> cooling<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.900> reactor

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
that's constantly cooling the reactor

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.630 
that's constantly cooling the reactor
and<00:04:20.350> keeps<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.770> safety<00:04:20.950> condition<00:04:21.430> and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
and keeps it to safety condition and

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.010 
and keeps it to safety condition and
then<00:04:21.910> there's<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.150> bunch<00:04:22.330> of<00:04:22.419> buckets<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.840> are

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
then there's a bunch of buckets that are

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.990 
then there's a bunch of buckets that are
being<00:04:23.260> ejected<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.400> how<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.550> detect

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
being ejected and this is how I detect

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.780 
being ejected and this is how I detect
whether<00:04:25.180> the

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
whether the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.980 
whether the
actors<00:04:26.060> operating<00:04:26.480> in<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:26.600> safe<00:04:26.780> environment

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
actors operating in a safe environment

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.890 
actors operating in a safe environment
or<00:04:27.440> not<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:28.340> i<00:04:28.700> actually<00:04:28.970> have<00:04:29.240> water<00:04:29.450> here<00:04:29.540> and

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
or not so i actually have water here and

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.970 
or not so i actually have water here and
this<00:04:29.960> water<00:04:30.140> is<00:04:30.260> not<00:04:30.410> really<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.680> cooler

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
this water is not really the cooler

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.680 
this water is not really the cooler
reactor<00:04:31.370> all<00:04:31.460> that<00:04:31.580> does<00:04:31.730> help<00:04:31.910> it's<00:04:32.450> mainly

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
reactor all that does help it's mainly

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.030 
reactor all that does help it's mainly
to<00:04:32.870> keep<00:04:32.900> buckets<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.560> can<00:04:33.680> see<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:33.920> one

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
to keep buckets you can see that one

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.790 
to keep buckets you can see that one
kind<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.280> ended<00:04:34.610> up<00:04:34.700> on<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.940> pipe<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.570> tube

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
kind of ended up on the pipe of the tube

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.190 
kind of ended up on the pipe of the tube
and<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.950> keeps<00:04:37.130> them<00:04:37.220> from<00:04:37.340> getting<00:04:37.460> stuck<00:04:38.200> so

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
and it keeps them from getting stuck so

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.020 
and it keeps them from getting stuck so
what<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.350> want<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.980> any<00:04:40.310> ejected<00:04:40.730> buckets

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
what I want is the any ejected buckets

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.910 
what I want is the any ejected buckets
to<00:04:41.120> get<00:04:41.270> fed<00:04:41.450> back<00:04:41.690> down<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.140> get<00:04:42.410> recycled<00:04:42.650> in

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
to get fed back down and get recycled in

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.350 
to get fed back down and get recycled in
the<00:04:43.070> system<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.490> that's<00:04:43.640> what<00:04:43.760> these<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:44.270> can

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
the system and that's what these you can

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.840 
the system and that's what these you can
see<00:04:44.510> there's<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.830> floor<00:04:45.830> full<00:04:46.010> of<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.280> trans

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
see there's a floor full of the trans

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.490 
see there's a floor full of the trans
pleasures<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.390> bottom<00:04:47.660> which<00:04:48.290> actually

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
pleasures on the bottom which actually

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.280 
pleasures on the bottom which actually
take<00:04:48.770> any<00:04:48.920> buckets<00:04:49.130> and<00:04:49.430> send<00:04:49.580> them<00:04:49.640> back<00:04:49.700> in

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
take any buckets and send them back in

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.070 
take any buckets and send them back in
so<00:04:51.290> like<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.710> said<00:04:51.830> any<00:04:52.160> empty<00:04:52.460> but<00:04:52.760> any<00:04:53.080> ejected

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
so like I said any empty but any ejected

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.070 
so like I said any empty but any ejected
buckets<00:04:54.410> wind<00:04:55.130> up<00:04:55.250> down<00:04:55.310> here<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.750> they<00:04:56.960> get

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
buckets wind up down here and they get

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.350 
buckets wind up down here and they get
counted<00:04:57.500> this<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.890> night<00:04:58.670> of<00:04:58.790> detector<00:04:59.240> so

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
counted this is a night of detector so

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.480 
counted this is a night of detector so
anything<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.750> comes<00:04:59.930> thinking<00:05:00.620> comes

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
anything that comes thinking comes

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.910 
anything that comes thinking comes
through<00:05:01.610> these<00:05:01.730> tubes<00:05:02.540> and<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:03.530> get<00:05:03.650> counted

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
through these tubes and it get counted

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.340 
through these tubes and it get counted
here<00:05:04.130> so<00:05:04.520> let<00:05:04.670> this<00:05:04.760> this<00:05:05.180> item<00:05:05.720> detector<00:05:06.200> does

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
here so let this this item detector does

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.630 
here so let this this item detector does
is<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.530> pulses<00:05:06.860> every<00:05:07.010> time<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.220> bucket<00:05:07.490> goes

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
is it pulses every time the bucket goes

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.670 
is it pulses every time the bucket goes
through<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:07.910> and<00:05:08.420> this<00:05:08.840> pulse<00:05:09.110> ends<00:05:09.350> up<00:05:09.440> on

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
through it and this pulse ends up on

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.140 
through it and this pulse ends up on
this<00:05:10.040> counter<00:05:10.400> right<00:05:10.520> here<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:10.850> this<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.120> a

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
this counter right here so this is a

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.560 
this counter right here so this is a
headless<00:05:11.780> counter<00:05:12.050> set<00:05:12.260> to<00:05:12.650> 20<00:05:13.010> max<00:05:13.790> count<00:05:14.120> and

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
headless counter set to 20 max count and

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.630 
headless counter set to 20 max count and
so<00:05:15.020> it<00:05:15.140> increments<00:05:15.410> once<00:05:15.860> every<00:05:16.130> second<00:05:16.490> and

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
so it increments once every second and

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.740 
so it increments once every second and
every<00:05:16.760> time<00:05:17.000> I<00:05:17.060> bucket<00:05:17.360> goes<00:05:17.480> through<00:05:17.630> it

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
every time I bucket goes through it

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.230 
every time I bucket goes through it
basically<00:05:18.170> resets<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:18.770> decrements<00:05:18.920> by<00:05:19.280> 20<00:05:19.580> so

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
basically resets it decrements by 20 so

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.810 
basically resets it decrements by 20 so
so<00:05:20.770> what<00:05:21.770> this<00:05:21.860> effectively<00:05:22.280> does<00:05:22.490> is<00:05:22.700> it

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
so what this effectively does is it

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.970 
so what this effectively does is it
makes<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:23.120> so<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.270> if<00:05:23.540> there<00:05:24.230> isn't<00:05:24.530> a<00:05:24.590> bucket

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
makes it so that if there isn't a bucket

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.120 
makes it so that if there isn't a bucket
dejected<00:05:25.460> at<00:05:25.970> least<00:05:26.210> every<00:05:26.720> 20<00:05:27.170> seconds<00:05:27.560> then

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
dejected at least every 20 seconds then

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.860 
dejected at least every 20 seconds then
the<00:05:28.220> system<00:05:28.520> will<00:05:28.580> fault<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.120> each<00:05:29.690> other

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
the system will fault and each other

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.010 
the system will fault and each other
itself<00:05:30.140> down<00:05:30.260> so<00:05:31.480> just<00:05:32.480> because<00:05:32.570> a<00:05:32.720> bucket

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
itself down so just because a bucket

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.570 
itself down so just because a bucket
doesn't<00:05:33.260> get<00:05:33.350> ejected<00:05:33.560> doesn't<00:05:33.980> necessarily

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
doesn't get ejected doesn't necessarily

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.920 
doesn't get ejected doesn't necessarily
mean<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.850> reactors<00:05:35.210> going<00:05:35.360> to<00:05:35.450> explode<00:05:35.690> but

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
mean the reactors going to explode but

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.390 
mean the reactors going to explode but
it<00:05:36.050> does<00:05:36.170> mean<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:36.470> reactors<00:05:36.800> probably<00:05:37.250> not

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
it does mean the reactors probably not

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.430 
it does mean the reactors probably not
operating<00:05:37.940> in<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.090> safe<00:05:38.300> condition<00:05:38.600> and<00:05:39.290> so

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
operating in a safe condition and so

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.170 
operating in a safe condition and so
that's<00:05:39.590> why<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:39.800> shops<00:05:39.980> itself<00:05:40.250> down<00:05:40.400> and<00:05:40.940> so

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
that's why it shops itself down and so

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.720 
that's why it shops itself down and so
this<00:05:41.330> this<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:42.230> timer<00:05:43.160> right<00:05:43.310> here<00:05:43.460> is<00:05:43.550> set

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
this this this timer right here is set

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.610 
this this this timer right here is set
to<00:05:43.820> one<00:05:43.940> second<00:05:44.330> which<00:05:44.450> is<00:05:44.540> why<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:45.080> takes<00:05:45.350> 20

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
to one second which is why it takes 20

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.250 
to one second which is why it takes 20
seconds<00:05:45.980> for<00:05:46.190> that<00:05:46.310> to<00:05:46.430> occur<00:05:46.480> so<00:05:47.480> I<00:05:47.780> can

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
seconds for that to occur so I can

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.560 
seconds for that to occur so I can
actually<00:05:48.380> cause<00:05:48.650> that<00:05:48.830> to<00:05:48.920> happen<00:05:48.950> if<00:05:49.490> I<00:05:49.940> were

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
actually cause that to happen if I were

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.280 
actually cause that to happen if I were
to<00:05:50.780> take<00:05:51.200> this<00:05:51.440> pipe<00:05:51.980> out<00:05:52.510> and<00:05:53.510> now<00:05:53.900> buckets

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
to take this pipe out and now buckets

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.420 
to take this pipe out and now buckets
instead<00:05:54.590> of<00:05:54.650> getting<00:05:54.830> fed<00:05:54.980> back<00:05:55.130> in-system

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
instead of getting fed back in-system

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.100 
instead of getting fed back in-system
ejected<00:05:56.150> buckets<00:05:56.420> we<00:05:56.480> just<00:05:56.690> kind<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:56.870> falling

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
ejected buckets we just kind of falling

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.380 
ejected buckets we just kind of falling
on<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.290> floor<00:05:57.320> here<00:05:57.680> and<00:05:58.000> in<00:05:59.000> a<00:05:59.030> very<00:05:59.330> short

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
on the floor here and in a very short

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.450 
on the floor here and in a very short
period<00:05:59.600> of<00:05:59.840> time<00:05:59.900> that's<00:06:00.410> going<00:06:00.560> to<00:06:00.620> cause<00:06:00.830> the

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
period of time that's going to cause the

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.580 
period of time that's going to cause the
system<00:06:01.640> to<00:06:01.850> fall<00:06:02.180> so<00:06:03.110> you'll<00:06:03.260> see<00:06:03.380> that

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
system to fall so you'll see that

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.170 
system to fall so you'll see that
there's<00:06:03.980> still<00:06:04.070> some<00:06:04.370> ejecta<00:06:04.700> buckets<00:06:05.030> which

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
there's still some ejecta buckets which

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.540 
there's still some ejecta buckets which
you<00:06:05.330> saw<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:05.660> there<00:06:05.870> or<00:06:06.170> reset<00:06:06.680> it<00:06:06.800> I<00:06:07.190> think

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
you saw it there or reset it I think

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.210 
you saw it there or reset it I think
this<00:06:07.670> time<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.210> there's<00:06:08.480> another<00:06:08.690> one<00:06:09.220> but

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
this time and there's another one but

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.210 
this time and there's another one but
within<00:06:10.430> 20<00:06:10.760> seconds<00:06:11.090> or<00:06:11.270> so<00:06:11.420> it's<00:06:11.780> going<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.220> it

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
within 20 seconds or so it's going to it

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.440 
within 20 seconds or so it's going to it
won't<00:06:13.370> be<00:06:13.460> any<00:06:13.610> more<00:06:13.730> buckets<00:06:14.300> getting

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
won't be any more buckets getting

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.780 
won't be any more buckets getting
ejected<00:06:14.570> and<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:16.220> system<00:06:16.520> will<00:06:16.640> fault<00:06:16.850> out

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
ejected and the system will fault out

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.070 
ejected and the system will fault out
and<00:06:19.790> so<00:06:19.910> this<00:06:20.030> circuit<00:06:20.360> is<00:06:20.420> mostly<00:06:20.780> just

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
and so this circuit is mostly just

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.980 
and so this circuit is mostly just
counters<00:06:21.650> and<00:06:21.980> rs<00:06:22.520> latches<00:06:22.910> on<00:06:23.150> to<00:06:23.210> latch

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
counters and rs latches on to latch

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.450 
counters and rs latches on to latch
different<00:06:24.380> states<00:06:24.590> so<00:06:24.860> it's<00:06:24.980> not<00:06:25.100> super

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
different states so it's not super

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.830 
different states so it's not super
complex<00:06:27.190> but<00:06:28.190> there's<00:06:28.400> a<00:06:28.700> fault<00:06:29.000> latches<00:06:29.720> the

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
complex but there's a fault latches the

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.240 
complex but there's a fault latches the
fault<00:06:30.080> and<00:06:30.290> then<00:06:30.440> that<00:06:30.590> causes<00:06:30.740> this<00:06:31.070> red

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
fault and then that causes this red

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.320 
fault and then that causes this red
light<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:31.550> blink<00:06:31.670> and<00:06:31.880> it<00:06:31.940> shuts<00:06:32.090> off<00:06:32.210> the

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
light to blink and it shuts off the

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.140 
light to blink and it shuts off the
reactor<00:06:33.040> at<00:06:34.040> the<00:06:34.130> same<00:06:34.310> time<00:06:34.490> this<00:06:34.700> this<00:06:35.000> will

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
reactor at the same time this this will

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.790 
reactor at the same time this this will
there's<00:06:35.480> a<00:06:35.540> timer<00:06:35.750> that<00:06:35.930> keeps<00:06:36.110> us<00:06:36.230> this<00:06:36.590> light

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
there's a timer that keeps us this light

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.020 
there's a timer that keeps us this light
on<00:06:36.950> for<00:06:37.040> a<00:06:37.130> while<00:06:37.250> which<00:06:37.520> is<00:06:37.550> actually<00:06:37.940> the

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
on for a while which is actually the

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.940 
on for a while which is actually the
cooling<00:06:38.330> lie

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
cooling lie

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
cooling lie
it<00:06:39.950> indicates<00:06:40.400> that<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.670> cooling<00:06:40.910> system

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
it indicates that the cooling system

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.350 
it indicates that the cooling system
still<00:06:41.390> on<00:06:41.540> and<00:06:42.250> you<00:06:43.250> can<00:06:43.400> see<00:06:43.550> that<00:06:43.580> this<00:06:44.090> this

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
still on and you can see that this this

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.700 
still on and you can see that this this
is<00:06:44.480> basically<00:06:44.780> still<00:06:45.170> moving<00:06:45.410> which<00:06:45.530> means

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
is basically still moving which means

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.950 
is basically still moving which means
applying<00:06:45.860> system<00:06:46.280> still<00:06:46.460> on<00:06:46.550> so<00:06:47.540> if<00:06:47.690> i<00:06:47.780> were<00:06:47.870> to

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
applying system still on so if i were to

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.620 
applying system still on so if i were to
put<00:06:48.110> this<00:06:48.260> back<00:06:49.000> you<00:06:50.000> can<00:06:50.120> see<00:06:50.150> buckets<00:06:50.510> will

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
put this back you can see buckets will

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.910 
put this back you can see buckets will
start<00:06:50.840> getting<00:06:50.930> fed<00:06:51.230> back<00:06:51.410> into<00:06:51.440> the<00:06:51.770> system

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
start getting fed back into the system

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.540 
start getting fed back into the system
but<00:06:53.470> the<00:06:54.470> system's<00:06:54.830> actually<00:06:55.100> shut<00:06:55.250> down<00:06:55.400> at

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
but the system's actually shut down at

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.210 
but the system's actually shut down at
this<00:06:55.640> point<00:06:55.850> because<00:06:55.940> it's<00:06:56.210> faltan<00:06:56.800> so<00:06:57.800> i<00:06:57.830> can

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
this point because it's faltan so i can

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:05.590 
this point because it's faltan so i can
go<00:06:58.310> and<00:06:58.430> reset<00:06:58.700> it<00:06:58.730> again<00:06:59.950> up<00:07:00.950> here<00:07:04.150> and<00:07:05.150> as<00:07:05.510> you

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600 
go and reset it again up here and as you

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.940 
go and reset it again up here and as you
can<00:07:05.720> see<00:07:05.750> the<00:07:05.930> systems<00:07:06.290> in<00:07:06.440> the<00:07:06.470> fault<00:07:06.740> state

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:06.950 
can see the systems in the fault state

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.220 
can see the systems in the fault state
like<00:07:07.550> it<00:07:07.670> should<00:07:07.850> be<00:07:07.880> so<00:07:08.570> reset<00:07:08.930> it<00:07:09.050> and

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.230 
like it should be so reset it and

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.820 
like it should be so reset it and
restart<00:07:10.040> it<00:07:10.160> and<00:07:11.320> I'm<00:07:12.320> just<00:07:12.530> going<00:07:12.650> to<00:07:12.740> show

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
restart it and I'm just going to show

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.740 
restart it and I'm just going to show
kind<00:07:13.340> of<00:07:13.370> how<00:07:13.490> much<00:07:13.640> power<00:07:13.880> the<00:07:14.210> reactor<00:07:14.540> puts

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
kind of how much power the reactor puts

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.430 
kind of how much power the reactor puts
out<00:07:14.870> at<00:07:14.960> this<00:07:15.080> point<00:07:16.600> again<00:07:17.600> it's<00:07:17.780> not<00:07:17.990> I'm<00:07:18.290> not

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
out at this point again it's not I'm not

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.160 
out at this point again it's not I'm not
maxing<00:07:18.920> it<00:07:19.010> out<00:07:19.130> by<00:07:19.610> any<00:07:19.880> means<00:07:20.120> I<00:07:20.390> could<00:07:20.570> get<00:07:21.140> a

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.170 
maxing it out by any means I could get a

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.130 
maxing it out by any means I could get a
lot<00:07:21.290> more<00:07:21.350> power<00:07:21.710> out<00:07:21.770> of<00:07:21.890> it<00:07:22.870> but<00:07:23.870> it<00:07:23.960> still

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.140 
lot more power out of it but it still

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.140 
lot more power out of it but it still
generates<00:07:24.440> plenty<00:07:24.710> of<00:07:24.800> power<00:07:24.920> for<00:07:25.040> my<00:07:25.250> use<00:07:25.580> a

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
generates plenty of power for my use a

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.510 
generates plenty of power for my use a
lot<00:07:26.420> more<00:07:26.570> than<00:07:26.630> you<00:07:26.810> would<00:07:26.900> be<00:07:27.050> able<00:07:27.110> to<00:07:27.260> get

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
lot more than you would be able to get

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.600 
lot more than you would be able to get
safely<00:07:28.520> without<00:07:28.790> this<00:07:29.180> so<00:07:30.040> this<00:07:31.040> line<00:07:31.460> is

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
safely without this so this line is

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.610 
safely without this so this line is
putting<00:07:31.850> a<00:07:31.940> 100<00:07:32.270> EU<00:07:32.570> this<00:07:32.840> is<00:07:32.930> 100<00:07:33.080> and<00:07:33.440> this

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
putting a 100 EU this is 100 and this

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.900 
putting a 100 EU this is 100 and this
one's<00:07:33.770> actually<00:07:33.860> zero<00:07:34.250> just<00:07:34.460> because<00:07:34.700> the

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.910 
one's actually zero just because the

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.300 
one's actually zero just because the
thing<00:07:35.090> that's<00:07:35.210> beating<00:07:35.360> is<00:07:35.600> full<00:07:35.810> so<00:07:36.620> it's<00:07:36.740> 280

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
thing that's beating is full so it's 280

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.700 
thing that's beating is full so it's 280
per<00:07:37.490> tick<00:07:37.700> which<00:07:38.450> is<00:07:38.570> quite<00:07:38.750> a<00:07:38.810> bit<00:07:39.020> I<00:07:39.290> could

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.710 
per tick which is quite a bit I could

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.530 
per tick which is quite a bit I could
get<00:07:39.860> a<00:07:39.920> lot<00:07:40.100> lot<00:07:40.340> higher<00:07:40.490> if<00:07:40.730> I<00:07:40.880> if<00:07:41.240> I<00:07:41.360> was

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:41.540 
get a lot lot higher if I if I was

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.130 
get a lot lot higher if I if I was
pushing<00:07:41.780> the<00:07:41.960> system<00:07:42.260> but<00:07:42.440> again<00:07:42.620> I'm<00:07:42.710> not<00:07:42.740> and

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.140 
pushing the system but again I'm not and

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.810 
pushing the system but again I'm not and
but<00:07:45.140> it<00:07:45.230> works<00:07:45.350> pretty<00:07:45.500> well<00:07:45.590> it<00:07:45.950> it's<00:07:46.610> very

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820 
but it works pretty well it it's very

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.460 
but it works pretty well it it's very
reliable<00:07:47.300> I<00:07:47.540> haven't<00:07:47.900> had<00:07:47.990> exploded<00:07:48.440> ever<00:07:48.650> and

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:50.470 
reliable I haven't had exploded ever and

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.600 
reliable I haven't had exploded ever and
and<00:07:51.470> I<00:07:51.560> think<00:07:51.740> it's<00:07:51.830> kind<00:07:52.160> of<00:07:52.190> cool<00:07:52.310> so

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:52.610 
and I think it's kind of cool so

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.040 
and I think it's kind of cool so
hopefully<00:07:53.360> enjoyed<00:07:53.600> watching<00:07:53.750> this<00:07:53.930> video

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.050 
hopefully enjoyed watching this video

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.190 
hopefully enjoyed watching this video
and<00:07:54.440> next<00:07:54.890> watch<00:07:55.010> it
