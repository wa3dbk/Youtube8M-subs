then the very first step is to open up
that<00:02:29.579> hole<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.849> little<00:02:29.970> bit<00:02:30.329> so<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.200> can

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
cats comfortable with that little hole

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.390 
cats comfortable with that little hole
which<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.420> big<00:03:13.170> stopping<00:03:13.859> point<00:03:14.099> for<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.370> lot

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
which is a big stopping point for a lot

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.059 
which is a big stopping point for a lot
of<00:03:14.549> cats<00:03:14.989> then<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.379> start<00:03:16.650> making<00:03:16.829> the

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
of cats then you can start making the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.640 
of cats then you can start making the
whole<00:03:17.190> little<00:03:17.459> bigger<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.940> little<00:03:17.970> bigger

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
whole little bigger a little bigger

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.729 
whole little bigger a little bigger
little<00:03:19.650> bigger<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:20.250> little<00:03:20.910> bigger<00:03:21.329> and

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
little bigger a little bigger and

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.920 
little bigger a little bigger and
basically<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.220> idea<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.609> and<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.629> you

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
basically the idea is and you can you

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.309 
basically the idea is and you can you
can<00:03:25.109> use<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.319> little<00:03:25.680> um<00:03:26.780> pick<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.930> something<00:03:28.109> at

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
can use a little um pick up something at

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.689 
can use a little um pick up something at
the<00:03:28.349> hardware<00:03:28.590> store<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:29.099> you<00:03:29.160> can<00:03:29.400> use<00:03:29.669> to

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
the hardware store that you can use to

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.849 
the hardware store that you can use to
to<00:03:30.389> line<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.959> inside<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.379> hole<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
to line the inside of the hole so the

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.789 
to line the inside of the hole so the
lunar<00:03:32.040> doesn't<00:03:32.370> fall<00:03:32.549> right<00:03:32.730> through<00:03:33.620> but<00:03:34.620> as

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
lunar doesn't fall right through but as

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.009 
lunar doesn't fall right through but as
I<00:03:34.980> gets<00:03:35.190> bigger<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.609> bigger<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:36.510> goal<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
I gets bigger and bigger the goal is to

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.629 
I gets bigger and bigger the goal is to
get<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.470> big<00:03:37.650> enough<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:38.129> there's<00:03:38.310> just<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
get it big enough that there's just a

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.189 
get it big enough that there's just a
little<00:03:38.879> bit<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.060> litter<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.359> outside<00:03:39.840> and
