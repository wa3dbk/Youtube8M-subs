00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
two inches on either side so that we can

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920 
two inches on either side so that we can
clean<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> ends<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.570> I'm<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> say

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
cut away the excess the final step is to

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.589
