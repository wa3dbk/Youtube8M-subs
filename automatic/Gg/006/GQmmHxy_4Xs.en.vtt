reinserting<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.910> for<00:02:47.240> for<00:02:48.050> burning<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.620> end

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
reinserting it for for burning the end

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.300 
reinserting it for for burning the end
so<00:02:50.290> every<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:51.380> not<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.650> difficult<00:02:51.830> but

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
so every it's not that difficult but

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.180 
so every it's not that difficult but
secure<00:02:53.240> is<00:02:53.360> probably<00:02:53.720> better<00:02:53.930> than<00:02:54.200> none<00:02:54.440> not

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
secure is probably better than none not

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.220 
secure is probably better than none not
secure<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.270> roll<00:02:56.540> off<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.750> amount<00:02:57.140> of

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
secure so you roll off the amount of

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.580 
secure so you roll off the amount of
corn<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.830> want<00:02:58.150> for<00:02:59.150> your<00:02:59.240> given<00:02:59.600> task

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.080 

and<00:03:03.590> then<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:03.890> simply<00:03:04.130> slide<00:03:04.490> it<00:03:04.820> through

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
and then you simply slide it through

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.000 
and then you simply slide it through
here<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.780> very<00:03:09.050> easily<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.860> very

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
here and it's very easily and very

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
here and it's very easily and very
cleanly<00:03:10.610> cut<00:03:12.040> okay<00:03:13.040> now<00:03:13.520> I<00:03:13.550> would<00:03:13.850> normally

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
cleanly cut okay now I would normally

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.530 
cleanly cut okay now I would normally
burn<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:16.570> would<00:03:17.570> normally<00:03:17.750> burn<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.500> end<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.970> a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
burn I would normally burn the end of a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.130 
burn I would normally burn the end of a
piece<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.780> paracord<00:03:23.170> with<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.200> Bic<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:26.140> just

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
piece of paracord with a Bic and just

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.920 
piece of paracord with a Bic and just
simply<00:03:27.410> roll<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.709> in<00:03:27.830> my<00:03:27.980> fingers<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.900> make<00:03:29.900> a

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
simply roll it in my fingers to make a

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.910 
simply roll it in my fingers to make a
point<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.870> this<00:03:33.050> is<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.290> way<00:03:33.380> it's<00:03:33.410> typically

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
point so this is the way it's typically

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:42.990 
point so this is the way it's typically
done<00:03:37.750> burn<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.780> little<00:03:39.050> bit<00:03:40.480> lick<00:03:41.480> your<00:03:41.660> fingers

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
done burn a little bit lick your fingers

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.040 
done burn a little bit lick your fingers
otherwise<00:03:44.000> you'll<00:03:44.209> burn<00:03:44.420> them<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:47.000> there<00:03:47.959> you

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
otherwise you'll burn them and there you

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.860 
otherwise you'll burn them and there you
go<00:03:48.640> alright<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:49.820> that's<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.150> typical<00:03:50.360> end<00:03:50.690> and

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
go alright so that's a typical end and

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.440 
go alright so that's a typical end and
let<00:03:50.959> people<00:03:51.140> don't<00:03:51.440> like<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.860> touch<00:03:52.580> molten

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
let people don't like to touch molten

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.180 
let people don't like to touch molten
burning<00:03:53.780> paracord<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.410> I<00:03:54.560> don't<00:03:54.830> blame<00:03:54.980> them

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
burning paracord and I don't blame them

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.390 
burning paracord and I don't blame them
so<00:03:55.910> here's<00:03:56.330> where<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.660> other<00:03:56.780> feature<00:03:57.400> these

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
so here's where the other feature these

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.960 
so here's where the other feature these
particular<00:03:58.730> holes<00:03:59.150> come<00:03:59.450> in<00:04:00.489> I'll<00:04:01.489> we<00:04:01.730> cut

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
particular holes come in I'll we cut

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.490 
particular holes come in I'll we cut
this

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.390 

and<00:04:08.500> what<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.650> want<00:04:08.770> to<00:04:08.830> do<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:09.010> want<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.220> lace

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
and what you want to do is want to lace

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.500 
and what you want to do is want to lace
this<00:04:09.700> into<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.120> hole<00:04:11.160> by<00:04:12.160> pushing<00:04:12.430> down<00:04:12.580> this

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
this into the hole by pushing down this

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.360 
this into the hole by pushing down this
is<00:04:13.660> what<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.870> said<00:04:14.200> my<00:04:14.800> wife<00:04:14.950> had<00:04:15.190> some

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
is what I said my wife had some

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.730 
is what I said my wife had some
difficulty<00:04:15.940> doing<00:04:18.150> okay

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:36.970 

and<00:04:23.740> take<00:04:24.010> your<00:04:24.040> big<00:04:25.050> burn<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.230> end

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.980 

and<00:04:37.980> gently<00:04:38.580> slide<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.120> through<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.480> hole<00:04:39.660> and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
and gently slide it through the hole and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.590 
and gently slide it through the hole and
it<00:04:40.560> helps<00:04:40.800> if<00:04:40.890> you<00:04:41.040> can<00:04:41.250> actually<00:04:41.670> bring<00:04:42.450> it

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
it helps if you can actually bring it

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.050 
it helps if you can actually bring it
through<00:04:42.750> slowly<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.440> twist<00:04:43.800> it<00:04:43.980> which<00:04:44.820> I

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
through slowly and twist it which I

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.660 
through slowly and twist it which I
actually<00:04:45.270> didn't<00:04:45.810> do<00:04:46.040> just<00:04:47.040> pop<00:04:47.220> through<00:04:49.670> but

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
actually didn't do just pop through but

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.610 
actually didn't do just pop through but
it<00:04:50.790> does<00:04:50.970> make<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.480> end<00:04:54.050> multiple<00:04:55.050> clean<00:04:55.350> and

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
it does make the end multiple clean and

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.860 
it does make the end multiple clean and
pointed<00:04:56.100> without<00:04:56.460> having<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.180> slide<00:04:57.750> it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
pointed without having to slide it

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.060 
pointed without having to slide it
through<00:04:57.990> your<00:04:58.050> fingers<00:04:58.410> i'm<00:04:58.800> going<00:04:58.890> to<00:04:58.950> try

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
through your fingers i'm going to try

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.460 
through your fingers i'm going to try
that<00:04:59.280> again<00:04:59.870> see<00:05:00.870> if<00:05:00.930> i<00:05:00.990> can<00:05:01.110> get<00:05:01.170> down<00:05:01.320> the

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
that again see if i can get down the

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:18.620 
that again see if i can get down the
second<00:05:01.800> time<00:05:08.960> burn<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:09.990> little<00:05:10.169> bit<00:05:10.410> more

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.990 

I<00:05:19.280> got<00:05:20.280> a<00:05:20.310> good<00:05:20.520> burn<00:05:20.730> there<00:05:21.170> slide<00:05:22.170> it<00:05:22.200> up<00:05:23.000> try

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
I got a good burn there slide it up try

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.750 
I got a good burn there slide it up try
to<00:05:24.060> work<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.450> into<00:05:24.630> here<00:05:25.490> twist<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.640> a<00:05:26.700> little

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
to work it into here twist it a little

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:34.790 
to work it into here twist it a little
bit<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:28.640> then<00:05:29.640> pull<00:05:29.910> it<00:05:29.940> out<00:05:30.350> there<00:05:31.350> you<00:05:31.440> go<00:05:33.800> so

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
bit and then pull it out there you go so

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.580 
bit and then pull it out there you go so
there's<00:05:35.070> that<00:05:35.340> and<00:05:36.830> compared<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:39.290> the<00:05:40.290> end<00:05:40.470> I

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
there's that and compared to the end I

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.350 
there's that and compared to the end I
did<00:05:40.770> myself<00:05:40.980> by<00:05:41.430> just<00:05:41.640> rolling<00:05:42.000> it<00:05:42.090> through<00:05:42.240> my

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
did myself by just rolling it through my

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.270 
did myself by just rolling it through my
fingers<00:05:45.170> so<00:05:46.170> that's<00:05:46.350> what<00:05:46.560> those<00:05:46.710> are<00:05:46.890> for<00:05:46.920> and

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
fingers so that's what those are for and

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.640 
fingers so that's what those are for and
they're<00:05:47.400> different<00:05:47.940> sized<00:05:48.150> holes<00:05:48.650> for

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
they're different sized holes for

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.450 
they're different sized holes for
different<00:05:49.950> sized<00:05:50.100> cord<00:05:51.950> then<00:05:52.950> like<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:53.400> said

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
different sized cord then like I said

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.430 
different sized cord then like I said
you've<00:05:53.790> got<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.030> convenient<00:05:54.600> place<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.900> put<00:05:55.320> you

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
you've got a convenient place to put you

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.040 
you've got a convenient place to put you
around<00:05:55.740> your<00:05:56.070> bic<00:05:56.280> so<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.490> don't<00:05:56.640> lose<00:05:56.760> it<00:05:57.050> so

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
around your bic so you don't lose it so

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.390 
around your bic so you don't lose it so
I<00:05:58.620> think<00:05:59.310> it's<00:05:59.460> a<00:05:59.550> good<00:05:59.930> tool<00:06:01.400> particularly

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
I think it's a good tool particularly

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.920 
I think it's a good tool particularly
for<00:06:02.490> carrying<00:06:02.940> some<00:06:03.090> paracord<00:06:03.540> in<00:06:03.840> the

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
for carrying some paracord in the

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.130 
for carrying some paracord in the
survival<00:06:04.350> kit<00:06:04.560> gives<00:06:05.490> you<00:06:05.670> a<00:06:05.700> blade<00:06:06.030> to<00:06:06.750> cut<00:06:06.780> it

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
survival kit gives you a blade to cut it

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.930 
survival kit gives you a blade to cut it
so<00:06:07.260> you<00:06:07.350> don't<00:06:07.500> have<00:06:07.590> to<00:06:07.740> draw<00:06:07.920> up<00:06:08.100> you'll<00:06:08.850> have

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
so you don't have to draw up you'll have

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.170 
so you don't have to draw up you'll have
to<00:06:09.090> work<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:11.310> find<00:06:11.460> your<00:06:11.640> knife<00:06:11.790> pull<00:06:12.060> your

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
people don't carry a knife so this gives

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.680 
people don't carry a knife so this gives
them<00:06:17.040> the<00:06:17.160> option<00:06:17.280> of<00:06:17.610> cutting<00:06:18.360> a<00:06:18.420> length<00:06:18.570> of
