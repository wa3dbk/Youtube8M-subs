hey<00:00:06.700> its<00:00:06.910> behavior<00:00:07.390> here<00:00:07.570> from<00:00:07.750> blaster

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
hey its behavior here from blaster

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.039 
hey its behavior here from blaster
and<00:00:09.490> I<00:00:09.639> got<00:00:09.790> an<00:00:09.879> advanced<00:00:10.389> training<00:00:10.780> tip<00:00:10.900> that

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
and I got an advanced training tip that

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.089 
and I got an advanced training tip that
I<00:00:11.080> want<00:00:11.200> to<00:00:11.320> share

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
I want to share

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.839 
I want to share
it's<00:00:12.219> a<00:00:12.340> way<00:00:12.490> to<00:00:12.519> take<00:00:12.849> your<00:00:13.000> sets<00:00:13.299> past

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
it's a way to take your sets past

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.850 
it's a way to take your sets past
and<00:00:15.330> help<00:00:15.630> stimulate<00:00:15.870> more<00:00:16.230> growth<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:16.740> your

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
and help stimulate more growth with your

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.310 
and help stimulate more growth with your
workouts<00:00:17.220> now<00:00:18.060> when<00:00:18.689> I<00:00:18.720> consider<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> point

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
workouts now when I consider the point

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
workouts now when I consider the point
of<00:00:19.590> muscular<00:00:19.950> failure<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.610> when<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.119> get

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
of muscular failure is when you can get

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.550 
of muscular failure is when you can get
to<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> point<00:00:21.570> where<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.869> can't<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.230> another

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
to the point where you can't do another

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.890 
to the point where you can't do another
but<00:00:23.279> another<00:00:23.700> complete<00:00:24.119> repetition<00:00:24.720> with

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
but another complete repetition with

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
but another complete repetition with
good<00:00:25.110> form<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.400> doesn't<00:00:26.700> mean<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.849> you

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
good form but that doesn't mean that you

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
good form but that doesn't mean that you
can't<00:00:27.329> move<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> weight<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.110> so<00:00:28.980> there's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
can't move the weight at all so there's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.440 
can't move the weight at all so there's
certain<00:00:29.520> times<00:00:29.730> when<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.210> incorporate

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
certain times when you can incorporate

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.000 
certain times when you can incorporate
this<00:00:30.750> advanced<00:00:31.230> training<00:00:31.560> technique<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
this advanced training technique that

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.500 
this advanced training technique that
I'm<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.279> show<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.879> actually<00:00:33.120> take

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I'm going to show you and actually take

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
I'm going to show you and actually take
your<00:00:33.660> sex<00:00:33.960> past<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.650> point<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.920> muscular

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
your sex past the point of muscular

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
your sex past the point of muscular
failure<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.989> doing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
failure and what it is it's doing

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
failure and what it is it's doing
personal<00:00:38.010> reps<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.730> some<00:00:39.089> people<00:00:39.330> call<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
personal reps or some people call it

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.500 
personal reps or some people call it
burns<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> end<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.800> your<00:00:40.890> set<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.150> case

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
burns at the end of your set so in case

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.880 
burns at the end of your set so in case
you're<00:00:42.720> under<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.019> demonstrate<00:00:43.530> use<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
you're under the demonstrate use of the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.430 
you're under the demonstrate use of the
shoulder<00:00:44.129> press<00:00:44.460> machine<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:46.080> point<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
shoulder press machine and the point the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
shoulder press machine and the point the
muscular<00:00:46.860> failure<00:00:47.039> would<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.450> no

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
muscular failure would be like to no

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.180 
muscular failure would be like to no
longer<00:00:48.930> completely<00:00:49.230> completely<00:00:49.829> show

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
longer completely completely show

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
longer completely completely show
regrets<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.450> doesn't<00:00:51.750> mean<00:00:51.840> again<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
regrets but that doesn't mean again that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.959 
regrets but that doesn't mean again that
I<00:00:52.469> can't<00:00:52.710> move<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.879> can

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
I can't move the way at all so I can

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
I can't move the way at all so I can
just<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.329> short-range<00:00:54.840> partial<00:00:55.379> reps<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
just do short-range partial reps in the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
just do short-range partial reps in the
bottom<00:00:56.340> after<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.059> complete<00:00:57.420> muscular<00:00:57.840> failure

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
bottom after I complete muscular failure

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
bottom after I complete muscular failure
in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> full<00:00:58.890> range<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.910> come<00:01:00.120> take<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
in the full range and just come take a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.299 
in the full range and just come take a
set<00:01:00.719> past<00:01:01.109> point<00:01:01.530> failure<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.219> I'll

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
set past point failure so I'll

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.340 
set past point failure so I'll
demonstrate<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.960> start<00:01:07.229> with

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
demonstrate so I'm going to start with

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.000 
demonstrate so I'm going to start with
full<00:01:07.590> range<00:01:07.770> motion<00:01:07.950> race

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:42.340 

[Music]

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.200 

so<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> notice<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.579> didn't<00:01:44.819> know<00:01:44.880> 12

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
so you notice that I didn't know 12

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.120 
so you notice that I didn't know 12
wrenchers<00:01:45.569> over<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> full<00:01:46.140> range<00:01:46.380> motion<00:01:46.499> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
wrenchers over a full range motion and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.499 
wrenchers over a full range motion and
then<00:01:47.429> I<00:01:47.460> couldn't<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:47.969> the<00:01:48.119> point<00:01:48.359> where<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
then I couldn't get to the point where I

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.399 
then I couldn't get to the point where I
could<00:01:48.659> lock<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.020> up

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
could lock it up

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.870 
could lock it up
so<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:49.979> started<00:01:50.369> doing<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> partial

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
so then I just started doing the partial

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.419 
so then I just started doing the partial
range<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> burn<00:01:51.960> reps<00:01:52.289> at<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.890> bottom<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
range or the burn reps at the bottom and

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.999 
range or the burn reps at the bottom and
again<00:01:53.969> this<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.240> way<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.569> ticket<00:01:54.899> said<00:01:55.109> pass

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
again this is way the ticket said pass

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.590 
again this is way the ticket said pass
the<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.399> muscular<00:01:56.850> failure<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the one muscular failure and to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.779 
the one muscular failure and to
stimulate<00:01:57.810> more<00:01:58.140> growth<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:59.429> there's<00:01:59.670> only

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
stimulate more growth now there's only

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.339 
stimulate more growth now there's only
certain<00:02:00.030> exercises<00:02:00.569> I'd<00:02:00.869> recommend<00:02:01.289> them

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
certain exercises I'd recommend them

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.160 
certain exercises I'd recommend them
doing<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:02.099> recommend<00:02:02.670> doing<00:02:02.789> this<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.209> such<00:02:03.509> as

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
doing or recommend doing this on such as

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.469 
doing or recommend doing this on such as
the<00:02:04.229> Machine<00:02:04.500> exercise<00:02:05.329> something<00:02:06.329> that's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
the Machine exercise something that's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.910 
the Machine exercise something that's
sync<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.020> you're<00:02:07.319> not<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:07.679> pinned

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
sync and you're not going to get pinned

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.740 
sync and you're not going to get pinned
under<00:02:08.160> later<00:02:08.509> obviously<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> wouldn't

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
under later obviously I wouldn't

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.650 
under later obviously I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:09.989> doing<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.940> like<00:02:11.940> squats<00:02:12.329> or

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
recommend doing this with like squats or

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.059 
recommend doing this with like squats or
bench<00:02:12.930> presses<00:02:13.410> or<00:02:13.590> something<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
bench presses or something like that

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.430 
bench presses or something like that
work<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.879> doing<00:02:14.910> free<00:02:15.360> weights<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
work you're doing free weights and the
