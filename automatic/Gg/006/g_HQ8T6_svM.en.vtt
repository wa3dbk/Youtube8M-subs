boots<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.190> have<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.400> knees<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.940> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
boots then you have the knees and you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.450 
boots then you have the knees and you
have<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:04.050> ankle<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.160> comes<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
have the ankle so when it comes to

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.340 
have the ankle so when it comes to
articulation<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.480> can't<00:02:06.690> beat<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> also

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
articulation you can't beat it also

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.940 
articulation you can't beat it also
I<00:02:08.410> failed<00:02:08.980> to<00:02:09.340> see<00:02:09.850> any<00:02:10.180> new<00:02:10.920> Captain<00:02:11.920> America

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
I failed to see any new Captain America

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.970 
I failed to see any new Captain America
that<00:02:12.370> could<00:02:12.880> do<00:02:13.060> all<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.300> articulation<00:02:14.080> but

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
that could do all that articulation but

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.580 
that could do all that articulation but
like<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:15.970> said<00:02:16.090> before<00:02:16.180> my<00:02:16.510> other<00:02:16.660> reviews<00:02:16.990> you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
like I said before my other reviews you

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.020 
like I said before my other reviews you
know<00:02:17.740> sometimes<00:02:18.250> you're<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.430> posing<00:02:18.730> it

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
know sometimes you're just posing it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.050 
know sometimes you're just posing it
doesn't<00:02:19.840> make<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.960> difference<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.910> nice

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
doesn't make a difference but it is nice

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.780 
doesn't make a difference but it is nice
to<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.330> two<00:02:22.420> articulation<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:24.010> other<00:02:24.550> than

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
to have two articulation the other than

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.220 
to have two articulation the other than
that<00:02:24.940> when<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.150> comes<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> shield<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.990> don't

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
that when it comes to the shield I don't

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.720 
that when it comes to the shield I don't
like<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.590> shoot<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:26.950> much<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.400> think<00:02:27.550> it's

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
like to shoot that much is I think it's

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.630 
like to shoot that much is I think it's
too<00:02:27.910> big<00:02:28.180> actually<00:02:28.740> but<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:29.980> do<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.520> fact

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
too big actually but I do like the fact

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.580 
too big actually but I do like the fact
that<00:02:30.760> comes<00:02:30.970> with<00:02:31.060> straps<00:02:31.330> because<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:32.470> to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that comes with straps because I like to

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.460 
that comes with straps because I like to
put<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.670> on<00:02:33.850> his<00:02:34.000> back<00:02:34.210> actually<00:02:37.470> just

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
put the on his back actually just

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.160 
put the on his back actually just
like<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:41.680> think<00:02:41.770> that's<00:02:41.950> pretty<00:02:42.130> cool

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
like this and I think that's pretty cool

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.810 
like this and I think that's pretty cool
I<00:02:44.200> do<00:02:44.410> think<00:02:44.710> it's<00:02:44.800> too<00:02:44.920> big<00:02:45.130> for<00:02:45.310> him<00:02:45.490> on<00:02:45.700> his

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
I do think it's too big for him on his

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.270 
I do think it's too big for him on his
arm<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.300> do<00:02:46.570> like<00:02:46.900> some<00:02:47.080> other<00:02:47.290> shields<00:02:48.160> that

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
arm I do like some other shields that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.120 
arm I do like some other shields that
came<00:02:48.460> with<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.790> movie<00:02:49.180> figures<00:02:49.920> from<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
came with the movie figures from the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.040 
came with the movie figures from the
original<00:02:52.000> Captain<00:02:52.300> America<00:02:52.570> movie<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.020> I

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
original Captain America movie and I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.090 
original Captain America movie and I
think<00:02:53.200> they<00:02:53.290> fit<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> little<00:02:53.680> bit<00:02:53.800> better

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
think they fit a little bit better

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.140 
think they fit a little bit better
and<00:02:54.820> also<00:02:55.480> look<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:57.100> scale<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.850> him<00:02:58.000> actually

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
and also look and scale to him actually

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.700 
and also look and scale to him actually
so<00:03:00.210> there<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.300> go<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:03.190> other<00:03:03.400> than<00:03:03.490> that

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
so there you go so other than that

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.470 
so there you go so other than that
that's<00:03:05.710> about<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.160> I'll<00:03:06.310> get<00:03:06.940> into<00:03:07.060> some<00:03:07.150> size

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
that's about it I'll get into some size

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.170 
that's about it I'll get into some size
comparisons<00:03:08.130> size<00:03:09.130> comparisons<00:03:09.760> here<00:03:10.000> is

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
comparisons size comparisons here is

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.640 
comparisons size comparisons here is

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
wrong I like to figure out a lot this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.600 
wrong I like to figure out a lot this
scope<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.050> really<00:03:20.290> nice<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:21.160> body<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.520> really

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
nice too I like it a lot but when it

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.970 
nice too I like it a lot but when it
comes<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.280> overall<00:03:24.580> sculpt<00:03:25.180> detail

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
comes to overall sculpt detail

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.700 
comes to overall sculpt detail
articulation<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:28.140> accuracy<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:29.560> like

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
articulation and accuracy I just like

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.930 
articulation and accuracy I just like
that<00:03:29.860> one<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.250> lot<00:03:30.550> better

pretty good to me he is a little bit

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.080 
pretty good to me he is a little bit
taller<00:03:40.620> than<00:03:41.100> some<00:03:41.490> of<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.700> other<00:03:41.850> figures

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090

out<00:03:42.510> Captain<00:03:42.930> America<00:03:43.170> figures<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:43.680> he<00:03:44.280> is
