 throws us the soccer ball almost 50 meters away 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.840
 which would be equivalent to five British double-decker buses complying with 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.420
 the requirement to have both feet on the ground at the time of launch 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.890

 this requires concentration so you are guaranteed that you can pay for it 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.879
 you can fall asleep again the drastic solution would be to take away the 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:17.850
 batteries to stop sounding the alarm 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.029
