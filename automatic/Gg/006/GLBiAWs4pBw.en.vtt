00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.300
 louis congratulations on qualifying 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.280
 and belongs to the qualification and a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 small snack 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.500
 yes we are very happy with the qualification 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.270
 what kind of achievement is this? 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.310
 qualification in this group with this 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.050
 Dutch soccerteam 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 well if you go back to the past 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:33.450
 to the selection I had to pick up 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.520
 to the ek and that you re-production 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.820
 must formulate with young players 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.570
 yes then it is always difficult and for sure 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.890
 at that time of course that was none 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.590
 good ek and then you get too 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.379
 disappointed players 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.449
 and if you are the first team of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.430
 Europe qualified with with 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.469
 I understand Switzerland 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.120
 yes then you naturally do it whole 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.080
 very good if you also have a goal 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.159
 wrap of plus 20 yes then everyone can 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 say yes andorra 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.960
 does not mean anything to me according to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.420
 Germany now plays against sailing 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.540
 island is 0 1 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.750
 maybe the now has become 0 2 but 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.140
 but look defending turns out remains 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.750
 always easier as an attacker that we 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.549
 always be and and the players of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.070
 andorras are also much more trained 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.590
 than 10 years ago 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.110
 so it gets harder every time 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.390
 of these kinds of countries to win from 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 Persie but good after being the first 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.479
 have given half a lot of bags 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.520
 historically leaving the hoover 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.920
 gave more more more space 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.420
 yes shoot twice very well 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 then you have you as a national coach 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 and as a little love still 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.460
 enjoyed tonight 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.610
 it was silly not nice to look for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.850
 for us, well i last time 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.619
 already said you have to invest in the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.900
 you have to let them walk in the first half and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.120
 I think we did 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.080
 and he already played very fast pace 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.970
 only yes from the side kees say yes 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.740
 that is too slow a pace yes that is 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.500
 of course longshot but they stand with 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.600
 two rows of 4 in the 16 meters and 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.120
 standing in front of it or two two players 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.840
 Missed Missed We already knew you who is 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.070
 not even a creative one of the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.660
 two inspectors who maybe what 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.860
 easier and faster from PC 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.410
 find 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.900
 no because I just tried that out 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.370
 to explain before the match that one 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.830
 scarce and straw man 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.760
 be critical only I have the risk 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.770
 then taken by again 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.530
 players who are also creative in te 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.970
 bring with with my hair and with scarce 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.810
 as a left back 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.720
 yes that is a risk and a margaret 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.120
 according to but no ball touched after 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.010
 the rens of persie school that balloon 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.959
 within that has to do with the first 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.690
 half that he boys completely destroyed 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.000
 have been played and I also have reedy 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.040
 home game against all through faces 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.650
 and also against estonia because that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.160
 is a given nowadays 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.000
 Wesley Sneijder who is actually there 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.519
 accidentally recovered by 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.870
 circumstances he is in your eyes 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.870
 grown in in in in these two 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.989
 competitions and in this training week how 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.780
 he is also there well he is one of them 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.720
 Of the players who have been selected 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.580
 and he has the qualification 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.200
 accomplished is that shit no that is 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.540
 not here but he knows it himself 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.300
 a and how fit should be in the belt o 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.980
 who's not about oh no , no, no 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.860
 then it is not about right now 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.739
 I think we have qualified 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.769
 I think he is incredibly good 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.690
 has stated that he has everything 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.660
 given to 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.799
 to achieve the result that we 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.880
 wanted to have 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.170
 well that that is and is important 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.510
 love came closer 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.480
 and he comes 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.340
 he really gets fit all media if you 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.079
 have not played football for half a year 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.479
 then you will have to train a lot and 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.250
 play competitions for that fitness again 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.620
 get those who had at Inter Milan 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.030
 won a lot here as a coach 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.590
 him 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.880
 You have a big disappointment 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.310
 disappointment that that is not 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.780
 qualify in 2002 that is with you now 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.810
 eliminated 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.389
 no I don't think it was blemish 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.310
 also becomes the 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:48.210
 If you are called up then you should see how we 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.470
 have evaluated that or how handy 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.090
 if was a disappointment for you 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.760
 density so that is no blemish 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.910
 my career I was well away 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.150
 no, because I think there is another bk and 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.370
 in the wk you have to perform and you have to 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.669
 also not go out the first round and 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.229
 we have a very young team with one 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.400
 few older players 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.710
 well i hope we get further than the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.280
 first round at the wk this is just it 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.610
 get started 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.150
 we are still building and and if you 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.220
 now I have said in advance at 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.070
 this one 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.170
 round qualifying round that it is the 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.590
 hardest selection round was because 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:34.170
 everyone is sick or sick and you sick 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.670
 qualifier qualifies you first 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.010
 log from europe then you do anyway 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.990
 very good of course is the game 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.290
 could be improved 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.150
 but that will come and we also have good ones 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.560
 played matches in Hungary 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.330
 from Romania 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.940
 yes that is not going to be wrong 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.620
 I 'm going to have a drink tonight 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.420
 no no just assume you don't like that 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.890
 makes me look I wait there for one more 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.920
 can do 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:03.120
