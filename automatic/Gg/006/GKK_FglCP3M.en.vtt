00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.950
 The guys from youtube 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:19.480
 today some again discuss the goal 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.480
 left at 42 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.230
 the next record 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.630
 already showed an old video and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.560
 it's automatic 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:49.880
 here there is no need to make the 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:58.940
 gear changes do not have a car that you 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:01:02.510
 select is drive el and that lever of 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.710
 when there is a need when 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.740
 you grow up to it as the manual is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.430
 can be done with a difference is in the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.430
 real mean 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:25.940
 the meat item only you take the brake what 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:28.670
 15 more to show you here me 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.979
 makes the exchanges very much like a 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.979
 manual does the same 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.149
 it's no need you should take 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.439
 the car took the foot off the throttle keep 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.060
 the foot on the accelerator 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.490
 it decreases acceleration alone is makes 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.439
 change is made after the gear shift 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.700
 tip for the normal acceleration is 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.140
 You were right, let's start here with 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.509
 he the movement to show you 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.509
 leaves it here in the panel 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.150
 I already know how I was to make this exchange. 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:18.570
 i series that it 's drive 4 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:23.300
 if I want to put this in the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:27.890
 fist leverage pro side this movement 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.060
 sure it will transfer to the manual 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.320
 because now I would have to do the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.250
 changes in lever but I'll leave and 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.970
 dry for you see as such lady 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.640
 drive 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.640
 the gear shifting is coming off 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.250
 I think I 've been accelerating . 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.810
 down and hurt 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.270
 It is a highlight to change the gears if 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.510
 concerned with the acceleration was what 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.510
 good 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.439
 we are reversing a fall of almost 50% 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.439
 our side 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.230
 he remembered the case 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.620
 it was possible for you to observe 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.620
 there 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.480
 it's the boy's 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.940
 the twist of the motor he cuts the guy 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.860
 is to the extent that you are going to effect 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.860
 the exchange of mach photo g1 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.610
 is that you 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.580
 to make the exchange safe is 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.580
 quiet 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.560
 it's a positive path 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:01.480
 who has the opportunity to work 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.480
 wii that's cool 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:13.180
 he refutes he still remembers from 12ยบ c through 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.990
 of clothes the time in the city fell being 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.920
 cold that will trigger he ran away 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:25.320
 this is basically the very truck 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.650
 to ride the horse and want to 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.650
 as a matter of fact 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:40.279
 I'm here with and away is up is 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:42.489
 Loaded but tethered coach of the 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.489
 Flamengo 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.900
 however that taking this truck to 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:54.590
 repairing the brake system is 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.440
 for the cart then it is without brake 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.410
 cart requires a little more care 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.680
 because the law only of the horse if you 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:08.500
 need a medical brake where 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.500
 the famous famous l 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.570
 without the cart 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:24.430
 horse did not you have the horse 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:28.650
 Not cold cart and there me 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.650
 the effect is and what is 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.280
 with calm and tranquility 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.729
 they get there too 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.729
 a hug guys 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.239
 until the next government
