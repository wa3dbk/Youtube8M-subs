00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and in a way I guess this was a good

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.520 
and in a way I guess this was a good
thing<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.309> me<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:48.090> Erik<00:00:48.329> Morales<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.020> mean

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
dangerous fight for Erik Morales in my

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
dangerous fight for Erik Morales in my
opinion<00:01:01.050> he's<00:01:01.199> fighting<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> younger<00:01:01.980> fighter

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
opinion he's fighting a younger fighter

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.969 
opinion he's fighting a younger fighter
someone<00:01:03.180> who<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> pushover<00:01:04.470> someone's

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
someone who so not a pushover someone's

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.440 
someone who so not a pushover someone's
actually<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> give<00:01:05.729> him<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.000> tough<00:01:06.210> fight
