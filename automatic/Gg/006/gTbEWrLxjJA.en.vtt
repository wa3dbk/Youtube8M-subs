00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.570 
bats weren't as plentiful from my
understanding<00:04:03.950> guys<00:04:04.950> would<00:04:05.220> put<00:04:05.400> little

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
understanding guys would put little

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.830 
understanding guys would put little
finishing<00:04:06.030> nails<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.390> there<00:04:06.540> if<00:04:06.600> they<00:04:06.660> had<00:04:06.810> a

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
finishing nails in there if they had a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.090 
finishing nails in there if they had a
little<00:04:07.020> crack<00:04:07.230> in<00:04:07.260> them<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.740> put<00:04:07.830> more<00:04:08.070> and

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
little crack in them and put more and

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.740 
little crack in them and put more and
more<00:04:08.250> pine<00:04:08.550> tar<00:04:08.820> on<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.240> then<00:04:09.330> guys<00:04:09.540> would

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
more pine tar on it and then guys would

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.449 
more pine tar on it and then guys would
hit<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.900> ball<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.560> black<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.130> ball<00:04:11.340> would

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
hit a ball and the black the ball would

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.040 
hit a ball and the black the ball would
get<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.670> black<00:04:11.940> smudge<00:04:12.270> on<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.780> umpires

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
get a black smudge on it and the umpires

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.530 
get a black smudge on it and the umpires
would<00:04:13.230> always<00:04:13.350> throw<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.770> away<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:15.330> they

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
would always throw it away and so they

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.750 
would always throw it away and so they
decided<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.020> come<00:04:16.260> up<00:04:16.290> with<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.530> rule<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:17.520> save

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
decided to come up with a rule to save

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.140 
decided to come up with a rule to save
baseball's<00:04:18.330> that<00:04:19.190> you<00:04:20.190> cannot<00:04:20.459> put<00:04:20.700> pine<00:04:20.910> tar

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
baseball's that you cannot put pine tar

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.240 
baseball's that you cannot put pine tar
eighteen<00:04:21.450> inches<00:04:21.690> above<00:04:21.960> the<00:04:22.140> handle<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:23.220> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
eighteen inches above the handle of the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.219 
eighteen inches above the handle of the
bat<00:04:23.430> that's<00:04:23.970> my<00:04:24.210> understanding<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.990> where<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
bat that's my understanding of where the

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.790 
bat that's my understanding of where the
rule<00:04:25.410> came

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.020 

now<00:04:28.800> they<00:04:28.979> throw<00:04:29.129> a<00:04:29.220> ball<00:04:29.430> out<00:04:29.610> every<00:04:29.819> time<00:04:29.970> it

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
now they throw a ball out every time it

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.960 
now they throw a ball out every time it
hits<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.389> ground<00:04:30.599> yeah
