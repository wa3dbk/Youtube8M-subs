00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello to all i'm proud that there is a will to block infiniti vote 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.989
 tsr ch 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.069
 so 5 6-2 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.749
 I like that it will be presented the small models here 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.210
 so that's a little happiness 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.699
 that simple 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.569
 which actually allows you 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.829
 to have a record at a greenhouse with resources not finishing 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.939
 so the reason to do 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.939
 it comes out of fleet 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.669
 cf net 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.370
 he installs as usual required him to marry his adapter for this 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.220
 delay 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.410
 thomas kraft bwin 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 we are promised once 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.920
 first you have to close 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 So it's not 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
 there I am counterfeit 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.740
 placed the class file that quotes 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.350
 m cb 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.450
 back to the game I'm showing you a little bit but I'm proud of my 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 predecessors 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 with everything I do inside like porto 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.170
 so after the very good sense the system of favorites cope 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.120
 interview with the leader 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 period 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.350
 after that I know how to make a small system a little further 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.080
 a little bigger 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 here are the layers 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.459
 triple silver medalist 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.459
 Duplicates 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.049
 m 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.049
 chopped off 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.310
 the sanitary system of this new system 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.859
 our man came with about ten seconds will be closed tomorrow 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.789
 first the system resources 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.479
 to these practices 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.479
 so that's all it's just a little engine 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.569
 kloten 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.360
 and I also advise you 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.120
 in front of the preview of the next texture mode presentation 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.870
 compression on the image you see here the
