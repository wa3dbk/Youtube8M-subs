00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.600
 hello very good we will try to 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.670
 repair a connector which has adhered 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.980
 of having an internal damage of some of 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.619
 the cables had to be disconnected 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.910
 is what does not load our 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.060
 iphone phone 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.450
 well for it good because we're going to have 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 to open we will use tin 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.260
 we will also use as a tool a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.370
 cutter with which we will make the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.000
 incision in the connector also 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.640
 we should use a soldering iron 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.100
 and also because 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.379
 we will use a little bit of glue 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.379
 to finally seal the connector 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.260
 with our cutter we will practice a 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.530
 incision and we will start directly what 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.670
 we will place and we will split it in the middle 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.850
 which will allow us 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.850
 and release the inside wiring 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.380
 so we would have let's show now 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.640
 how could we have the connector open 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.899
 releasing it with that incision that we have 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.770
 done and if we realize only 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.709
 we would use 44 cables as there is one 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.659
 of them that is loose is the cable 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:36.060
 cited black in this case our there what 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.609
 we have and the cable cited black has been 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.509
 released that we are going to do then 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:44.899
 we're just going to be able to weld that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.899
 black cable 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 we take a little bit this year we want 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.260
 first we would have to wait with 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.810
 our cutter a bit the cable and solder 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.330
 and masters with a little bit of tin there in 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.960
 the area that we are indicating 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.960
 OK 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.210
 we proceed now with a cutter taking 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.630
 very careful not to cut us to release 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.770
 the outer shell leaving 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.590
 leaving loose by the copper wires of 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.820
 this way we can then apply 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.820
 tin and solder 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.950
 we have to connect the black thread with 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.890
 the connector that is in the center that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.230
 is also attached to the other black thread 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.620
 well we take we're going to warm up a little bit 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.620
 area 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.260
 and we're going to apply a piece of tin 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.140
 and we will keep it all completely welded 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.140
 and compact 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.430
 well we only have to 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.370
 check that we have to solder the cable 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.870
 black that is going away 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.879
 people have released there we put it 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.370
 come on let's put the droplet on 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.349
 of this year 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.650
 we must bear in mind that the savior 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.510
 it must be totally hot 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.870
 we apply a point 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.849
 of welding and there we have it either 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.000
 you have to apply a lot of tin is 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.500
 only one droplet we wait and now 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.599
 let's do the test we plug in and 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.840
 we connect everything and we are going to do the 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.530
 proof that that was really the fault 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.319
 in this case 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.290
 before closing it, we are seeing 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.640
 as fixed, we are enabled and we 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.610
 indicates that it is receiving current 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.069
 it's good that we would stay or we 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.110
 would be to close that structure in this 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.840
 case we are using a glue of 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.690
 quick sealer 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.550
 to be able to be totally fixed 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.550
 and that the connector does not move us 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.290
 the important thing is that it is already loading 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.290
 It's good, well, that's all 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.070
 ah
