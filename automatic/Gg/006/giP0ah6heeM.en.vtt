we've<00:00:12.430> got<00:00:12.610> some<00:00:12.850> curl

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.550 

now<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.699> point<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.150> time<00:00:30.360> it's<00:00:30.869> kind<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.350> a

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560

now at this point in time it's kind of a
gentle<00:00:33.650> fragile<00:00:34.650> curl<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.090> don't<00:00:36.300> want<00:00:36.510> to

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
gentle fragile curl so we don't want to

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.740 
gentle fragile curl so we don't want to
pull<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:38.220> don't<00:00:38.400> want<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.180> lot

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
pull on this we don't want to do a lot

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
pull on this we don't want to do a lot
of<00:00:40.220> like<00:00:41.239> combing<00:00:42.320> with<00:00:43.320> tension<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.220> know<00:00:44.309> we

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
of like combing with tension you know we

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.280 
of like combing with tension you know we
just<00:00:44.580> want<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> keep<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.870> kind

just want to kind of keep them just kind

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.229 
just want to kind of keep them just kind
of<00:00:46.410> pushing<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.790> don't<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:48.150> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
of pushing it up because I don't want to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.689 
of pushing it up because I don't want to
pull<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.690> them<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.900> want<00:00:49.290> them<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.620> retain<00:00:50.160> that

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
pull on them I want them to retain that

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.509 
pull on them I want them to retain that
curl<00:00:51.089> shape<00:00:54.830> because<00:00:55.830> the<00:00:55.980> hair<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.280> been

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
curl shape because the hair has been

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.670 
curl shape because the hair has been
through<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.839> it's<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.080> kind<00:00:58.470> of<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
through a lot and it's just kind of a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.029 
through a lot and it's just kind of a
fragile<00:00:59.040> so<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.180> example<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.920> an

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
fragile so for example this would be an

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.070 
fragile so for example this would be an
instance<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.270> did<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.989> were

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
instance if if you did this and you were

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.680 
instance if if you did this and you were
having<00:01:04.320> remorse<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.060> were<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.630> was

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
having remorse and you were like it was

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.290 
having remorse and you were like it was
way<00:01:06.990> too<00:01:07.020> curly<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.220> hated<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.940> you

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
way too curly and you just hated it you

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.010 
way too curly and you just hated it you
could<00:01:10.310> wash<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.610> hair<00:01:11.789> in<00:01:12.000> comb<00:01:12.300> it<00:01:12.509> at<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
could wash the hair in comb it at this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
could wash the hair in comb it at this
point<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.649> you<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.039> a<00:01:14.100> lot<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
point and you would get a lot of the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.660 
point and you would get a lot of the
curl<00:01:14.910> out<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.800> mind<00:01:17.039> we<00:01:17.460> want

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
curl out so with that in mind we want

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
curl out so with that in mind we want
the<00:01:17.970> curl<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.570> love<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.710> we're<00:01:19.920> just

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the curl we love it and so we're just

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.889 
the curl we love it and so we're just
being<00:01:20.820> kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.119> careful<00:01:21.600> they're<00:01:21.750> not

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
being kind of careful they're not

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.249 
being kind of careful they're not
pulling<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:23.160> combing<00:01:23.910> just<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> keeping

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
pulling not combing just kind of keeping

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
pulling not combing just kind of keeping
that<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:27.390> new<00:01:27.660> curled<00:01:28.170> form<00:01:32.360> after<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.540> get

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that that new curled form after I get

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
that that new curled form after I get
all<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.990> these<00:01:34.080> out<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.590> gonna<00:01:34.740> work<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> rest

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
all of these out I'm gonna work the rest

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.940 
all of these out I'm gonna work the rest
of<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.790> neutralizer<00:01:36.509> into<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.200> ends<00:01:37.740> for

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
of that neutralizer into the ends for

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
of that neutralizer into the ends for
one<00:01:38.280> minute<00:01:40.670> okay<00:01:41.670> mom<00:01:41.880> let's<00:01:41.909> stand<00:01:42.330> up<00:01:42.509> and

and we're gonna put the remaining

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.810 
and we're gonna put the remaining
solution<00:01:54.890> here<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.159> way<00:01:56.340> we'll<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
solution here it this way we'll have it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
solution here it this way we'll have it
real<00:01:57.090> good<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.869> ends<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.560> kind<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
real good on the ends and just kind of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.330 
real good on the ends and just kind of
gently<00:01:59.369> working<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.240> through<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.130> can

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
gently working it through so as you can

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.460 
gently working it through so as you can
see<00:02:02.399> she<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.329> does<00:02:03.720> need<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.290> her

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
see she really does need to have her

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.840 
see she really does need to have her
roots<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.009> touch<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.670> phone<00:02:06.560> they<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:07.850> way

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
roots to touch that phone they are way

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.789 
roots to touch that phone they are way
grown<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.360> should<00:02:09.600> have<00:02:09.690> been<00:02:09.810> done<00:02:09.989> probably

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
grown out should have been done probably

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.280 
grown out should have been done probably
six<00:02:11.130> months<00:02:11.190> ago<00:02:11.780> there's<00:02:12.780> not<00:02:12.989> too<00:02:13.170> much

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
six months ago there's not too much

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.009 
six months ago there's not too much
color<00:02:13.590> left<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.130> on<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> ends<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.750> we're

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
color left just on the ends but we're

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.020
