one<00:00:17.610> of<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> reasons<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.510> really<00:00:18.690> wanted<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
one of the reasons I really wanted to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.980 
one of the reasons I really wanted to
write<00:00:19.440> real<00:00:19.770> revision<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:21.120> because<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.930> think

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
write real revision was because I think

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.110 
write real revision was because I think
kids<00:00:22.440> have<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.770> real<00:00:23.010> misconception<00:00:23.280> about

kids have a real misconception about

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.590 
kids have a real misconception about
authors<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.950> amount<00:00:26.280> of<00:00:26.550> perhaps<00:00:27.150> innate

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
authors and the amount of perhaps innate

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.770 
authors and the amount of perhaps innate
writing<00:00:28.110> talent<00:00:28.530> that<00:00:28.620> we<00:00:28.770> have<00:00:29.010> my<00:00:29.910> books<00:00:30.210> my

writing talent that we have my books my
first<00:00:31.050> drafts<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.669> pretty<00:00:33.290> they<00:00:34.290> go

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
first drafts are not pretty they go

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.170 
first drafts are not pretty they go
through<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> lot<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> stages<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> lot<00:00:36.149> of

through a lot of stages and a lot of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.000 
through a lot of stages and a lot of
scribbling<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.929> a<00:00:37.050> lot<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> post-it<00:00:37.800> notes

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
it is about Marty who is a third grader

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.050 
it is about Marty who is a third grader
she<00:02:13.590> loves<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.920> catch<00:02:14.099> frogs<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.849> crayfish

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
she loves to catch frogs and crayfish

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.970 
she loves to catch frogs and crayfish
and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.589 
and
get<00:02:16.099> muddy<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.580> then<00:02:16.970> they<00:02:17.090> make<00:02:17.269> her<00:02:17.420> be<00:02:17.540> the

get muddy and then they make her be the

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.199 
get muddy and then they make her be the
princess<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.290> her<00:02:18.409> school<00:02:18.739> play<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.000> it's

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
princess in her school play and so it's

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.180 
princess in her school play and so it's
very<00:02:20.299> much<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> book<00:02:21.080> about<00:02:21.290> learning<00:02:21.980> to

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
very much a book about learning to

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.250 
very much a book about learning to
improvise<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.360> find<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.659> way<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.810> make<00:02:24.049> things

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
improvise and find a way to make things

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.289 
improvise and find a way to make things
work<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.799> I<00:02:24.830> think<00:02:25.040> that's<00:02:25.220> suitable<00:02:25.909> in<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
work and I think that's suitable in the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.509 
work and I think that's suitable in the
world<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.840> revision<00:02:27.290> too<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:28.099> is<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.310> book

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
world of revision too this is a book

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.850 
world of revision too this is a book
that<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.700> had<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.090> revise<00:02:29.239> an<00:02:29.599> awful<00:02:29.900> lot

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
that I had to revise an awful lot

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.220 
that I had to revise an awful lot
I<00:02:30.890> wrote<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.400> first<00:02:31.610> draft<00:02:31.819> of<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.810> sent

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
I wrote a first draft of it that I sent

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.110 
I wrote a first draft of it that I sent
to<00:02:33.290> my<00:02:33.560> literary<00:02:33.830> agent<00:02:34.190> she<00:02:34.610> loved<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:34.970> and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
to my literary agent she loved it and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.089 
to my literary agent she loved it and
said<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.019> think<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.470> should<00:02:36.500> start<00:02:36.950> over

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
said but I think you should start over

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.539 
said but I think you should start over
and<00:02:37.430> here's<00:02:37.970> why<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.319> rolled<00:02:39.920> my<00:02:40.010> eyes<00:02:40.280> and

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
and here's why and I rolled my eyes and

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.000 
and here's why and I rolled my eyes and
stomped<00:02:40.849> my<00:02:41.000> feet<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> little<00:02:41.390> bit<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.010> then

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
stomped my feet a little bit and then

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.130 
stomped my feet a little bit and then
realized<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:43.730> she<00:02:44.150> had<00:02:44.329> a<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:44.660> good<00:02:44.989> idea

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
realized that she had a really good idea

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.809 
realized that she had a really good idea
and<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.530> really<00:02:45.769> interesting<00:02:46.280> idea<00:02:46.579> that<00:02:46.610> would

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
and a really interesting idea that would

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.880 
and a really interesting idea that would
take<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.150> character<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.900> perhaps<00:02:48.650> a

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
take this character and a perhaps a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.650 
take this character and a perhaps a
better<00:02:49.040> stronger<00:02:49.370> direction<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.420> way<00:02:50.510> that

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
better stronger direction and a way that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.660 
better stronger direction and a way that
would<00:02:50.750> be<00:02:50.840> more<00:02:51.019> accessible<00:02:51.290> for<00:02:51.739> kids<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.640> I

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
would be more accessible for kids so I

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.339 
would be more accessible for kids so I
started<00:02:53.000> over<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.569> ended<00:02:53.870> up<00:02:53.930> with<00:02:54.109> a<00:02:54.140> book

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
started over and I ended up with a book

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.780 
started over and I ended up with a book
that<00:02:54.440> was<00:02:54.560> much<00:02:54.769> stronger<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.459> did<00:02:55.640> end

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
that was much stronger and that did end

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.970 
that was much stronger and that did end
up<00:02:55.879> selling<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.450> scholastic<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.829> that's

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
up selling to scholastic and that's

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.380 
up selling to scholastic and that's
actually<00:02:58.160> one<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.579> stories<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.120> tell

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
actually one of the stories that I tell

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.000 
actually one of the stories that I tell
in<00:02:59.510> real<00:02:59.690> revisions<00:03:00.200> sometimes<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:00.920> our

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
in real revisions sometimes for our

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.670 
in real revisions sometimes for our
students<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:02.180> very<00:03:02.359> best<00:03:02.690> way<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:02.900> revise<00:03:03.349> is

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
students the very best way to revise is

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.039 
students the very best way to revise is
to<00:03:04.099> just<00:03:05.000> give<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.209> another<00:03:05.299> try<00:03:05.660> from<00:03:05.930> the

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
to just give it another try from the

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.349 
to just give it another try from the
beginning<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.739> can<00:03:07.370> be<00:03:07.489> really<00:03:08.030> tough

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
beginning and that can be really tough

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.300 
beginning and that can be really tough
to<00:03:08.420> hear<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:09.109> it<00:03:09.260> was<00:03:09.379> hard<00:03:09.560> for<00:03:09.799> me<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.069> hear

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
to hear like it was hard for me to hear

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.910 
to hear like it was hard for me to hear
I<00:03:10.340> was<00:03:10.549> what<00:03:11.209> high<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:11.959> might<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:12.560> written<00:03:12.739> it

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
I was what high I might have written it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.650 
I was what high I might have written it
this<00:03:13.040> way<00:03:13.250> but<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.519> didn't<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.239> wrote<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.599> this

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
this way but I didn't I wrote it this

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.830 
this way but I didn't I wrote it this
way<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.140> here<00:03:15.349> it<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.790> think<00:03:16.849> kids<00:03:17.299> feel

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
way and here it is and I think kids feel

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.930 
way and here it is and I think kids feel
often<00:03:18.349> like<00:03:18.500> they've<00:03:18.680> put<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.190> much<00:03:19.489> work<00:03:19.730> into

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
often like they've put so much work into

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.390 
often like they've put so much work into
that<00:03:20.180> first<00:03:20.419> draft<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:21.769> want<00:03:21.950> me<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.099> go<00:03:22.250> back

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
that first draft you want me to go back

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.610 
that first draft you want me to go back
and<00:03:22.459> do<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.730> again<00:03:22.900> it's<00:03:23.900> just<00:03:24.109> overwhelming

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
and do it again it's just overwhelming

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.740 
and do it again it's just overwhelming
unless<00:03:25.370> they<00:03:25.549> realize<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.480> first

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
unless they realize that that first

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.259 
unless they realize that that first
draft<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.859> of<00:03:27.919> itself<00:03:28.250> has<00:03:28.579> value<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
draft in and of itself has value and
