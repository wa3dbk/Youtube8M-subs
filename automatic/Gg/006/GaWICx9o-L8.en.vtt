00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
candy glamoflauge um it is I have it in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.049 
candy glamoflauge um it is I have it in
shade<00:00:46.140> medium<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.219> also<00:00:47.430> comes<00:00:47.879> with

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.629> pencil<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.120> pencil<00:00:51.510> is

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a little pencil so I think the pencil is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.080 
a little pencil so I think the pencil is
meant<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.260> outline<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.399> tattoo<00:00:53.850> but

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
ones I have are writing so I just trace

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.660

over<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.460> kind<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
over it with this and it just kind of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910 
over it with this and it just kind of
helps<00:00:59.969> cancel<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> darkness<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
helps cancel out the darkness I do a

glamoflage<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.430> only<00:01:44.579> comes<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.060> three

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
glamoflage is it only comes in three

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.410 
glamoflage is it only comes in three
colors<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.460> shade<00:01:47.909> darker<00:01:48.270> than

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
colors and I have the shade darker than

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.630 
colors and I have the shade darker than
this<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.869> not<00:01:48.990> much<00:01:49.200> darker<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> are

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
this it's not much darker so if you are

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.249 
this it's not much darker so if you are
any<00:01:50.909> darker<00:01:51.360> you're<00:01:51.540> probably<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
any darker you're probably not going to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
instead of using this you could use

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
instead of using this you could use
translucent<00:02:28.320> powder<00:02:28.740> but<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.280> doesn't

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
translucent powder but it doesn't

translucent powder but it doesn't
photograph<00:02:30.000> well<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> are<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.140> to

be photographed you're going to have a
white<00:02:32.610> cast<00:02:32.850> exactly<00:02:33.420> where<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.720> put<00:02:33.960> that

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
white cast exactly where you put that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.040 
white cast exactly where you put that
cover<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.420> adds<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.780> little<00:02:36.960> bit

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
cover up and this just adds a little bit

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.990 
cover up and this just adds a little bit
extra<00:02:37.200> coverage<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.430> glamoflage

extra coverage with the glamoflage

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.930

concealer<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.350> after<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.880> a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
concealer so after that I know it's a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.310 
concealer so after that I know it's a
lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.180> steps<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.720> really<00:02:42.930> quick<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.140> easy

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
lot of steps it's really quick and easy

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.890 
lot of steps it's really quick and easy
though<00:02:43.850> but<00:02:44.850> after<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.630> want<00:02:45.840> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
though but after that you just want to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.360 
though but after that you just want to
spray<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.380> some<00:02:46.560> finishing<00:02:46.920> spray

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
spray it with some finishing spray

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.650 
spray it with some finishing spray
because<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.910> don't<00:02:48.090> want<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.390> look<00:02:48.480> all

Urban Decay D slick because I couldn't

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.020 
Urban Decay D slick because I couldn't
find<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.070> mean<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.520> any<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.910> can

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030

even<00:02:57.150> Swizz<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.570> with<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:57.960> water<00:02:58.140> you

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
even Swizz it with a little water you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.080 
even Swizz it with a little water you
just<00:02:58.800> don't<00:02:59.190> want<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.610> look<00:02:59.700> powdery

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
just don't want it to look powdery

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.220 
just don't want it to look powdery
because<00:03:00.330> that's<00:03:00.510> not<00:03:00.660> going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.840> look<00:03:00.990> natural

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
because that's not going to look natural

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.390 
because that's not going to look natural

little bit tacky err so it just kind of

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.800

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
rub it back and forth because that's not

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.290 
rub it back and forth because that's not
going<00:03:59.770> to<00:03:59.830> let<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.130> sit<00:04:00.400> on<00:04:00.550> top<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.060> skin

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300

going to let it sit on top of the skin
and<00:04:01.510> on<00:04:01.690> top<00:04:01.960> of<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.230> tattoo

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.810 

so<00:04:15.439> as<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.739> can<00:04:15.860> see<00:04:15.920> I'm<00:04:16.250> kind<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.609> blending

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
so as you can see I'm kind of blending

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.969 
so as you can see I'm kind of blending
it<00:04:17.120> out<00:04:17.269> around<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.959> tattoo<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.470> just<00:04:18.799> wanted

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
it out around the tattoo I just wanted

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.580 
it out around the tattoo I just wanted
to<00:04:19.130> cut<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.729> kind<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.030> fade<00:04:20.329> into<00:04:20.600> my<00:04:20.959> skin<00:04:21.350> now

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
to cut to kind of fade into my skin now

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.350 
to cut to kind of fade into my skin now
I<00:04:21.620> know<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:22.070> doesn't<00:04:22.250> match<00:04:22.580> my<00:04:22.610> skin<00:04:23.120> color

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
I know it doesn't match my skin color

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.939 
I know it doesn't match my skin color
and<00:04:23.660> that's<00:04:24.169> okay<00:04:24.530> because<00:04:24.620> we're<00:04:24.800> going<00:04:24.889> to

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
and that's okay because we're going to

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.010 
and that's okay because we're going to
fix<00:04:25.160> that<00:04:25.280> later<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:25.880> just<00:04:25.940> wanted<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.540> like

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
using the urban decay because I couldn't

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.390 
using the urban decay because I couldn't
find<00:07:02.330> my<00:07:02.480> ELF<00:07:02.690> but<00:07:03.350> any<00:07:03.590> setting<00:07:03.980> spray<00:07:04.220> will

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
find my ELF but any setting spray will

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.890 
find my ELF but any setting spray will
work<00:07:04.580> and<00:07:04.790> you're<00:07:04.970> just<00:07:05.120> doing<00:07:05.420> this<00:07:05.540> to<00:07:05.780> get

rid<00:07:06.110> of<00:07:06.140> that<00:07:06.320> powdery<00:07:06.770> look<00:07:07.040> because<00:07:07.250> that

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
rid of that powdery look because that

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.720 
rid of that powdery look because that
looks<00:07:07.640> very<00:07:08.000> unnatural

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730
