big break in the rail line like this

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.739 
big break in the rail line like this
gives<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:47.920> pivot<00:00:48.339> point<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:48.850> turn<00:00:49.269> in<00:00:49.449> small

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
gives you a pivot point to turn in small
