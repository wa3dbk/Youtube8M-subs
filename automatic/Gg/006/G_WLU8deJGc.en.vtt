00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
their final stop motions but I use ol

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.400 
their final stop motions but I use ol

powerdirector<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:51.599> could<00:03:51.780> change<00:03:51.959> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
powerdirector and you could change the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.890 
powerdirector and you could change the
speed<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.859> lower<00:03:53.099> than<00:03:53.549> 0.25<00:03:55.250> which<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:57.150> the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
programs in the description some a lot

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.409 
programs in the description some a lot
of<00:04:22.260> them<00:04:22.349> aren't<00:04:22.590> free<00:04:22.949> but<00:04:23.820> there<00:04:23.969> are<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> lot

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419

of them aren't free but there are a lot
of<00:04:24.450> free<00:04:24.719> programs<00:04:25.139> out<00:04:25.349> there

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.660 

the<00:04:28.660> best<00:04:28.930> would<00:04:29.290> probably<00:04:29.740> be<00:04:29.890> stop<00:04:30.280> motion

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
the best would probably be stop motion

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.210 
the best would probably be stop motion
pro<00:04:31.320> which<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.530> like<00:04:33.120> six<00:04:34.120> hundred<00:04:34.480> dollars

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
pro which is like six hundred dollars

it does help people get better at stop

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:55.449 
it does help people get better at stop
