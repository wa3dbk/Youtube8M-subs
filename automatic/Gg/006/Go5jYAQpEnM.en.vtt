00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi girls how are you in your taste like 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.950
 always greet you here in this your channel 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.770
 from the beginning this time I'm going 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.170
 to present this design today is a design 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.010
 very subtle very beautiful and we can 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.470
 employ both on a special occasion 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.830
 and even lends itself to a design 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.840
 Christmas since these flowers can 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.900
 represent white poinsettias and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.170
 golden touches give a very 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.540
 special for this christmas 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.850
 let's use what seals are and 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.449
 little else there are many brands 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.460
 I occupy a Chinese brand of the model of 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.210
 65 what is the plate 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.769
 and this is a very simple seal 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.410
 I used what glazes are for 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.350
 signature brand stamps are these 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.510
 mini enamels that really give you very 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.579
 good consistency to the objective that 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.680
 we have that is the seal let's start 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.739
 with our nails completely clean 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.180
 dry and with a base of enamel to 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:10.210
 next we are going to apply a glaze 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.789
 pink and then we will apply 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.170
 what is the seal on the disc we are going 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.090
 to apply the enamel 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.060
 in this case I occupy special enamel 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.540
 it gets 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 be me 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.600
 and it is applied on the nail is something very 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 simple clean, I used thinner 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.210
 to clean both the disk and the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.850
 seal the rubber stamp is made the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.770
 same procedure and it is very important 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.750
 tell them that if there is no stamp 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.780
 how it should be or is not complete 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.300
 we have to delete it and return it to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.720
 apply so that it is complete and remains 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.659
 well in what is our nail like that remains 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.850
 complete is perfect 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.219
 and if it is not going to be with small 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.689
 details although they are little visible to 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.260
 next I will occupy a glaze 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.670
 golden bisou 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.040
 in the French style 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.009
 If necessary, we will apply a 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.229
 second layer this depends on taste 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.600
 from each one I prefer two layers 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.980
 because it gives a better look 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.430
 let dry perfectly 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.900
 and then we will apply with a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.670
 pointer with the same gold enamel 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.610
 dots at the base of the nail in the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.709
 curve that goes over the cuticle in that 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.019
 curvita let's apply the points the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.480
 they can apply either gold or 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.840
 including white so that you notice a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.400
 little more or that they are more defined in 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.660
 this case I apply them simple and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.930
 simply in gold as it 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.380
 and climb the curve to the top of 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.380
 The nail 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.290
 It will be and is 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.160
 it is very beautiful it is very easy to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.560
 perform 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.450
 and I hope that this design has been 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.940
 Your liking that you enjoy it very much if it is 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.960

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.650
 and see you next video
