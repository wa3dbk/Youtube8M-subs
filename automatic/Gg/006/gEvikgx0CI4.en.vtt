awesome<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.810> let's<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.260> unlocked

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
awesome so let's just unlocked

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.840 
awesome so let's just unlocked
I'm<00:02:15.510> guessing<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.470> cannot<00:02:16.800> open<00:02:17.190> packs

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
I'm guessing that we cannot open packs

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.310 
I'm guessing that we cannot open packs
with<00:02:18.060> real<00:02:18.300> money<00:02:18.540> until<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
with real money until you have the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.110 
with real money until you have the
retail<00:02:19.680> version<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> game<00:02:20.550> like<00:02:21.090> last

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
retail version of the game like last

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.240 
retail version of the game like last
year<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.320> only<00:02:22.440> open<00:02:22.650> packs<00:02:23.010> with

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
year so you can only open packs with

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.430 
year so you can only open packs with
coins<00:02:23.550> but<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:24.480> going<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.840> very<00:02:24.870> very

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.670
