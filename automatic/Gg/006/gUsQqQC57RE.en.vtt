Birds up to the top of the tower at a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040 
Birds up to the top of the tower at a
time<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:44.190> throw<00:00:44.430> them<00:00:44.579> off<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.149> tower<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.930> at

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
time we throw them off the tower one at

that bird
guys<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.980> typically<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.879> through<00:00:53.910> around

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
guys will typically go through around

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.020 
guys will typically go through around
two<00:00:54.840> boxes<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.260> shells<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.039> would<00:00:56.579> encourage

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
two boxes of shells I would encourage

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
two boxes of shells I would encourage
you<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> bring<00:00:57.539> even<00:00:58.170> three<00:00:58.379> boxes<00:00:59.149> it<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you to bring even three boxes it is a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.549 
you to bring even three boxes it is a
lot<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.570> shooting<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:03.199> pheasants<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.320> very

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
lot of shooting the pheasants are very

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.109 
lot of shooting the pheasants are very
wind<00:01:05.040> sensitive<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.990> we<00:01:07.040> we<00:01:08.040> try<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.310> spread<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
wind sensitive so we we try to spread it

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
wind sensitive so we we try to spread it
out<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.360> much<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:10.950> like

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
out as much as we can but they do like

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.200 
out as much as we can but they do like
to<00:01:11.310> fly<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> wind<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.290> reason<00:01:13.650> we

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
to fly with the wind for that reason we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.070 
to fly with the wind for that reason we
have<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.220> guys<00:01:17.400> rotate<00:01:18.060> after<00:01:18.450> ten<00:01:18.810> Birds

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
have the the guys rotate after ten Birds

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.770 
have the the guys rotate after ten Birds
so<00:01:19.520> we'll<00:01:20.520> take<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> crate<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> birds<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
so we'll take a crate of birds up to the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.270 
so we'll take a crate of birds up to the
top<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.229> tower

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
top of the tower

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.280 
top of the tower
throw<00:01:24.970> them<00:01:25.090> out<00:01:25.240> one<00:01:25.570> at<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.750> time<00:01:25.960> whatever

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
throw them out one at a time whatever

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.930 
throw them out one at a time whatever
direction<00:01:26.560> they<00:01:26.920> go<00:01:27.100> that's<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.550> guys<00:01:27.730> that

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
direction they go that's the guys that

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.790 
direction they go that's the guys that
get<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.360> shooting<00:01:28.690> at<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:29.080> particular<00:01:29.260> bird

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
after we do that for ten Birds we run

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.660 
after we do that for ten Birds we run
the<00:01:33.490> crate<00:01:33.700> down<00:01:33.910> lift<00:01:34.780> another<00:01:34.990> crate<00:01:35.320> up

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the crate down lift another crate up

the crate down lift another crate up
while<00:01:36.670> we're<00:01:36.820> moving<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.270> crate<00:01:37.810> up<00:01:37.960> and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
while we're moving that crate up and

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.170 
while we're moving that crate up and
down<00:01:38.290> that's<00:01:38.830> when<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.160> guys<00:01:39.310> rotate<00:01:39.790> we
