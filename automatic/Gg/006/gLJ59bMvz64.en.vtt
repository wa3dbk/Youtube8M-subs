00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
install of the top CAD cage on the

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.440 
install of the top CAD cage on the
Wraiths<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.710> cage<00:00:12.040> I<00:00:12.280> did<00:00:12.550> get<00:00:12.820> from<00:00:12.880> Asia

Wraiths that cage I did get from Asia

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.650 
Wraiths that cage I did get from Asia
T's<00:00:16.260> last<00:00:17.260> look<00:00:17.590> at<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:18.420> poison<00:00:19.420> spider

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
T's last look at the poison spider

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.939 
T's last look at the poison spider
before<00:00:19.900> we<00:00:20.140> change<00:00:20.349> things<00:00:20.589> up<00:00:22.410> nice<00:00:23.410> big<00:00:23.679> box

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
here push that to the side and I did do

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.579 
here push that to the side and I did do
an<00:00:27.820> unboxing<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.419> this<00:00:28.570> so<00:00:28.869> for<00:00:29.140> those<00:00:29.259> of<00:00:29.320> you

an unboxing of this so for those of you
who<00:00:29.739> have<00:00:29.859> seen<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:30.279> you<00:00:30.429> know<00:00:30.460> what<00:00:30.699> I'm

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
who have seen it you know what I'm

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.850 
who have seen it you know what I'm
pulling<00:00:31.150> out<00:00:31.239> and<00:00:31.509> for<00:00:32.200> those<00:00:32.470> who<00:00:32.650> haven't

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
pulling out and for those who haven't

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.020 
pulling out and for those who haven't
well<00:00:33.100> you're<00:00:33.220> gonna<00:00:33.310> be<00:00:33.400> seeing<00:00:33.700> it<00:00:33.790> here<00:00:33.910> for

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
well you're gonna be seeing it here for

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.979 
well you're gonna be seeing it here for
the<00:00:34.120> first<00:00:34.300> time<00:00:36.300> trying<00:00:37.300> to<00:00:37.359> fish<00:00:37.539> this<00:00:37.780> out

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
the first time trying to fish this out

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.720 
the first time trying to fish this out
probably<00:00:38.559> don't<00:00:38.859> want<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.039> lose<00:00:39.219> you<00:00:39.370> got<00:00:39.520> some

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
probably don't want to lose you got some

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.610 
probably don't want to lose you got some
LEDs<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:40.570> some<00:00:40.690> free-flowing<00:00:41.079> parts<00:00:41.440> in

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
LEDs and some free-flowing parts in

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.810 
LEDs and some free-flowing parts in
their<00:00:43.199> panels<00:00:44.199> aside<00:00:44.559> and<00:00:45.039> we're<00:00:45.489> gonna<00:00:45.579> grab

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
their panels aside and we're gonna grab

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.599 
their panels aside and we're gonna grab
all<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.809> LEDs<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:47.649> that<00:00:47.829> extra<00:00:48.070> plastic

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
all the LEDs and that extra plastic

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.549 
all the LEDs and that extra plastic
stuff<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:50.649> into<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.070> bag<00:00:51.280> temporarily<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
stuff back into the bag temporarily so

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.799 
stuff back into the bag temporarily so
we<00:00:53.739> don't<00:00:53.890> lose<00:00:54.100> anything<00:00:54.399> and<00:00:54.789> just<00:00:55.269> leave

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
we don't lose anything and just leave

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.090 
we don't lose anything and just leave
the<00:00:55.929> hardware<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.500> get<00:00:56.620> everything<00:00:56.829> connected

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
the hardware to get everything connected

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:07.410 
the hardware to get everything connected
up<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:58.239> side<00:01:01.170> unravel<00:01:02.170> our<00:01:02.260> panels<00:01:06.420> throw

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
up to the side unravel our panels throw

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.359 
up to the side unravel our panels throw
that<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:07.990> side<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.990> quick<00:01:11.890> look<00:01:12.070> at<00:01:12.220> the

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
that to the side and a quick look at the

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
that to the side and a quick look at the
cage<00:01:12.579> here<00:01:15.210> very<00:01:16.210> nice<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.930> looks<00:01:17.170> very<00:01:17.799> clean

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cage here very nice it looks very clean

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.899 
cage here very nice it looks very clean
so<00:01:20.380> first<00:01:20.740> things<00:01:20.920> first<00:01:20.979> there<00:01:21.790> you're

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
so first things first there you're

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.660 
so first things first there you're
cracking<00:01:22.210> on<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.720> tear<00:01:22.930> down<00:01:23.140> this<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:24.280> very

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
cracking on the tear down this is a very

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.240 
cracking on the tear down this is a very
simple<00:01:25.090> one<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.869> we<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.110> four<00:01:26.470> screws<00:01:26.799> both

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
simple one so we have four screws both

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.039 
simple one so we have four screws both
sides<00:01:27.579> which<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.030> gonna<00:01:28.149> release<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.750> skid

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
sides which is gonna release the skid

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.450 
sides which is gonna release the skid
plate<00:01:32.399> gotta<00:01:33.399> learn<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:33.640> shut<00:01:33.909> that<00:01:34.090> off<00:01:35.460> all

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
plate gotta learn to shut that off all

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.060 
plate gotta learn to shut that off all
right<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:36.969> next<00:01:37.390> two<00:01:38.200> screws<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.560> get<00:01:38.829> the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
right and next two screws to get the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.649 
right and next two screws to get the
shocks<00:01:39.399> off<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.969> already<00:01:40.180> did<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.450> other<00:01:40.570> side

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
shocks off I already did the other side

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.990 
shocks off I already did the other side
so<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.259> cage<00:01:41.469> is<00:01:41.649> free<00:01:41.920> now<00:01:42.130> all<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:42.729> have<00:01:42.850> to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
so the cage is free now all we have to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
so the cage is free now all we have to
do<00:01:43.149> is<00:01:43.420> fish<00:01:44.049> through<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.350> electronics

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
do is fish through the electronics

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.529 
do is fish through the electronics
wiggle<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.829> ESC<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.240> receiver<00:01:49.659> free<00:01:51.539> and

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
wiggle the ESC and the receiver free and

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.080 
wiggle the ESC and the receiver free and
this<00:01:53.200> was<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.530> hard<00:01:53.680> part<00:01:53.740> here<00:01:54.100> fishing<00:01:54.939> the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
this was the hard part here fishing the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.060 
this was the hard part here fishing the
stuff<00:01:55.360> from<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.780> old<00:01:56.020> race<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.649> interior

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
stuff from the old race the interior

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.520 
stuff from the old race the interior
back<00:01:57.280> into<00:01:57.610> this<00:01:57.759> cage<00:01:58.060> but<00:01:58.750> we're<00:01:58.990> there<00:01:59.200> so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
back into this cage but we're there so

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.219 
back into this cage but we're there so
now<00:01:59.680> we're<00:01:59.770> gonna<00:01:59.890> move<00:02:00.070> on<00:02:00.219> to<00:02:00.250> our<00:02:00.520> panels<00:02:01.229> so

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
now we're gonna move on to our panels so

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.240 
now we're gonna move on to our panels so
we're<00:02:02.320> going<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.530> show<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.680> one<00:02:02.859> quick<00:02:02.890> one

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
we're going to show you one quick one

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.340 
we're going to show you one quick one
here<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:03.789> got<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.000> clip<00:02:04.210> screw<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.170> net

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
here so you got the clip screw and a net

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.310 
here so you got the clip screw and a net
underneath<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.939> do<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.299> up<00:02:07.479> off<00:02:07.659> camera<00:02:08.110> cuz

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
underneath to do that up off camera cuz

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.809 
underneath to do that up off camera cuz
they<00:02:08.470> are<00:02:08.500> lots<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.550> them<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:09.940> was<00:02:10.030> tedious

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
they are lots of them and it was tedious

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.300 
they are lots of them and it was tedious
but<00:02:12.819> it's<00:02:13.450> done<00:02:13.690> looking<00:02:14.349> clean<00:02:14.560> ready<00:02:15.099> for

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
but it's done looking clean ready for

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.510 
but it's done looking clean ready for
reassembly

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
reassembly

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.590 
reassembly
so<00:02:16.790> fish<00:02:17.360> electronics<00:02:18.050> through<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:19.510> little<00:02:20.510> bit

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
so fish electronics through a little bit

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.580 
so fish electronics through a little bit
of<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.750> snugger<00:02:21.050> fit<00:02:21.170> than<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.860> poison<00:02:22.640> spider

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
of a snugger fit than the poison spider

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.880 
of a snugger fit than the poison spider
but<00:02:24.590> we<00:02:24.830> will<00:02:25.100> be<00:02:25.310> able<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.580> fit<00:02:25.850> everything<00:02:26.120> in

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.440 
that up off later on with a little piece
of<00:03:44.690> lexan<00:03:45.020> so<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.320> can't<00:03:45.530> see<00:03:45.800> through<00:03:46.450> but

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
of lexan so you can't see through but

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.190 
of lexan so you can't see through but
for<00:03:47.660> now<00:03:47.810> still<00:03:48.530> loving<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.890> look<00:03:49.040> at<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:49.340> as

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
for now still loving a look at this as

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.570 
for now still loving a look at this as
all<00:03:51.200> my<00:03:51.380> stuff<00:03:51.620> we'd<00:03:51.950> be<00:03:52.100> putting<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.550> the

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
all my stuff we'd be putting it to the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.170 
all my stuff we'd be putting it to the
test<00:03:54.130> but<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.370> only<00:03:55.490> thing<00:03:55.670> left<00:03:55.850> on<00:03:56.030> the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
test but the only thing left on the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.970 
test but the only thing left on the
Wraith<00:03:56.330> right<00:03:56.600> now<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:57.020> is<00:03:57.170> not<00:03:57.440> all<00:03:57.680> hopped

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980

Wraith right now that is not all hopped
up<00:03:58.190> would<00:03:58.550> be<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.850> skid<00:03:59.120> plate<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.600> shocks

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
up would be the skid plate and shocks

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.010 
up would be the skid plate and shocks
which<00:04:00.320> would<00:04:00.500> be<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.710> next<00:04:00.980> change<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.750> here

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020

we got the LEDs gonna fish some

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.330
