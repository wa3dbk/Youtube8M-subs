on<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.010> recently<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.730> tried<00:00:09.630> out<00:00:10.080> some

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
on it recently I tried out some

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.959 
on it recently I tried out some
adpositions<00:00:10.980> egg<00:00:11.160> which<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.490> failed<00:00:11.670> at

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
adpositions egg which I failed at

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.280 
adpositions egg which I failed at
miserably<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:12.840> not<00:00:12.990> going<00:00:13.230> anywhere

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
miserably but it's not going anywhere

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.880 
miserably but it's not going anywhere
and<00:00:14.299> I<00:00:15.299> made<00:00:15.509> another<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.619> these<00:00:16.740> little

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and I made another one of these little

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.650 
and I made another one of these little
plate<00:00:17.160> things<00:00:17.400> at<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> top<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
plate things at the top of this for the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.439 
plate things at the top of this for the
exhaust<00:00:18.960> style<00:00:19.320> together<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.090> that's<00:00:21.270> all

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
exhaust style together and so that's all

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.109 
exhaust style together and so that's all
good<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> inside<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> cut<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:23.789> another

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
good and on the inside I cut up another

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.970 
good and on the inside I cut up another
piece<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.689> mesh<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.619> our<00:00:25.769> cooking

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
piece of mesh and so we have our cooking

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.169 
piece of mesh and so we have our cooking
surface<00:00:26.519> all<00:00:26.699> made<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.820> all<00:00:29.970> good

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
building something we're gonna build the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
building something we're gonna build the
fourth<00:00:45.120> fence<00:00:45.420> line<00:00:45.629> roller<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.079> series

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
fourth fence line roller in the series

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.350 
fourth fence line roller in the series
now<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> picked<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.149> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
now as you all know I picked up this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
now as you all know I picked up this
material<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.230> finish<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> third<00:00:49.800> fence<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
material to finish the third fence and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.750 
material to finish the third fence and
roller<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> series<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.340> yeah<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> guess

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
roller in the series and yeah so I guess

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
kind of tired of watching me build these

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040 
kind of tired of watching me build these
things<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.309> y'all<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.910> watched<00:01:00.120> three<00:01:00.719> parts

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
things as y'all just watched three parts

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.920 
things as y'all just watched three parts
of<00:01:01.170> me<00:01:01.260> building<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> third<00:01:01.859> fence<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.280> roller

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
of me building the third fence on roller

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
of me building the third fence on roller
but<00:01:03.930> ah<00:01:04.260> too<00:01:04.650> bad<00:01:05.240> now<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:07.110> though<00:01:07.320> some

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
but ah too bad now I really though some

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280

people<00:01:08.430> supposedly<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.600> their<00:01:09.780> fence<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> be

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
people supposedly like their fence to be

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.050 
people supposedly like their fence to be
unrolled<00:01:10.560> horizontally<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.549> some<00:01:11.790> people

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
unrolled horizontally and some people

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.480 
unrolled horizontally and some people
prefer<00:01:12.240> done<00:01:12.720> vertically<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> seeing<00:01:14.400> as

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
prefer done vertically and seeing as

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.010 
prefer done vertically and seeing as
people<00:01:14.520> buy<00:01:14.909> both<00:01:15.210> kinds<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:15.689> gonna<00:01:15.840> make

people buy both kinds I'm gonna make
both<00:01:16.350> kinds<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.210> money

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and yeah so I need a good design of each

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.740 
and yeah so I need a good design of each
and<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> design<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> third<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and I like the design of the third one I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
and I like the design of the third one I
mean<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.950> perfect<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:26.610> any<00:01:26.640> means<00:01:26.850> I'm

not an engineer I don't claim to be but
it<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> simple<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.850> functional<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:31.110> pretty

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it is simple it's functional it's pretty

the other design of the second fence on
roller<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.890> didn't<00:01:41.070> make<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> video<00:01:41.490> about

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
roller which I didn't make a video about

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
roller which I didn't make a video about
because<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> had<00:01:42.659> strep<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.340> so

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
because I was when I had strep and so

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.010 
because I was when I had strep and so
I'm<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.579> gonna<00:01:44.670> make<00:01:44.909> another<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.420> just

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
I'm just gonna make another one just

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.179 
I'm just gonna make another one just
like<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.740> I'll<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.979> my<00:01:47.130> two

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
like that and then I'll have my two

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.580 
like that and then I'll have my two
designs<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.049> vertical<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
designs and you know one vertical and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
designs and you know one vertical and
one<00:01:49.680> horizontal<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.030> world's<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> better

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
one horizontal and the world's a better

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.109 
one horizontal and the world's a better
place<00:01:51.630> somehow<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.520> don't<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.790> well

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
place somehow I think I don't know well

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:20.800 
place somehow I think I don't know well
anyway<00:01:54.420> let's<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.780> it

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.220 

okay<00:02:23.810> let's<00:02:24.810> leave

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.110 

because<00:02:28.440> work<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.099> I<00:02:29.129> guess

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:03:29.130 

that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.920 

okay<00:03:29.890> YouTube<00:03:30.100> so<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.880> got<00:03:31.030> my<00:03:31.150> nice<00:03:31.330> nice<00:03:31.600> we're

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
okay YouTube so I got my nice nice we're

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.530 
okay YouTube so I got my nice nice we're
sitting<00:03:32.440> over<00:03:32.500> here<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:33.130> basically<00:03:33.760> once

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
sitting over here and basically once

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.660 
sitting over here and basically once
this<00:03:34.780> thing<00:03:34.960> is<00:03:35.080> built<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.710> 40<00:03:36.280> inch<00:03:36.400> piece

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
this thing is built that 40 inch piece

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.640 
this thing is built that 40 inch piece
of<00:03:36.850> plate<00:03:37.060> hard<00:03:37.540> sheet<00:03:37.960> I<00:03:38.200> guess<00:03:38.410> it's<00:03:38.560> still

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
of plate hard sheet I guess it's still

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.190 
of plate hard sheet I guess it's still
technically<00:03:39.190> sheet<00:03:39.550> is<00:03:40.180> gonna<00:03:40.420> sit<00:03:40.690> up<00:03:40.720> here

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
technically sheet is gonna sit up here

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.500 
technically sheet is gonna sit up here
and<00:03:41.350> we're<00:03:42.160> gonna<00:03:42.250> need<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.610> put<00:03:42.880> some<00:03:43.090> type<00:03:43.390> of

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
and we're gonna need to put some type of

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.210 
and we're gonna need to put some type of
angle<00:03:43.810> supports<00:03:44.230> underneath<00:03:44.530> there<00:03:44.890> and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
angle supports underneath there and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.730 
angle supports underneath there and
since<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.240> raided<00:03:46.420> my<00:03:46.660> scrap<00:03:46.960> bin<00:03:47.170> I<00:03:47.200> don't<00:03:47.500> have

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
since I raided my scrap bin I don't have

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.350 
since I raided my scrap bin I don't have
any<00:03:47.890> four-inch<00:03:48.460> angle<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.970> really<00:03:49.210> want

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
any four-inch angle that I really want

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.750 
any four-inch angle that I really want
to<00:03:49.420> sacrifice<00:03:49.630> on<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.320> project<00:03:50.920> we're<00:03:51.580> just

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
to sacrifice on this project we're just

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.220 
to sacrifice on this project we're just
gonna<00:03:51.910> put<00:03:52.150> some<00:03:52.180> two<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.630> half<00:03:52.780> inch<00:03:53.020> like

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
gonna put some two and a half inch like

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.360 
gonna put some two and a half inch like
that<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:54.640> then<00:03:55.510> while<00:03:56.380> these<00:03:56.650> smaller<00:03:57.040> pieces

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
that and then while these smaller pieces

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.420 
that and then while these smaller pieces
like<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.800> I'll<00:03:59.860> keep<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.190> off<00:04:00.280> the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
like that and I'll keep it off the

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.330 
like that and I'll keep it off the
ground<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.390> that<00:04:01.450> chop<00:04:02.410> saw<00:04:02.650> blade<00:04:02.890> is<00:04:02.920> really

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
ground and that chop saw blade is really

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.520 
ground and that chop saw blade is really
pretty<00:04:03.700> much<00:04:03.820> done<00:04:04.180> for<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.780> know<00:04:05.050> there's<00:04:05.380> no

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
pretty much done for I know there's no

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.930 
pretty much done for I know there's no
way<00:04:05.650> it's<00:04:05.770> going<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:05.950> go<00:04:06.070> through<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.520> piece

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
way it's going to go through the piece

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.910 
way it's going to go through the piece
of<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.180> beam<00:04:07.390> we<00:04:07.540> have<00:04:07.570> but<00:04:08.440> hopefully<00:04:08.770> I<00:04:08.800> can

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
of I beam we have but hopefully I can

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.530 
of I beam we have but hopefully I can
get<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.190> couple<00:04:09.340> more<00:04:09.640> cuts<00:04:09.850> out<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.300> on<00:04:10.420> the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
get a couple more cuts out of it on the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.240 
get a couple more cuts out of it on the
smaller<00:04:10.840> angle<00:04:11.110> before<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.650> put<00:04:11.800> my<00:04:11.920> new<00:04:12.040> blade

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
smaller angle before I put my new blade

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:37.280 
smaller angle before I put my new blade
on<00:04:12.489> there

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.740

all right so yeah let's play bags on

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.230 
all right so yeah let's play bags on
here<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.350> starting<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.160> look<00:04:41.250> like<00:04:41.490> something

all right YouTube so as you guys okay I
got<00:05:11.430> this<00:05:11.580> beautiful<00:05:11.940> plate<00:05:12.800> tectonic<00:05:13.800> on

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
got this beautiful plate tectonic on

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.710 
got this beautiful plate tectonic on
here<00:05:14.160> at<00:05:14.250> stitch<00:05:14.460> welded<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.060> across<00:05:15.300> here

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
here at stitch welded and across here

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.190 
here at stitch welded and across here
and<00:05:16.790> so<00:05:17.790> yeah<00:05:18.090> basically<00:05:18.360> now<00:05:18.810> we<00:05:18.870> just<00:05:19.020> have

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
and so yeah basically now we just have

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.570 
and so yeah basically now we just have
to<00:05:19.260> drill<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.680> hole<00:05:19.830> where<00:05:19.980> that<00:05:20.130> holes<00:05:20.340> can

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
to drill the hole where that holes can

00:05:20.580 --> 00:06:05.090 
to drill the hole where that holes can
come<00:05:20.790> down<00:05:20.970> through<00:05:21.270> this<00:05:21.360> let's<00:05:21.630> do<00:05:21.840> it

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.920 

all<00:06:06.100> right<00:06:06.370> you<00:06:06.520> guys<00:06:06.700> so<00:06:07.180> we<00:06:07.360> got<00:06:07.390> us<00:06:07.630> a<00:06:07.750> nice

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
all right you guys so we got us a nice

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.110 
all right you guys so we got us a nice
hole<00:06:08.170> drilled<00:06:08.470> in<00:06:08.620> there<00:06:08.920> and<00:06:09.310> I<00:06:09.790> guess<00:06:09.970> the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
hole drilled in there and I guess the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.730 
hole drilled in there and I guess the
next<00:06:10.150> thing<00:06:10.540> we're<00:06:10.690> gonna<00:06:10.750> do<00:06:11.020> is<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:11.500> cut<00:06:11.650> out

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
next thing we're gonna do is to cut out

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.530 
next thing we're gonna do is to cut out
a<00:06:11.800> second<00:06:12.250> one<00:06:12.340> of<00:06:12.430> these<00:06:12.520> triangle<00:06:13.060> gussets

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
a second one of these triangle gussets

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.130 
a second one of these triangle gussets
this<00:06:14.170> one's<00:06:14.410> gonna<00:06:14.560> go<00:06:15.450> sort<00:06:16.450> of<00:06:16.540> like<00:06:16.690> that<00:06:16.930> I

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
this one's gonna go sort of like that I

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.600 
this one's gonna go sort of like that I
want<00:06:17.440> to<00:06:17.500> make<00:06:17.620> another<00:06:17.890> one<00:06:18.010> that<00:06:18.250> will<00:06:18.340> go<00:06:18.430> on

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
want to make another one that will go on
