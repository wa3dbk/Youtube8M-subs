00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
the backing plate right so the backing

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.640 
the backing plate right so the backing
plate<00:00:30.169> goes<00:00:30.380> on<00:00:30.529> like<00:00:30.650> this<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:36.230> pad<00:00:36.440> like

plate goes on like this and the pad like

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.400 
plate goes on like this and the pad like
this<00:00:37.210> and<00:00:38.470> with<00:00:39.470> a<00:00:39.500> hit<00:00:39.920> of<00:00:39.950> a<00:00:40.130> button

this and with a hit of a button
okay<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:43.990> rotary<00:00:44.990> polishers<00:00:45.470> generally

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
okay now rotary polishers generally

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.090 
okay now rotary polishers generally
rotates<00:00:46.520> around<00:00:46.730> 600<00:00:47.630> rpms<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.260> 2,000<00:00:48.650> rpms

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
rotates around 600 rpms to 2,000 rpms

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.520 
rotates around 600 rpms to 2,000 rpms
for<00:00:49.640> detailing<00:00:50.030> use<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:50.540> normally<00:00:50.870> go<00:00:51.170> not

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
for detailing use we normally go not

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.640 
for detailing use we normally go not
more<00:00:51.830> than<00:00:51.980> 2,000<00:00:52.520> rpms<00:00:52.940> as<00:00:53.530> anything<00:00:54.530> more

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
more than 2,000 rpms as anything more

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.560 
more than 2,000 rpms as anything more
than<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:54.980> actually<00:00:55.460> more<00:00:55.940> butchering

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
than that is actually more butchering

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.380 
than that is actually more butchering
the<00:00:56.690> pinion<00:00:56.930> work<00:00:57.080> other<00:00:57.380> than<00:00:57.440> polishing<00:00:57.980> it

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
the pinion work other than polishing it

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.130 
the pinion work other than polishing it
but<00:00:59.390> yeah<00:01:00.230> anyway<00:01:00.830> because<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:01.760> rotates<00:01:02.060> in<00:01:02.540> a

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
but yeah anyway because it rotates in a

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.710 
but yeah anyway because it rotates in a
single<00:01:03.410> axis<00:01:03.800> right<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:04.879> you<00:01:05.390> will<00:01:05.509> create

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
single axis right so you will create

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.470 
single axis right so you will create
more<00:01:06.020> heat<00:01:06.549> you'll<00:01:07.549> break<00:01:07.850> down<00:01:08.090> the

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
more heat you'll break down the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.870 
more heat you'll break down the
polishing<00:01:08.990> compound<00:01:09.409> faster<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.820> are

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
polishing compound faster and you are

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.120 
polishing compound faster and you are
able<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.180> remove<00:01:11.480> more<00:01:11.750> defects<00:01:12.290> with<00:01:12.920> it

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
able to remove more defects with it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.730 
able to remove more defects with it
right<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:13.790> defects<00:01:14.570> like<00:01:14.659> I'm<00:01:14.960> standing<00:01:15.200> marks

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
right so defects like I'm standing marks

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.870 
right so defects like I'm standing marks
or<00:01:15.980> oxidation<00:01:16.820> acid<00:01:17.450> rain<00:01:17.630> marks<00:01:18.020> right<00:01:18.530> those

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
or oxidation acid rain marks right those

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.830 
or oxidation acid rain marks right those
even<00:01:19.880> orange<00:01:20.150> peel<00:01:20.330> yeah

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
even orange peel yeah

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.740 
even orange peel yeah
those<00:01:21.080> can<00:01:21.320> be<00:01:21.350> gone<00:01:22.300> effortlessly<00:01:23.300> with<00:01:23.570> this

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
those can be gone effortlessly with this

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.290 
those can be gone effortlessly with this
right<00:01:24.620> to<00:01:25.010> further<00:01:25.250> illustrate<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.909> use<00:01:26.090> of
