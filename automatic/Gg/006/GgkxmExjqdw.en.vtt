drops or whatever you want to use for

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.590 
drops or whatever you want to use for
that<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> did<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.549> some<00:02:02.759> pigmentation<00:02:03.390> off

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
that so I did get some pigmentation off

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.870 
that so I did get some pigmentation off
of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> color<00:02:04.140> trick<00:02:04.530> from<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> naked<00:02:05.189> 3<00:02:05.340> but

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
of the color trick from the naked 3 but

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.119 
of the color trick from the naked 3 but
then<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.390> discovered<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.350> palette<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.979> they

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
then I discovered this palette and they

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.999 
then I discovered this palette and they
have<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.670> color<00:02:09.270> right<00:02:09.539> here<00:02:09.569> which<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.649> very

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009

very

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.030 
very
comparable<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.760> trick<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:14.470> comes<00:02:14.799> off

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
comparable to trick and it comes off

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.759 
comparable to trick and it comes off
perfect<00:02:15.909> like<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.599> can<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:16.870> swipe<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
trick I kind of have to dig in there

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.839 
trick I kind of have to dig in there
just<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.920> little<00:02:29.950> bit<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.019> get<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> same

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
just a little bit just to get the same

just a little bit just to get the same
pigmentation<00:02:33.849> as<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.120> would<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.930> both<00:02:35.200> are

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
pigmentation as I would but both are

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.740 
pigmentation as I would but both are
very<00:02:36.129> comparable<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.269> I'll<00:02:37.359> make<00:02:37.510> sure<00:02:37.629> that

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750
