00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
working and there's several different

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.090 
working and there's several different
ways<00:00:21.850> you<00:00:22.030> can<00:00:22.119> fix<00:00:22.570> this<00:00:22.660> problem<00:00:23.110> it<00:00:23.350> might

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
ways you can fix this problem it might

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.220 
ways you can fix this problem it might
work<00:00:24.340> one<00:00:24.700> way<00:00:24.880> for<00:00:25.210> you<00:00:25.360> in<00:00:25.630> a<00:00:25.840> different<00:00:26.170> way

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
work one way for you in a different way

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.360 
work one way for you in a different way
for<00:00:26.290> someone<00:00:26.680> else<00:00:26.800> so<00:00:26.950> I'm<00:00:27.010> going<00:00:27.220> to<00:00:27.250> go

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.370 
for someone else so I'm going to go

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.410 
for someone else so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.670> go<00:00:27.790> through<00:00:27.820> all<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.270> different

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
ahead and go through all the different

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.459 
ahead and go through all the different
ways<00:00:28.690> and<00:00:29.520> hopefully<00:00:30.520> this<00:00:30.670> works<00:00:30.940> for<00:00:31.120> you

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:31.469 
ways and hopefully this works for you

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.810 
ways and hopefully this works for you
ultimately<00:00:32.469> the<00:00:32.710> last<00:00:32.920> resort<00:00:33.340> you<00:00:33.550> want<00:00:33.730> to

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
ultimately the last resort you want to

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.420 
ultimately the last resort you want to
do<00:00:33.940> is<00:00:34.090> actually<00:00:34.450> restore<00:00:35.020> your<00:00:35.200> iPod<00:00:35.590> but<00:00:35.950> if

do is actually restore your iPod but if

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.850 
do is actually restore your iPod but if
none<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.760> these<00:00:36.910> attempts<00:00:37.360> work<00:00:37.600> then<00:00:37.989> restore

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
none of these attempts work then restore

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.669 
none of these attempts work then restore
but<00:00:39.160> for<00:00:39.309> analysis<00:00:39.699> try<00:00:39.910> these<00:00:40.410> first<00:00:41.410> thing<00:00:41.620> I
