 exclusively on the history of the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.550

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 part of the continuous ally he can 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.379

 destiny box an army of mega robots 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 power it just that they all too 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.379
 have the consciousness of fate then 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.180
 when they need to make a decision 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.879
 it is also based on a destination for 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.729
 make that decision he can fly 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.040
 stay in space under the sea for 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.869
 days for weeks and even because 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.299
 that his clothing gives a supply of 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.470
 a thermal pool as it goes 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.840
 transforming destiny he can 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.659
 also in addition to travel real time 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.659
 have no butterfly effect and such 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 he can also transfer the mind 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.820
 him as he once did since 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 was quietly killing him 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.740
 he learned the voice so fate 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 he is a guy over 40 and has is a lot 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.610
 hard to hit on him and it's for 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.820
 This is what I brought here the book and the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.500
 destination that is from a books as it was 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.659
 released in the original magazine letter 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.640
 written by Bill Baker who is a 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.310
 Famous drummer he won a lot of 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.020
 award there by captain america for the series 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.700
 from the demolisher this guy he is very good 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.799
 it is very coherent in their text to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.659
 lusa does not lose the team like that 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.610
 that in this framework that is legal because 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.590
 we know the origin and destination and 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.240
 so his mother messes with magic 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.009
 black 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.170
 they were gypsies and so he 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.420
 grew involved with this business but 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.489
 only that fate he begins to want 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.319
 fiddle with this black magic, too. 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.090
 begins to become very strong and he will 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.190
 in the United States and there it goes into a 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.050
 faculty, the government gives all the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.660
 He needs money from 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.069
 technology and he knows Yiddish and there 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.830
 begins a relationship with him 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.019
 editions you have here side 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.330
 feeling of fate because it shows the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.800
 his girlfriend, the way he 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.019
 related to her the things that he 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.680
 I think you see very well face to 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.350
 transformation of the boy and doctor destiny 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.019
 and it's really cool because it has details on 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.400
 very simple because the doctor is a 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.440
 which is also linked to the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.840
 indigenous and such is very aware one 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.760

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.900
 photo of him in the position he wants it 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.489

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.560
