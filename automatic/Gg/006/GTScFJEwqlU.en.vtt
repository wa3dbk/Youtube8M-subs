00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
these when I first bought them and I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.560 
these when I first bought them and I
immediately<00:00:49.860> jumped<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.550> threw<00:00:50.850> banana<00:00:51.360> in

banana<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.770> got<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.100> gunked<00:00:59.760> up

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
banana out of here you got all gunked up

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.450 
banana out of here you got all gunked up
and<00:01:00.239> sticky<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> slimy<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.100> really

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and sticky and slimy and it's really

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
and sticky and slimy and it's really
impossible<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.180> clean<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.750> without

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
impossible to clean it out without

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.320 
impossible to clean it out without
having<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.070> scrub<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> good<00:01:05.880> long<00:01:06.060> while

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
having to scrub it for a good long while

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.570 
having to scrub it for a good long while
so<00:01:06.720> I'd<00:01:06.900> probably<00:01:07.110> recommend<00:01:07.560> doing<00:01:08.220> more<00:01:08.549> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
so I'd probably recommend doing more of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
so I'd probably recommend doing more of
the<00:01:08.909> vegetables<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.810> maybe<00:01:10.500> some<00:01:10.799> berries

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.100 
like I said her favorite thing is Rav
Aires<00:02:06.640> in<00:02:06.790> here<00:02:07.060> second<00:02:07.540> favorite<00:02:07.900> would<00:02:07.990> be

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
Aires in here second favorite would be

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.010 
Aires in here second favorite would be
great<00:02:08.410> she<00:02:08.940> likes<00:02:09.940> when<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.210> put<00:02:10.390> ice<00:02:10.509> cubes<00:02:10.869> in

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
great she likes when I put ice cubes in

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.120 
great she likes when I put ice cubes in
there<00:02:11.170> she<00:02:11.380> likes<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.710> for<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.860> little<00:02:12.010> while

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
there she likes it for a little while

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.470 
there she likes it for a little while
but<00:02:12.400> then<00:02:12.520> I<00:02:12.610> think<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.880> gets<00:02:12.970> maybe<00:02:13.210> a<00:02:13.300> little

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
but then I think it gets maybe a little

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.350
