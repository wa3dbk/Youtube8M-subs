the power and home buttons together for
10<00:00:13.799> seconds<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:15.000> would<00:00:15.089> exit<00:00:15.509> recovery<00:00:15.990> mode

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
10 seconds it would exit recovery mode

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.429 
10 seconds it would exit recovery mode
however<00:00:17.070> what<00:00:17.760> if<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.180> oh<00:00:18.390> I'm<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.410> lazy

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
can watch it and note this does require

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.200 
can watch it and note this does require
Java<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.760> little<00:01:12.060> icon

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
Java as you can see in this little icon

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.460 
Java as you can see in this little icon
down<00:01:12.479> there<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:15.420> will<00:01:15.780> need<00:01:16.170> Java

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
down there and so you will need Java

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.560 
down there and so you will need Java
will<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.100> work<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.880> java-based

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
will not work because it is java-based

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.469 
will not work because it is java-based
application<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
application and then you can go up to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.600 
application and then you can go up to
the<00:01:21.600> top<00:01:21.840> left<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.380> go<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> recovery<00:01:23.070> devices

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the top left and go to recovery devices

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.210 
the top left and go to recovery devices
I<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> option<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.049> egg<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.680> recovery

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
I have the option to egg to recovery

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.270 
I have the option to egg to recovery
fixed<00:01:26.850> recovery<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.450> exit<00:01:27.840> recovery<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.100> what

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
fixed recovery or exit recovery so what

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770

we're<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.880> exit<00:01:30.360> recovery

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
we're going to do is exit recovery

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.539 
we're going to do is exit recovery
