next we're going into this chocolate
brown<00:01:48.390> color<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.899> I'll<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.140> using<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.649> small

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
brown color and I'll be using a small

brown color and I'll be using a small
pencil<00:01:50.759> brush<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:51.810> gonna<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.200> is

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
pencil brush and what we're gonna do is

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.469 
pencil brush and what we're gonna do is
just<00:01:52.950> build<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.520> color<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:54.030> onto<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
just build this color right onto the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
just build this color right onto the
crease<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.959> a<00:01:55.229> lime<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.069> want<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> make<00:01:56.490> sure

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
crease in a lime you want to make sure

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
crease in a lime you want to make sure
that<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.090> slowly<00:01:57.659> build<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.020> color<00:01:58.289> once

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that you slowly build this color once

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.649 
that you slowly build this color once
again<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.490> looks<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> lot<00:02:00.270> better<00:02:00.420> than

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
again because it looks a lot better than

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.270 
again because it looks a lot better than
if<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> put<00:02:00.899> too<00:02:01.200> much<00:02:01.229> color<00:02:01.709> on<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.039> once

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
if you put too much color on it once

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.039 
if you put too much color on it once
because<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.759> naturally<00:02:03.270> fades<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:03.780> blend<00:02:03.959> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
because it naturally fades and blend a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.499 
because it naturally fades and blend a
lot<00:02:04.140> better<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.679> it<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.039> and

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
lot better if you do it like this and

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.210 
lot better if you do it like this and
you<00:02:06.509> want<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> use<00:02:06.899> small<00:02:07.409> little<00:02:07.709> strokes<00:02:08.039> to
