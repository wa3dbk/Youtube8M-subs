comparing<00:00:07.230> these<00:00:07.440> specs<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.189> Nikon<00:00:08.490> d50

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
comparing these specs of the Nikon d50

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.280 
comparing these specs of the Nikon d50
300<00:00:09.720> to<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> Nikon<00:00:10.679> d50<00:00:11.370> 200<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> 5300<00:00:13.170> has

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
hands-on review of the d50 200 but

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.139 
hands-on review of the d50 200 but
what's<00:00:31.439> different<00:00:31.649> between<00:00:31.889> these<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.640> while

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
what's different between these two while

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.729 
what's different between these two while
I<00:00:33.179> do<00:00:33.480> hit<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:33.719> thumbs<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.109> and<00:00:34.230> let's<00:00:34.559> find

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
I do hit the thumbs up and let's find

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.049 
I do hit the thumbs up and let's find
out<00:00:34.859> in<00:00:34.949> this<00:00:35.070> head-to-head<00:00:35.219> spec<00:00:35.609> comparison

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
out in this head-to-head spec comparison

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.849 
out in this head-to-head spec comparison
so<00:00:36.359> starting<00:00:36.600> off<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.079> sensor<00:00:37.469> size<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
so starting off with the sensor size and

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.860 
so starting off with the sensor size and
resolution<00:00:37.980> resolution<00:00:38.550> wise<00:00:39.000> pretty<00:00:39.690> much

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
resolution resolution wise pretty much

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.660 
resolution resolution wise pretty much
similar<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:40.649> twenty<00:00:40.980> four<00:00:41.190> point<00:00:41.460> one

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
similar here twenty four point one

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.250 
similar here twenty four point one
versus<00:00:42.030> twenty<00:00:42.239> four<00:00:42.390> point<00:00:42.629> two<00:00:42.809> you're<00:00:43.170> not

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
versus twenty four point two you're not

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
versus twenty four point two you're not
going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> notice<00:00:43.620> much<00:00:44.039> of<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> difference

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
going to notice much of a difference

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.790 
going to notice much of a difference
here<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.210> especially<00:00:45.749> because<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.199> that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here and especially because of that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.590 
here and especially because of that
sheer<00:00:47.100> size<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.460> images<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.510> be

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
sheer size of images it's going to be

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
sheer size of images it's going to be
absolutely<00:00:48.960> great<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> sensor<00:00:50.309> size<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
absolutely great now the sensor size is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.279 
absolutely great now the sensor size is
the<00:00:50.910> same<00:00:51.089> but<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> big<00:00:51.749> difference<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the same but the big difference is the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.069 
the same but the big difference is the
fact<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.070> d50<00:00:53.550> 300<00:00:54.089> does<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.960> an

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
fact that the d50 300 does not have an

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.899 
fact that the d50 300 does not have an
optical<00:00:55.199> low-pass<00:00:55.499> filter<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.519> for<00:00:56.760> those<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
optical low-pass filter so for those of

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.729 
optical low-pass filter so for those of
you<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.719> basically<00:00:58.170> an

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you don't know what that is basically an

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.919 
you don't know what that is basically an
optical<00:00:59.159> low-pass<00:00:59.249> filter<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.030> most<00:01:00.449> DSLRs

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
optical low-pass filter is on most DSLRs

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.869 
optical low-pass filter is on most DSLRs
and<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.499> helps<00:01:01.829> eliminate<00:01:02.039> aliasing

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and that helps eliminate aliasing

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.389 
and that helps eliminate aliasing
distortions<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.659> images<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.619> I'm<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.129> having

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
distortions on images but I'm not having

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.920 
distortions on images but I'm not having
this<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.820> gives<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.420> sharper<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this it gives you much sharper and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.710 
this it gives you much sharper and
crisper<00:01:07.290> images<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> d50<00:01:09.180> 300<00:01:09.570> Nick

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
crisper images so with the d50 300 Nick

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.819 
crisper images so with the d50 300 Nick
on<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> same<00:01:10.049> because<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> sheer<00:01:10.799> number

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
on the same because of the sheer number

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.889 
on the same because of the sheer number
of<00:01:11.009> pixels<00:01:11.460> under<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> new<00:01:12.360> processing

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
of pixels under the new processing

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.630 
of pixels under the new processing
engine<00:01:13.229> they've<00:01:13.409> got<00:01:13.560> leak<00:01:13.680> speed<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.250> versus

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
engine they've got leak speed for versus

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.069 
engine they've got leak speed for versus
big<00:01:14.759> speed<00:01:15.000> three<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
big speed three you're not going to

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.990 
big speed three you're not going to
really<00:01:16.259> notice<00:01:16.469> much<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.399> difference<00:01:17.430> in

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
really notice much of a difference in

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
really notice much of a difference in
terms<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> aliasing<00:01:18.990> distortions<00:01:19.469> so

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
terms of the aliasing distortions so

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.569 
terms of the aliasing distortions so
that's<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.009> good<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.369> kind<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
that's really good at this kind of

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.340 
that's really good at this kind of
result<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.360> sharper<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.810> crisp<00:01:21.990> images

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
result in more sharper and crisp images

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
result in more sharper and crisp images
Nick<00:01:22.530> ona<00:01:22.710> doing<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.520> lots<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> their

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
Nick ona doing this with lots of their

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.870 
Nick ona doing this with lots of their
DSL<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.600> started<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> d800e<00:01:26.310> they

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
DSL as they started with the d800e they

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.569 
DSL as they started with the d800e they
move<00:01:27.329> that<00:01:27.479> over<00:01:27.780> onto<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.380> d70<00:01:28.950> 100<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.399> well

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
move that over onto the d70 100 as well

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
move that over onto the d70 100 as well
now<00:01:30.000> you've<00:01:30.149> got<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> d50<00:01:30.990> 300<00:01:31.439> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
now you've got it on the d50 300 so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.679 
now you've got it on the d50 300 so
clearly<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.250> has<00:01:32.430> been<00:01:32.579> successful<00:01:33.090> ISO<00:01:33.509> range

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
clearly it has been successful ISO range

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.990 
clearly it has been successful ISO range
has<00:01:33.869> also<00:01:34.049> been<00:01:34.320> increased<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.039> d50<00:01:35.579> 200

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
has also been increased so the d50 200

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
has also been increased so the d50 200
you've<00:01:36.149> got<00:01:36.390> 100<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> 6400<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.189> d50<00:01:38.700> 300

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you've got 100 to 6400 on the d50 300

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.600 
you've got 100 to 6400 on the d50 300
you've<00:01:39.240> got<00:01:39.390> 100<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.039> 12,800<00:01:41.039> both<00:01:41.430> are

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you've got 100 to 12,800 both are

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.209 
you've got 100 to 12,800 both are
extendable<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.320> 25600<00:01:43.320> although<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.859> wouldn't

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
extendable to 25600 although I wouldn't

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.649 
extendable to 25600 although I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.969> up<00:01:45.119> all<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.420> way<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
recommend it going up all the way to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.480 
recommend it going up all the way to
that<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.590> you've<00:01:46.799> got<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> bit<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.189> an<00:01:47.250> increase

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that so you've got a bit of an increase

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.160 
that so you've got a bit of an increase
here<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:48.060> new<00:01:48.180> processing<00:01:48.719> engine<00:01:49.020> should

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
here the new processing engine should

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
here the new processing engine should
also<00:01:49.380> help<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:50.070> low<00:01:50.250> noise<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:51.000> higher

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
also help get low noise at the higher

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.090 
also help get low noise at the higher
ISOs<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.930> well<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.320> nice<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.859> both

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
ISOs as well so that's nice to see both

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.380 
ISOs as well so that's nice to see both
of<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.640> quite<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> few<00:01:54.270> similarities

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
of these have quite a few similarities

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.940 
of these have quite a few similarities
I'm<00:01:54.869> gonna<00:01:54.990> quickly<00:01:55.170> run<00:01:55.439> through<00:01:55.469> them

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
I'm gonna quickly run through them

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.279 
I'm gonna quickly run through them

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.330 
1080p on both of these the D 5200 came
with<00:03:01.550> 1080i<00:03:02.270> at<00:03:02.690> 60<00:03:03.200> frames<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.440> second<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:03.920> for

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
with 1080i at 60 frames a second so for

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.130 
with 1080i at 60 frames a second so for
slow<00:03:04.520> motion<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.000> was<00:03:05.330> quite<00:03:05.600> nice<00:03:05.810> but

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
slow motion that was quite nice but

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.810 
slow motion that was quite nice but
still<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.590> was<00:03:06.710> interlaced<00:03:07.160> not<00:03:07.370> progressive

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
still it was interlaced not progressive

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.540 
still it was interlaced not progressive

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
a second so that slow motion is gonna be

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.440 
a second so that slow motion is gonna be
really<00:03:16.400> nice<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.640> it's<00:03:16.790> progressive<00:03:17.300> this

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
really nice and it's progressive this

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.990 
really nice and it's progressive this

you've got 1080 at 60 frames a second
but<00:03:26.750> that's<00:03:26.900> not<00:03:27.020> included<00:03:27.350> here<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:27.710> you

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
but that's not included here but you

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.740 
but that's not included here but you

know can't be too picky that is a nice

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.510 
know can't be too picky that is a nice
improvement<00:03:30.050> here<00:03:30.470> having<00:03:30.770> that<00:03:30.950> slow<00:03:31.160> motion

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
improvement here having that slow motion

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.690 
improvement here having that slow motion

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
at full HD 1080p is quite nice and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.070 
at full HD 1080p is quite nice and
progressive<00:03:35.150> rather<00:03:35.360> than<00:03:35.510> in<00:03:35.630> today's<00:03:35.900> like

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
progressive rather than in today's like

we<00:03:36.200> had<00:03:36.320> last<00:03:36.470> time

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
we had last time

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.650 
we had last time
both<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.160> these<00:03:37.250> also<00:03:37.580> have<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.940> mic<00:03:38.150> in<00:03:38.360> which

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
both of these also have a mic in which

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.720 
both of these also have a mic in which
is<00:03:38.810> nice<00:03:38.960> C<00:03:39.260> for<00:03:39.440> video<00:03:39.650> in<00:03:40.310> terms<00:03:40.490> of<00:03:40.610> these

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
is nice C for video in terms of these

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.570 
is nice C for video in terms of these
sizes<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.360> both<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.690> these<00:03:41.840> DD<00:03:42.470> 5300<00:03:43.340> although

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
sizes of both of these DD 5300 although

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.340 
sizes of both of these DD 5300 although
it's<00:03:43.730> got<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:43.940> larger<00:03:44.210> screen<00:03:44.360> actually<00:03:45.020> comes

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
it's got a larger screen actually comes

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.990 
it's got a larger screen actually comes
in<00:03:45.470> smaller<00:03:45.740> so<00:03:45.950> it's<00:03:46.130> smaller<00:03:46.490> in<00:03:46.700> terms<00:03:46.730> of

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
in smaller so it's smaller in terms of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.640 
in smaller so it's smaller in terms of
the<00:03:47.120> high-end<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.540> width<00:03:47.810> they<00:03:48.080> also<00:03:48.380> ways

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
the high-end the width they also ways

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.460 
the high-end the width they also ways
that<00:03:48.680> are<00:03:48.980> less<00:03:49.010> than<00:03:49.370> DD<00:03:49.940> 5200<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:51.290> great

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
that are less than DD 5200 so it's great

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.540 
that are less than DD 5200 so it's great
to<00:03:51.530> see<00:03:51.710> that<00:03:51.860> they've<00:03:51.980> packed<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:52.400> new

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
to see that they've packed in new

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.310 
to see that they've packed in new
features<00:03:52.940> but<00:03:53.390> they've<00:03:53.570> managed<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.840> keep<00:03:54.110> the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
features but they've managed to keep the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.930 
features but they've managed to keep the
weight<00:03:54.590> lower<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.340> terms<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.760> wireless

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
weight lower in terms of wireless

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.270 
weight lower in terms of wireless
transfer<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.480> d50<00:03:56.960> 300<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.860> have<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.040> buy<00:03:58.220> the

transfer the d50 300 you have to buy the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.970 
transfer the d50 300 you have to buy the
wu1<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.330> wireless<00:03:59.840> mobile<00:03:59.990> adapter<00:04:00.560> so<00:04:00.710> you<00:04:00.740> had

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
wu1 a wireless mobile adapter so you had

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.800 
wu1 a wireless mobile adapter so you had
to<00:04:01.130> add<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.360> would<00:04:02.450> allow<00:04:02.660> you

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
to add that on and that would allow you

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.630 
to add that on and that would allow you
wireless<00:04:03.350> transfer<00:04:03.770> so<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.070> can<00:04:04.250> transfer
