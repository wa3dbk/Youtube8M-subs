00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
introduced in 1967 and I believe only 18

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.599 
introduced in 1967 and I believe only 18
were<00:03:41.599> ever<00:03:41.810> made<00:03:42.079> so<00:03:42.829> this<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.099> really<00:03:43.250> cool<00:03:43.459> to

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
were ever made so this is really cool to

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.030 
were ever made so this is really cool to
see<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.819> put<00:03:44.299> into<00:03:44.540> GTA<00:03:44.870> 5<00:03:45.260> looks<00:03:45.799> like<00:03:45.950> it

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
see that put into GTA 5 looks like it

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.319 
see that put into GTA 5 looks like it
would<00:03:46.099> be<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.220> very<00:03:46.280> cool<00:03:46.700> car<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:47.000> use<00:03:47.180> i

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
would be a very cool car to use i

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.050 
would be a very cool car to use i
believe<00:03:47.599> it's<00:03:47.750> italian<00:03:48.290> made<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.799> i<00:03:49.549> think

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
believe it's italian made and i think

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.670 
believe it's italian made and i think
it'll<00:03:50.180> be<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.329> really<00:03:50.750> fast<00:03:50.989> car<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.470> drive

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
it'll be a really fast car to drive

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.559 
it'll be a really fast car to drive
around<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.340> find<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:52.669> a<00:03:52.700> long<00:03:52.970> interstate<00:03:53.450> to

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
around and find you a long interstate to

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.050 
around and find you a long interstate to
just<00:03:53.750> cruise<00:03:54.139> or<00:03:54.470> just<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.160> ver<00:03:55.310> have<00:03:55.609> races

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
just cruise or just a ver have races

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.460 
just cruise or just a ver have races
with<00:03:56.209> friends<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.660> down<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.989> highway<00:03:57.019> and

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
with friends on down the highway and

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.860 
with friends on down the highway and
stuff<00:03:57.680> i<00:03:57.829> think<00:03:58.069> that'd<00:03:58.280> be<00:03:58.370> really<00:03:58.549> cool

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
stuff i think that'd be really cool

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.000 
stuff i think that'd be really cool
looks<00:03:59.870> like<00:04:00.049> this<00:04:00.230> could<00:04:00.349> carry<00:04:00.560> up<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.769> two

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
looks like this could carry up to two

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.069 
looks like this could carry up to two
people<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.609> upon<00:04:02.120> further<00:04:02.269> reading<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:02.780> looks

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
people and upon further reading it looks

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.530 
people and upon further reading it looks
like<00:04:03.230> this<00:04:03.440> could<00:04:03.650> be<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:04.190> new<00:04:04.489> variant<00:04:05.419> of

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
like this could be the new variant of

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.390 
like this could be the new variant of
the<00:04:05.690> windsor<00:04:06.079> from<00:04:06.319> san<00:04:06.560> andreas<00:04:07.040> which<00:04:07.250> is
