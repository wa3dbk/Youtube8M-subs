00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 all right 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.850
 these drawings of people and chewing gum a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.130
 early 20th century cartoonist 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.530
 they show the elephant of the movement that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.030
 imitates the human being to be able to do 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.490
 this type of drawings is necessary 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 start with the most basic position 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.730
 in profile is what we will learn the day 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.670
 from today 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 but beginning we draw a circle and 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.340
 then we draw a kind of number 9 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.040
 that circle here is like half 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.470
 of the size of the first then we join them 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.019
 this is the body and the head of 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.670
 elephant here in green we begin to 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.489
 draw the head itself with its 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.140
 feature horn is makes a 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.120
 way like a pipe or a bugle 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 if we cut this part of the circle 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.079
 we can get half the height 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 of the animal this distance will serve us 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.220
 because the elephant legs begin 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.199
 about half its height so 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.760
 continuing the line of the head 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.350
 we draw the leg with two lines 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.840
 lead 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.939
 these go from thick to thin and in the end 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.030
 the tip of the leg we make it more 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.650
 thick as a trapeze we cut this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.740
 part of the circle and from there 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.110
 we draw the hind leg this point of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.720
 signal to the knee and the rest is very 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.090
 similar to the front leg up here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.700
 we already have the general form of the elephant 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.540
 now we will draw some more details 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.190
 specific 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.890
 if we draw the line of the column 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.350
 over will these points the hip and 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.330
 the vertebrae of the neck in the head to 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.490
 remarking we have this break in the form 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.720
 of the head and we trace the ears 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.340
 great in the case of the African elephant 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.830
 here we draw the shoulders two fangs 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.410
 and we draw the legs on the other side of the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.960
 shaded body to indicate that they are 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.940
 back and finally the tail 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.400
 it is important to note that the abdomen of 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.310
 elephant points down and the way 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.530
 general body is like a pear 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.750
 from this drawing we begin to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.759
 make a finer stroke as you can 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.890
 realize you only review the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.569
 way that we got there is only 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.580
 some lines that we do with greater 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.410
 careful to represent the anatomy of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.300
 elephant 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 before working in grays you have to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.430
 understand how the skin of this is drawn 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.780
 animal you have to draw many wrinkles 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.150
 we can represent them with lines 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.340
 horizontal but in the case of creases 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.150
 we will also find lines with shapes 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.310
 as of and and these change the direction 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.590
 depending on the part of the body by 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.020
 example here in the thorax is this 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.270
 curve here on the back leg we have 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.970
 folds in both directions that's why it 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.680
 they form rhombuses in the trunk the folds 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.290
 they are like those in a hose 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.359
 we will represent the shadow with green 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.010
 when the light comes directly from above 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.680
 the shadow will be on the bottom 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.730
 of the pachyderm are very dark shadows 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.980
 because they are projected 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.659
 we leave here on the left the steps 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.250
 that we already have already the right 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.580
 we will study the elephant's head 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.840
 front as it is a basic view 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.879
 we started by drawing this trapeze of 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.870
 head and elongated and we divide it by the 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.670
 half 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.950
 here we cut a small section and 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.860
 on this very separated line we draw 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.200
 both eyes we draw curve down and 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.180
 shorter curves upwards 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.640
 this time starting from the banks of the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.579
 blue shape with which we started and in 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.829
 these parts we draw both fangs 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.629
 these sometimes point inward at 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.120
 the upper part we trace the skull 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.220
 bulging and we indicate the ears very 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.540
 great and finally we finished 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.110
 draw the trunk with its folds 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.000
 horizontal 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.180
 When detailing you can easily recognize 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.860
 to the animal and it is a fact that the method is 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.990
 so simple that anyone could 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.480
 draw it and learn it after a couple 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.670
 of practices already having the stroke of 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.400
 profile and head in front 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.530
 we started to work in pencil 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.260
 in the final drawing it may seem that 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.959
 it's about photographs but in these 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.019
 approaches you can see the strokes and 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.909
 traces of the pencil what it is that in the 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.340
 computer we add layers of light and 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.859
 shade to accentuate the contrast and give 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.920
 color as you can see in the drawing 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.959
 finish 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.230
 We hope this class is useful for you 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.970
 do not stop practicing you can access 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.740
 other kinds of animal drawings and 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.210
 drawing in general in this channel giving 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.310
