baby so so when they get upset they
flare<00:02:11.540> their<00:02:11.750> hood<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:13.489> if<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.030> saw<00:02:16.030> almost

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.240 

the<00:03:30.560> head<00:03:30.770> is<00:03:30.920> not<00:03:31.130> very<00:03:31.600> triangular<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:32.930> I

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
the head is not very triangular so I

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.930 
the head is not very triangular so I
think<00:03:34.250> I'm<00:03:34.460> safe<00:03:34.790> enough<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.150> handle<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.810> I'm

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
think I'm safe enough to handle it I'm

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.720 
think I'm safe enough to handle it I'm
99%<00:03:37.940> sure<00:03:38.240> and<00:03:38.720> more<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:40.070> it's<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.310> common

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
99% sure and more that it's a common

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.589 
99% sure and more that it's a common
Brown<00:03:41.000> keel<00:03:41.390> back

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
Brown keel back

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.089 
Brown keel back
and<00:03:44.599> again<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.110> mouth<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.470> probably<00:03:45.680> too

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
and again the mouth is probably too

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.559 
and again the mouth is probably too
small<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.519> really<00:03:46.640> bite<00:03:46.909> down<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.150> me<00:03:47.390> get

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
small to really bite down on me get

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.610 
small to really bite down on me get
anyway<00:03:48.610> well<00:03:49.610> this<00:03:49.730> one<00:03:49.909> is<00:03:50.090> much<00:03:50.840> faster<00:03:51.170> than

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
anyway well this one is much faster than

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.190 
anyway well this one is much faster than
the<00:03:51.769> other<00:03:51.890> one<00:03:54.970> maybe<00:03:55.970> more<00:03:56.090> more<00:03:56.780> energy

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
the other one maybe more more energy

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
the other one maybe more more energy
more<00:03:57.799> fast<00:03:58.750> but<00:03:59.750> this<00:03:59.870> one<00:04:00.079> apparently<00:04:00.620> is

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
more fast but this one apparently is

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.479 
more fast but this one apparently is
virtually<00:04:01.730> harmless<00:04:01.909> totally<00:04:02.750> harmless

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
virtually harmless totally harmless

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.699 
virtually harmless totally harmless
which<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.700> a<00:04:04.730> nice<00:04:05.000> well<00:04:05.569> if<00:04:06.319> it's<00:04:06.530> what<00:04:06.590> I

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
which is a nice well if it's what I

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.690 
which is a nice well if it's what I
believe<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.190> is<00:04:07.720> which<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:08.959> cool

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.160 

really<00:04:13.700> beautiful<00:04:14.150> snakes<00:04:14.420> anyway<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:14.989> one

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
really beautiful snakes anyway this one

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.590 
really beautiful snakes anyway this one
has<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.349> nice<00:04:15.560> pattern<00:04:15.859> and<00:04:16.870> maybe<00:04:19.269> maybe<00:04:20.269> he

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
has a nice pattern and maybe maybe he

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.020 
has a nice pattern and maybe maybe he
ate<00:04:20.870> something<00:04:21.229> I'm<00:04:21.530> not<00:04:21.650> sure<00:04:21.709> had<00:04:22.190> some<00:04:22.430> I

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.219 

had<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.060> couple<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.419> things<00:04:26.600> they<00:04:26.780> could<00:04:26.840> eat<00:04:27.080> in

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
had a couple of things they could eat in

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.850 
had a couple of things they could eat in
there<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:28.810> there's<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.870> possibility<00:04:30.590> that

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
there and there's a possibility that

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.240 
there and there's a possibility that
these<00:04:31.850> things<00:04:32.060> got<00:04:32.360> out<00:04:32.510> through<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.900> side

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.060 

here's<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:39.260> here's<00:04:40.260> another<00:04:40.680> snake<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:43.800> one's

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
here's a here's another snake this one's

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.159 
here's a here's another snake this one's
a<00:04:44.190> little<00:04:44.310> little<00:04:44.970> nuts

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.140 

this<00:04:49.159> one<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.520> a<00:04:49.550> blind<00:04:50.030> snake<00:04:50.960> Abra<00:04:51.439> meanie

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
this one is a blind snake Abra meanie

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.580 
this one is a blind snake Abra meanie
blind<00:04:53.150> snake<00:04:53.419> and<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:53.930> is<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.169> biggest<00:04:54.499> one

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
blind snake and this is the biggest one

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.969 
blind snake and this is the biggest one
I've<00:04:54.770> seen<00:04:55.930> this<00:04:56.930> one's<00:04:57.169> almost<00:04:57.349> as<00:04:57.680> big<00:04:57.860> as

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
I've seen this one's almost as big as

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.149 
I've seen this one's almost as big as
these<00:04:58.099> other<00:04:58.400> snakes<00:05:00.550> but<00:05:01.550> much<00:05:01.969> more<00:05:02.210> crazy

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
these other snakes but much more crazy

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.439 
these other snakes but much more crazy
so<00:05:04.159> these<00:05:04.340> snakes<00:05:04.699> don't<00:05:04.849> eat<00:05:05.060> each<00:05:05.090> other

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
so these snakes don't eat each other

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.209 
so these snakes don't eat each other
which<00:05:05.779> is<00:05:05.810> cool<00:05:06.259> so<00:05:06.499> I<00:05:06.560> can<00:05:06.770> keep<00:05:06.919> them<00:05:07.069> all

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
which is cool so I can keep them all

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:08.580 
which is cool so I can keep them all
together

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
together

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.499 
together
but<00:05:09.590> this<00:05:09.860> one<00:05:10.039> lives<00:05:10.249> in<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.430> dirt<00:05:10.789> is<00:05:11.210> shiny

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
but this one lives in the dirt is shiny

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.830 
but this one lives in the dirt is shiny
when<00:05:11.719> I<00:05:11.749> just<00:05:12.020> showed<00:05:12.259> you<00:05:12.289> and<00:05:13.449> I<00:05:14.449> don't<00:05:14.599> know

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
when I just showed you and I don't know

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.619 
when I just showed you and I don't know

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
if it's really blind or not but doesn't

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.230
