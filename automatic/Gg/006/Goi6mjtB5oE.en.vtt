00:00:06.123 --> 00:00:13.372
 Paints for the artist are what are the music notes for the composer. 

00:00:13.372 --> 00:00:19.858
 The artist gathers together a variety of materials to assemble them in one composition. 

00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:22.955
 What we see from this composition is on the canvas. 

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:31.204
 Just as the conductor picks up the notes and puts some order in the orchestra, 

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:36.941
 the restorer takes on the paints that have undergone so many transformations, 

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:41.758
 since the artist has brought them, and brings some order among them. 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.688
 As conservatives, we have a variety of tools made to tell us, 

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:57.254
 to tell us what the artist meant when he created a particular image. 

00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:00.864
 This is "The Forgiveness of the Telem and the Eucharist", 

00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:08.623
 painted in 1818 by Jacques-Louis David while working in exile in Brussels. 

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:12.844
 We see the details of the picture with a technique called "infrared reflection" 

00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:17.454
 which includes a camera provided with an infrared sensing tube, 

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:23.534
 with which we see the reflective capability of the various materials and pigments on the infrared light register. 

00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:28.540
 If we take a closer look at this honor with infrared rays, 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:38.097
 we see that David tried to put on the naked figure and fill the curtains below. 

00:01:38.436 --> 00:01:44.290
 He received an academic education in fine arts, in France this started from early - 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.981
 drawing and studying the naked body, especially in order to get a real idea of ​​the forms, 

00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:56.263
 not only for the skin but also for the bones and muscles underneath it. 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.289
 When you are in a gallery, there are a few things you do not realize. 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.431
 One is that the picture has a story, from the moment it is removed from the stand. 

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.398
 Everything begins to happen to her. 

00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:16.675
 This is a picture of the 19th century German artist Kaspar David Friedrich. 

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:20.291
 He is very rare in his country. 

00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:28.585
 When I first saw his painting at an auction, she was in a very poor condition. 

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:37.040
 The lacquer had faded, but more importantly, there was a hole in this part of the painting. 

00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:45.626
 I fixed the hole in the back, stuck a piece of cloth to the corners of the picture, 

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:48.009
 which allowed me to stretch the canvas back into the frame. 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:54.039
 Then I added another piece of cloth to the frame and the whole thing was assembled again. 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.267
 So, on the front, it does not appear in any way. 

00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:08.326
 The challenge of the restoration was to take care of structural anomalies like this hole in the sky. 

00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:15.454
 But do the work in such a way that my presence is as unobtrusive as possible 

00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:21.605
 and finally only the artist's voice remains. 

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:26.040
 We were able to see this picture through infrared reflection. 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.582
 Beneath the surface there is an extremely complex plan. 

00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:38.494
 These trees in the distance, which are slightly blurred, are very precise and detailed 

00:03:38.494 --> 00:03:42.026
 and in fact only then the paint gives the mist. 

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:49.455
 Imagine late afternoon or early evening when the fog starts to descend in the field. 

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:52.456
 Friedrich paints the fog with paints, 

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:54.705
 just as the fog would fall over the field. 

00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:59.123
 And that's one of the reasons for the illusion of fog in the distance 

00:03:59.123 --> 00:04:02.981
 compared to the clarity of the trees in the foreground. 

00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:08.967
 Because he used the paint to mimic the natural movement of the atmosphere. 

00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:18.097
 What looks so simple and clean is usually the result of great effort and struggle with materials. 

00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:24.872
 Paint is hard to work and it's not easy to get her to do what you want. 

00:04:24.872 --> 00:04:34.872
 And one of the reasons artists are such geniuses is precisely that they manage to make a non-destructive material 

00:04:34.872 --> 00:04:41.485
 to speak and reflect their inner feelings and beliefs. 

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:48.941
 This is great skill, talent and gift, that's why we appreciate these things today.
