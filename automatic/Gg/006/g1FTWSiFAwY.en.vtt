00:00:02.019 --> 00:00:13.719
 as in Spanish texts is the last one 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.719
 they're going to make you go to the game here 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.440
 or what they are going to do is 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:27.390
 and the options 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.250
 options are going to go to sounds and here we go 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.230
 to do in English or Russian and you already 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.030
 with doing it they are going to change 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.630
 and that's what they're going to do or they're going to change 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.590
 to Spanish they will serve you to give you 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.660
 They will apply and that's all 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.080
 well now he left and we continue with 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.080
 instance 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.010
 so I'm going to close this 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.810
 good a download of 600 megabytes that is 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.880
 in the description of the video 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.160
 what they are going to do they are going to decompress 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.600
 is going to leave two folders because I do not 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.220
 I have because I did not have time to 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.950
 download and there are two people who 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.880
 they asked in the game tutorial well 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.100
 that I do not want to disappoint them good you 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.560
 they know they are going to extract those that file 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.750
 there will be two folders in that folder 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.850
 there will be the installation of voices and 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.530
 texts we will enter problem for example 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.860
 the same of the texts that is the most 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.990
 league we do not execute the file and offer 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.150
 an installer where they go to only 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.690
 give it to the next following and they go to 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.700
 change the route from where you are going to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.650
 install and it goes name where to spend and 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.990
 where is the game connect it 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.720
 install it better go to the next 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.060
 next and end the same do with 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.010
 that of the voices and then what they have 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.140
 that make a little more complicated 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:57.030
 is that start write king edit 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.520
 well rgr and as you see here they are going to give 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.850
 to enter he will ask for the permits 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.470
 of administration to give that yes 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.409
 I do not have to enter here they will not know 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.190
 who are you what we are going to do is go to 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:16.010
 the folder for what we have 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.150
 Windows 7 62 32 bit so we enter 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.660
 key local machine 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.819
 we are going to open the software and we are looking for 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.069
 now I have to go to game and 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.560
 battlefield 3 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.629
 good here to appear for example is 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.969
 in language it will not appear English 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.560
 they are not going to write you so it costs 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:38.830
 convince well in English 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.190
 it appears to us in which they will grab 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.070
 to enter write spanish 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.520
 the truth about here as you see is going to 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.319
 look like this 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:58.430
 in a low 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:00.829
 bush or English and Russian and then the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.909
 tele will do is change is a 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.849
 low is first the minuscule and then 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.159
 capital letters are going to accept and good for the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.280
 game and they will change as it says in the 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.650
 beginning of the video and nothing more than that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.480
 how do you see if you installed the hosts 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.909
 text they have to appear these 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.969
 files as well repas says that 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.960
 they are loaded and texts and with this already 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:28.000
 will have to be installed 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.030
 will this text file will appear 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.470
 here that will allow you to explain for 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.320
 the two that to enter where are three 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.450
 just for those who have 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.740
