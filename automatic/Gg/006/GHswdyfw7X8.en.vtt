down this world yeah whatever it's a
custom<00:00:44.879> cross<00:00:45.090> rod<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.620> test<00:00:46.890> lower<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
custom cross rod and a test lower and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.760 
custom cross rod and a test lower and
all<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> enchantments<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.750> stuff<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.200> that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of all that's a fast clock powering

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.099 
of all that's a fast clock powering
these<00:00:57.510> three<00:00:57.809> common<00:00:58.170> blocks<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.109> each

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
these three common blocks so each

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.870 
these three common blocks so each
command<00:01:02.100> block<00:01:02.309> has<00:01:02.789> its<00:01:03.090> own<00:01:03.390> Minecraft<00:01:04.880> item

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
command block has its own Minecraft item

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.380 
command block has its own Minecraft item
so<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.650> one<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:08.030> Marisa

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
so this one is Marisa

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.380 
so this one is Marisa
what<00:01:11.290> genius<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:12.310> searching<00:01:12.910> for<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.090> player

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
what genius is searching for the player

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.120 
what genius is searching for the player
and<00:01:13.810> it's<00:01:14.530> testing<00:01:14.950> for<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.920> prospector<00:01:17.920> I

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
and it's testing for the prospector I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.840 
and it's testing for the prospector I
carry<00:01:18.550> which<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.090> NASA<00:01:19.720> in<00:01:19.990> this<00:01:20.140> case<00:01:20.850> within

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
carry which is NASA in this case within

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.920 
carry which is NASA in this case within
the<00:01:22.060> four<00:01:22.570> blocks<00:01:22.900> videos<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:24.040> yeah<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.810> is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
the four blocks videos so yeah this is

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
the four blocks videos so yeah this is
the<00:01:26.080> another<00:01:26.290> star

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the another star

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.320 
the another star
this<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.630> diamond<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:30.880> is<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
this is the diamond and this is the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.400 
this is the diamond and this is the
blaze<00:01:31.990> rod<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.600> all<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.440> them<00:01:35.650> have<00:01:35.680> been<00:01:36.430> sets

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
blaze rod so all of them have been sets

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.270 
blaze rod so all of them have been sets
and<00:01:38.700> now<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.880> can<00:01:40.090> happen<00:01:40.300> is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
and now it can happen is

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.410 
and now it can happen is
it's<00:01:42.790> going<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.450> go<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:44.710> this<00:01:44.950> test<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.790> gonna

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
it's going to go into this test is gonna

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it's going to go into this test is gonna
go<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.790> comparator<00:01:48.820> because<00:01:49.240> it's<00:01:49.960> gonna<00:01:50.230> be

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
go to a comparator because it's gonna be

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.240 
go to a comparator because it's gonna be
like<00:01:50.860> it's<00:01:51.580> gonna<00:01:51.729> test<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.840> once<00:01:53.050> I<00:01:53.350> throw<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
like it's gonna test so once I throw the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.820 
like it's gonna test so once I throw the
plate<00:01:54.490> for<00:01:54.640> down<00:01:54.970> that<00:01:55.330> turns<00:01:55.690> on<00:01:55.900> which<00:01:56.590> will

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
plate for down that turns on which will

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.070 
plate for down that turns on which will
turn<00:01:57.130> off<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.720> vessel<00:01:59.410> touch<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:01.090> if<00:02:01.600> I'm<00:02:01.869> not

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
turn off the vessel touch so if I'm not

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.800 
turn off the vessel touch so if I'm not
in<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.350> full<00:02:02.530> block<00:02:02.800> radius<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.550> will<00:02:03.940> turn<00:02:04.630> on

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
in the full block radius it will turn on

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.320 
in the full block radius it will turn on
cuz<00:02:05.170> I'm<00:02:05.650> not<00:02:05.860> in<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.070> full<00:02:06.280> block<00:02:06.490> reach<00:02:06.729> but<00:02:07.090> if

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
cuz I'm not in a full block reach but if

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.080 
cuz I'm not in a full block reach but if
I'm<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.630> four-block<00:02:08.050> radius<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:09.280> will<00:02:09.580> turn

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
I'm in a four-block radius it will turn

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.600 
I'm in a four-block radius it will turn
off<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:13.030> into<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.540> redstone

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
off so it is going into a redstone

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.240 
off so it is going into a redstone
pattern<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.820> mean<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.300> goes<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.720> redstone<00:02:17.250> it

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
pattern I mean it goes to a redstone it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.270 
pattern I mean it goes to a redstone it
goes<00:02:18.520> redstone<00:02:19.390> like<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:21.010> block

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
goes redstone like this and it block

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.080 
goes redstone like this and it block
whatever<00:02:21.640> still<00:02:22.120> touch<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.980> damn<00:02:24.670> swat

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
