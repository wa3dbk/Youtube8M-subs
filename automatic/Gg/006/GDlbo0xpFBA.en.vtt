to the back of that arrow I know one of
the<00:02:16.270> first<00:02:16.480> things<00:02:16.569> in<00:02:16.870> my<00:02:17.019> mind<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.500> well<00:02:17.980> what

happens if that pops out what's the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.309 
happens if that pops out what's the
safety<00:02:22.060> features<00:02:22.239> on<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:22.720> little<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.200> will

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
safety features on this little that will

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.809

keep you from getting hurt well let me
demonstrate<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.900> said<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.379> bleeder<00:02:26.620> too

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
demonstrate it it said the bleeder too

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.619 
demonstrate it it said the bleeder too
was<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> tube<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.670> cannot<00:02:28.000> come<00:02:28.239> off<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
was a tube so it cannot come off the

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.150 
was a tube so it cannot come off the
back<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.080> arrow<00:02:29.260> because<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.769> hits<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
back of the arrow because it hits the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.280 
back of the arrow because it hits the
string<00:02:30.519> ok<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.300> guess<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.569> can<00:02:31.750> see<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.050> hits

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
string ok I guess you can see it hits

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.350 
string ok I guess you can see it hits
the<00:02:32.470> string<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:32.920> we<00:02:33.640> typically<00:02:33.970> shoot<00:02:34.269> it

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the string and we typically shoot it

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.229 
the string and we typically shoot it
through<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.569> whisker<00:02:34.959> biscuit<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.940> cannot

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
through a whisker biscuit and it cannot

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.600 
through a whisker biscuit and it cannot
