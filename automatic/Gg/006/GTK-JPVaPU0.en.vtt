00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 today we are going to make a scorpion 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.330
 clay 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.200
 we are in a black yellow and a 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.320
 stick like this to make a scorpion 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.420
 let's take the yellow placenta and 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.029
 let's start to lengthen that of this 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.150
 way and then we're going to get two 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.420
 points on the opposite side something 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.660
 like this 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.110
 and let's start to flatten also two 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.840
 parts by their sides to make their 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.540
 legs 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.760
 and with the toothpick we will cut through the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.120
 medium and those two halves we're going to 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.800
 also split in half to make 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.140
 what they will do all fours that 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.230
 we will apply it for both sides 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.530
 and now every cut we made is going to 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.290
 lengthen it in this way to train you 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.890
 what are your legs going to do once 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.890
 we have this 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.710
 let's make some folds to each leg 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.490
 in this way 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.370
 and we're going to do it for the eight courtyards 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.820
 something like this 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.660
 now let's smooth the plasticine of a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.580
 little so that it is not rough of this 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.210
 way and we are going to delimit what is going to 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.580
 be your head of our scorpion 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.190
 something like this then with the tip 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.100
 of the stick we are going to make some stripes 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.350
 the bottom part of our lacquer now 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.050
 let's create the pliers or the tweezers 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.630
 that have scorpions in this way 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.420
 we are going to lengthen the parts that we leave 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.510
 go ahead and let's start forming what 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 that is the pincer of our scorpion 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.530
 something like this 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.650
 and we will apply it 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.510
 for the two of the hours in front 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.210
 now colony we can delimit 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.870
 the cuts of his arm or of his pincers 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.870
 in this way 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.980
 so we have to see it like this 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.770
 and the same thing we will apply for the 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.360
 tail we are going to delimit some parts of 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.360
 your skin 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.850
 in this way 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.930
 with the union we will support to make you 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.300
 this part of its tail and the tip on the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.060
 point to do the sting, let's do it 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.069
 in this way we press up and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.769
 let's keep it this way 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.349
 then we open a little bit to do the 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.680
 fold the tail that we left as 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.510
 is now complete in the black we are going to 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.260
 let's put together some joyful pressure 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.730
 on top of its shell 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.420
 in this way we are going to spread the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.270
 so there's something like this 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.310
 and we anoint it well we're not good in 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:59.190
 all the carapace above 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:02.190
 in this way we have something like this 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.740
 we are going to some limitations in your 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.620
 shell 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.250
 with the stick in this way we can 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.630
 grate 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 little by little and informing you of your scale or 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.630
 its layers of its skin or its shell 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.480
 up this way and flattened a 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.850
 little so that we stay like this and also in 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.210
 the tip of the tail we are going to put this 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.210
 black 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.600
 and so would our stinger 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.940
 plasticine give me a little friend and 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.280
 subscribe to my channel that's all for 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.280
 today we see the following video
