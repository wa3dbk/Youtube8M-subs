00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 a new saturday and therefore time for 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.960
 a new round news please view 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 Owners know about the games supply 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.500
 it is currently weakening a bit and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.509
 also in things hardware sales figures 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 Nintendo just can not really look that up 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.060
 to make the most of it 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.820
 now comment on the first 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.750
 words party publisher the whole ubisoft 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359
 he has a long time ago 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.439
 announced that the former 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.060
 exclusive titles do not just frame legends 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.109
 for other consoles will come but 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.599
 also far later 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.120
 Now ea has come to word 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.600
 and justifies why future games like 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 eg fifa 14 not ported to the riu 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.329
 that is partly due to the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.460
 frostbite engine with the nintendo 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.180
 console is not compatible to another 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.320
 but also simply because that is currently the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.230
 Nintendo console I quote from her 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.510
 view is not a useful platform 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.489
 simply sold too little 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.989
 nintendo will see for yourself 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.420
 even the blame for nintendo boss 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.730
 satoru iwata has recently announced 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.340
 Do not let people go yet 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.449
 convinced that the wii u 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.920
 unique is there is none 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.600
 big flagship title 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.090
 we do not have a title yet 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.750
 The people think that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.909
 view 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.220
 that is really something different 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.930
 nintendo and iwata the bills currently 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.930
 in fact a bit baffled 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.399
 Fans of space mechanic isaac 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.170
 Clarke still had until the e3 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.939
 hoping that maybe a new one 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.460
 announce dead space 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.990
 no there is currently nothing in the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.909
 on the contrary, do the team of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.219
 visceral games are currently working 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.840
 a completely different project what that 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.000
 we do not know but actually 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.259
 is it that the sales figures of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.939
 dead space clearly behind the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.130
 what is left behind are what you get 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:52.729
 hoped that would be appropriate 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:55.649
 project at ea for the time being as true 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.450
 how long should or may be allowed 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.250
 even being a game that's a topic 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.649
 about which one can debate royally 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.329
 christofer sundberg has the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.879
 the boss of avalanche is a whole 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.229
 own theory he means that is 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.729
 that 's why so many games in the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.500
 create a trade because they 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.900
 are simply too short and so on 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.849
 unspectacular and uninspired that is 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.049
 So why the people take all 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.790
 quickly put your title in the 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.980
 used trade as counter example 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.889
 he called the in-house just cause 2 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.239
 something so incredibly complex and innovative 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.459
 and it's great that there is nobody 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.780
 wants to sell if that is so know 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.549
 Of course we do not but we give the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.230
 like to ask more about you than we do 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.090
 want to know from you how long may 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.310
 should or must be a game it must be 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.030
 always 1 carim with 200 hours of play 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.310
 or even more 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.540
 or can also times a crysis 3 with 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.669
 maybe only five hours in the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.410
 campaign to buy entice yours 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.389
 opinion is asked then post 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.609
 we will soon be evaluated as 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:52.680
 and ne na.de I do not read before ea 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.799
 announced that the sims 4 on the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.049
 gamescom are presented 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.819
 but sometimes plug according to 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.889
 the e3 there sony and the turn 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.750
 playstation 4 almost as winner in the 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.669
 fight for the next generation console 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.130
 but microsoft has redone the cards 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:10.019
 mixed in things xbox man is 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.639
 to announce with some unpleasant ones 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.599
 tough from the past 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.879
 backtracked 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.919

 the next microsoft console no 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.480
 always online would have forced that one 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.139
 not every 24 hours at least online 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.720
 have to go 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.579

 sold as a gift or something borrowed 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.519
 it could always be that 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.310
