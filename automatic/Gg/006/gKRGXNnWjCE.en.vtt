mainly<00:00:23.340> being<00:00:23.490> diamonds<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.090> imagine<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.720> him

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
mainly being diamonds I imagine so him

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.660 
mainly being diamonds I imagine so him
this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> little<00:00:25.769> bit<00:00:25.949> glitchy<00:00:26.160> sometimes

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
this is a little bit glitchy sometimes

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.920 
this is a little bit glitchy sometimes
it<00:00:26.789> works<00:00:26.970> sometimes<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.420> doesn't<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.810> just

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it works sometimes it doesn't you just

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.210 
it works sometimes it doesn't you just
have<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.199> keep<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.470> trying<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.130> for

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
have to keep on trying with it but for

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.589 
have to keep on trying with it but for
the<00:00:29.310> most<00:00:29.429> part<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.760> pretty<00:00:29.880> successful<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the most part is pretty successful so

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.209 
the most part is pretty successful so
from<00:00:30.779> here<00:00:30.990> you're<00:00:31.410> gonna<00:00:31.560> split<00:00:31.920> these<00:00:32.009> two

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
from here you're gonna split these two

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.350 
from here you're gonna split these two
blocks<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.610> diamonds<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.059> you're<00:00:33.239> gonna

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
blocks of diamonds up you're gonna

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.299 
blocks of diamonds up you're gonna
probably<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.290> two<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.219> you

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
probably do this with two or so then you

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.979 
probably do this with two or so then you
want<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.460> click<00:00:35.520> y<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> place<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.660> over<00:00:36.719> there

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and then click y on the other one then

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.010 
and then click y on the other one then
from<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.270> you're<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> go<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:39.899> here
