so<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.420> computer<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.260> already<00:02:25.620> know<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.910> is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
so this computer I already know it is

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.690 
so this computer I already know it is
most<00:02:28.290> likely<00:02:28.440> I'm<00:02:28.860> gonna<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.220> reinstall

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
most likely I'm gonna have to reinstall

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.400 
most likely I'm gonna have to reinstall
when<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.060> 8<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:33.050> well<00:02:34.050> actually<00:02:34.170> I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
when it was 8 on it so well actually I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.050 
when it was 8 on it so well actually I
won't<00:02:34.650> I'll<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.100> my<00:02:35.250> friend<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.760> since

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
won't I'll have my friend do that since

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.470 
won't I'll have my friend do that since
he<00:02:36.900> knows<00:02:37.050> how<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.380> all<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.620> stuff<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.480> I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
he knows how to do all that stuff and I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.280

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
have him take care of the reinstalling

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.070 
have him take care of the reinstalling

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
nice laptop the last one I had was a

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.350 
nice laptop the last one I had was a
dell<00:03:47.620> latitude<00:03:47.770> d620<00:03:50.610> well<00:03:51.610> that<00:03:51.760> one<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
dell latitude d620 well that one the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.410 
dell latitude d620 well that one the
backlight<00:03:52.810> broke<00:03:53.050> which<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.440> right<00:03:53.860> in<00:03:54.010> there

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
backlight broke which is right in there

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.080 
backlight broke which is right in there
and<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:58.020> my<00:03:59.020> friend<00:03:59.320> found<00:04:00.190> me<00:04:00.340> this<00:04:00.550> one<00:04:00.790> here

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
and so my friend found me this one here

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.200 
and so my friend found me this one here
so<00:04:01.390> now<00:04:01.900> I've<00:04:02.050> got<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.380> one<00:04:02.650> but<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:04.090> was

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
so now I've got this one but it was

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.120 
so now I've got this one but it was
thrown<00:04:04.450> across<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.870> room<00:04:05.080> so<00:04:07.560> this<00:04:08.560> part<00:04:08.830> here

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
thrown across the room so this part here

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.300 
thrown across the room so this part here
is<00:04:09.160> kind<00:04:09.490> of<00:04:09.610> goofy<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.680> can<00:04:11.830> see<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.160> won't

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
is kind of goofy so you can see it won't

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.350 
is kind of goofy so you can see it won't
close<00:04:13.800> but<00:04:14.800> if<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:15.010> push<00:04:15.250> that<00:04:15.850> corner<00:04:16.210> back

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
close but if I push that corner back

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.460 
close but if I push that corner back
then<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.260> closes<00:04:19.980> see<00:04:20.980> if<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.370> watch<00:04:21.549> here

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
then it closes see if you watch here

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.070 
then it closes see if you watch here
you<00:04:23.470> can<00:04:23.650> see<00:04:23.860> how<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:26.710> pops<00:04:26.980> up<00:04:27.190> right<00:04:27.400> here

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
you can see how that pops up right here

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.050 
you can see how that pops up right here
like<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.100> can<00:04:30.160> see<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:30.940> then

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
like that so you can see that and then

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.550 
like that so you can see that and then
this<00:04:31.840> comes<00:04:32.110> out<00:04:32.260> of<00:04:32.380> there<00:04:32.530> so<00:04:33.930> I<00:04:34.930> guess<00:04:35.440> I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
this comes out of there so I guess I

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.360 
this comes out of there so I guess I
could<00:04:35.740> this<00:04:35.920> time<00:04:36.130> but<00:04:36.420> you<00:04:37.420> know<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:39.100> get<00:04:39.250> the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
could this time but you know you get the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.890 
could this time but you know you get the
general<00:04:39.520> idea<00:04:39.850> there<00:04:40.920> definitely<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:42.900> nice

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
general idea there definitely a nice

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.380 
general idea there definitely a nice
laptop<00:04:44.170> otherwise<00:04:44.770> so<00:04:45.640> I'm<00:04:45.730> very<00:04:45.850> happy<00:04:46.270> with

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
laptop otherwise so I'm very happy with

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:54.720 
laptop otherwise so I'm very happy with
the<00:04:46.540> overall<00:04:47.260> condition<00:04:47.820> really<00:04:48.820> nice<00:04:53.730> so

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
the overall condition really nice so

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.690 
the overall condition really nice so
yeah<00:04:55.360> it's<00:04:55.510> got<00:04:55.630> Windows<00:04:55.900> 8<00:04:56.050> on<00:04:56.230> that<00:04:56.290> with<00:04:56.700> I'm

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
yeah it's got Windows 8 on that with I'm

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.620 
yeah it's got Windows 8 on that with I'm
gonna<00:04:57.910> guess<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.480> think<00:04:59.550> maybe<00:05:00.630> 64-bit

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
gonna guess I think maybe 64-bit

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.490 
gonna guess I think maybe 64-bit
operating<00:05:01.930> system

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500

I've got a 6 cell battery it's a brand
new<00:05:06.970> battery<00:05:07.210> almost<00:05:07.570> from<00:05:08.260> what<00:05:08.410> I've<00:05:08.470> been

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
new battery almost from what I've been

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.830

told

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
told

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.830 
told
oops<00:05:11.140> there<00:05:12.070> we<00:05:12.190> go

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
so almost full charge that one should

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.570 
so almost full charge that one should
hopefully<00:05:16.270> hold<00:05:16.630> thirds<00:05:17.350> longer

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
hopefully hold thirds longer

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.070
