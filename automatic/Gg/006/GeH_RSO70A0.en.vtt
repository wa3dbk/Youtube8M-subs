00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.450
 hello how about now I'm going to make an effect 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.090
 of color in the hair 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.460
 is going to be an effect with fantasy tint going 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.180
 to be roughly about half 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.519
 of the head but shaped v 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.300
 of triangle is going to be like your hands on 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.880
 the inner part that does not notice much 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.180
 but that looks good I will use a 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.570
 funny peanut fantasy dye that is 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.890
 This is a voodoo 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.120
 and if you want to do it with one more tone 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.370
 clear in pastel colors 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.239
 you can use conditioner or a 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.850
 treatment 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.329
 I'm going to use this treatment 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.670
 kurt and we are going to use gloves have been 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.140
 and a brush the first thing I'm going to leave 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.140
 to be splitting my hair in half 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.270
 and now I'm going to make a diagonal in 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.260
 each side forming the v everything depends on the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.260
 bone who wants it 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.310
 all right 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.030
 humans like that have to stay 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.030
 ah 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.010
 just the other side we are another diagonal 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.110
 the division does not have to be so 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.150
 perfect is a vee 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.150
 As you see, it must be left 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.920
 and what I'm going to do is paint the 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:45.149
 part of below we will use a 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.909
 percentage of dye and one of treatment 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.920
 of conditioner so that the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.109
 so intense color let's do it with 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 very careful without staining the rest of the 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.380
 hair 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.549
 to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.620
 ah 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.579
 let it sit for an hour and rinse 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.969
 nothing more with water but use the 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.960
 conditioner shampoo just water and 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:58.830
 preferably it is cold water 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:03.620
 as they see that way, the hair is left 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.620
 the inner part the bottom part 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.070
