00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110

easy<00:02:43.470> ride<00:02:44.130> down<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:45.300> go<00:02:45.420> any<00:02:45.600> other<00:02:45.720> way

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
you're going straight down the cliff and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.670 
you're going straight down the cliff and
I've<00:02:47.790> only<00:02:48.030> landed<00:02:48.480> at<00:02:48.600> once<00:02:48.870> other<00:02:49.320> than<00:02:49.560> that

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
I've only landed at once other than that

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.710

down<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.080> steep<00:02:52.290> hill<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> suggest<00:02:53.940> going

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270

right all along until it this is a big
cliff<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.470> then<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> little<00:03:02.370> drop

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790
