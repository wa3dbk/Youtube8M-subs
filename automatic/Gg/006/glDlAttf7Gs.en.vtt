the<00:00:52.450> program<00:00:52.600> we<00:00:53.320> need<00:00:53.470> to<00:00:53.590> locate<00:00:53.950> the<00:00:55.260> screen

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
the program we need to locate the screen

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.210 
the program we need to locate the screen
capture<00:00:56.680> Microsoft<00:00:57.580> expressions<00:00:58.300> I<00:00:59.220> then

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
capture Microsoft expressions I then

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.509 
capture Microsoft expressions I then
look<00:01:00.370> for<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.580> encoder<00:01:00.970> 4<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.980> I<00:01:03.160> see<00:01:03.340> a

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
look for the encoder 4 and I see a

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.260 
look for the encoder 4 and I see a
screen<00:01:04.269> and<00:01:04.510> this<00:01:04.629> will<00:01:04.809> open<00:01:05.110> up<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:06.270> program

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
screen and this will open up the program

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.750 
screen and this will open up the program
that<00:01:07.810> will<00:01:07.900> allow<00:01:08.080> me<00:01:08.260> to<00:01:08.440> do<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.920> video

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
that will allow me to do the video

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.950 
that will allow me to do the video
capturing<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:11.170> I'm<00:01:11.290> doing<00:01:11.470> right<00:01:11.800> now<00:01:12.960> I'm

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
capturing that I'm doing right now I'm

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.980 
capturing that I'm doing right now I'm
now<00:01:14.170> showing<00:01:14.410> you<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.890> uploaded<00:01:15.990> expressions

I<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.920> went<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.069> I<00:01:51.160> send<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:52.110> file<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.140> the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
I have a went and I send the file to the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.260 
I have a went and I send the file to the
encoder<00:01:53.860> we're<00:01:54.759> just<00:01:54.819> going<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.060> place<00:01:55.240> it

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
encoder we're just going to place it

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.740 
encoder we're just going to place it
down<00:01:55.569> here<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.759> want<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.390> change

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
down here and if you want you can change

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.669 
down here and if you want you can change
the<00:01:59.050> mode<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.950> CBR<00:02:00.940> one<00:02:01.209> pass<00:02:01.479> sort<00:02:02.289> deuce<00:02:02.500> the

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
the mode to CBR one pass sort deuce the

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.919 
the mode to CBR one pass sort deuce the
size<00:02:03.160> of<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.520> file<00:02:03.849> and<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:06.039> encode

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
size of the file and then you can encode

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.120 
size of the file and then you can encode
it<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:09.550> will<00:02:09.700> then<00:02:09.910> send<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.630> file

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
it and this will then send that file

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.820 
it and this will then send that file
into<00:02:12.130> your<00:02:12.280> documents<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.440> see<00:02:14.650> where

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
into your documents we can see where

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.480 
into your documents we can see where
it's<00:02:14.980> going<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.310> appear<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.650> output

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
it's going to appear in the output

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.320 
it's going to appear in the output
and<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:20.060> appears<00:02:20.420> my<00:02:20.720> documents

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.940 

now<00:02:27.330> I've<00:02:27.480> little<00:02:27.720> Gator<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.050> drop<00:02:28.380> file<00:02:28.650> in

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
now I've little Gator the drop file in

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.630 
now I've little Gator the drop file in
my<00:02:29.310> documents<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.470> expressions<00:02:31.470> I'll<00:02:32.100> go<00:02:32.400> into

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
my documents in expressions I'll go into

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.390 
my documents in expressions I'll go into
expressions<00:02:33.209> encoder<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.130> then<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.190> will<00:02:35.250> go

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
expressions encoder and then I will go

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.240 
expressions encoder and then I will go
into<00:02:35.840> screen<00:02:37.819> correction<00:02:38.819> outputs<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:41.010> will

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
into screen correction outputs and will

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.949 
into screen correction outputs and will
find<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.670> latest<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.360> which<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.050> right<00:02:43.530> here

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
find the latest one which is right here

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.520 
find the latest one which is right here
and<00:02:45.959> then<00:02:46.200> i<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.830> Windows<00:02:47.520> Movie<00:02:47.970> Maker

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
and then i have this Windows Movie Maker

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.740 
and then i have this Windows Movie Maker
windows<00:02:49.530> media<00:02:49.830> file<00:02:50.520> which<00:02:51.330> I'm<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.630> going
