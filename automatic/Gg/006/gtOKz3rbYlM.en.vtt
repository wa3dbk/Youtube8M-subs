00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
if we view the tutorial is going to use

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.649 
if we view the tutorial is going to use
the<00:01:07.470> generic<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.420> there

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
there's really no point in going over

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.899 
there's really no point in going over
these<00:01:12.350> unless<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.920> should<00:01:14.369> assure

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
these unless they actually should assure

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.249 
these unless they actually should assure
to<00:01:15.000> customize<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.990> would<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.170> been

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
to customize it that would have been

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
to customize it that would have been
much<00:01:16.470> better<00:01:19.130> at<00:01:20.130> least<00:01:20.280> their<00:01:20.490> gestures<00:01:20.880> are

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
guess the beginning is easy I think it's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.050 
guess the beginning is easy I think it's
this<00:02:05.720> guy<00:02:05.960> yeah<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:06.860> he<00:02:07.040> has<00:02:07.490> definitely

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
