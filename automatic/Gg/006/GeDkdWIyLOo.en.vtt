00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.980
 hello dear tennis fans i have for 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.529
 the new babolat prodrive 2015 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.410
 tested here he is in the new design with 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.520
 the known data he weighs 300 grams 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.730
 He has a 645 head and a 32 balance 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.439
 and a 16 19 removal image in the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.380
 Compared to the predecessor has not 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.030
 Much done except for a special detail 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.730
 and indeed have evaluations of babolat 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 play systems show that the sweet spot 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 not exactly betz in the middle of the part 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.039
 is wanting to move up a bit 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 has moved by babbel has 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.910
 reacts and the holes of the grommets too 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 moved up so here in the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 upper part of the board the lateral sides 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.059
 a little closer together so that you are there 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.829
 in the area a little more behind 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.929
 ball has and direct game led 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.719
 in the square can then immediately 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.679
 well-known prodrive feeling 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.059
 unbelievable power and errors 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.280
 forgive the game by the big one 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.870
 It's really unbelievable what 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.580
 this racket of momentum 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.810
 developed and how much steam man 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 can get behind the ball 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.310
 just in front and backhand and at the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.820
 this is especially true 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.320
 validity 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.270
 almost too much power 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.250
 for me because I swing very fast 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.070
 I had the ball spinning an enormous amount of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.150
 give it so that it comes in the field but 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.130
 players do not do it that fast 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.360
 swing and the lot of owner of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.460
 are expecting their own bat 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.200
 exactly right 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.240
 on the net the same picture enormously much 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.770
 pressure and train in the volleys at the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.800
 You just have to be careful about that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.840
 you hit him right and the ball 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.050
 always demanded that has the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.670
 Ball in the field comes down at the serve 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.430
 in my Ã¼ber Kopfball comes the pure 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.480
 drive then his power back one man 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.970
 can really make the ball great 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.550
 accelerate and whopping loads with 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.020
 playing high speed in the field 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.400
 altogether a racket for one 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.900
 wide mass is suitable from 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.260
 hobby player to tournament player 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.820
 Everyone is happy with it 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.620
 especially the leisure player that very 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.240
 A lot of power is expected from his bat 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.920
 because not so much has to do something 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.869
 slower swinging is here with 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.640
 just right the tournament player 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.430
 ambitious the fast swing has 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.560
 just have to give a little more spin and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.050
 can then but still the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.410
 adversary in distress 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.890
 bring 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.720
 The bubble from 2015 looks at him 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.250
 It is worthwhile to watch it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.250
 and I'm looking forward to the next time
