00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
data so now you guys you're going at if

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.439 
data so now you guys you're going at if
you<00:01:00.210> use<00:01:01.640> Internet<00:01:02.640> Explorer<00:01:03.180> you're<00:01:03.300> going

you use Internet Explorer you're going
to<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.809> compatibility<00:01:04.320> view<00:01:04.470> off

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to want to have compatibility view off

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.020 
to want to have compatibility view off
as<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.360> screws<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:08.850> thing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
as it really screws this up so one thing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
as it really screws this up so one thing
is<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.600> symbols<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.560> never<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
is these symbols will never be in the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
is these symbols will never be in the
same<00:01:11.400> spot<00:01:11.820> twice<00:01:12.860> actually<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:13.979> what

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
same spot twice actually you know what

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.410 
same spot twice actually you know what
they<00:01:14.189> might<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.850> been<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.240> pesky

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
they might be they have been for pesky

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
they might be they have been for pesky
time<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> use<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
time going to use this so I'm going to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.880 
time going to use this so I'm going to
use<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.450> pillar<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> code<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.680> find

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
use the pillar about the code you find

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.740 
use the pillar about the code you find
on<00:01:20.070> pillar<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.490> autumn<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
on pillar of autumn that's right you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.350 
on pillar of autumn that's right you
find<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.350> ginger<00:01:23.009> code<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
find the ginger code and you have to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.480 
find the ginger code and you have to
find<00:01:24.600> them<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> actual<00:01:25.560> terminals<00:01:26.040> from

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
find them in the actual terminals from

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.960 
find them in the actual terminals from
halo<00:01:26.850> anniversary<00:01:28.759> let's<00:01:29.759> go<00:01:29.820> ahead<00:01:29.880> and

alright<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:39.020> they<00:01:39.110> got<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.560> code<00:01:39.740> right<00:01:39.920> there

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
alright so they got the code right there

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.639 
alright so they got the code right there
I'm<00:01:41.030> enter<00:01:43.750> up<00:01:44.770> never<00:01:45.770> recovered<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.460> but<00:01:47.649> it's

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
I'm enter up never recovered it but it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.440 
I'm enter up never recovered it but it's
a<00:01:48.770> little<00:01:48.979> work<00:01:49.070> but<00:01:49.700> basically<00:01:50.060> that's<00:01:50.299> what

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
you do you go to the end of the terminal

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.980 
you do you go to the end of the terminal
and<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.670> watch<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:53.270> then<00:01:53.539> you<00:01:53.630> enter<00:01:53.780> the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
and you watch it and then you enter the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.120 
and you watch it and then you enter the
code<00:01:54.200> at<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.439> end<00:01:54.759> now<00:01:56.530> when<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.649> get<00:01:57.920> that

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
code at the end now when you get that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.130 
code at the end now when you get that
see<00:01:58.520> I've<00:01:58.640> got<00:01:58.789> my<00:01:58.909> um<00:01:59.090> we've<00:01:59.840> got<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.020> two

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
see I've got my um we've got the two

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.060 
see I've got my um we've got the two
Charles<00:02:00.409> have<00:02:00.530> there<00:02:00.939> so<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.450> can<00:02:02.600> actually

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
watch the terminal and only that they go

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.910
