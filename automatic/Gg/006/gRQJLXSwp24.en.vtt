balanced so that they both go down at

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
if you don't manage this so a bit of

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.510 
if you don't manage this so a bit of
careful<00:05:18.870> coordination<00:05:19.229> this<00:05:20.070> is<00:05:20.190> more<00:05:20.400> about

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
careful coordination this is more about

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.450 
careful coordination this is more about
staying<00:05:21.000> alive<00:05:21.150> this<00:05:21.510> fight<00:05:22.070> DPS<00:05:23.070> obviously

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
staying alive this fight DPS obviously

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.270 
staying alive this fight DPS obviously
is<00:05:23.760> important<00:05:24.360> but<00:05:24.710> survival<00:05:25.710> is<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.830> biggest

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
is important but survival is the biggest

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.939 
is important but survival is the biggest
thing<00:05:26.460> about<00:05:26.669> this<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.900> tanks<00:05:28.320> do<00:05:28.710> get
