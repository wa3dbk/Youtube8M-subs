something that's really thick and creamy
because<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.289> blend<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.679> to<00:01:55.830> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
because this is going to blend it to the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.839 
because this is going to blend it to the
skin<00:01:56.599> more<00:01:57.599> easily<00:01:57.989> than<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.470> okay<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:01.849> you

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.160 
skin more easily than that okay so you
definitely<00:02:05.360> need<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.509> use<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.690> concealer

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
definitely need to use the concealer

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.400 
definitely need to use the concealer
brush<00:02:07.649> or<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.550> use<00:02:08.580> your<00:02:08.849> fingers

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
as I said I use a different concealer

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.009 
as I said I use a different concealer
for<00:03:35.080> this<00:03:35.379> I<00:03:35.680> use<00:03:36.269> first<00:03:37.269> my<00:03:37.569> bin<00:03:37.810> deine

for this I use first my bin deine
concealer<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:39.790> use<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.239> color<00:03:40.450> because

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
concealer and I use this color because

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.500 
concealer and I use this color because
it's<00:03:40.959> kind<00:03:41.319> of<00:03:41.500> it's<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.950> brown<00:03:42.220> concealer<00:03:42.910> but

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
it's kind of it's a brown concealer but

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.110 
it's kind of it's a brown concealer but
it<00:03:43.599> has<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> Solomon<00:03:44.410> undertone<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.970> it

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it has a Solomon undertone to it so it

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:56.970 
it has a Solomon undertone to it so it
really<00:03:46.420> helps<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.959> cancel<00:03:47.440> out<00:03:47.590> dark<00:03:47.860> circles

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.680 

and<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:57.640> like<00:03:57.879> to<00:03:58.090> use<00:03:58.360> a<00:04:00.120> heavier<00:04:01.120> concealer

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
and I like to use a heavier concealer

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.530 
and I like to use a heavier concealer
under<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.110> eye<00:04:02.459> because<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.489> find<00:04:03.909> that<00:04:04.269> it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
under the eye because I find that it

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.009 
under the eye because I find that it
lasts<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.140> bit<00:04:05.379> longer<00:04:09.030> then<00:04:10.030> if<00:04:10.239> I<00:04:10.390> were<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.810> use

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
lasts a bit longer then if I were to use

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.839 
lasts a bit longer then if I were to use
a<00:04:11.049> lighter<00:04:11.470> concealer<00:04:13.830> because<00:04:14.830> I<00:04:15.160> do<00:04:15.280> tend<00:04:15.760> to

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
a lighter concealer because I do tend to

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.409 
a lighter concealer because I do tend to
have<00:04:16.120> dark<00:04:16.720> circles<00:04:16.959> underneath<00:04:17.560> my<00:04:17.829> eyes<00:04:18.010> I

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.330

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340
