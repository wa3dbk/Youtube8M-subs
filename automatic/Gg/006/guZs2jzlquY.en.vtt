course<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.710> also<00:01:47.040> has<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:48.119> following<00:01:48.299> options

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
course it also has the following options

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.039 
course it also has the following options
you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.200> our<00:01:49.439> nine<00:01:49.740> head<00:01:50.240> LED<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you can have our nine head LED or you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
you can have our nine head LED or you
can<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> six<00:01:52.860> head<00:01:53.100> LED<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
can have a six head LED so you get to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
can have a six head LED so you get to
decide<00:01:54.710> what<00:01:55.710> option<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.219> want<00:01:56.460> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
decide what option you want and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.770 
decide what option you want and
basically<00:01:56.759> how<00:01:57.030> much<00:01:57.180> money<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
basically how much money you want to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.980 
basically how much money you want to
spend<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.280> far<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.490> bracketry<00:02:00.060> goes<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.659> again

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
spend as far as bracketry goes and again

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.209 
spend as far as bracketry goes and again
we'll<00:02:01.140> talk<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> studio

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
we'll talk about that in the studio

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.679 
we'll talk about that in the studio
there<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:02.790> different<00:02:03.180> brackets<00:02:03.540> for

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
there are different brackets for

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.090 
there are different brackets for
different<00:02:04.140> types<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.500> vehicles<00:02:04.860> because

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
different types of vehicles because

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.039 
different types of vehicles because
obviously<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.610> every<00:02:05.850> mirror<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
obviously not every mirror is going to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.990 
obviously not every mirror is going to
be<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> same<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.979> let's<00:02:08.129> take<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> look<00:02:08.789> at<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
be the same so let's take a look at it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:24.910 
be the same so let's take a look at it
with<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> camera<00:02:09.539> outside

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.059 

now<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.910> light<00:02:26.060> head<00:02:26.240> itself<00:02:26.600> has<00:02:27.440> an<00:02:27.680> angle

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
now the light head itself has an angle

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.309 
now the light head itself has an angle
of<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.250> hundred<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.760> eighty<00:02:28.910> degrees<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.720> when

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
of a hundred and eighty degrees and when

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.280 
of a hundred and eighty degrees and when
you're<00:02:30.440> putting<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.830> on<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> vehicle

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
you're putting it on to the vehicle

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.110 
you're putting it on to the vehicle
housing<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.800> will<00:02:33.950> get<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.459> set<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.060> up

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
housing you will get to set that up

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.750 
housing you will get to set that up
again<00:02:35.920> relating<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> bracketry<00:02:37.580> that

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
again relating to the bracketry that

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.130 
again relating to the bracketry that
will<00:02:37.880> be<00:02:37.970> supplied<00:02:38.330> with<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.900> particular

you right now but essentially here is
the<00:03:27.730> light<00:03:27.910> head<00:03:28.090> itself<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.650> what<00:03:30.459> we<00:03:30.610> have

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
the light head itself and what we have

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.839 
the light head itself and what we have
here<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.390> an<00:03:31.599> aluminum<00:03:32.019> housing<00:03:32.709> on<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.670> back

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
here is an aluminum housing on the back

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.100 
here is an aluminum housing on the back
which<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.360> course<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.630> obviously<00:03:34.930> where<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
which of course is obviously where the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.319 
which of course is obviously where the
heatsink<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.860> then<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.730> front<00:03:36.849> area

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
heatsink is and then in the front area

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.720 
heatsink is and then in the front area
here<00:03:37.569> we<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:38.400> 180<00:03:39.400> degree<00:03:39.970> curved<00:03:41.730> light

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
here we have a 180 degree curved light

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.640 
here we have a 180 degree curved light
array<00:03:43.060> which<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.629> course<00:03:43.660> has<00:03:43.959> got<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
array which of course has got the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.000 
array which of course has got the
generation<00:03:45.220> 3<00:03:45.489> LEDs<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.500> as<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.799> said

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
generation 3 LEDs in it and as I said

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.610 
generation 3 LEDs in it and as I said
earlier<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.670> have<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.420> ability<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.930> have

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
earlier you have the ability to have

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.250 
earlier you have the ability to have
either<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.250> 9<00:03:51.760> configuration<00:03:52.690> or<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.870> 6

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
either a 9 configuration or a 6

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.349 
either a 9 configuration or a 6
configuration<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.370> again<00:03:54.819> they<00:03:54.940> will<00:03:55.090> come

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
configuration and again they will come

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.890 
configuration and again they will come
out<00:03:55.510> with<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:56.680> time<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:57.519> right<00:03:58.000> now<00:03:58.269> what

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
out with that in time so right now what

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.229 
out with that in time so right now what
we<00:03:59.049> have<00:03:59.079> is<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.739> 9<00:04:00.010> array<00:04:00.730> is<00:04:00.970> what<00:04:01.150> I'm

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
we have is the 9 array is what I'm

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.479

you have a driver side and a passenger
side<00:05:19.819> bracket<00:05:20.720> for<00:05:20.900> those<00:05:21.020> particular

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
side bracket for those particular

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.620 
side bracket for those particular
vehicles<00:05:21.800> why<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.400> brackets<00:05:23.000> essentially

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
vehicles why the brackets essentially

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.430 
vehicles why the brackets essentially
obviously<00:05:24.440> not<00:05:25.190> all<00:05:25.840> outside<00:05:26.840> mirrors<00:05:27.289> are

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
obviously not all outside mirrors are

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.920 
obviously not all outside mirrors are
the<00:05:27.560> same<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:28.310> have<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.729> be<00:05:28.849> able<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.120> angle

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
the same so you have to be able to angle

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.580 
the same so you have to be able to angle
the<00:05:30.710> light<00:05:30.889> head<00:05:31.069> itself<00:05:31.460> onto<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:32.599> outside

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
the light head itself onto the outside

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.580 
the light head itself onto the outside
mirror<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.610> again<00:05:35.360> these<00:05:35.900> particular<00:05:36.289> light

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
mirror and again these particular light

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.080 
mirror and again these particular light
heads<00:05:36.830> will<00:05:37.009> give<00:05:37.220> you<00:05:37.400> different<00:05:37.580> degrees<00:05:38.060> of

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
heads will give you different degrees of

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.520 
heads will give you different degrees of
angle<00:05:38.509> one<00:05:38.720> will<00:05:38.900> for<00:05:39.020> example<00:05:39.050> with<00:05:39.440> you

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
angle one will for example with you

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.520 
angle one will for example with you
would<00:05:39.650> give<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:40.009> a<00:05:40.070> 10<00:05:40.400> degree<00:05:40.669> angle

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
would give you a 10 degree angle

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
would give you a 10 degree angle
configuration<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:42.680> the<00:05:43.070> other<00:05:43.220> will<00:05:43.400> give

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
configuration and the other will give

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.450 
configuration and the other will give
you<00:05:43.669> a<00:05:43.699> 5<00:05:44.120> or<00:05:44.599> in<00:05:45.349> this<00:05:45.500> case<00:05:45.710> the<00:05:45.889> utility<00:05:46.310> one

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
you a 5 or in this case the utility one

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.999 
you a 5 or in this case the utility one
which<00:05:46.639> is<00:05:46.789> basically<00:05:47.449> zero<00:05:47.810> but<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.650> object

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
which is basically zero but the object

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.439 
which is basically zero but the object
being<00:05:49.190> that<00:05:49.370> once<00:05:49.580> you<00:05:49.669> put<00:05:49.849> it<00:05:49.940> in<00:05:50.000> place<00:05:50.270> is

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
being that once you put it in place is

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.360 
being that once you put it in place is
totally<00:05:50.630> flat<00:05:51.169> so<00:05:51.680> they<00:05:51.800> don't<00:05:51.949> need<00:05:52.039> to<00:05:52.160> angle

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
totally flat so they don't need to angle

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.300 
totally flat so they don't need to angle
it<00:05:52.610> so<00:05:53.240> again<00:05:53.539> this<00:05:53.960> is<00:05:54.199> the<00:05:54.380> brand<00:05:54.889> new<00:05:55.070> light

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
it so again this is the brand new light

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.999 
it so again this is the brand new light
available<00:05:56.090> from<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.479> gang<00:05:56.659> over<00:05:56.900> at<00:05:57.289> sound

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009

off<00:05:58.220> so<00:05:58.580> I'm<00:05:58.669> gonna<00:05:58.759> turn<00:05:58.970> it<00:05:59.030> on<00:05:59.150> here<00:05:59.389> inside

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
off so I'm gonna turn it on here inside

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.120 
off so I'm gonna turn it on here inside
the<00:05:59.750> studio<00:06:00.050> you<00:06:00.229> already<00:06:00.440> saw<00:06:00.590> it<00:06:00.680> outside<00:06:00.860> so

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
the studio you already saw it outside so

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.860 
the studio you already saw it outside so
let's<00:06:01.430> turn<00:06:01.610> it<00:06:01.729> on<00:06:01.789> and<00:06:01.849> see<00:06:02.389> how<00:06:02.569> bright<00:06:02.810> I

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
let's turn it on and see how bright I

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.610 
at the camera there we go so there you
have<00:06:14.330> it<00:06:14.509> I'm<00:06:14.810> going<00:06:15.020> to<00:06:15.080> move<00:06:15.289> it<00:06:15.409> slightly

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
have it I'm going to move it slightly

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.920 
have it I'm going to move it slightly
off<00:06:15.860> axis<00:06:16.280> here<00:06:16.550> but<00:06:16.940> you<00:06:17.090> can<00:06:17.300> see<00:06:17.570> as<00:06:17.780> I'm

off axis here but you can see as I'm

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.999 
off axis here but you can see as I'm
turning<00:06:18.349> this<00:06:18.500> here<00:06:18.800> you've<00:06:19.759> got<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:21.009> 180

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
turning this here you've got the 180

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.640 
turning this here you've got the 180
degree<00:06:22.520> angle<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:25.960> again<00:06:26.960> there's<00:06:27.320> 30

it down and you can still see you can

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.870 
it down and you can still see you can
still<00:06:45.080> see<00:06:45.259> it<00:06:45.349> fairly<00:06:45.710> good<00:06:45.889> and<00:06:46.099> then<00:06:46.759> I'll

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 
still see it fairly good and then I'll

not<00:06:54.080> there's<00:06:54.320> going<00:06:54.469> to<00:06:54.560> be<00:06:54.620> different

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
not there's going to be different
