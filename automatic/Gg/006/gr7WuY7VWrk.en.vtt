best<00:01:51.180> way<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.360> figure<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.810> how<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.200> works<00:01:52.439> is

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
best way to figure out how it works is

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.730 
best way to figure out how it works is
just<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.119> take<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
just to take it like this and just and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
just to take it like this and just and
just<00:01:55.770> work<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> lever<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.360> study<00:01:57.869> how<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
just work the lever and study how it

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.249 
just work the lever and study how it
goes<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.460> basically<00:01:59.880> got<00:02:00.149> three<00:02:00.259> components

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
goes you basically got three components

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.260 
goes you basically got three components
the<00:02:02.329> take-up<00:02:03.329> reel<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:05.460> drive<00:02:05.820> ring<00:02:06.090> or

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
that for left and right SRAM did not

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.920 
that for left and right SRAM did not
make<00:03:02.159> two<00:03:02.909> different<00:03:04.069> drive<00:03:05.069> cogs<00:03:05.629> this<00:03:06.629> one

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
make two different drive cogs this one

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.850 
make two different drive cogs this one
has<00:03:07.319> as<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:08.550> can<00:03:08.700> see<00:03:09.800> ten<00:03:12.019> ten<00:03:13.019> slots<00:03:13.319> on<00:03:13.620> one

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
has as you can see ten ten slots on one

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.509 
has as you can see ten ten slots on one
side<00:03:14.159> of<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:16.110> then<00:03:17.330> two<00:03:18.330> on<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> other

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
side of and then two on the other

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.860 
side of and then two on the other
basically<00:03:20.519> what<00:03:20.730> you've<00:03:20.879> got<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.360> built<00:03:21.690> in

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
basically what you've got is a built in

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.039 
basically what you've got is a built in
spare<00:03:22.230> part

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
spare part

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.640 
spare part
typically<00:03:25.049> with<00:03:25.379> these<00:03:25.760> ceramics

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
typically with these ceramics

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.720 
typically with these ceramics
particularly<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.830> found<00:03:29.099> with<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.459> front

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
particularly I found with the front

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.710 
particularly I found with the front
shifter<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:33.299> case<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:36.390> can<00:03:36.510> get<00:03:36.690> a

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
shifter the in this case you can get a

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.839 
shifter the in this case you can get a
view<00:03:37.500> out<00:03:37.739> here<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:39.030> step<00:03:39.720> has<00:03:40.849> broken

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
view out here this step has broken

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.119 
view out here this step has broken
basically<00:03:42.840> sheared<00:03:43.230> off<00:03:43.470> because<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
basically sheared off because of the

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.289 
basically sheared off because of the
force<00:03:44.870> put<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.140> mechanism<00:03:46.739> by<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.700> shift

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
force put on the mechanism by the shift

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.580 
force put on the mechanism by the shift
cable<00:03:49.610> so<00:03:50.610> you've<00:03:51.209> got<00:03:51.480> what<00:03:52.170> we<00:03:52.290> basically

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
cable so you've got what we basically

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.270 
cable so you've got what we basically
need<00:03:53.040> here<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.519> another<00:03:55.760> spare<00:03:56.760> part<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:58.280> we

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
need here is another spare part and we

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.030 
need here is another spare part and we
have<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.640> over<00:03:59.730> here<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.299> other<00:04:00.420> side

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
have it over here on the other side

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.890 
have it over here on the other side
because<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.640> as<00:04:02.849> I<00:04:03.000> say<00:04:03.180> was<00:04:03.360> machined<00:04:03.810> with

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
because this as I say was machined with

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.149 
because this as I say was machined with
the<00:04:06.900> front<00:04:07.200> shift<00:04:08.090> steps<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.930> one<00:04:10.650> side<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:10.920> the

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
the front shift steps on one side of the

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.710 
the front shift steps on one side of the
ring<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:12.950> tennspeed<00:04:14.000> steps<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.269> the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
ring and the tennspeed steps on the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.289 
ring and the tennspeed steps on the
other<00:04:15.750> side<00:04:16.079> so<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.979> trick<00:04:17.220> for<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.970> just

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
other side so the trick for this is just

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.009 
other side so the trick for this is just
to<00:04:18.419> dismantle<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:20.040> unit<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.579> swap<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.810> two

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
to dismantle the unit and swap the two

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.800 
to dismantle the unit and swap the two
rings<00:04:22.320> over<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.790> you'll<00:04:24.000> effectively<00:04:24.330> have

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
rings over and you'll effectively have

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.790 
rings over and you'll effectively have
new<00:04:24.990> shifters<00:04:25.440> then

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
new shifters then

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.279 
new shifters then
so<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.580> way<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.030> do<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.810> this<00:04:27.900> has<00:04:28.050> been

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
so the way to do that and this has been

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.580 
so the way to do that and this has been
covered<00:04:28.590> in<00:04:28.650> other<00:04:28.830> videos<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.449> knock<00:04:31.229> this

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
covered in other videos is to knock this

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.420 
covered in other videos is to knock this
pivot<00:04:32.099> pin<00:04:32.460> out<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:33.720> remove<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:35.240> shift<00:04:36.240> lever

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
pivot pin out to remove the shift lever

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:46.850 
pivot pin out to remove the shift lever
then<00:04:40.699> take<00:04:41.699> off<00:04:41.909> this<00:04:42.889> screw<00:04:43.889> at<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.639> side<00:04:45.860> too

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
then take off this screw at the side too

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.909 
then take off this screw at the side too
in<00:04:46.979> order<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.370> remove<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:48.319> pin<00:04:49.319> you<00:04:49.650> need<00:04:49.830> to

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
in order to remove the pin you need to

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.990 
in order to remove the pin you need to
go<00:04:50.069> in<00:04:50.280> from<00:04:50.690> from<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:51.870> end<00:04:52.139> here<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.000> knock

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
go in from from this end here and knock

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.649 
go in from from this end here and knock
out<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:55.259> pivot<00:04:56.190> pin<00:04:56.430> that's<00:04:56.729> this<00:04:56.940> unit<00:04:57.300> here

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
out the pivot pin that's this unit here

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:05.839 
out the pivot pin that's this unit here
and<00:04:58.639> then<00:04:59.639> out<00:05:00.599> come<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:04.699> basically<00:05:05.699> this

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
and then out come the basically this

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.620 
and then out come the basically this
this<00:05:07.159> shift<00:05:08.159> unit<00:05:08.520> here<00:05:08.699> with<00:05:08.909> what<00:05:09.180> shrim

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
this shift unit here with what shrim

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.589 
this shift unit here with what shrim
calls<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.789> transport<00:05:11.789> pole<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.180> can<00:05:12.300> see

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
calls the transport pole you can see

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.010 
calls the transport pole you can see
that<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:13.470> pivot<00:05:13.740> hole<00:05:14.039> there<00:05:15.020> typically

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
that the pivot hole there typically

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.249 
that the pivot hole there typically
you're<00:05:16.590> just<00:05:17.270> moving<00:05:18.270> it<00:05:18.539> like<00:05:18.719> this<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.169> the

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
you're just moving it like this and the

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.850 
you're just moving it like this and the
transport<00:05:19.860> Paul<00:05:20.130> will<00:05:20.460> actually<00:05:20.969> move<00:05:21.860> push

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
transport Paul will actually move push

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.730 
transport Paul will actually move push
the<00:05:24.289> drive<00:05:25.289> cog<00:05:25.650> up<00:05:25.979> and<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.740> holding

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
the drive cog up and the the holding

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.480 
the drive cog up and the the holding
pole<00:05:29.009> will<00:05:29.490> simply<00:05:29.909> snap<00:05:30.870> in<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.289> the<00:05:31.490> nearest

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
pole will simply snap in to the nearest

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.459 
pole will simply snap in to the nearest
ring<00:05:33.479> or<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.560> nearest<00:05:34.740> step<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.490> hold<00:05:36.000> it<00:05:36.469> so

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
ring or the nearest step and hold it so

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.890 
ring or the nearest step and hold it so
once<00:05:38.280> you've<00:05:38.490> actually<00:05:38.699> taken<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.270> apart<00:05:39.659> it

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
once you've actually taken this apart it

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.439 
once you've actually taken this apart it
becomes<00:05:40.860> fairly<00:05:41.279> self-evident<00:05:41.699> how<00:05:42.090> it<00:05:42.240> works

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
becomes fairly self-evident how it works

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.719 
becomes fairly self-evident how it works
but<00:05:43.139> I<00:05:43.199> think<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.500> coolest<00:05:43.710> feature<00:05:44.099> is<00:05:44.430> the

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
but I think the coolest feature is the

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.830 
but I think the coolest feature is the
fact<00:05:44.940> that<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.120> can<00:05:45.270> swap<00:05:45.569> these<00:05:45.870> rings<00:05:46.229> and

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
fact that you can swap these rings and

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.709 
fact that you can swap these rings and
as<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.979> result<00:05:50.400> you've<00:05:50.669> got<00:05:50.880> built<00:05:51.210> in<00:05:51.330> spare

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
as a result you've got built in spare

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.750 
as a result you've got built in spare
parts
