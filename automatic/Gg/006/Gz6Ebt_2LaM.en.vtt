first of all the lower cages poppy was

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.950 
first of all the lower cages poppy was
in<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> five<00:00:46.710> by<00:00:46.920> two<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.430> Dillon<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> 3<00:00:48.600> by

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
in a five by two and Dillon in the 3 by

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.130 
in a five by two and Dillon in the 3 by
2<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.950> middle<00:00:50.250> which<00:00:51.239> was<00:00:51.480> okay<00:00:51.840> when<00:00:52.050> he

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
2 in the middle which was okay when he

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
2 in the middle which was okay when he
was<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:52.770> until<00:00:53.039> he'd<00:00:53.340> been<00:00:53.520> muted

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
was just in there until he'd been muted

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.330 
was just in there until he'd been muted
and<00:00:54.030> could<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> girls<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.680> bit

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and could go in with the girls but a bit

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.060 
and could go in with the girls but a bit
small<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> keep<00:00:57.090> him<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.570> permanently

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
small to keep him in there permanently

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.639 
small to keep him in there permanently
so<00:00:59.070> I've<00:00:59.160> extended<00:00:59.670> his<00:01:00.149> cage<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.660> grid<00:01:01.350> so

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
so I've extended his cage one grid so

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.889 
so I've extended his cage one grid so
he's<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.039> got<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> four<00:01:02.579> by<00:01:02.730> two<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
he's now got a four by two and so

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200 
he's now got a four by two and so
poppies<00:01:04.290> got<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:05.159> good<00:01:05.309> smaller<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.000> she's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
poppies got one good smaller so she's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.140 
poppies got one good smaller so she's
got<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> four<00:01:06.689> by<00:01:06.900> two<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.850> been

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
got a four by two so I think that's been

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.580 
got a four by two so I think that's been
sorted<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.510> quite<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:09.840> they've<00:01:10.140> both<00:01:10.350> got

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
sorted out quite well they've both got

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.060 
sorted out quite well they've both got
enough<00:01:10.860> space<00:01:11.540> mini<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.290> harder<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
enough space mini was a little harder to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
enough space mini was a little harder to
work<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.030> she<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.420> had

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
work out what to do because she just had

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.760 
work out what to do because she just had
that<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.080> long<00:01:17.780> strip<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.200> good<00:01:19.439> wide

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that one long strip of one good wide

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
that one long strip of one good wide
which<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.850> didn't<00:01:21.840> feel<00:01:22.020> was<00:01:22.140> enough<00:01:22.409> space<00:01:22.650> she

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
which I didn't feel was enough space she

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.749 
which I didn't feel was enough space she
couldn't<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.640> run<00:01:23.909> round<00:01:24.119> properly<00:01:24.600> I

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
couldn't really run round properly I

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.710 
couldn't really run round properly I
couldn't<00:01:26.759> put<00:01:26.939> two<00:01:26.970> grids<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> way<00:01:27.659> along

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
couldn't put two grids all the way along

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.780 
couldn't put two grids all the way along
because<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.619> put<00:01:28.799> them<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.460> couldn't

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
because if I put them here I couldn't

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
because if I put them here I couldn't
get<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.420> Poppy's<00:01:30.780> cage<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.350> too<00:01:31.470> small

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
get in to Poppy's cage it was too small

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.440 
get in to Poppy's cage it was too small
a<00:01:31.799> gap<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.450> could<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.570> put<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.280> doors<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.700> by

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a gap I could have put a doors in by

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.140 
a gap I could have put a doors in by
putting<00:01:36.930> opening<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:37.650> two<00:01:37.979> lower<00:01:38.400> grids

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
putting opening these two lower grids

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.569 
putting opening these two lower grids
but<00:01:40.110> I've<00:01:40.229> got<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> bad<00:01:40.650> back<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.340> don't

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
but I've got a bad back and I don't

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.770 
but I've got a bad back and I don't
think<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.000> would<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.180> cope<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.540> all<00:01:42.600> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
think it would have cope with all that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.410 
think it would have cope with all that
bending<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> end<00:01:44.670> I've<00:01:44.970> come<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.270> with

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
bending so in the end I've come up with

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.440 
bending so in the end I've come up with
this<00:01:45.840> which<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.560> putting<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.130> grid<00:01:47.520> over

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
this which is putting one grid over

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.600 
this which is putting one grid over

the<00:02:46.830> support<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.750> still<00:02:49.020> allowed<00:02:49.800> me<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.130> have

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
the support but still allowed me to have

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.070 
the support but still allowed me to have
access<00:02:50.459> I'm<00:02:50.910> another<00:02:51.300> thing<00:02:51.390> I've<00:02:51.600> done<00:02:51.630> is

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
access I'm another thing I've done is

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.500 
access I'm another thing I've done is
this<00:02:52.440> these<00:02:53.340> cages<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> conservatory

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
this these cages of in the conservatory

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.020 
this these cages of in the conservatory
and<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.320> gets<00:02:55.440> quite<00:02:55.709> cold<00:02:56.130> in<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.519> winter<00:02:56.850> as

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
and it gets quite cold in the winter as

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.780 
and it gets quite cold in the winter as
they're<00:02:57.209> up<00:02:57.330> right<00:02:57.959> up<00:02:58.110> against<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.530> window

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
they're up right up against the window

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.340 
they're up right up against the window
if<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.000> northerly<00:03:00.390> wind<00:03:00.720> blowing<00:03:01.170> right

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
across the field behind our house it

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.170 
across the field behind our house it
gets<00:03:03.810> really<00:03:04.170> chilly<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.800> here<00:03:04.830> I've<00:03:05.310> had

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
gets really chilly in here I've had

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.120 
gets really chilly in here I've had
bubble<00:03:06.600> wrap<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.840> most<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> windows<00:03:07.890> which

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
bubble wrap on most of the windows which

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.280 
bubble wrap on most of the windows which
is<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> good<00:03:08.519> insulator<00:03:08.880> but<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.840> fallen<00:03:10.170> off

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
is a good insulator but it's fallen off

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.590 
is a good insulator but it's fallen off
in<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.530> few<00:03:10.709> places<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.310> can't<00:03:11.580> get<00:03:12.390> behind

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
in a few places and I can't get behind

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.229 
in a few places and I can't get behind
the<00:03:12.810> cages<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.290> put<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.560> back<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.970> what<00:03:15.150> I've

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
the cages to put it back so what I've

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.660 
the cages to put it back so what I've
done<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.570> I've<00:03:15.810> puts<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.350> thermal<00:03:16.890> curtain<00:03:17.370> all

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
done is I've puts a thermal curtain all

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.690 
done is I've puts a thermal curtain all
along<00:03:18.180> Mini's<00:03:18.930> cage<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.620> pegged<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.340> and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
along Mini's cage just pegged it on and

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.940 
along Mini's cage just pegged it on and
that's<00:03:21.299> deep<00:03:21.930> enough<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.590> goes<00:03:22.739> down

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
that's deep enough that it goes down

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.600 
that's deep enough that it goes down
behind<00:03:23.400> Poppy's<00:03:24.000> cage<00:03:24.269> too<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:25.459> didn't<00:03:26.459> have

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
behind Poppy's cage too I didn't have

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.789 
behind Poppy's cage too I didn't have
another<00:03:26.850> curtain<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.110> probably<00:03:28.350> need<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.620> buy

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
another curtain I probably need to buy

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.180 
another curtain I probably need to buy
another<00:03:29.010> couple<00:03:29.720> but<00:03:30.720> I've<00:03:30.810> got<00:03:30.989> some<00:03:31.200> vet<00:03:31.890> bed

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
another couple but I've got some vet bed

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.150 
another couple but I've got some vet bed
which<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.660> useless<00:03:33.660> i<00:03:33.900> bought<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.470> ebay<00:03:34.860> and

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
which is useless i bought it on ebay and

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.539 
which is useless i bought it on ebay and
i<00:03:35.640> think<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.880> must<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.180> some<00:03:36.329> cheap<00:03:36.600> copy

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
i think it must be some cheap copy

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.479 
i think it must be some cheap copy
because<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:39.299> fluid<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:40.019> doesn't<00:03:40.459> pen<00:03:41.459> a

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
because the fluid just doesn't pen a

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.000 
because the fluid just doesn't pen a
filter<00:03:42.269> through<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.350> just<00:03:43.380> stays<00:03:43.739> on<00:03:43.920> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
filter through it it just stays on the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.840 
filter through it it just stays on the
top<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.489> pigs<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:44.880> wet<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.430> haven't

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
top and the pigs get wet so I haven't

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.350 
top and the pigs get wet so I haven't
really<00:03:48.000> used<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.690> lately<00:03:48.900> as<00:03:49.380> bedding<00:03:50.329> but<00:03:51.329> I

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
really used it lately as bedding but I

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.270 
really used it lately as bedding but I
thought<00:03:51.570> why<00:03:52.260> can't<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.650> put<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:52.950> along<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
thought why can't I put it along the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.890 
thought why can't I put it along the
back<00:03:53.430> getting<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.940> bit<00:03:54.090> closer<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.660> so<00:03:54.750> that's

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
back getting a bit closer and so that's

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.949 
back getting a bit closer and so that's
what<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:55.380> like<00:03:56.090> there's<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.239> few<00:03:57.450> gaps<00:03:57.690> which

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
what it's like there's a few gaps which

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.090 
what it's like there's a few gaps which
I<00:03:58.049> need<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.320> sort<00:03:58.530> out<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.890> have<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.040> have

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
I need to sort out and have to have

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.800 
I need to sort out and have to have
another<00:03:59.310> go<00:03:59.489> at<00:03:59.579> doing<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.090> think<00:04:00.150> but

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
another go at doing it I think but

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.800 
another go at doing it I think but
overall<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.739> think<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.549> should<00:04:03.510> keep

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
overall I think that that should keep

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.430 
overall I think that that should keep
them<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.110> bit<00:04:04.260> warmer<00:04:05.540> I've<00:04:06.540> also<00:04:06.750> got<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.140> couple

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
them a bit warmer I've also got a couple

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.460 
them a bit warmer I've also got a couple
of<00:04:07.560> cage<00:04:08.010> liners<00:04:08.640> on<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.420> end<00:04:09.690> bit<00:04:10.200> there

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
of cage liners on the end bit there

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.930 
of cage liners on the end bit there
because<00:04:10.859> there's<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.070> door<00:04:11.280> behind<00:04:11.459> they<00:04:11.820> own

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
because there's a door behind they own

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.599 
because there's a door behind they own
again<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.510> might<00:04:12.900> be<00:04:13.019> drafty<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.799> I've<00:04:14.430> done

course<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.260> had<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.440> have<00:05:04.620> some<00:05:04.920> this<00:05:05.700> is<00:05:05.880> the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
course I had to have some this is the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.030 
course I had to have some this is the
smaller<00:05:06.630> one<00:05:06.870> they<00:05:07.020> do<00:05:07.080> they<00:05:07.350> do<00:05:07.410> bigger<00:05:07.770> ones

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
smaller one they do they do bigger ones

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.740 
smaller one they do they do bigger ones
because<00:05:08.400> obviously<00:05:08.670> they're<00:05:09.210> designed<00:05:09.540> for

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
because obviously they're designed for

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.590 
because obviously they're designed for
cars<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.410> guess<00:05:11.160> this<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:11.520> about<00:05:11.790> two<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:12.540> a

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
cars I guess this is about two and a

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.140 
cars I guess this is about two and a
half<00:05:12.630> inches<00:05:12.870> long<00:05:13.460> either<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.760> can<00:05:14.940> choose

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
half inches long either you can choose

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.670 
half inches long either you can choose
which<00:05:15.300> direction<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:16.110> face<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:16.650> think

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
which direction you face and I think

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.350 
which direction you face and I think
they've<00:05:16.980> got<00:05:17.100> three<00:05:17.460> different<00:05:17.880> ones<00:05:18.120> with
