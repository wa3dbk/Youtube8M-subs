00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 way more details about the approval 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.919
 in general and in the particular of the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.960
 energy reform I have the ring 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.059
 telephone and I greet the deputy 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.820
 javier treviño cantú very good afternoon 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.039
 deputy therefore marathon and also with 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.130
 many surprises not all of them 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.779
 nice the discussion before the plenary and 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 in the alternate venue they had to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.140
 enable for discussion and approval 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.550
 of this energy reform for the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.859
 I call a lot to be with you with you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 auditorium that we have a vision 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.910
 historical ephemeral theoretical but ultra 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.079
 valid 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.700
 well I believe that the energy reform 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.620
 transformative that we approved the day of 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.399
 today after meeting he had approved the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 Senate is really designed to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.079
 generate a new Mexican model of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 energy competitiveness I think it is 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.530
 very important what we are achieving 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.020
 for the country 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.120
 and especially because I would also say 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.120
 well achieving three objectives 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.070
 fundamental number one we are 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.540
 strengthening pemex of the commission 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.540
 federal electricity 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 as the two big companies 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.070
 reproductive of state number two 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.790
 We opened the energy sector in Mexico to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.590
 the investment and lower the investment of 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.320
 private national companies and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.780
 international giving them full certainty 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 legal for the benefit of the nation and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.640
 number three we strengthen the capacity 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.350
 state regulator the capacity of 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.330
 the energy secretary of the commission 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.110
 national hydrocarbons in the commission 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.120
 Power regulator 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.450
 with these three objectives what we are 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.479
 Really achieving is maximizing income 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.700
 oil industry in the future we are also 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 succeeding in guaranteeing safety 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.470
 energy of the nation for the plant 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.020
 productive and for all Mexicans and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 we are achieving that when it comes to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.210
 a non-renewable resource such as oil 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.680
 that we see not only in benefit to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 this generation but to the future 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 generations and for that a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.240
 very important instrument for the country 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.729
 which is the Mexican oil fund 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.649
 and that is going to be administered by 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.569
 the bank of mexico so we're going to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.180
 to be able to channel the resources that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.160
 enter the country as a result of this 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.140
 energy reform must be analyzed 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.569
 in social investment is undoubtedly deputy 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.540
 let me ask you why of course 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.970
 confusion has reigned about the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.989
 issue of oil sale oil 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.370
 continues or does not continue to be of the Mexicans 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.410
 absolutely oil is of the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.660
 Mexicans without a doubt and this is very 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.260
 clear in the constitution the property 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.660
 of the nation's oil that has not 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.819
 changed the opposite is still a 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.410
 activity also exclusive and 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.160
 strategic state and what happens 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.260
 is that participation can be achieved 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.090
 from the private sector to expand 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.340
 precisely exploration and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.080
 exploitation in a modality is 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.030
 violence that wash legal certainty that 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.560
 they are a series of contracts there 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.750
 different types of contract 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.670
 utility services contracts 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.620
 Shared production shared and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.200
 of licenses then with this we are going to 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.300
 have all the legal design for 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.370
 the national private sector 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.769
 international can participate and also 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.260
 within this same reform we are 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.120
 strengthening the productive chain of 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.220
 national companies in this industry 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.550
 energetic which is also going to be very 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.569
 important besides that we are also 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.069
 foreseeing the participation of the sector 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.650
 private in the generation of energy 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.750
 electrical we think that with that we are going to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.640
 achieve 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.650
 really strengthen the competitiveness 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.810
 international of our country remember 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.630
 that now that is taking place in 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.510
 the world in the last 10 years a great 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.700
 technological revolution in the field 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.519
 energy that changed the geography of 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.160
 geopolitical world previously the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.690
 Middle East was the center of the offer 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.400
 of good world energy you already migrated 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.829
 the center speak middle east america 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.630
 from the north now the united states and canada 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.069
 with this transformation are the 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.450
 main producers including 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.400
 they are exporting not only not 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.110
 they need nobody else's oil but 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.410
 who are exporting then mexico 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.690
 decided that it has is that we have to 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.400
 really play a relevant role in 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.049
 this revolution and on a paper 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.190
 relevant in the competitiveness of 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.770
 north america 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.090
 and why then because in america 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.910
 There is a process of 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.980
 reindustrialization precisely by the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.260
 low in energy prices and 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.330
 for the greater competitiveness and mexico not 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.370
 can be left behind if we are members 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.630
 from this region we are part of the region 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.190
 from north america 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.490
 so the energy reform in 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.400
 reality is a reform on employment is 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.350
 a reform on improving the quality of 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.660
 life is a reform that will improve the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.700
 competitiveness of the national industry 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.800
 and one thing that I think of the 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.690
 greater relevance in what was approved the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.090
 yesterday in the deputy chamber santi 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.030
 in the one of senators and deputy javier 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.220
 treviño the theme of the union of 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.500
 Mexican petroleum is no longer going to form 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.180
 part of the board of directors and 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.640
 this is obviously good news 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.020
 what are we doing with plans 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.820
 as I told you the first point in the 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.910
 The first objective was to strengthen Pemex 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.520
 as a productive state company not 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.470
 a decentralized public body and 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.050
 especially that we can have a 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.370
 type regulation 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.099
 in such a way that it is a company 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.199
 productive that you think you can create 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.750
 public value that this is the most 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.819
 important that private companies 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.740
 good generate private value create value 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.300
 of his were pemex has like 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.220
 productivity company or have to create 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.750
 public value because it would be this 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.639
 I appreciate very much deputy that you have 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.479
 talked with us today in 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.879
