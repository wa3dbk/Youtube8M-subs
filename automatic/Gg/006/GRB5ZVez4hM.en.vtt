00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 good if we're all in minecraft 1.7 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.160
 point 10 let's see a way you notice 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.620
 that is pretty cool and is that it adds 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.360
 a way to get back the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.039
 objects when we die the question is 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.289
 that when we die we will leave a kind 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.180
 of corpse you're actually seeing there 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.640
 but well I want to try it also with 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.610
 the lava let's try it from normal to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.340
 see him when he dies 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.099
 respawn and we go where we died with 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.520
 port over there to have died a little 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 closer 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.040
 gildo you want a bullet cue and this is from 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.350
 our corpse 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.010
 it's super weird it 's good because we 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.100
 keep things as you see 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.859
 but first I do not know how he did it but 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.500
 perhaps by having it in your hand can be 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.900
 let's die here now 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.630
 because although it came out with the dialogue yes 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.720
 with the ante sword he came out with his beak 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.030
 but you know what you have in the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.700
 hand is a ball a lot where is the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.190
 corpse 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.490
 twice I sent them by has been placed 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.619
 As you can see, it's pretty cool 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.570
 allows us to recover everything sounds is 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.570
 that weird sound when digging 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.820
 because he is hitting one 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 do not 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.979
 so if you can not break it is a 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.810
 little bit more kaka is I think maybe 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.200
 I gave it to her 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.009
 let's try it on the lady 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.009
 see if he keeps it 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.050
 two 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.800
 but we can keep looking at things 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.480
 I was going to fly and I could not fly 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.830
 put here in the lava 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.830
 I want to check what happens 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:07.270
 let's see where it is 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.690
 this is that a little bit like crazy there 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.090
 is clicking on here is someone 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.820
 but when there are two blocks of lava and if 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.990
 the corpse stays down like 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.960
 it's a little bit more complicated to find 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.430
 ok let's try one more thing I'm 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.170
 trying to see if the corpse always 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.970
 it stays with the let's see that yes 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.970
 Now, if I bust only what 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.750
 let's assume that there is a criterion 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.950
 played so that here 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.070
 let's assume there are many that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.070
 we're passing by 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.770
 but good to be here here here and 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.470
 here 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.470
 good and refloat 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.950
 if we go a little 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.340
 I hear 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.220
 does not know the corpse is the explosion has 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.650
 been more over there 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.870
 has not been beyond this is because it has 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.450
 splashed from here so it's saved 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.710
 the corpse I good by explosion 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.540
 also saved I have everything here 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.340
 kept all the time 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.560
 to know what that corpse is and there's 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.200
 another one out there that as a matter of fact several 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.569
 tests tests how are you supposed to here 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.190
 to be of the objects to skip the here is 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.530
 destroy 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.940
 I want to check what happens if you save 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.470
 equally or not 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.490
 It is pretty well the power of knowing that 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.400
 we have in hand in this case if it is 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.110
 everything we will see explain 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:55.340
 others but it does not stop sounding like 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:59.340
 I was in 72 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.829
 quite useful very very cool but good 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.689
 you have in the registrations for 1.7 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.200
 point day if it is conformed 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.200
 as usual 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.120
 bye
