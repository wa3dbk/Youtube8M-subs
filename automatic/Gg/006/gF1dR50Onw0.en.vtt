00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.520
 live them the nuts or covers that 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.100
 they hold the cut that holds in this 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.070
 case in this case I already afloat them for 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.750

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.820
 then we use the key to release 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:05.060
 the nuts that hold the ring 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.060

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.260
 do not 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.220
 and we use a flat screwdriver 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.270
 to remove the cover that holds the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:44.360
 disc nut because it is complete 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.360

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.600
 what do we need to remove it 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.340
 once you have removed this 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.640
 very carefully to place true 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.640
 that there are two screws that 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.790

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.790
 screw will remove it with a key 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.790

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.139
 look at it three eighths place the part 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.139
 later 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.950
 we have the bowl are 21 part of 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.460
 up one part below 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.280
 and the one below was removed and he was in 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.680
 the chalice but once the 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.160
 chalice but 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.280
 below and as we already released this piece 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.139
 from here we release the nut we take the 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.370
 large of which is the nut 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.370
 go big and cover 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.860

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.099
 this is to oil today we are not going to 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.500
 make changes because these bearings 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.360
 they are good the veriles are 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.849
 in perfect condition here they have a 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.750
 front side verín as they can 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:29.710
