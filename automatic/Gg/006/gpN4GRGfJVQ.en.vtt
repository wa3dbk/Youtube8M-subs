badly<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:09.540> worked<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.990> salinity<00:00:10.650> tolerance

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
badly and I worked on salinity tolerance

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.860 
badly and I worked on salinity tolerance
in<00:00:12.349> rice<00:00:13.969> rice<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.179> an<00:00:15.330> important<00:00:15.719> crop

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
in rice rice is an important crop

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.980 
in rice rice is an important crop
worldwide<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:17.100> fits<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.789> millions<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.539> people

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
worldwide it fits the millions of people

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.760 
worldwide it fits the millions of people
every<00:00:19.140> day

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
every day

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.609 
every day
however<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:21.300> grown<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.869> some<00:00:22.199> soil

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
however it's grown on some soil

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.160 
however it's grown on some soil
sometimes<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.580> less<00:00:24.210> than<00:00:24.240> ideal<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
sometimes that is less than ideal and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.960 
sometimes that is less than ideal and
one<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> these<00:00:25.830> problems<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.760> have

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
one of these problems that it can have

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.380 
one of these problems that it can have
it<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.330> too<00:00:28.289> much<00:00:28.439> salt<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> soil<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.609> what

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it is too much salt in the soil and what

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.959 
it is too much salt in the soil and what
this<00:00:30.599> means<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.099> salt<00:00:32.369> can't<00:00:32.790> get

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
this means is that the salt can't get

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.330 
this means is that the salt can't get
into<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.480> roots<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> plant<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.860> get<00:00:35.190> up

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
into the roots of the plant and get up

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.459 
into the roots of the plant and get up
to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> shoot<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.090> planet<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.170> damage

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to the shoot of the planet and do damage

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.209 
to the shoot of the planet and do damage
to<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.940> way<00:00:39.059> -<00:00:39.120> finebros<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.290> how<00:00:40.469> much<00:00:40.920> yield

to the way - finebros and how much yield

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.600 
to the way - finebros and how much yield
it<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> agency<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> GE

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it can put on so at the agency of GE

salinity tolerance of cereal crop
species<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.770> look

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
species and what we do is we look

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.479 
species and what we do is we look
forward<00:00:53.219> teens<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.090> involved<00:00:54.690> in

forward teens that are involved in

forward teens that are involved in
helping<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> plant<00:00:57.059> operated<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.079> let's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
helping the plant operated so let's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.900 
helping the plant operated so let's
dress<00:00:59.100> better<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> we've<00:01:02.190> taken<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.640> salt

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
dress better so we've taken a salt

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
dress better so we've taken a salt
tolerance<00:01:03.180> change<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> rabbit<00:01:04.500> offs<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
tolerance change from the rabbit offs to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460 
tolerance change from the rabbit offs to
see<00:01:05.220> multiple<00:01:05.700> plant<00:01:05.970> species<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.689> we

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
see multiple plant species and we

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
see multiple plant species and we
express<00:01:07.770> things<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.520> other<00:01:08.729> cells<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
express things to be other cells of the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.399 
express things to be other cells of the
roots<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.320> rice<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.570> what<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.720> does<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
roots of rice and what this does is it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.469 
roots of rice and what this does is it
essentially<00:01:13.830> filters<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> salt<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
essentially filters the salt out of the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
essentially filters the salt out of the
water<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.290> being<00:01:16.619> moved<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.400> root

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
water that's being moved from the root

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.730 
water that's being moved from the root
to<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.880> chute<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> rice<00:01:18.780> plant<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
to the chute of the rice plant and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
to the chute of the rice plant and
prevents<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> salt<00:01:20.640> into<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.210> suit<00:01:21.540> for

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
prevents the salt into a suit for

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.950 
prevents the salt into a suit for
damages<00:01:21.920> issues<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> an<00:01:27.810> image

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
damages issues and so this is an image

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.660 
damages issues and so this is an image
of<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> rice<00:01:28.590> drink<00:01:28.979> underneath

also<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.650> cells<00:01:38.040> marked<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.610> green<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
also see cells marked in green and this

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
also see cells marked in green and this

is the green fluorescent protein that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300 
is the green fluorescent protein that

it's within the cells marked in green
that<00:01:46.470> means<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.250> us<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.549> salt<00:01:48.390> tolerance
