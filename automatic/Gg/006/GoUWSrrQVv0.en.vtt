actually<00:01:32.100> need<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.360> you're

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
actually need it because if you're

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.210 
actually need it because if you're
holding<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.290> shot<00:01:34.500> you're<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:35.009> here

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
holding for a shot you're way down here

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.590 
holding for a shot you're way down here
at<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> end<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> pole<00:01:36.000> it'll<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.360> really

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
at the end of the pole it'll get really

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
at the end of the pole it'll get really
heavy<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.200> give<00:01:37.530> yourself<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.040> little

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
heavy but if you give yourself a little

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.040 
heavy but if you give yourself a little
more<00:01:38.400> extension

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
more extension

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.840 
more extension
you<00:01:40.620> can<00:01:40.740> hold<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> pole<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.310> closer<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
you can hold the pole a little closer to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
you can hold the pole a little closer to
the<00:01:41.940> middle<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> counterweights<00:01:43.260> itself

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the middle and it counterweights itself

the middle and it counterweights itself
a<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:43.890> better<00:01:44.040> thanks<00:01:44.580> for<00:01:44.670> watching<00:01:44.940> guys

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
a little better thanks for watching guys

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.610 
a little better thanks for watching guys
and<00:01:45.120> if<00:01:45.300> all<00:01:45.510> else<00:01:45.720> fails<00:01:46.050> make<00:01:46.380> sure<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
and if all else fails make sure the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.680 
and if all else fails make sure the
power<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.010> turned<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.550> that's<00:01:48.240> really<00:01:48.510> obvious

power is turned on that's really obvious

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.530 
power is turned on that's really obvious
but<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.920> important<00:01:50.370> that<00:01:50.400> someone<00:01:50.760> says<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
but it's important that someone says it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.870 
but it's important that someone says it
anyway
