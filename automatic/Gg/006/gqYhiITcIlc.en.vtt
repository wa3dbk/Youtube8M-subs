the<00:04:40.510> full<00:04:42.450> so<00:04:43.450> this<00:04:43.660> is<00:04:43.810> called<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.170> Euro

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
the full so this is called the Euro

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.000 
the full so this is called the Euro
brace<00:04:46.080> why<00:04:47.080> do<00:04:47.140> you<00:04:47.290> need<00:04:47.410> one<00:04:47.470> on<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> ends

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
brace why do you need one on the ends

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.530 
brace why do you need one on the ends
but<00:04:51.010> you<00:04:51.190> need<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.400> brace<00:04:51.700> on<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.060> answer

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
but you need the brace on the answer

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.520 
but you need the brace on the answer
it's<00:04:53.020> mostly<00:04:53.710> there<00:04:54.010> for<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.310> lift<00:04:54.490> life<00:04:55.530> just

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
it's mostly there for the lift life just

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.720 
it's mostly there for the lift life just
for<00:04:56.710> lux<00:04:56.920> so<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.880> main<00:04:58.090> structure<00:04:58.780> is<00:04:59.140> the

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
for lux so the main structure is the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.550 
for lux so the main structure is the
long<00:05:00.730> piece<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:04.540> this<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.900> one<00:05:05.080> with<00:05:05.260> a<00:05:05.290> single

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
long piece and this is one with a single

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.890 
long piece and this is one with a single
corner<00:05:08.520> they<00:05:09.520> clamp<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:10.060> all<00:05:10.210> up

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.680 

so<00:05:14.470> this<00:05:14.620> is<00:05:14.650> what<00:05:14.979> the<00:05:15.100> polished<00:05:15.580> edge

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.480 

and<00:05:21.690> then<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:21.930> got<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.199> pieces<00:05:22.680> glass<00:05:22.949> here<00:05:23.340> all

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
and then I got the pieces glass here all

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.360 
and then I got the pieces glass here all
piled<00:05:23.849> up<00:05:24.150> they<00:05:24.720> put<00:05:24.960> pieces<00:05:25.199> of<00:05:25.530> cork<00:05:26.220> in

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
piled up they put pieces of cork in

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.300 
piled up they put pieces of cork in
between<00:05:26.699> them<00:05:27.349> that<00:05:28.349> just<00:05:28.650> keeps<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:29.069> glass

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
between them that just keeps the glass

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.629 
between them that just keeps the glass
from<00:05:29.580> sticking<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.120> each<00:05:30.180> other<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:31.639> making

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
from sticking to each other and making

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.240 
from sticking to each other and making
it<00:05:32.789> hard<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.060> take<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.419> apart<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:36.860> have<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.039> end

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
it hard to take it apart I have to end

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.920 
it hard to take it apart I have to end
overflow<00:05:38.759> so<00:05:39.060> this<00:05:39.210> will<00:05:39.360> be<00:05:39.509> one<00:05:39.720> that's

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
overflow so this will be one that's

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.320 
overflow so this will be one that's
meant<00:05:40.440> to<00:05:40.500> be<00:05:40.590> looked<00:05:40.860> at<00:05:41.009> from<00:05:41.190> both<00:05:41.400> sides<00:05:44.330> so

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
meant to be looked at from both sides so

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.990 
meant to be looked at from both sides so
then<00:05:45.509> these<00:05:45.690> hoes<00:05:46.259> is<00:05:46.560> here<00:05:46.979> they<00:05:47.580> run<00:05:47.819> the

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
then these hoes is here they run the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.809 
then these hoes is here they run the
silicon<00:05:48.509> ok<00:05:50.960> so<00:05:51.960> i<00:05:51.990> guess<00:05:52.169> is<00:05:52.620> one<00:05:53.310> clear<00:05:53.639> in

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
silicon ok so i guess is one clear in

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.890 
silicon ok so i guess is one clear in
one<00:05:54.000> black<00:05:54.860> yeah<00:05:55.860> one<00:05:56.159> clear<00:05:56.580> one<00:05:56.819> black<00:05:57.120> how

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
one black yeah one clear one black how

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.129 
one black yeah one clear one black how
do<00:05:57.960> you<00:05:58.110> clean<00:05:58.349> the<00:05:58.379> silicon<00:05:58.919> Oh<00:05:58.949> to<00:05:59.129> the<00:05:59.310> ends

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
do you clean the silicon Oh to the ends

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.300 
do you clean the silicon Oh to the ends
like<00:06:01.139> if<00:06:01.259> this<00:06:01.379> sits<00:06:01.650> overnight<00:06:02.009> and<00:06:04.099> you<00:06:05.099> just

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
like if this sits overnight and you just

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.059 
like if this sits overnight and you just
pull<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.090> silicon<00:06:06.629> out<00:06:07.909> yeah<00:06:08.909> and<00:06:09.919> then<00:06:10.919> the

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
pull the silicon out yeah and then the

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:19.610 
pull the silicon out yeah and then the
silicon<00:06:11.580> is<00:06:11.879> in<00:06:12.060> these<00:06:12.210> big<00:06:12.449> barrels<00:06:18.620> ok

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
silicon is in these big barrels ok

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.249 
silicon is in these big barrels ok
they're<00:06:19.949> two<00:06:20.879> hundred<00:06:21.210> and<00:06:21.360> four<00:06:21.690> point<00:06:22.139> three

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
they're two hundred and four point three

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:28.879 
they're two hundred and four point three
kilograms<00:06:23.330> worth<00:06:24.330> of<00:06:24.599> silicon<00:06:27.800> it's<00:06:28.800> all

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
kilograms worth of silicon it's all

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.379 
kilograms worth of silicon it's all
pressurized<00:06:30.680> and<00:06:31.680> these<00:06:32.490> hoses<00:06:32.759> then<00:06:33.180> run

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
pressurized and these hoses then run

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.010 
pressurized and these hoses then run
over<00:06:33.419> to<00:06:33.810> the<00:06:33.930> other<00:06:34.020> room<00:06:34.139> and<00:06:35.750> get<00:06:36.750> three

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
over to the other room and get three

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.790 
over to the other room and get three
different<00:06:37.169> drums<00:06:41.960> maybe<00:06:42.960> two<00:06:43.229> black<00:06:43.529> and<00:06:43.560> one

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
different drums maybe two black and one

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.010 
different drums maybe two black and one
clear<00:06:45.560> not<00:06:46.560> sure<00:06:46.940> how<00:06:47.940> come<00:06:48.150> they're<00:06:48.360> here

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
clear not sure how come they're here

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.260 
clear not sure how come they're here
instead<00:06:49.259> of<00:06:49.349> an<00:06:49.500> a<00:06:49.879> well<00:06:50.879> you<00:06:51.000> got<00:06:51.090> to<00:06:51.210> be

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
instead of an a well you got to be

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.540 
instead of an a well you got to be
somewhere<00:06:51.690> and<00:06:51.900> I<00:06:52.440> guess<00:06:53.039> maybe<00:06:53.279> they<00:06:53.460> had

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
somewhere and I guess maybe they had

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.510 
somewhere and I guess maybe they had
more<00:06:53.729> room<00:06:53.879> in<00:06:54.029> this<00:06:54.150> room<00:06:54.919> and<00:06:55.919> there's

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
more room in this room and there's

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.390 
more room in this room and there's
here's<00:06:56.849> some<00:06:57.120> shallower<00:06:57.659> tanks<00:06:58.229> a<00:06:58.409> little

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
here's some shallower tanks a little

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.550 
here's some shallower tanks a little
narrow<00:06:59.819> I<00:07:00.090> get<00:07:00.419> these<00:07:00.539> guys<00:07:00.779> to<00:07:00.840> make<00:07:01.199> all<00:07:01.409> the

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
narrow I get these guys to make all the

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.070 
narrow I get these guys to make all the
oddball<00:07:02.009> ok<00:07:02.729> that's<00:07:02.969> a<00:07:03.150> narrow<00:07:03.389> tank<00:07:03.719> there's

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
oddball ok that's a narrow tank there's

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.670 
oddball ok that's a narrow tank there's
the<00:07:04.319> opening<00:07:07.190> nice<00:07:08.190> yes<00:07:09.199> it's<00:07:10.199> quite<00:07:10.349> cool

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
the opening nice yes it's quite cool

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.439 
the opening nice yes it's quite cool
actually<00:07:11.840> ok<00:07:12.840> there's<00:07:13.050> no<00:07:13.139> bottom<00:07:13.319> in<00:07:13.560> this

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:14.449 
actually ok there's no bottom in this

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.899 
actually ok there's no bottom in this
that's<00:07:15.449> just<00:07:15.690> a<00:07:15.870> tube<00:07:16.310> that's<00:07:17.310> just<00:07:17.550> a<00:07:17.699> tube

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:17.909 
that's just a tube that's just a tube

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:21.170 
that's just a tube that's just a tube
there's<00:07:18.479> no<00:07:18.569> bottom<00:07:18.750> and<00:07:18.960> now<00:07:19.849> this<00:07:20.849> is<00:07:21.029> what

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
there's no bottom and now this is what

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.860 
there's no bottom and now this is what
they<00:07:21.330> use<00:07:21.360> for<00:07:23.180> meter<00:07:24.180> to<00:07:24.360> some<00:07:24.569> kind<00:07:24.779> of

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
they use for meter to some kind of

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.860 
they use for meter to some kind of
rubber<00:07:25.169> to<00:07:25.529> clean<00:07:26.129> the<00:07:26.250> blade<00:07:26.430> for<00:07:26.940> the<00:07:27.060> cutter

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
rubber to clean the blade for the cutter

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:35.320 
rubber to clean the blade for the cutter
and<00:07:28.310> these<00:07:29.310> are<00:07:29.490> all<00:07:29.550> the<00:07:29.789> slugs

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.690 

so<00:07:36.330> this<00:07:36.780> is<00:07:36.810> miracles<00:07:37.290> in<00:07:37.710> glass<00:07:37.980> as<00:07:38.310> I<00:07:38.340> said

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:38.700 
so this is miracles in glass as I said

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.410 
so this is miracles in glass as I said
if<00:07:38.850> it<00:07:38.970> doesn't<00:07:39.360> leak<00:07:39.510> that's<00:07:39.780> a<00:07:40.140> miracle
