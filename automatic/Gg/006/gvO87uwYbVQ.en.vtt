00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
groups and learn from them actually

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.989 
groups and learn from them actually
recently<00:01:42.039> a<00:01:42.310> lot<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.549> people<00:01:42.759> have<00:01:42.850> been

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
recently a lot of people have been

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:44.849 
recently a lot of people have been
asking<00:01:43.359> me<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.689> know<00:01:43.749> what

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
asking me you know what

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.430 
asking me you know what
what's<00:01:45.280> International<00:01:45.969> medicine

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
what's International medicine

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.830 
what's International medicine
this<00:01:46.560> ain't<00:01:47.490> medicine<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
this ain't medicine I think there's a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.110 
this ain't medicine I think there's a
sense<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.290> multiple<00:01:50.250> aspects<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.790> me<00:01:50.910> I<00:01:50.970> mean

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
sense of multiple aspects to me I mean

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.730 
sense of multiple aspects to me I mean
there's<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> scientific<00:01:52.140> aspect<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
there's the scientific aspect of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.350 
there's the scientific aspect of
treating<00:01:53.430> patients<00:01:53.580> treating<00:01:54.030> diseases

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
treating patients treating diseases

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.130 
treating patients treating diseases
there's<00:01:55.200> also<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.710> cultural<00:01:56.160> aspect<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
there's also the cultural aspect the

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.110 
there's also the cultural aspect the
kinds<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.230> diseases<00:01:58.620> that<00:01:58.800> we<00:01:59.400> see<00:01:59.430> because<00:02:00.090> of

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
kinds of diseases that we see because of

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.930 
kinds of diseases that we see because of
the<00:02:00.780> different<00:02:01.740> patient<00:02:02.040> population<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
the different patient population and

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.820 
the different patient population and
environment<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.720> think<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> lot<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.800> just

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
environment I think a lot of it is just

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.719 
environment I think a lot of it is just
being<00:02:05.130> able<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.340> relate<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.910> patients<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
being able to relate to patients in a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.870 
being able to relate to patients in a
culturally<00:02:09.300> sensitive<00:02:09.450> way

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
culturally sensitive way

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.040 
culturally sensitive way
so<00:02:12.050> Hebrew<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.520> difficult<00:02:15.000> language<00:02:15.090> it's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so Hebrew is a difficult language it's

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.540 
so Hebrew is a difficult language it's
not<00:02:16.110> easy<00:02:17.990> but<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.830> mean<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.130> important

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
not easy but it's I mean it's important

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.740 
not easy but it's I mean it's important
for<00:02:20.640> us<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:20.850> as<00:02:21.000> medical<00:02:21.300> students<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.600> learn

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
for us just as medical students to learn

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.470 
for us just as medical students to learn
the<00:02:21.810> language<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:22.530> next<00:02:22.890> year<00:02:23.180> come<00:02:24.180> next

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the language because next year come next

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.030 
the language because next year come next
year<00:02:24.630> we're<00:02:24.780> gonna<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.440> be<00:02:25.860> able<00:02:25.950> to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040
