I believe so the game was on you know
the<00:00:49.770> game<00:00:49.920> should<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.340> been<00:00:50.430> mine<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the game should have been mine the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.869 
the game should have been mine the
amount<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.010> amount<00:00:53.160> chances<00:00:53.610> i<00:00:53.730> had

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
amount of you the amount chances i had

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.990 
amount of you the amount chances i had
was<00:00:54.059> unbelievable<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.340> but<00:00:56.340> his<00:00:56.550> keeper<00:00:56.850> was

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
