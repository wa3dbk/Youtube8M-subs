00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
personally think gives it that thick

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.770 
personally think gives it that thick
look<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.670> adds<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.460 
look just because it adds on like this
extra<00:01:28.409> shine<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> pretty<00:01:31.350> I
