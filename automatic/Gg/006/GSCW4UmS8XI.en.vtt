vehicle it is not as boxy is brutal
looking<00:00:18.349> as<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.800> previous<00:00:19.369> generation<00:00:19.400> now

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
looking as the previous generation now

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.630 
looking as the previous generation now
it's<00:00:20.660> looking<00:00:20.929> very<00:00:21.410> similar<00:00:21.740> to<00:00:22.160> its<00:00:22.310> younger

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
it's looking very similar to its younger

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.810 
it's looking very similar to its younger
sibling<00:00:23.240> Honda<00:00:23.720> CRV<00:00:24.259> has<00:00:24.500> mainly<00:00:25.490> smooth

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
sibling Honda CRV has mainly smooth

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.140 
sibling Honda CRV has mainly smooth
lines<00:00:26.119> that<00:00:27.019> make<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:27.439> very<00:00:27.800> attractive<00:00:28.429> and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
lines that make it very attractive and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.929 
lines that make it very attractive and
seems<00:00:29.509> like<00:00:29.599> it<00:00:29.900> is<00:00:30.470> going<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.890> get<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.460> wider

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
seems like it is going to get the wider

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.470 
seems like it is going to get the wider
variety<00:00:32.330> of<00:00:32.599> owners<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.550> it<00:00:34.550> actually<00:00:35.270> might

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
variety of owners and it actually might

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.070 
variety of owners and it actually might
look<00:00:35.660> like<00:00:35.720> it's<00:00:36.140> lost<00:00:36.950> volume<00:00:37.370> its<00:00:38.300> volume

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
look like it's lost volume its volume

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.440 
look like it's lost volume its volume
because<00:00:39.500> it<00:00:39.710> doesn't<00:00:40.430> have<00:00:40.580> this<00:00:40.790> sharp<00:00:41.180> edges

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
because it doesn't have this sharp edges

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.930 
because it doesn't have this sharp edges
that<00:00:41.990> but<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.770> actually<00:00:43.160> changes<00:00:43.580> when<00:00:43.820> you

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
that but it actually changes when you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.210 
that but it actually changes when you
look<00:00:44.150> at<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.450> vehicle<00:00:44.900> and<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.320> inside<00:00:45.680> and
