stereo chorus the MX our stereo of

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.479 
stereo chorus the MX our stereo of
course<00:00:37.630> is<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:37.870> classic<00:00:38.470> sounding<00:00:38.829> chorus<00:00:39.130> unit

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
course is a classic sounding chorus unit

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.280 
course is a classic sounding chorus unit
it's<00:00:39.760> got<00:00:39.880> a<00:00:39.910> lot<00:00:40.149> of<00:00:40.180> flexibility<00:00:40.899> and<00:00:40.989> see

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
it's got a lot of flexibility and see

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.750 
it's got a lot of flexibility and see
we've<00:00:41.410> got<00:00:41.500> some<00:00:41.559> tone<00:00:41.890> shaping<00:00:42.190> options

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
we've got some tone shaping options

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.760 
we've got some tone shaping options
let's<00:00:43.329> dig<00:00:43.540> in<00:00:43.690> and<00:00:43.840> take<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:43.989> look<00:00:44.079> you<00:00:44.590> can<00:00:44.620> see

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
let's dig in and take a look you can see

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.440 
let's dig in and take a look you can see
the<00:00:44.980> controls<00:00:45.340> are<00:00:45.489> kind<00:00:45.640> of<00:00:45.670> blocked<00:00:45.969> off<00:00:46.210> in

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
the controls are kind of blocked off in

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.540 
the controls are kind of blocked off in
two<00:00:46.600> sections<00:00:47.050> here<00:00:47.350> this<00:00:47.890> is<00:00:48.039> more<00:00:48.250> like<00:00:48.429> the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
two sections here this is more like the

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.790 
two sections here this is more like the
EQ<00:00:48.940> section<00:00:49.179> and<00:00:49.570> this<00:00:49.870> section<00:00:50.230> over<00:00:50.320> here<00:00:50.440> is

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
EQ section and this section over here is

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.650 
EQ section and this section over here is
more<00:00:51.070> like<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.399> actual<00:00:51.760> coursing<00:00:52.329> section

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
more like the actual coursing section

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.569 
more like the actual coursing section
itself<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.559> for<00:00:54.039> this<00:00:54.160> you<00:00:54.339> have<00:00:54.370> the

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
itself so for this you have the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.509 
itself so for this you have the
intensity<00:00:54.999> level<00:00:55.449> you<00:00:56.320> have<00:00:56.499> a<00:00:56.769> width<00:00:57.129> control

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
intensity level you have a width control

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.459 
intensity level you have a width control
which<00:00:57.940> obviously<00:00:58.449> controls<00:00:58.929> the<00:00:59.079> width<00:00:59.350> of

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
which obviously controls the width of

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.169 
which obviously controls the width of
the<00:00:59.620> chorus<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.370> rate<00:01:00.609> which<00:01:00.879> is<00:01:01.030> the

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
the chorus and the rate which is the

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.029 
the chorus and the rate which is the
speed<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.629> course<00:01:01.929> and<00:01:02.170> intensity<00:01:02.980> is

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
speed of the course and intensity is

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.250 
speed of the course and intensity is
more<00:01:03.249> like<00:01:03.399> a<00:01:03.429> level<00:01:04.210> control<00:01:04.629> how<00:01:05.080> much

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
more like a level control how much

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.280 
more like a level control how much
course<00:01:05.640> versus<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.820> unaffected<00:01:07.540> signal<00:01:08.110> and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
course versus the unaffected signal and

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.800 
course versus the unaffected signal and
over<00:01:08.980> here<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.730> have<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:09.970> bass<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.630> treble

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
over here you have a bass and treble

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.200 
over here you have a bass and treble
control<00:01:11.380> that's<00:01:12.070> just<00:01:12.340> on<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.520> modulate<00:01:13.030> as

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
control that's just on the modulate as

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.000 
control that's just on the modulate as
part<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.659> signal<00:01:14.020> itself<00:01:14.320> that's<00:01:14.650> just<00:01:14.890> on

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
part of the signal itself that's just on

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.980 
part of the signal itself that's just on
the<00:01:15.040> coursing<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:15.729> here<00:01:16.330> you<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:16.600> a<00:01:16.630> bass

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
the coursing and here you have a bass

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.840 
the coursing and here you have a bass
switch<00:01:17.380> which<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:18.040> really<00:01:18.310> interesting

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
switch which is really interesting

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.150 
switch which is really interesting
I<00:01:19.030> had<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.540> engaged<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.380> actually<00:01:20.920> gives<00:01:21.100> you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
I had it engaged it actually gives you

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.150 
I had it engaged it actually gives you
like<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.370> little<00:01:21.460> extra<00:01:22.180> base<00:01:22.420> so<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.320> can<00:01:23.440> take

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
like a little extra base so you can take

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.530 
like a little extra base so you can take
that<00:01:24.340> out<00:01:24.550> if<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.820> want<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:25.210> I<00:01:25.300> thought

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
that out if you want it I thought

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.180 
that out if you want it I thought
playing<00:01:25.840> by<00:01:25.990> myself<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.650> sounded<00:01:26.980> really

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
playing by myself and it sounded really

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.730 
playing by myself and it sounded really
appropriate<00:01:27.970> couple<00:01:28.960> other<00:01:29.080> cool<00:01:29.350> features

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
appropriate couple other cool features

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.320 
appropriate couple other cool features
it's<00:01:30.160> obviously<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.640> nice<00:01:30.850> bright<00:01:31.300> yellow

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
it's obviously a nice bright yellow

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.630 
it's obviously a nice bright yellow
can't<00:01:32.290> miss<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.470> on<00:01:32.830> your<00:01:32.980> crowded<00:01:33.370> pedal

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
can't miss that on your crowded pedal

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.170 
can't miss that on your crowded pedal
board<00:01:33.820> on<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.030> dark<00:01:34.330> stage<00:01:34.740> there's<00:01:35.740> also<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
board on a dark stage there's also the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.690 
board on a dark stage there's also the
status<00:01:37.510> indicator<00:01:38.050> light<00:01:38.320> which<00:01:38.700> actually

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
status indicator light which actually

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.180 
status indicator light which actually
blinks<00:01:40.120> at<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.390> rate<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.050> effect<00:01:41.620> so<00:01:42.100> you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
blinks at the rate of the effect so you

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.680 
blinks at the rate of the effect so you
can<00:01:42.340> see<00:01:42.520> I've<00:01:42.610> got<00:01:42.730> it<00:01:42.850> cranked<00:01:43.180> up<00:01:43.300> there<00:01:43.510> got

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
can see I've got it cranked up there got

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.250 
can see I've got it cranked up there got
the<00:01:43.750> rate<00:01:43.960> cranked<00:01:44.320> up<00:01:44.410> blinking<00:01:45.220> faster

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
the rate cranked up blinking faster

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.950 
the rate cranked up blinking faster
blinking<00:01:47.260> slower<00:01:48.000> very<00:01:49.000> handy<00:01:49.390> on<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:49.630> again

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
blinking slower very handy on it again

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.620 
blinking slower very handy on it again
on<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> dark<00:01:50.470> stage<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.040> you've<00:01:51.640> got<00:01:51.850> an<00:01:52.000> LED

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
on a dark stage and you've got an LED

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.030 
on a dark stage and you've got an LED
that<00:01:52.660> lets<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.020> know<00:01:53.050> you<00:01:53.170> have<00:01:53.380> power<00:01:53.620> and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
that lets you know you have power and

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.370 
that lets you know you have power and
speaking<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.550> power<00:01:54.730> this<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.450> an<00:01:55.600> 18<00:01:56.050> volt

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
speaking of power this is an 18 volt

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.260 
speaking of power this is an 18 volt
pedal<00:01:56.800> so<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.430> can<00:01:57.580> run<00:01:57.760> it<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:57.940> two<00:01:58.060> 9-volt

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
pedal so you can run it with two 9-volt

you can hear that it's a really nice

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.119 
you can hear that it's a really nice
thick<00:02:29.540> analog<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.409> actually<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.799> bucket

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
thick analog it's actually a bucket

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.759 
thick analog it's actually a bucket
brigade<00:02:31.420> chip<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:32.959> that's<00:02:33.260> got<00:02:33.409> that<00:02:33.560> really

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
brigade chip so that's got that really

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.880 
brigade chip so that's got that really
thick<00:02:34.250> analog<00:02:34.760> sound<00:02:35.180> let's<00:02:35.930> pull<00:02:36.379> out<00:02:36.650> this

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
thick analog sound let's pull out this

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.770 
thick analog sound let's pull out this
base<00:02:37.430> contour<00:02:37.909> switch<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.390> can<00:02:38.480> hear<00:02:38.659> what

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
base contour switch you can hear what

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.420 
base contour switch you can hear what
that<00:02:38.810> sounds<00:02:39.290> like<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:45.200> here<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:45.859> is<00:02:45.980> engaged

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
that sounds like and here it is engaged

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.820 
that sounds like and here it is engaged
again

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.990 

so<00:02:53.830> here<00:02:54.010> are<00:02:54.100> much<00:02:54.220> more<00:02:54.430> pronounced<00:02:54.820> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
so here are much more pronounced the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.450 
so here are much more pronounced the
low-end<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.660> that's<00:02:56.530> great<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.160> some

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
low-end is that's great in some

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.250 
low-end is that's great in some
situations<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:58.240> in<00:02:58.360> other<00:02:58.510> situations

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
situations and in other situations

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.110 
situations and in other situations
it'd<00:02:59.890> be<00:03:00.070> great<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.340> have<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:00.730> out<00:03:00.850> like

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
it'd be great to have it out like

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.060 
it'd be great to have it out like
especially<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.780> track<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.650> know<00:03:02.770> where

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
especially in a track you know where

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.830 
especially in a track you know where
you've<00:03:03.190> already<00:03:03.340> got<00:03:03.580> plenty<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.390> stuff<00:03:04.600> going

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
you've already got plenty of stuff going

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.510 
you've already got plenty of stuff going
on<00:03:04.930> low-end<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.740> you<00:03:05.800> just<00:03:05.980> want<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.190> clean<00:03:06.400> it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
on low-end and you just want to clean it

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.090 
on low-end and you just want to clean it
up<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.850> further<00:03:07.600> EQ<00:03:08.020> control<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.890> on<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
up and further EQ control just on the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.340 
up and further EQ control just on the
modulated<00:03:09.670> section<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.810> know<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:10.990> have<00:03:11.140> bass

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
modulated section you know you have bass

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.080 
modulated section you know you have bass
and<00:03:11.560> treble<00:03:11.710> control<00:03:12.190> you'll<00:03:12.790> hear<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
and treble control you'll hear the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.670 
and treble control you'll hear the
interesting<00:03:13.540> thing<00:03:13.690> about<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.350> it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
interesting thing about that is that it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.230 
interesting thing about that is that it
actually<00:03:14.860> affects<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.520> intensity<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
actually affects the intensity the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.330 
actually affects the intensity the
effect<00:03:16.630> as<00:03:16.810> well<00:03:17.020> so<00:03:17.440> here<00:03:17.830> we<00:03:17.920> go<00:03:18.040> check<00:03:18.250> it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
effect as well so here we go check it

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:44.600 
effect as well so here we go check it
out

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.250 

you<00:03:45.610> can<00:03:45.730> hear<00:03:45.909> as<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.030> turn<00:03:46.480> up<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.659> EQ<00:03:47.110> you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
you can hear as you turn up the EQ you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.199 
you can hear as you turn up the EQ you
actually<00:03:47.620> get<00:03:47.829> like<00:03:48.010> more<00:03:48.370> coursing<00:03:48.909> effect

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
actually get like more coursing effect

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.360 
actually get like more coursing effect
and<00:03:49.450> again<00:03:50.019> these<00:03:50.140> three<00:03:50.319> knobs<00:03:50.620> are<00:03:50.920> actually

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
and again these three knobs are actually

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.979 
and again these three knobs are actually
for<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.730> course<00:03:51.939> effect<00:03:52.329> we'll<00:03:52.689> start<00:03:52.900> with

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
for the course effect we'll start with

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:09.740 
for the course effect we'll start with
the<00:03:53.049> intensity<00:03:53.530> control<00:03:53.680> all<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.159> way<00:03:54.250> down

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:33.500 

and<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.950> same<00:04:12.129> with<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.370> width

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.330 

you<00:04:34.510> can<00:04:34.660> hear<00:04:34.810> that<00:04:34.930> actually<00:04:35.320> changes<00:04:36.220> the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
you can hear that actually changes the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.310 
you can hear that actually changes the
intensity<00:04:36.790> of<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.060> wave<00:04:37.240> that's<00:04:37.660> exactly

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
intensity of the wave that's exactly

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.750 
intensity of the wave that's exactly
what's<00:04:38.500> going<00:04:38.740> on<00:04:38.860> is<00:04:39.040> it's<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.430> know<00:04:39.520> more

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
what's going on is it's you know more

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.280 
what's going on is it's you know more
pronounced<00:04:40.180> at<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.330> peaks<00:04:40.600> in<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.900> valleys

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
pronounced at the peaks in the valleys

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.310 
pronounced at the peaks in the valleys
and<00:04:41.440> finally<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.430> rate<00:04:42.580> control<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:47.110> fact

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
and finally the rate control in fact

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.810 
and finally the rate control in fact
I'll<00:04:47.500> put<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.710> little<00:04:47.950> more<00:04:48.100> intensity<00:04:48.640> and

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
I'll put a little more intensity and

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.920 
I'll put a little more intensity and
width<00:04:49.060> on<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.390> so<00:04:49.510> it's<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:49.660> little<00:04:49.720> more

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
width on it so it's a little more

00:04:49.930 --> 00:05:09.260 
width on it so it's a little more
obvious

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.640 

you

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.230 

so<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.680> lot<00:05:16.860> of<00:05:16.889> great<00:05:17.070> flexibility<00:05:17.850> throughout

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
so a lot of great flexibility throughout

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.689 
so a lot of great flexibility throughout
the<00:05:18.509> entire<00:05:18.960> range<00:05:19.229> of<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.500> pedal<00:05:19.830> every<00:05:20.009> knob

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
the entire range of the pedal every knob

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.939 
the entire range of the pedal every knob
I<00:05:20.970> mean<00:05:21.120> really<00:05:21.330> makes<00:05:21.600> a<00:05:21.690> huge<00:05:21.720> difference<00:05:21.949> so

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
I mean really makes a huge difference so

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:23.900 
I mean really makes a huge difference so
there<00:05:23.190> you<00:05:23.340> go

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
there you go

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.960 
there you go
