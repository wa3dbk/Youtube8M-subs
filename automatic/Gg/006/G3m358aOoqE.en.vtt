 privatizes property seize 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.100
 land and undermine the foundations of society 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.090
 in southern countries as a result of people

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.600
 world bank over the past five years 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.670
 invested 50 billion dollars project 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.620
 which according to his employees 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.910
 renders irreversible destructive 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 impact on society 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.289
 that is, they knew what would be 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.219
 the consequences are now visible we we 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.530
 must break this 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.420
 cause and effect secondly we 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.369
 can stop the bombardment of the near 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.409
 east we can help restore 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.930
 infrastructure is where their own and 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.330
 destroyed so we bombed livia 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.189
 destroying the entire infrastructure of the country if 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.689
 take part of the means which are world wide 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.490
 the bank allocates mining 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.710
 corporations to develop mines and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.570
 increase their profits and direct it to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.150
 restoration of some infrastructure 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.430
 countries the situation would improve if we 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.200
 did not support the al-Sisi regime in Egypt 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.000
 which is engaged in privatization 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.040
 takes the most severe measures against 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.020
 Muslims on the Arab Spring dissidents 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.119
 people wouldn't have to get in the boat 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 I think that deal with humanitarian 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.689
 disaster is necessary but we like 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 Westerners should also 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.619
 terminate the fundamental structural 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.960
 damage caused by waves 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.189
 migration we think about the solution 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.470
 problems and only at the last moment 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.960
 when the situation gets out of control 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.399
 I sincerely want everyone to understand while we 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.320
 we will continue such actions 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.920
 poor countries migrant flow is not 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.920
 will stop
