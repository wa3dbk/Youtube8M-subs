but<00:00:26.789> anyway<00:00:27.060> let's<00:00:27.240> get<00:00:27.359> into<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.779> first<00:00:28.650> we

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
but anyway let's get into this first we

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580 
but anyway let's get into this first we
have<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.609> mining<00:00:30.119> egg<00:00:30.359> which<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.810> craft<00:00:31.140> just

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
have the mining egg which you craft just

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.900 
have the mining egg which you craft just
one<00:00:31.890> stone<00:00:32.219> pickaxe<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.480> egg<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.050> this

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
one stone pickaxe and one egg so this

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.490 
one stone pickaxe and one egg so this
it's<00:00:35.910> kind<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.180> tricky<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> way<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.989> works<00:00:37.290> if

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's kind of tricky the way it works if

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.520 
it's kind of tricky the way it works if
you<00:00:37.530> want<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.719> be<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.899> straight<00:00:40.260> down

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you want it to be like straight down

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260 
you want it to be like straight down
then<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.430> throw<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.700> straight<00:00:41.790> down<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.210> if

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
then just throw it straight down but if

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.850 
then just throw it straight down but if
you<00:00:42.329> wanted<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.750> diagonally<00:00:43.410> across<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you wanted to go diagonally across the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.130 
you wanted to go diagonally across the
world<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.190> sorry<00:00:44.399> leg<00:00:44.640> then<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.719> throw<00:00:45.960> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
world and sorry leg then just throw it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.639 
world and sorry leg then just throw it
like<00:00:46.620> diagonal<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:48.030> gonna<00:00:48.300> show<00:00:48.450> you

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
like diagonal but I'm gonna show you

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.990 
like diagonal but I'm gonna show you
throwing<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> straight<00:00:49.829> down<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:50.700> it's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
throwing it straight down because it's

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.060 
throwing it straight down because it's
the<00:00:51.180> coolest<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.500> does<00:00:52.739> break

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
diagonal at time so it'll just go

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.250 
diagonal at time so it'll just go
straight<00:01:01.590> down<00:01:02.359> keep<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> side

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
there we go see straight down and so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
there we go see straight down and so
bedrock<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.479> die<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> might<00:01:25.979> not

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
bedrock and you die so you might not

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.170 
bedrock and you die so you might not
want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> follow<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.909> might<00:01:27.000> want

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
want to follow that down you might want

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.880 
want to follow that down you might want
to<00:01:27.210> make<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.420> staircase<00:01:27.659> around<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
to make a staircase around it if you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.710 
to make a staircase around it if you
want<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:30.439> not<00:01:31.439> less<00:01:31.700> less<00:01:32.700> dying<00:01:35.720> next

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
want it to be not less less dying next

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
want it to be not less less dying next

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
we have the teleportation a which is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.120 
we have the teleportation a which is
just<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.030> ender<00:01:39.270> pearl<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:40.200> egg<00:01:40.470> which

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
just one ender pearl and one egg which

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
just one ender pearl and one egg which
just<00:01:41.490> tells<00:01:41.640> me<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> normal<00:01:42.360> ender<00:01:42.810> pearl

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
just tells me like a normal ender pearl

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.130 
just tells me like a normal ender pearl
however<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:44.490> does<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.909> take<00:01:45.270> any<00:01:45.509> damage<00:01:45.750> away

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
however it does not take any damage away

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
however it does not take any damage away
