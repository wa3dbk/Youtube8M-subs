within<00:00:47.739> 20<00:00:48.039> minutes<00:00:48.159> your<00:00:48.429> blood<00:00:48.579> sugar

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
within 20 minutes your blood sugar

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.180 
within 20 minutes your blood sugar
spikes<00:00:49.149> and<00:00:49.390> your<00:00:49.479> liver<00:00:49.659> responds<00:00:50.289> so<00:00:51.039> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
spikes and your liver responds so the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.619 
spikes and your liver responds so the
minute<00:00:51.429> we<00:00:51.519> kick<00:00:51.729> that<00:00:51.909> liver<00:00:52.120> into<00:00:52.479> motion

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
minute we kick that liver into motion

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.799 
minute we kick that liver into motion
then<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.800> bursts<00:00:54.789> insulin<00:00:55.420> so<00:00:55.569> can<00:00:55.719> you

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
then it bursts insulin so can you

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.369 
then it bursts insulin so can you
imagine<00:00:56.079> if<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:56.620> are<00:00:56.789> syndrome<00:00:57.789> X

hypoglycemic or diabetic what it's going

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.660 
hypoglycemic or diabetic what it's going
to<00:01:00.339> do<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.609> you<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.289> liver<00:01:02.739> screaming<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.429> its

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
to do to you the liver screaming is its

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.369 
to do to you the liver screaming is its
first<00:01:03.969> in<00:01:04.120> with<00:01:04.270> insulin<00:01:04.570> coming<00:01:04.900> out<00:01:05.020> then

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
first in with insulin coming out then

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.110 
first in with insulin coming out then
within<00:01:05.530> 40<00:01:05.980> minutes<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.760> caffeine

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
within 40 minutes the caffeine

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.300 
within 40 minutes the caffeine
absorption<00:01:07.630> is<00:01:07.720> totally<00:01:08.050> complete<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.710> so

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
absorption is totally complete and so

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.760 
absorption is totally complete and so
your<00:01:09.460> pupils<00:01:09.850> are<00:01:09.940> dilated<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.870> same<00:01:11.230> way<00:01:11.470> as

your pupils are dilated the same way as

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.310 
your pupils are dilated the same way as
if<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:12.700> had<00:01:12.940> taken<00:01:13.720> some<00:01:13.990> kind<00:01:14.110> of<00:01:14.230> an

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
amphetamine your blood pressure rises

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.360 
amphetamine your blood pressure rises
your<00:01:16.720> pupils<00:01:17.050> are<00:01:17.170> dilated<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:17.860> your<00:01:18.220> liver

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
your pupils are dilated and your liver

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.130 
your pupils are dilated and your liver
dumps<00:01:18.700> more<00:01:18.910> sugar<00:01:19.330> into<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.630> bloodstream<00:01:19.810> to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
dumps more sugar into the bloodstream to

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.600 
dumps more sugar into the bloodstream to
try<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.350> overcome<00:01:20.650> that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
try to overcome that

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.900 
try to overcome that
okay<00:01:22.210> then<00:01:22.930> within<00:01:23.250> 45<00:01:24.250> minutes<00:01:24.280> your<00:01:24.730> body

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
increases dopamine production and the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.520 
increases dopamine production and the
dopamine<00:01:28.060> production<00:01:28.330> stimulates<00:01:29.110> the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
dopamine production stimulates the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.920
