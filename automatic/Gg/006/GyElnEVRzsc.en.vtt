00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.509
 min 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.710
 with a greeting 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.319
 here we are again with another and tutorials and fernando cadiz the tenor 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.930
 and I'm going to take that opportunity to write 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 These services include below 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.520
 and in him in this case powers 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.320
 is the hard drive they had 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.880
 on my week computer amounts to 1 could that paranoia that had some 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.880
 defective actors I can not format it 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.690
 what it does is take advantage of the network 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.820
 in this opportunity to serve and tutorial 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.460
 at the same time that I'm going to create a partition in the renewal speech 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 if you are that I had the future for those people who 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.150
 this same place that I and want 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.410
 clear why be a hard drive with the windows xp ii introduced as 0 tests 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.580
 relevant that costs 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.710
 this vitoriano 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 for this as he used the windows xp 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.870
 I know what I'm going to be hostage 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.870
 since as I know I hope a partition is dropped from 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.910
 from the administrator 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.290
 of the team we will have to use a child an external program by e in 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.700
 January first april the administrator 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.180
 so you can see 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.630
 in the state 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.010
 the hard drive 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.780
 we would like concrete right it will not relax only the most relaxed 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.390
 download the coast 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 not only the studies so we are going to overcome this 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 and what we go there is promoted 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.470
 that we be partition norton part of a valley 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.550
 eight points 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.820
 coli and I have it here open 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.960
 we are going to die 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.110
 but here we have 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.549
 is our hard drive the only woman then 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.549
 so what we're going to do is first in the first box 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.469
 that arturo portillo 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.949
 in its origin 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.669
 this sale we would not be here 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:23.669
 We are gonna give 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.909
 the next 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.790
 writing next months sessions later assured here by how it has been 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.119
 recommended 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:37.149
 Poplar next sacyr general of the state and those of which we believe you 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:38.269
 occupy 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.639
 our artistic object 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.639
 here we can for the man who was bush 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.089
 this time we leave it as logic 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:52.259
 here in this recommended cessation and is that the letter I think to have our 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.519
 partition 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.539
 in the museum 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.919
 following 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:01.379
 and how can you be of the controversial saints as we have in our disc 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.879
 with the ability and like the cod what makes us this program is more or 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.659
 less divide the hard drive 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.659
 we will see how we are going to half more things 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.349
 Moscow - no 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.500
 you do not see that we're going to create this partition after we could make another 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.799
 partition here another part is required 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.269
 he proposed talented continuations 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.869
 give him 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:26.259
 finish 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.229
 and here he will tell us in this picture like other 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.299
 the hard disk from state to state to the operating system 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.449
 and the copy of his life of 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:35.779
 I do not participate 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.349
 genesis 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.319
 the local treasury 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.229
 with the means 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.229
 and the disc the mosqueo 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.379
 with the ability of tigers to read well 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.789
 let's say it would be done but to be able to complete profit we have cÃ¡ceres 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.079
 on the occasion 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.049
 p apply 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.989
 I mean 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.389
 these operations currently pending apply the changes now we say that 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.199
 yes block will not be able to apply the changes but they sweep us and close the 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.409
 computer 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.309
 warm 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.019
 your dialog boxes p 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.709
 at the start of windows will end skiing because he said to macri 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.810
 renove we have the partition creation this moment home 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.730
 I'm not going to do it because 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.150
 this has been the record the bidders 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.909
 we will go through the changes that 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.249
 peter mullan on the disk 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.249
 quique will bet the video 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.699
 well we are always back 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.639
 after having 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.750
 on the restart 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.520
 - tronador and have created the partition now let's see how 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.439
 as other supports 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.460
 for this we open my pc or you can see here gathered here that the 

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:06.349
 we had 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:07.729
 Recently 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 and it was the partition that a mosqueo unit 3 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:14.870
 alright then let's close it on another version 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.419
 partition 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.279
 maino in orkut 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.569
 we do not open 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.229
 and we can see the unit efe 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.749
 OS 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.069
 unit 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.330
 that we have created in the pressure that we have created 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.169
 good for 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.689
 he will return 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.560
 Previous jab as we have the obligation 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.460
 was the principle be to merge the two hard drives 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.529
 it is also very subjective to do 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:42.580
 we are going to do it 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.229
 on 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.949
 the hard drive or the partition that we have created 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.930
 the right uneasiness the bronzes 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.249
 fuse 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:52.639
 lanusse 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.520
 about this sale not 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.289
 tells us here what 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.249
 efe becomes a catastrophe 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.990
 the deep part 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.669
 disco one 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.669
 in this sector we are going to accept 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.270
 as we will see here 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.460
 it has become merged 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.869
 with the size of a museum 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:19.800
 at the beginning of 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.820
 this victory for what we will do now would be to apply but as 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.200
 we think so we want to leave it as we did not have a mousse to undo the 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.729
 changes 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.819
 us what it says re-do it possibly antiseptic restart 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.839
 given the pcc and would return 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:37.169
 he has previously accused 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.080
 from the disk c 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.319
 what now also if we want to create another partition 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.919
 it got so destructive 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.099
 click on ccm 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:49.150
 a period that follows is expected 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.499
 the moncloa partition 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:53.189
 President 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:54.800
 table I think here 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 efe efe no troncoso to mark 

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:00.539
 ence 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.539
 following 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:09.039
 following 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.259
 It is already telling us the sizes we really have here and we 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:13.960
 we could put 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.119
 what we do 

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:19.119
 we would like or as we think 

00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:20.869
 of the g-7 capacity 

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:22.629
 that partition that we're going to create 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.629
 I like myself only want a few what I have now 

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:29.229
 enrique castelar 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.860
 but we can not close the program 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.999
 And I think that 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:36.930
 well the eleven simple to do 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.169
 I hope you have no problem at the time of this one to the partitions I know 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:45.240
 and nothing else is simply can comment is to rate the bibio 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.819
 percent and subscribe and also how can you visit us on my channel 

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:50.889
 mayor when they played and they felt 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:52.929
 you know how I say many times 

00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:57.199
 I am and tutorials and that many in the network but or are not made to 

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:00.199
 the people who are nuke is new and who wants 

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:03.749
 and ended it with the prize 

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:06.849
 with obama his health and until the next 28 hours the fact
