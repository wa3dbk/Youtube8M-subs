00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
to try something a little bit different

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.719 
to try something a little bit different
another<00:01:23.880> smaller<00:01:24.570> grid<00:01:24.990> than<00:01:25.740> norm<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.430> Golf

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
another smaller grid than norm that Golf

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.670 
another smaller grid than norm that Golf
is<00:01:26.880> fucking<00:01:27.240> lucky<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.810> even<00:01:27.900> care

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
is fucking lucky that I even care

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.069 
is fucking lucky that I even care
this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> such<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> weird<00:01:29.970> car<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.840> feels

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
this is such a weird car so it feels

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.210 
this is such a weird car so it feels
like<00:01:31.400> every<00:01:32.400> other<00:01:32.490> Bradford<00:01:32.970> car

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
like every other Bradford car

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
like every other Bradford car
what<00:01:35.220> heavier<00:01:35.550> that's<00:01:35.940> basically<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.480> record

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
what heavier that's basically the record

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.960 
what heavier that's basically the record
but<00:01:37.260> early<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.040> loosely<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.490> seemed<00:01:38.730> really

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
but early but loosely it seemed really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.410 
but early but loosely it seemed really
pretty<00:01:39.300> can<00:01:39.420> heavy<00:01:39.630> car<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.070> drives<00:01:41.580> really

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
pretty can heavy car or it drives really

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.540 
pretty can heavy car or it drives really
well<00:01:42.570> even<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.260> it's<00:01:43.410> revving<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.310> hard

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
well even when it's revving really hard

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.430 
well even when it's revving really hard
but<00:01:44.760> nothing<00:01:44.880> that's<00:01:45.120> pretty<00:01:45.420> cool<00:01:45.630> it's

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
but nothing that's pretty cool it's

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.280 
but nothing that's pretty cool it's
different<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.340> while<00:01:48.300> lonely<00:01:48.600> cars<00:01:48.840> when

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
different because while lonely cars when

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.810 
different because while lonely cars when
they<00:01:49.410> hit<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.620> rev<00:01:49.800> limiter<00:01:50.190> they<00:01:50.340> boot<00:01:50.610> they

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
I think overall the gameplay in this

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.720 
I think overall the gameplay in this
like<00:03:52.430> when<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.910> looks<00:03:53.120> more<00:03:53.360> real<00:03:53.720> or<00:03:54.730> I

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
like when it it looks more real or I

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.610
