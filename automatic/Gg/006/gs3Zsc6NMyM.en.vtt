lakes designs and this is this was

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.360 
lakes designs and this is this was
actually<00:00:39.690> my<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.110> time<00:00:40.559> using<00:00:40.829> water

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
actually my first time using water

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.600 
actually my first time using water
decals<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> cut<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.770> into<00:00:43.920> pieces<00:00:44.280> like

decals so I cut them up into pieces like

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
decals so I cut them up into pieces like
this<00:00:44.789> since<00:00:45.059> they're<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.480> different<00:00:45.719> designs

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
this since they're all different designs

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.119 
this since they're all different designs
and<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:48.420> polka<00:00:48.690> dot<00:00:48.960> lace<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> one

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
i'll be using then i cut them on

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.660 
i'll be using then i cut them on
individual<00:00:54.149> pieces<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:56.190> back<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
individual pieces in the back of the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.459 
individual pieces in the back of the
packaging<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> says<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> drop<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.050> decal<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
packaging and says to drop the decal and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.520 
packaging and says to drop the decal and
water<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.129> 10<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.699> 20<00:01:00.090> seconds<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.350> that's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
water for 10 to 20 seconds so that's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.630 
water for 10 to 20 seconds so that's
what<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> did<00:01:02.930> then<00:01:03.930> afterwards<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.949> grabbed<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
what I did then afterwards I grabbed it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.310 
what I did then afterwards I grabbed it
with<00:01:05.760> my<00:01:05.970> notes<00:01:06.180> weezer's<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.900> separated

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
with my notes weezer's and I separated

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.539 
with my notes weezer's and I separated
the<00:01:07.830> decal<00:01:08.220> from<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.549> paper

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.270 

so<00:01:16.549> I<00:01:16.579> assumed<00:01:17.329> that<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:18.109> decal<00:01:18.740> was<00:01:18.950> going<00:01:19.130> to

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
so I assumed that the decal was going to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.120 
so I assumed that the decal was going to
be<00:01:19.399> transparent<00:01:19.999> but<00:01:20.719> it<00:01:20.840> wasn't<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:21.619> I<00:01:21.890> kind

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
be transparent but it wasn't so I kind

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.639 
be transparent but it wasn't so I kind
of<00:01:22.189> didn't<00:01:22.429> like<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.409> assumed<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:24.530> was

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
of didn't like that I assumed it was

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:25.870 
of didn't like that I assumed it was
transparent<00:01:25.069> cuz<00:01:25.310> that's<00:01:25.460> how<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.700> looked

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
transparent cuz that's how it looked

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.099 
transparent cuz that's how it looked
like<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.359> paper<00:01:26.569> but<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:27.700> wasn't<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.630> now

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
like on the paper but it wasn't so now

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.630 
like on the paper but it wasn't so now
I'm<00:01:30.259> just<00:01:30.409> tapping<00:01:30.829> it<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.240> my<00:01:32.240> nail<00:01:33.579> trying<00:01:34.579> to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
I'm just tapping it on my nail trying to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.380 
I'm just tapping it on my nail trying to
put<00:01:34.849> it<00:01:34.939> into<00:01:35.209> place<00:01:42.609> then<00:01:43.609> I<00:01:43.670> used<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.090> client

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
put it into place then I used a client

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.510 
put it into place then I used a client
around<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.750> dry<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.049> decal<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.920> instructions

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
around to dry the decal the instructions

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.059 
around to dry the decal the instructions
don't<00:01:49.729> say<00:01:50.179> how<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:50.629> get<00:01:51.229> rid<00:01:51.439> of<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:51.679> excess

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
don't say how to get rid of the excess

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.580 
don't say how to get rid of the excess
decal<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:52.849> I<00:01:52.879> had<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.209> figure<00:01:54.049> that<00:01:54.259> out<00:01:54.319> on<00:01:54.439> my

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
decal so I had to figure that out on my

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.069 
decal so I had to figure that out on my
own<00:01:54.709> I<00:01:55.280> used<00:01:55.759> my<00:01:55.909> note<00:01:56.090> tweezers<00:01:56.539> to<00:01:56.569> a<00:01:56.780> dent

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
own I used my note tweezers to a dent

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.309 
own I used my note tweezers to a dent
around<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.649> cuticle<00:01:58.360> then<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.810> apply<00:02:00.289> the

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
around the cuticle then I apply the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:08.499 
around the cuticle then I apply the
topcoat<00:02:00.709> and<00:02:01.009> let<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.520> dry<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:07.119> last<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.329> dip

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
topcoat and let that dry and last I dip

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.509 
topcoat and let that dry and last I dip
my<00:02:08.539> brush<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.869> pure<00:02:09.229> acetone<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:10.220> touched

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
my brush in pure acetone and I touched

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.020 
my brush in pure acetone and I touched
the<00:02:10.670> decal<00:02:11.120> for<00:02:11.420> like<00:02:11.599> two<00:02:11.810> seconds<00:02:12.319> and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
the decal for like two seconds and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.360 
the decal for like two seconds and
acetone<00:02:14.030> melted<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.720> decal<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.500> that's<00:02:15.739> how<00:02:16.040> I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
acetone melted the decal so that's how I

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.000 
acetone melted the decal so that's how I
figured<00:02:16.790> out<00:02:16.879> how<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.150> get<00:02:18.139> rid<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.530> excess

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
figured out how to get rid of the excess

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.970 
figured out how to get rid of the excess
I<00:02:19.630> also<00:02:20.630> thought<00:02:20.930> about<00:02:20.989> using<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.650> cuticle

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
I also thought about using a cuticle

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.940 
I also thought about using a cuticle
nipper<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.760> cut<00:02:23.239> around<00:02:23.410> but<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> didn't<00:02:24.829> want

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
nipper to cut around but I didn't want

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.800 
nipper to cut around but I didn't want

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
charms I really like them they're very

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.559

pretty and shiny there are little big

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.259 
pretty and shiny there are little big
and<00:02:41.870> it'd<00:02:42.709> probably<00:02:43.280> look<00:02:43.459> better<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:44.060> a

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
and it'd probably look better on a

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.920 
and it'd probably look better on a
longer<00:02:44.780> now<00:02:45.019> but<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.400> them<00:02:46.639> I<00:02:46.930> went

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.599 
longer now but I do like them I went
ahead<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.200> apply<00:02:48.560> some<00:02:48.829> top<00:02:49.069> coat<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.310> that

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
ahead and apply some top coat to that

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.809 
ahead and apply some top coat to that
now<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.090> then<00:02:50.299> let<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.630> dry<00:02:51.549> afterwards<00:02:52.549> I

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
now and then let that dry afterwards I

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.960 
now and then let that dry afterwards I
applied<00:02:53.180> my<00:02:53.480> IBD<00:02:54.200> brush<00:02:54.440> on<00:02:54.650> nail<00:02:54.829> glue<00:02:55.099> to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.809 
applied my IBD brush on nail glue to
adhere<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.750> charm<00:02:57.220> although<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.250> recommend

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
adhere the charm although I recommend

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.759 
adhere the charm although I recommend
using<00:02:59.030> some<00:02:59.450> acrylic<00:02:59.870> powder<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.440> critic

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
using some acrylic powder and a critic

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.180 
using some acrylic powder and a critic
liquid<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.459> adhere<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.090> nail<00:03:02.269> charm<00:03:02.599> instead

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
liquid to adhere the nail charm instead

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.559 
liquid to adhere the nail charm instead
because<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.340> will<00:03:04.459> last<00:03:04.609> longer<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:05.269> and

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
because it will last longer that way and

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.650 
because it will last longer that way and
will<00:03:05.780> fall<00:03:06.079> off<00:03:06.230> as<00:03:06.410> easy<00:03:06.829> as<00:03:07.239> opposed<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.450> nail
