00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
oh and ride bearing spaces cuz that's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.990 
oh and ride bearing spaces cuz that's
probably<00:01:03.100> what<00:01:04.100> oval<00:01:04.399> icing<00:01:04.670> in<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.820> first

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
little bit on the edge so you can like

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:36.670 
little bit on the edge so you can like
wrap<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.490> back<00:01:26.640> around<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.270> side

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.980 

it's<00:01:37.220> like<00:01:37.430> that

and don't cut it all the way up to the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.399 
and don't cut it all the way up to the
bearing<00:02:06.270> again<00:02:06.510> let<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.720> little<00:02:06.900> bit<00:02:07.110> hang<00:02:07.320> off

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.490 

and<00:02:13.409> then<00:02:13.829> basically<00:02:15.049> that'll<00:02:16.049> make<00:02:16.140> sure<00:02:16.200> it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and then basically that'll make sure it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.039 
and then basically that'll make sure it
like<00:02:16.650> holds<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.159> well<00:02:17.939> you<00:02:18.120> put<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.720> back<00:02:18.810> into

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
like holds on well you put it back into

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:26.400 
like holds on well you put it back into
the<00:02:19.140> wheel<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> yeah

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the wheel and so yeah

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.930 
the wheel and so yeah
just<00:02:27.120> make<00:02:28.120> sure<00:02:28.150> none<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:28.960> it's<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.940> coming

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
just make sure none of it's like coming

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.880 
just make sure none of it's like coming
off<00:02:31.210> when<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.840> put<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.320> because<00:02:32.530> it'll<00:02:32.860> be

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
off when you put it in because it'll be

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.660 
off when you put it in because it'll be
pretty<00:02:33.160> tight<00:02:33.430> and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.110 

I<00:02:39.470> kind<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.590> twists<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.010> down<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> little<00:02:41.430> bit

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.330
