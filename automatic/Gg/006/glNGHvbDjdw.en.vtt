00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
so we're going to be building a birdbath

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.660 
so we're going to be building a birdbath
we're<00:00:05.250> going<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> put<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.670> on<00:00:05.790> top<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.120> our

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
we're going to put it on top of our

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.520 
we're going to put it on top of our
sequoia<00:00:08.670> stump<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.480> had<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.780> cut<00:00:09.960> down<00:00:10.170> we

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
sequoia stump that we had to cut down we

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.589 
sequoia stump that we had to cut down we
just--we<00:00:11.040> didn't<00:00:11.400> have<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.849> broom<00:00:12.150> for<00:00:12.360> to

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
just--we didn't have to broom for to

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.420 
just--we didn't have to broom for to
sequoias<00:00:13.259> back<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:15.440> it<00:00:16.440> blocks<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.250> too

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
sequoias back here it blocks out too

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.220 
sequoias back here it blocks out too
much<00:00:17.609> light<00:00:17.910> takes<00:00:18.330> too<00:00:18.539> much<00:00:18.660> toll<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
much light takes too much toll on the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.439 
much light takes too much toll on the
garden<00:00:19.590> as<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:21.060> already<00:00:21.240> have

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
garden as you can see we already have

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.470 
garden as you can see we already have
another<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.789> didn't<00:00:24.240> have

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
another one and we just didn't have

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.650 
another one and we just didn't have
enough<00:00:24.510> room<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.439> two<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.070> them<00:00:26.340> back<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.910> so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
enough room for two of them back here so

going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> build<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.420> concrete<00:00:40.280> birdbath<00:00:41.809> using

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
going to build a concrete birdbath using

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.060 
going to build a concrete birdbath using
some<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> integral<00:00:43.530> parts<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
some of the integral parts of the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.319 
some of the integral parts of the
Sequoia<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.670> some<00:00:45.180> river<00:00:45.450> rock<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> I've

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
Sequoia and some river rock so I've

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.810 
Sequoia and some river rock so I've
assembled<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> gear<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> concrete

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
assembled all the gear for the concrete

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.689 
assembled all the gear for the concrete
birdbath<00:00:51.360> I've<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.590> fiber<00:00:52.890> reinforced

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
birdbath I've got some fiber reinforced

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.750 
birdbath I've got some fiber reinforced
shotcrete<00:00:54.590> some<00:00:55.590> clean<00:00:55.829> sand<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.460> give<00:00:56.610> use

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
shotcrete some clean sand or give use

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.290 
shotcrete some clean sand or give use
that<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.180> mold<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.960> inside<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.969> above<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that to mold the inside of the above the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
that to mold the inside of the above the
birdbath<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:01.579> formed<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.730> form<00:01:03.660> -<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.890> going

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
birdbath I formed a form - this is going

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.670 
birdbath I formed a form - this is going
to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> final<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> final<00:01:06.869> diameter<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to be the final on the final diameter of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550 
to be the final on the final diameter of
the<00:01:07.950> birdbath

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.359 

and<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:13.369> leftover

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and this is some of the the leftover

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.710 
and this is some of the the leftover
limbs<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.880> stuff<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.570> from

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
limbs and stuff that we have from

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
limbs and stuff that we have from
Sequoia<00:01:16.260> we're<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> use<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
Sequoia we're going to use that to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.460 
Sequoia we're going to use that to
imprint<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.600> inside<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> birdbath

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
imprint the the inside of the birdbath

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.410 
imprint the the inside of the birdbath
and<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:19.979> we're<00:01:20.190> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> gather<00:01:21.119> some

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and then we're going to gather some

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.789 
and then we're going to gather some
river<00:01:21.630> rock<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.110> put<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.409> around<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
river rock and put that around the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.149 
river rock and put that around the
outside<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> birdbath<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.650> I've<00:01:25.770> added<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
outside the birdbath so I've added the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.960 
outside the birdbath so I've added the
water<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> sand<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.550> it's<00:01:29.550> just<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
water to the sand now and it's just just

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.820 
water to the sand now and it's just just
about<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.690> don't<00:01:30.899> want<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.560> wet

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
about right you don't want it so wet

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.280 
about right you don't want it so wet
that<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.030> mud<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> build

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that it's like mud but you want to build

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.859 
that it's like mud but you want to build
a<00:01:34.380> buildup<00:01:35.040> kill<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> packet<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.630> want

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
a buildup kill the packet and you want

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.139 
a buildup kill the packet and you want
to<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.020> able<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.259> run<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> field<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.850> stay

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
to be able to run it field if you stay

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.990 
to be able to run it field if you stay
in<00:01:39.299> stay<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.720> shape<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.649> know<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.100> form<00:01:41.549> me<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
in stay in shape you know to form me the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760 
in stay in shape you know to form me the
inside<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.600> bowls<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.200> whatever<00:01:43.470> shape

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
inside of the bowls or whatever shape

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.520 
inside of the bowls or whatever shape
you<00:01:43.830> want<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.929> I<00:01:45.960> think

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you want to do want to be so I think

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.310 
you want to do want to be so I think
this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.789> just<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.690> right<00:01:48.990> not

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
this is just just just about right not

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.980 
this is just just just about right not
too<00:01:49.500> wet<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.920> too<00:01:49.979> dry<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:51.600> Goldilocks

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
too wet not too dry just like Goldilocks

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.550 
too wet not too dry just like Goldilocks
nothing<00:01:52.590> hot<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.979> too<00:01:53.130> cold<00:01:53.159> get<00:01:53.640> us<00:01:53.759> ready<00:01:54.560> so

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
nothing hot not too cold get us ready so

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.430 
nothing hot not too cold get us ready so
now<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.369> founded<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> sand<00:01:57.780> at<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.170> damp

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
now I have founded the sand at the damp

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.059 
now I have founded the sand at the damp
sand<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.130> camped<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.580> down<00:01:59.819> into<00:02:00.780> my<00:02:01.200> mold<00:02:01.500> or

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
sand and camped it down into my mold or

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.570 
sand and camped it down into my mold or
my<00:02:02.700> guide<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.649> it's<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> depth<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.429> about

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
my guide here it's to a depth of about

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.300 
my guide here it's to a depth of about
four<00:02:06.030> inches<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.659> middle<00:02:06.929> if<00:02:07.890> that's<00:02:08.100> too

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
four inches in the middle if that's too

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.460 
four inches in the middle if that's too
deep<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.569> any<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> birds<00:02:09.869> we'll<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.289> put

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
deep for any of the birds we'll just put

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.020 
deep for any of the birds we'll just put
some<00:02:10.590> some<00:02:10.979> rocks<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> middle<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.819> they

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
some some rocks in the middle that they

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.560 
some some rocks in the middle that they
can<00:02:12.180> stand<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.579> nice<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.030> firm<00:02:15.269> I've

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
can stand on so it's nice and firm I've

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.660 
can stand on so it's nice and firm I've
camped<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.989> down<00:02:16.140> by<00:02:16.350> hand<00:02:16.380> moved<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.549> there

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
camped it down by hand moved it in there

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.229 
camped it down by hand moved it in there
with<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.850> trowel

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
with a trowel

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.170 
with a trowel
tap<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.630> down<00:02:18.660> by<00:02:18.930> hand<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.610> next<00:02:21.000> we're

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
tap it down by hand and so next we're

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.330 
tap it down by hand and so next we're
going<00:02:21.329> to<00:02:21.480> cover<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> with<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.150> Sequoia<00:02:24.150> limbs

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
going to cover it with the Sequoia limbs

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.590 
going to cover it with the Sequoia limbs
these<00:02:26.340> are<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.610> Sequoia<00:02:27.000> lines<00:02:27.269> are<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.480> to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
these are the Sequoia lines are going to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600 
these are the Sequoia lines are going to
cover<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.959> inside<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.590> now<00:02:28.709> give<00:02:28.920> an<00:02:29.040> imprint

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
cover the inside and now give an imprint

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.300 
cover the inside and now give an imprint
to<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.880> inside<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.200> birdbath<00:02:31.530> end<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
to the inside of the birdbath end of the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.050 
to the inside of the birdbath end of the
Sequoia<00:02:32.760> limbs

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
Sequoia limbs

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.300 
Sequoia limbs
and<00:02:34.300> later<00:02:34.690> cover<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.709> whole<00:02:35.890> thing<00:02:36.130> with

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and later cover the whole thing with

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.940 
and later cover the whole thing with
some<00:02:36.340> black<00:02:36.760> or<00:02:37.030> excuse<00:02:37.390> me<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:37.630> some<00:02:37.950> some

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
some black or excuse me with some some

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.520 
some black or excuse me with some some
clear<00:02:39.580> plastic<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.420> then<00:02:41.230> I'm<00:02:41.319> going<00:02:41.470> to

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
clear plastic and then I'm going to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.900 
clear plastic and then I'm going to
start<00:02:41.709> laying<00:02:41.890> out<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.250> rocks<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.760> rocks

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
start laying out the rocks the rocks

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.680 
start laying out the rocks the rocks
will<00:02:43.209> be<00:02:43.330> embedded<00:02:43.959> into<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.690> plastic

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
will be embedded into it the plastic

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.920 
will be embedded into it the plastic
will<00:02:47.140> prevent<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:48.069> sequela<00:02:48.580> limbs<00:02:48.880> from<00:02:49.330> you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
will prevent the sequela limbs from you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.530 
will prevent the sequela limbs from you
know<00:02:50.050> getting<00:02:50.410> embedded<00:02:51.069> into<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.550> into<00:02:52.420> the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
know getting embedded into the into the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.250 
know getting embedded into the into the
cement

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
cement

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.620 
cement
they'll<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:53.800> basically<00:02:54.340> form<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.180> shape<00:02:55.450> of

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
they'll just basically form the shape of

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.540 
they'll just basically form the shape of
the<00:02:55.780> sequela<00:02:56.200> limbs<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.890> rocks<00:02:57.130> will<00:02:57.400> be

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
the sequela limbs but the rocks will be

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.170 
the sequela limbs but the rocks will be
embedded<00:02:58.120> within<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.410> birdbath<00:03:00.180> okay

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
embedded within the in the birdbath okay

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.830 
embedded within the in the birdbath okay
so<00:03:01.239> now<00:03:01.480> I've<00:03:01.660> laid<00:03:01.930> out<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.170> sequoia<00:03:02.950> limbs

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
so now I've laid out the sequoia limbs

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.440 
so now I've laid out the sequoia limbs
and<00:03:04.840> if<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.170> notice<00:03:05.470> they're<00:03:06.400> laying<00:03:07.060> over

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
and if you notice they're laying over

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.070 
and if you notice they're laying over
the<00:03:07.750> edge<00:03:07.989> that's<00:03:08.290> by<00:03:08.590> design<00:03:09.209> when<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.239> after<00:03:11.019> I

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the edge that's by design when I after I

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.110 
the edge that's by design when I after I
cover<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.650> with<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.010> plastic<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.820> begin

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
cover this with the plastic and I begin

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.180 
cover this with the plastic and I begin
laying<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.510> rocks<00:03:13.750> in<00:03:13.989> there<00:03:14.170> it's<00:03:14.950> going<00:03:15.130> to

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
laying the rocks in there it's going to

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.390 
laying the rocks in there it's going to
be<00:03:15.280> alternating<00:03:16.290> sequoia<00:03:17.290> limbs<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.070> rocks

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
be alternating sequoia limbs and rocks

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.070 
be alternating sequoia limbs and rocks
around<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.910> edge<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.450> birdbath

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.890 

he<00:03:23.080> sets<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.440> plan<00:03:23.709> anyway<00:03:24.330> okay<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.390> now<00:03:25.840> we

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
he sets the plan anyway okay so now we

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.410 
he sets the plan anyway okay so now we
have<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.620> covered<00:03:26.860> with<00:03:27.010> plastic<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
have it covered with plastic and the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.180 
have it covered with plastic and the
rocks<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:29.290> are<00:03:29.350> going<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.590> run<00:03:29.860> around<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
rocks that are going to run around the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.970 
rocks that are going to run around the
rim<00:03:30.459> are<00:03:30.670> in<00:03:30.850> place<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:32.290> can<00:03:32.380> see<00:03:32.590> we<00:03:32.739> still

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
rim are in place you can see we still

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.050 
rim are in place you can see we still
have<00:03:33.040> underneath<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.970> plastic<00:03:34.239> we<00:03:34.840> have<00:03:35.050> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
have underneath the plastic we have the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.180 
have underneath the plastic we have the
sequoia<00:03:37.060> limbs<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:38.709> are<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:39.130> are

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
sequoia limbs that are that are

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.000 
sequoia limbs that are that are
overhanging<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.970> edge<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.480> they'll<00:03:40.660> be<00:03:41.010> kind

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
overhanging the edge so they'll be kind

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.009 
overhanging the edge so they'll be kind
of<00:03:42.130> alternating<00:03:42.579> rocks<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.329> sequoia<00:03:43.720> limb

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
of alternating rocks and sequoia limb

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.039 
of alternating rocks and sequoia limb
imprints<00:03:44.829> around<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> edge<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.090> around

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
imprints around the edge of the around

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.520 
imprints around the edge of the around
the<00:03:47.170> edge<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.910> birdbath<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:49.989> think<00:03:50.110> I'm

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
the edge of the birdbath so I think I'm

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.770 
the edge of the birdbath so I think I'm
ready<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:51.010> start<00:03:51.370> mixing<00:03:51.670> concrete<00:03:52.060> forms<00:03:52.690> of

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
ready to start mixing concrete forms of

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.660 
ready to start mixing concrete forms of

here and this is going to be the guide
actually<00:04:40.840> this<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.130> diameter<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.790> the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
actually this is the diameter of the

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.560 
actually this is the diameter of the
stump<00:04:43.450> so<00:04:44.350> I'm<00:04:44.500> putting<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.100> chamfer<00:04:45.570> around

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
stump so I'm putting a chamfer around

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.170 
stump so I'm putting a chamfer around
the<00:04:46.720> edge<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:47.140> this<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:48.730> that's<00:04:48.940> going<00:04:49.120> to

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
the edge of this and so that's going to

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.970 
the edge of this and so that's going to
be<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.330> guide<00:04:49.660> that's<00:04:50.170> going<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.440> basically

hold it on to the stump and once we get

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.490 
hold it on to the stump and once we get
everything<00:04:53.950> all<00:04:54.330> seasoned<00:04:55.330> then<00:04:55.540> cured<00:04:56.169> and

cure before I take into the forums off

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.260 
cure before I take into the forums off
it<00:05:17.320> ended<00:05:17.590> up<00:05:17.710> about<00:05:18.070> two<00:05:18.790> and<00:05:18.880> a<00:05:18.970> half<00:05:19.000> to

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
it ended up about two and a half to

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.040 
it ended up about two and a half to
three<00:05:19.300> inches<00:05:19.510> thick

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
three inches thick

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.180 
three inches thick
in<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.530> middle<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:22.380> crack-resistant<00:05:23.380> Sakura

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
in the middle the crack-resistant Sakura

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.150 
in the middle the crack-resistant Sakura
that<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.460> used<00:05:25.229> you<00:05:26.229> need<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.560> minimum<00:05:26.950> of<00:05:27.100> two

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
that I used you need a minimum of two

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.280 
that I used you need a minimum of two
inches<00:05:27.580> stick<00:05:27.850> for<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.780> optimal

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
inches stick for it to the optimal

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.050 
inches stick for it to the optimal
strength<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:30.400> it's<00:05:30.520> about<00:05:30.669> two<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:30.970> a<00:05:31.030> half

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
strength so it's about two and a half

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.150 
strength so it's about two and a half
inches<00:05:31.510> thick<00:05:31.540> in<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.930> middle<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.500> about

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
inches thick in the middle and about

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.640 
inches thick in the middle and about
probably<00:05:33.550> about<00:05:33.970> three<00:05:34.450> inches<00:05:34.780> through<00:05:35.470> the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
probably about three inches through the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.390 
probably about three inches through the
through<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.520> body<00:05:36.760> of<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:38.590> we'll<00:05:38.979> see<00:05:39.250> how

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
through the body of it and we'll see how

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.980 
through the body of it and we'll see how
everything<00:05:39.610> shapes<00:05:40.090> up<00:05:40.270> when<00:05:40.419> I<00:05:40.450> take<00:05:40.660> off<00:05:40.840> the

everything shapes up when I take off the

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.430 
everything shapes up when I take off the
forms<00:05:42.419> okay<00:05:43.419> so<00:05:43.479> here<00:05:43.840> we<00:05:43.930> go<00:05:44.050> we<00:05:44.169> got<00:05:44.200> the

thin<00:06:02.700> in<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:03.600> middle<00:06:03.960> so<00:06:04.680> when<00:06:04.950> I<00:06:04.980> when<00:06:05.430> I<00:06:05.460> did

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
thin in the middle so when I when I did

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.050 
thin in the middle so when I when I did
this<00:06:06.030> when<00:06:06.300> I<00:06:06.360> when<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:07.460> leave<00:06:08.460> it<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:08.700> up<00:06:08.820> to<00:06:08.940> put

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
this when I when I leave it it up to put

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.460 
this when I when I leave it it up to put
it<00:06:09.090> on<00:06:09.240> top<00:06:09.390> of<00:06:09.420> the<00:06:09.570> 2x4<00:06:09.990> is<00:06:10.080> it<00:06:10.170> immediately

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
it on top of the 2x4 is it immediately

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.130 
it on top of the 2x4 is it immediately
crack<00:06:10.830> in<00:06:11.040> half<00:06:11.220> so<00:06:12.090> far<00:06:12.120> this<00:06:12.540> is<00:06:12.600> successful

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
crack in half so far this is successful

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.340 
crack in half so far this is successful
I<00:06:13.560> also<00:06:14.430> reinforced<00:06:15.150> it<00:06:15.360> at<00:06:15.840> about<00:06:16.080> halfway

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
I also reinforced it at about halfway

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.490 
I also reinforced it at about halfway
point<00:06:16.980> thickness<00:06:17.430> wise<00:06:18.200> reinforced<00:06:19.200> it<00:06:19.350> with

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
point thickness wise reinforced it with

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.830 
point thickness wise reinforced it with
some<00:06:19.680> quarter<00:06:20.280> inch<00:06:20.430> galvanized<00:06:20.940> rabbit<00:06:21.750> in

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
some quarter inch galvanized rabbit in

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
some quarter inch galvanized rabbit in
it<00:06:21.960> rabbit<00:06:22.830> masher<00:06:23.520> rabbit<00:06:23.910> netting<00:06:24.500> so<00:06:25.500> it

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
it rabbit masher rabbit netting so it

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.710 
it rabbit masher rabbit netting so it
should<00:06:26.520> should<00:06:26.970> hold<00:06:27.180> up<00:06:27.300> pretty<00:06:27.480> good

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
should should hold up pretty good

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.410 
should should hold up pretty good
so<00:06:27.930> next<00:06:28.230> step<00:06:28.410> is<00:06:28.710> we're<00:06:28.920> going<00:06:29.100> to<00:06:29.300> I'm<00:06:30.300> going
