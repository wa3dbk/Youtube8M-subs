sounds that you want to be a little
spatially<00:04:54.560> interesting<00:04:55.129> so<00:04:56.259> that<00:04:57.259> as<00:04:57.530> I

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
spatially interesting so that as I

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.430 
spatially interesting so that as I
mentioned<00:04:58.189> is<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.849> configuration<00:04:59.690> here<00:05:00.289> the

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
mentioned is the configuration here the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.770 
mentioned is the configuration here the
difference<00:05:00.740> with<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:00.979> st<00:05:01.569> everything<00:05:02.569> comes

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
difference with the st everything comes

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.629 
difference with the st everything comes
equipped<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.169> same<00:05:03.379> way<00:05:03.530> on<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.740> st<00:05:04.129> only<00:05:04.550> it

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
equipped the same way on the st only it

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.640 
equipped the same way on the st only it
uses<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:04.969> tune-o-matic<00:05:05.330> bridge<00:05:05.379> with<00:05:06.379> a<00:05:06.409> really

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
uses a tune-o-matic bridge with a really

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.580 
uses a tune-o-matic bridge with a really
nicely<00:05:06.860> styled<00:05:07.629> string<00:05:08.629> through<00:05:08.900> design<00:05:09.259> so

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
nicely styled string through design so

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.959 
nicely styled string through design so
it<00:05:09.680> gives<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:09.979> good<00:05:10.190> fixed<00:05:10.699> bridge

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
it gives you a good fixed bridge

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.480 
it gives you a good fixed bridge
alternative<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:12.770> let's<00:05:12.949> talk<00:05:13.129> about<00:05:13.190> the

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
alternative so let's talk about the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.420 
alternative so let's talk about the
