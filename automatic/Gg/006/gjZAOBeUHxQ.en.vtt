00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 People do not care if they 're experimenting 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.140
 Chemistry lab or at home while grilling 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.630
 Fire can be out of control fast 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.759
 do not get the whole school with it 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.259
 or your house burns down at home 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.420
 We now look at what possibilities 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:24.630
 There is a fire to extinguish 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:26.760
 let 's go on a fire can burn 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.420
 There must be three different things 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.090
 his 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.239
 on the one hand a combustible substance so if 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.469
 you then make a campfire wood, for example 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.780
 it must still be warm 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.399
 without heat you do not get that and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.239
 The last thing is enough oxygen 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.829
 give 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.290
 without it, the burning can not 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.840
 continue to run and around the fire now 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.379
 you have to stop one or more 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.270
 take away the three factors 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.260
 For example, the combustible material the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.210
 withdraw before 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.430
 So no more wood on the campfire 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.530
 put or with a Bunsenbrenner the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.579
 Turn off the gas 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.559
 Of course you can but a company 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.930
 if that does not work you can escape that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.790
 fire heat that succeeds, for example 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.159
 by putting water on a fire 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 the water pours and the water pours 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.830
 this necessary heat it takes the fire 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.630
 The last method would be that simple 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.009
 fire to suffocate him so the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.170
 to take oxygen away 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.509
 that you'll see if you can 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.930
 tealight with a glass covering without 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.369
 Oxygen comes out after a short time 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 but which means do you actually have? 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.619
 specifically to delete the available 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.110
 simplest and suitable for many cases 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.700
 medium is water which has mostly 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.880
 fast to hand and it is also suitable 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.560
 great to clear a campfire 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.049
 Fire extinguishers are also an option in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.700
 they are definitely in the schools and the schools 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.280
 maybe you own a home here too 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.680
 in which can now be water powder 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.990
 foam or non-flammable gases 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.079
 as co2 be in it 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.630
 what exactly are you seeing on the holes in 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.670
 The schools often have sand of it 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.780
 not to play there but also with it 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.970
 can be deleted 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.649
 and if a classmate in flames 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.840
 There are also still hiding there 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.459
 the one developed by the then 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.039
 again no oxygen comes to the fire 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.900
 and it's all in there 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.080
 There are many different ways 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.700
 You can delete a fire with care 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.980
 but you have to be especially in chemistry 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.680
 but also in the kitchen with more special 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.470
 Fires are the first thing we look at 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.500
 here the fat burn so if a pan 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.720
 full fat on the stove burns the first 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.090
 Reaction would erase him with water 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.319
 but that's the worst thing 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.930
 you can do 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.360
 the water evaporates abruptly and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.940
 travels fed with the flies in the room 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.590
 around and burned even more 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.569
 There is such a fire to extinguish 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.880
 Special fire extinguishers on the field 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.590
 a layer make up this layer 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.900
 prevents the fed on with 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.360
 oxygen reacts and stifles it 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.100
 so if you are not in the house 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.049
 you can try one carefully 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.790
 put the lid on the pot also here 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.910
 No more oxygen can make you fat 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.799
 reach and the fire goes out even with 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.209
 metal fires in school you have to 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.489
 be very careful 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.829
 the first reflex water on top of it 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.720
 would be synonymous here a mistake in hot 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.549
 Metal would burn the water in 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.690
 its elements hydrogen and 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.850
 to replace oxygen 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.140
 but then they are the worst case scenario 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.230
 a mix that to one 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.650
 explosive gas explosion therefore leads here 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.049
 no water also use a co2 holes 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.180
 would be bad here many metals burn 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.620
 also with carbon dioxide so to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.049
 example magnesium 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.630
 That's why metal fires either 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.970
 special extinguishing powder or a lot 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.280
 sand uses both trend that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.370
 burning material from oxygen and there 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.410
 thus the fire is therefore one of the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.239
 three factors from the combustion triangle 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.780
 Must be removed to the fire 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.180
 Clear 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.970
 and may burn in fat and metal 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.200
 just no water and no co2 laundry 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.610
 be used 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.440
 if you have the reaction of one 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.569
 burning metal with carbon dioxide 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.930
 interested then watch the video 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.220
 here on magnesium burns in 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.599
 carbon dioxide environment you write 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.879
 in the comments if you ever have one 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.160
 have deleted fire and what that 1 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.480
 was otherwise lassnigs other skin pure 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.480
 until the next video and ciao
