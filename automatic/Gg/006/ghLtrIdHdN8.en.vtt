00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
after nothing too exciting so I don't

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.139 
after nothing too exciting so I don't
always<00:01:28.109> shoot<00:01:28.289> I'm<00:01:28.439> showing<00:01:28.679> you<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.799> but

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
always shoot I'm showing you that but

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.580 
always shoot I'm showing you that but
now<00:01:30.149> what's<00:01:30.509> cool<00:01:30.719> about<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.049> technology

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
now what's cool about this technology

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.260 
now what's cool about this technology
though<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:32.009> were<00:01:32.130> select<00:01:32.549> DVDs<00:01:32.999> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
though there were select DVDs and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
though there were select DVDs and
essentially<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.229> were<00:01:34.259> hoping<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.619> more

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
essentially they were hoping that more

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.349 
essentially they were hoping that more
TVs<00:01:35.039> would<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.249> released<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.179> had<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
TVs would be released but you had a

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.539 
TVs would be released but you had a
really<00:01:36.570> cool<00:01:36.810> zoomin<00:01:37.229> feature<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.859> when<00:01:38.429> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
really cool zoomin feature and when it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.889 
really cool zoomin feature and when it
fast-forward<00:01:39.149> it<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.390> really<00:01:39.600> smooth

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
fast-forward it was really smooth

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.450 
fast-forward it was really smooth
transition<00:01:40.049> fast-forward<00:01:40.920> which<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.219> cool

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
transition fast-forward which is cool

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.149 
transition fast-forward which is cool
but<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> did<00:01:42.390> double<00:01:42.719> as<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.929> gaming<00:01:43.259> system<00:01:43.530> now

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
but it did double as a gaming system now

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.580 
but it did double as a gaming system now
this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> pretty<00:01:44.850> rare<00:01:45.149> system<00:01:45.569> I'd<00:01:46.109> say<00:01:46.409> on

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this is a pretty rare system I'd say on

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.809 
this is a pretty rare system I'd say on
the<00:01:46.619> market<00:01:47.039> right<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.310> these<00:01:47.579> systems

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
the market right now these systems

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.630 
the market right now these systems
selling<00:01:48.329> worth<00:01:48.450> $400<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.170> plus<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.799> everyone

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
selling worth $400 or plus so everyone

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.919 
selling worth $400 or plus so everyone
smile<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> don't<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.329> who<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.689> if

better<00:01:57.539> deal<00:01:57.749> than<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.350> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
better deal than that but that that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.039 
better deal than that but that that

and it's just kind of a strategy game

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.490 
and it's just kind of a strategy game
which<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:42.880> fun<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:43.960> this<00:02:44.230> one<00:02:44.470> right

now<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.460> kind<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.730> interesting

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
now this is kind of interesting

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.030 
now this is kind of interesting
I<00:03:01.300> bought<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.080> system<00:03:02.260> wall<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.620> go<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:02.950> I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
I bought the system wall I go and I

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.470 
I bought the system wall I go and I
didn't<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.340> control<00:03:03.460> for<00:03:03.940> because<00:03:04.120> there<00:03:04.330> is

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
didn't have control for because there is

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.030 
didn't have control for because there is
there<00:03:04.780> are<00:03:04.870> aftermarket<00:03:05.230> controllers<00:03:05.920> can

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
there are aftermarket controllers can

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.240 
there are aftermarket controllers can
get<00:03:06.220> for<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.490> as<00:03:06.580> well<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:08.320> have<00:03:08.560> added

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
get for it as well but I do have added

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.370 
get for it as well but I do have added
buy<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> remote<00:03:10.150> for<00:03:10.450> two<00:03:10.570> this<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.870> Samsung

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
buy a remote for two this is a Samsung

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.410 
buy a remote for two this is a Samsung
remote<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.610> will<00:03:12.730> work<00:03:12.760> but<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.360> is

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
remote so it will work but this is

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.460 
remote so it will work but this is
interesting<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.050> just<00:03:14.170> kind<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.350> a

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
interesting it's just kind of a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.430 
interesting it's just kind of a
different<00:03:14.620> company<00:03:15.310> makes<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:16.170> also<00:03:17.170> this

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
different company makes that also this

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.290 
different company makes that also this
is<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> Samsung<00:03:18.130> controller<00:03:18.850> but<00:03:19.000> essentially

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
is a Samsung controller but essentially

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.180 
is a Samsung controller but essentially
you<00:03:19.600> know<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.720> Toshiba<00:03:20.680> controller<00:03:20.950> looks

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
you know the Toshiba controller looks

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.949 
you know the Toshiba controller looks
exactly<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.700> same<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.270> controller<00:03:22.720> reminds

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
exactly the same this controller reminds

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.010 
exactly the same this controller reminds
me<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> lot<00:03:23.500> like<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:25.239> Pippin<00:03:25.600> controller<00:03:25.989> I

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
me a lot like the Pippin controller I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.590 
me a lot like the Pippin controller I
know<00:03:26.080> if<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.230> saw<00:03:26.380> my<00:03:26.560> review<00:03:27.070> of<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:28.180> ban

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
know if you saw my review of the ban

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.690 
know if you saw my review of the ban
Apple<00:03:28.900> Pippin<00:03:29.080> controller<00:03:29.500> but<00:03:30.310> essentially

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
Apple Pippin controller but essentially

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.820 
Apple Pippin controller but essentially
it<00:03:30.850> kind<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.150> feels<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.390> same<00:03:31.590> I'll<00:03:32.590> tell<00:03:32.770> you

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
it kind of feels the same I'll tell you

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.810 
it kind of feels the same I'll tell you
that<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.130> controller<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.489> probably<00:03:33.730> the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
that the controller is probably the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.330 
that the controller is probably the
worst<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.720> weakness<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.380> system<00:03:35.709> for

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
worst the the weakness of the system for

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.010 
worst the the weakness of the system for
a<00:03:36.370> cheap<00:03:36.640> buttons<00:03:37.030> you've<00:03:37.330> got<00:03:37.450> your<00:03:37.600> BA

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
a cheap buttons you've got your BA

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.210 
a cheap buttons you've got your BA
buttons<00:03:38.440> here<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.739> then<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:38.980> get<00:03:39.070> these

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
buttons here and then you get these

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.440 
buttons here and then you get these
these<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.700> unmarked<00:03:40.060> buttons<00:03:40.300> right<00:03:40.390> here

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
these and unmarked buttons right here

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.630 
these and unmarked buttons right here
and<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.680> your<00:03:41.769> N<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.519> your

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
and this is your N and this is your

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.190 
and this is your N and this is your
start<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.000> this<00:03:43.120> kind<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.360> console<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.900> your

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
start so this kind of a console and your

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.720 
start so this kind of a console and your
bumper<00:03:44.470> buttons<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.400> right<00:03:45.489> here<00:03:45.550> the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
bumper buttons but this right here the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.920 
bumper buttons but this right here the
directional<00:03:46.000> pad<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.989> feels<00:03:47.260> very<00:03:47.830> very

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
directional pad it feels very very

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.130 
directional pad it feels very very
flimsy

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
flimsy

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.400 
flimsy
and<00:03:50.410> just<00:03:50.739> non<00:03:50.920> responsive<00:03:51.640> at<00:03:51.910> all<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.600> but

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
and just non responsive at all so but

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.949 
and just non responsive at all so but
let's<00:03:53.560> take<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.739> closer<00:03:53.950> look<00:03:54.100> at<00:03:54.510> tempest<00:03:55.510> 3000

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
let's take a closer look at tempest 3000

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.300 
let's take a closer look at tempest 3000
I<00:03:56.019> think<00:03:56.200> guys<00:03:56.290> will<00:03:56.470> really<00:03:56.769> get<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:56.980> kick<00:03:57.190> out

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
I think guys will really get a kick out

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.309 
I think guys will really get a kick out
of<00:03:57.340> this<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.880> thanks<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:58.930> watching

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
of this and thanks for watching

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.970 
of this and thanks for watching
so<00:04:01.250> here's<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.579> closer<00:04:01.819> look<00:04:02.090> at<00:04:02.360> tempest<00:04:03.110> 3000

so here's a closer look at tempest 3000
you<00:04:04.340> want<00:04:04.989> probably<00:04:05.989> one<00:04:06.200> of<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.319> best<00:04:06.439> course

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
you want probably one of the best course

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.679 
you want probably one of the best course
