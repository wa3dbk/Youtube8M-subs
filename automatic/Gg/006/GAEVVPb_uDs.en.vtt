00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
through the 10 obviously keeps those

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.429 
through the 10 obviously keeps those
bugs<00:01:59.430> outside<00:01:59.899> we've<00:02:00.899> also<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> clever

bugs outside we've also got a clever

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929 
bugs outside we've also got a clever
little<00:02:01.530> zip<00:02:01.799> section<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.520> well<00:02:02.729> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
little zip section on here as well so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
little zip section on here as well so
you<00:02:03.060> pull<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> zips<00:02:04.079> down<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:04.409> meet<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
you pull the zips down they meet in the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.990 
you pull the zips down they meet in the
middle<00:02:04.829> at<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.130> bottom<00:02:05.520> which<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.790> don't

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
middle at the bottom which you don't

tend<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.540> some<00:02:06.689> other<00:02:06.840> tents<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.409> you

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
tend to get on some other tents so you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.660 
tend to get on some other tents so you
always<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.979> where<00:02:08.099> those<00:02:08.190> zippers<00:02:08.520> are

the external fly sheets is it really

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.440 
the external fly sheets is it really
going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.370> maximize<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.000> amount<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.239> air

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450

the mesh panel at the back and also the
mesh<00:03:14.250> panels<00:03:14.549> we<00:03:14.639> have<00:03:14.819> on<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.030> doors<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.989> get

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
mesh panels we have on the doors you get

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.020 
mesh panels we have on the doors you get
a<00:03:16.200> nice<00:03:16.470> amount<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.859> air<00:03:17.010> circulating<00:03:17.730> through

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
a nice amount of air circulating through

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.460 
a nice amount of air circulating through
so<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.329> be<00:03:18.449> really<00:03:18.690> nice<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.049> comfortable

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
and it's also going to cut down on any

and it's also going to cut down on any
condensation<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.480> light<00:03:21.599> want<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.900> build<00:03:22.079> up

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
condensation and light want to build up

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.039 
condensation and light want to build up
inside<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.650> pod<00:03:22.799> itself

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
people as we said before these are

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.339 
people as we said before these are
actually<00:03:29.750> independent<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.840> each<00:03:30.959> other<00:03:31.169> with

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
actually independent to each other with

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.569 
actually independent to each other with
the<00:03:31.440> separator<00:03:31.889> in<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.190> middle

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
the separator in the middle

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.610

however<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.239> can<00:03:33.510> come<00:03:33.720> completely<00:03:34.230> out<00:03:34.410> if

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
however this can come completely out if

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.289 
however this can come completely out if
you<00:03:34.709> decide<00:03:35.010> not<00:03:35.129> to<00:03:35.190> use<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.669> so<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.239> have

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
you decide not to use it so you can have

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.580 
you decide not to use it so you can have
one<00:03:36.540> large<00:03:36.930> living<00:03:37.560> space<00:03:37.590> if<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.069> require

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
one large living space if you require

this<00:03:42.329> just<00:03:42.480> cuts<00:03:42.750> down<00:03:42.840> any<00:03:43.109> light<00:03:43.349> that<00:03:43.500> might

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
this just cuts down any light that might

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.780 
this just cuts down any light that might
want<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.799> try<00:03:43.949> and<00:03:44.040> get<00:03:44.160> inside<00:03:44.489> when<00:03:44.699> you're
