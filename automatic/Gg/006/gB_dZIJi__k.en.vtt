good<00:00:33.050> little<00:00:33.380> midge<00:00:33.530> pattern<00:00:34.010> I've<00:00:34.850> fished<00:00:35.150> it

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
good little midge pattern I've fished it

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.890 
good little midge pattern I've fished it
fished<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:36.950> dead<00:00:37.670> drifting<00:00:38.150> it<00:00:38.330> under<00:00:38.780> an

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
fished it dead drifting it under an

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.580 
fished it dead drifting it under an
indicator<00:00:39.380> I've<00:00:40.160> used<00:00:40.700> it<00:00:41.210> as<00:00:41.330> a<00:00:41.360> trailing<00:00:42.200> fly

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
indicator I've used it as a trailing fly

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.390 
indicator I've used it as a trailing fly
behind<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.160> streamer<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:43.850> done<00:00:44.600> pretty<00:00:44.840> well

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
behind a streamer and done pretty well

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.030 
behind a streamer and done pretty well
and<00:00:46.400> I've<00:00:46.580> also<00:00:46.700> fished<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:47.270> in<00:00:47.390> lakes<00:00:47.660> as<00:00:48.559> a

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
and I've also fished it in lakes as a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.580 
and I've also fished it in lakes as a
type<00:00:49.610> of<00:00:49.640> carotenoid<00:00:50.059> pattern<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.020> have<00:00:51.379> done

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
type of carotenoid pattern and have done

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.960 
type of carotenoid pattern and have done
pretty<00:00:51.800> well<00:00:51.890> there<00:00:52.190> too<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:52.670> pretty

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
pretty well there too so pretty

Universal fly really simple to really
simple<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.090> tie<00:00:57.190> I'm<00:00:58.190> tying<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:58.670> one<00:00:58.879> this<00:00:59.030> is

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
simple to tie I'm tying this one this is

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.880 
simple to tie I'm tying this one this is
about<00:00:59.269> as<00:00:59.420> big<00:00:59.720> as<00:00:59.870> I<00:00:59.989> would<00:01:00.140> probably<00:01:00.320> tie<00:01:00.830> it

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
about as big as I would probably tie it

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.610 
about as big as I would probably tie it
and<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:01.220> is<00:01:01.339> on<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.489> size<00:01:01.760> 16<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.659> definitely

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
and this is on a size 16 I definitely

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.500 
and this is on a size 16 I definitely
wouldn't<00:01:04.040> go<00:01:04.159> any<00:01:04.339> bigger<00:01:04.460> than<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.730> size<00:01:04.879> 16

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
wouldn't go any bigger than the size 16

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.680 
wouldn't go any bigger than the size 16
and<00:01:05.810> I've<00:01:06.470> got<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.740> I've<00:01:06.950> got<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.760> black<00:01:08.090> bead<00:01:08.450> on

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
and I've got a I've got a black bead on

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.040 
and I've got a I've got a black bead on
it<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:09.020> can<00:01:09.110> also<00:01:09.260> use<00:01:09.970> silver<00:01:10.970> bead<00:01:11.180> gold

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
it you can also use silver bead gold

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.500 
it you can also use silver bead gold
bead<00:01:12.550> whatever<00:01:13.550> or<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:13.909> can<00:01:14.030> also<00:01:14.150> tie<00:01:14.390> it

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
bead whatever or you can also tie it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.600 
bead whatever or you can also tie it
without<00:01:14.720> beat<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.229> like<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:15.950> B<00:01:16.130> because<00:01:16.490> it

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
without beat I like the B because it

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.350 
without beat I like the B because it
gives<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:17.000> little<00:01:17.180> bit<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.479> weight<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:19.360> I'm

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
gives it a little bit of weight and I'm

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.800 
gives it a little bit of weight and I'm
also<00:01:20.540> going<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.870> add<00:01:21.760> just<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.880> few<00:01:23.180> wraps<00:01:23.450> a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
also going to add just a few wraps a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.880 
also going to add just a few wraps a
lead<00:01:24.140> wire<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:24.979> make<00:01:25.130> this<00:01:25.340> fly<00:01:26.290> even<00:01:27.290> heavier

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
lead wire to make this fly even heavier

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.980 
lead wire to make this fly even heavier
than<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.159> is<00:01:28.370> right<00:01:28.400> now<00:01:32.200> not<00:01:33.200> too<00:01:33.500> many<00:01:33.680> wraps

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
than it is right now not too many wraps

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.550 
than it is right now not too many wraps
I'm<00:01:35.990> just<00:01:36.110> good<00:01:36.410> break<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.490> off<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:38.230> then<00:01:39.230> push

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
I'm just good break it off and then push

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.710 
I'm just good break it off and then push
that<00:01:39.590> push<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.640> wire<00:01:41.800> up<00:01:42.800> underneath<00:01:43.190> and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
that push the wire up underneath and

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.490 
that push the wire up underneath and
this<00:01:44.720> one's<00:01:44.900> going<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.080> be<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.230> black<00:01:45.620> zebra

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
this one's going to be a black zebra

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.450 
this one's going to be a black zebra

one this one will be black so we tie our

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.490 
one this one will be black so we tie our
thread<00:02:04.490> down<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:05.200> really<00:02:06.200> all<00:02:06.320> there<00:02:06.470> is

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
to it is no tie in a rib and for the rib

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.340 
to it is no tie in a rib and for the rib
on<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:11.360> one<00:02:11.569> I'm<00:02:11.690> using<00:02:12.910> silver<00:02:13.910> wire

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.030

that make sure that everything is
covered<00:02:30.040> up<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:32.310> then<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.730> sort<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.290> taper

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
covered up and then just sort of taper

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.680 
the taper the body up you don't want
this<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:42.030> now<00:02:43.030> yes<00:02:43.210> you<00:02:43.390> can<00:02:43.510> vary<00:02:43.870> the
