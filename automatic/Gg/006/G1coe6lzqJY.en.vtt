paint<00:00:19.210> was<00:00:19.330> kind<00:00:19.510> of<00:00:19.539> weird<00:00:19.810> for<00:00:19.990> its<00:00:20.140> time<00:00:20.380> and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
paint was kind of weird for its time and

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.890 
paint was kind of weird for its time and
I<00:00:21.220> don't<00:00:21.279> think<00:00:21.429> everybody<00:00:21.699> knew<00:00:22.060> how<00:00:22.420> popular

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900

I don't think everybody knew how popular
these<00:00:23.050> cars<00:00:23.289> would<00:00:23.410> become<00:00:23.740> later<00:00:23.890> on<00:00:24.160> you

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
these cars would become later on you

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.210 
these cars would become later on you
know<00:00:24.490> they<00:00:25.170> as<00:00:26.170> not<00:00:26.410> many<00:00:26.500> cars<00:00:26.830> are<00:00:26.980> painted

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220

looked at a regular Regal all this
bright<00:00:37.570> work<00:00:37.780> would<00:00:38.050> be<00:00:38.170> exactly<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.830> and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
bright work would be exactly that and

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.090 
bright work would be exactly that and
here<00:00:39.580> they've<00:00:39.790> powder-coated<00:00:40.980> everything<00:00:41.980> on

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
here they've powder-coated everything on

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.440 
here they've powder-coated everything on
here<00:00:42.310> and<00:00:42.400> it's<00:00:42.520> really<00:00:42.700> held<00:00:42.970> up<00:00:43.090> nicely

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
here and it's really held up nicely

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.720 
here and it's really held up nicely
this<00:00:43.990> particular<00:00:44.320> car<00:00:44.680> here<00:00:45.040> has<00:00:45.490> had

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
this particular car here has had

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.550 
this particular car here has had
virtually<00:00:45.910> every<00:00:46.540> single<00:00:46.900> thing<00:00:47.080> done<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.440> it

virtually every single thing done to it
all<00:00:48.310> over<00:00:48.730> again<00:00:48.760> so<00:00:49.330> when<00:00:49.840> you<00:00:49.930> talk<00:00:50.080> about

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
all over again so when you talk about

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.570 
all over again so when you talk about
sleepers<00:00:50.770> and<00:00:50.950> things<00:00:51.130> like<00:00:51.250> that<00:00:51.430> most

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
sleepers and things like that most

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.710 
sleepers and things like that most
people<00:00:51.820> know<00:00:51.910> that<00:00:52.000> things<00:00:52.180> are<00:00:52.300> pretty<00:00:52.450> fast

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
people know that things are pretty fast

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.450 
people know that things are pretty fast
to<00:00:52.870> begin<00:00:53.140> with<00:00:53.290> this<00:00:53.920> one<00:00:54.100> here<00:00:54.310> is

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
to begin with this one here is

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.730 
to begin with this one here is
especially<00:00:54.670> fast<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.290> walk<00:00:56.440> around<00:00:56.560> the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
especially fast and to walk around the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.830 
especially fast and to walk around the
car<00:00:56.890> there's<00:00:57.490> not<00:00:57.670> really<00:00:57.850> any<00:00:58.090> modifications

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
car there's not really any modifications

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.480 
car there's not really any modifications
on<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.020> outside<00:00:59.440> of<00:00:59.560> the<00:00:59.620> car<00:00:59.800> that<00:01:00.280> would<00:01:00.370> let

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
on the outside of the car that would let

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.070 
on the outside of the car that would let
you<00:01:00.610> know<00:01:00.640> other<00:01:00.940> than<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.240> non<00:01:01.420> stock<00:01:01.780> wheels

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
you know other than the non stock wheels

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.600 
you know other than the non stock wheels
and<00:01:02.410> I<00:01:02.440> think<00:01:02.650> a<00:01:02.710> stock<00:01:02.950> set<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.220> wheeled<00:01:03.430> on

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
and I think a stock set a wheeled on

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.279 
and I think a stock set a wheeled on
here<00:01:03.820> would<00:01:04.330> look<00:01:04.449> really<00:01:04.600> cool<00:01:04.839> too<00:01:04.899> if<00:01:05.199> you

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
here would look really cool too if you

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.810 
here would look really cool too if you
don't<00:01:05.379> let<00:01:05.590> these<00:01:05.799> so<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.280> can<00:01:06.399> go<00:01:06.490> either<00:01:06.670> way

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
don't let these so you can go either way

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.270 
don't let these so you can go either way
with<00:01:06.939> this<00:01:07.179> car<00:01:07.390> stock<00:01:07.929> set<00:01:08.170> of<00:01:08.259> wheels<00:01:08.439> or
