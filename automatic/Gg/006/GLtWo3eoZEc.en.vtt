00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.050 

you<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.960> also<00:02:40.080> mix<00:02:40.350> us<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.650> by<00:02:40.800> hand<00:02:41.100> which<00:02:41.910> I'm

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
you can also mix us in by hand which I'm

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.580 
you can also mix us in by hand which I'm
gonna<00:02:42.180> probably<00:02:42.480> do<00:02:42.810> towards<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> end<00:02:43.410> just

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
gonna probably do towards the end just

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.050

cuz<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.860> dough<00:02:44.040> gets<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:44.460> bit<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.730> bit

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
cuz the dough gets a little bit of bit

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.360 
cuz the dough gets a little bit of bit
stiff<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.710> it<00:02:46.860> okay<00:02:47.100> that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
you've got look something like this in

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.400 
you've got look something like this in
the<00:02:53.130> finished<00:02:53.430> product<00:02:53.850> okay<00:02:54.150> okay<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.230> what

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
the finished product okay okay and what

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.780 
the finished product okay okay and what
we're<00:02:55.500> gonna<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.740> next<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.070> actually<00:02:56.340> shape<00:02:56.580> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
we're gonna do next is actually shape it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.280 
we're gonna do next is actually shape it
we<00:02:56.910> do<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.360> two-step<00:02:57.750> process<00:02:57.780> will

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
we do this in a two-step process will

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.620 
we do this in a two-step process will
shape<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.770> partially<00:02:59.220> bake<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.730> then<00:03:00.480> we'll

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
shape and partially bake and then we'll

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.420 
shape and partially bake and then we'll
come<00:03:00.810> take<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> cookies<00:03:01.590> out<00:03:01.740> fill<00:03:02.100> them<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
come take the cookies out fill them and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.020 
come take the cookies out fill them and
bake<00:03:02.550> them<00:03:02.580> once<00:03:02.910> again<00:03:03.240> all<00:03:03.510> right<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:06.000> i

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
bake them once again all right so i

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.370 
bake them once again all right so i
think<00:03:06.120> i'll<00:03:06.300> move<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.450> over<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.230> we'll

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
think i'll move this over here and we'll

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.260 
think i'll move this over here and we'll
do<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> shaping<00:03:07.830> right<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.820> top<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.180> this

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
do the shaping right on top of this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.840 
do the shaping right on top of this
station<00:03:09.810> sure<00:03:10.290> sure<00:03:10.800> i'd<00:03:11.340> like<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.550> use<00:03:11.820> a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
station sure sure i'd like to use a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.700 
station sure sure i'd like to use a
scoop<00:03:12.150> for<00:03:12.180> shaping<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.260> I'm<00:03:13.410> gonna<00:03:13.530> let<00:03:13.680> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
I'll continue to through the process

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.900

of<00:03:24.000> egg<00:03:24.120> whites<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.900> isn't<00:03:25.290> essential<00:03:25.980> but

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
of egg whites this isn't essential but

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.100 
of egg whites this isn't essential but
it<00:03:26.370> does<00:03:26.610> help<00:03:26.880> keep<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.300> nuts<00:03:27.480> stuck<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
it does help keep the nuts stuck to the
