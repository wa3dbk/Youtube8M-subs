 the cross the law of god was abolished 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.580
 it will be that the prophet daniel is referring to Jesus Christ 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.860

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.980
 to Jesus Christ 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.000

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:20.919
 commandments of God 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.699
 what are the ten commandments 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.560
 and now 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.239

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.870
 the ten Commandments 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.510
 then there will be his bible the exodus 20 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.770
 and the first commandment is verse 3 what it says 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.059
 You can not have others gods in front of me 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.960
 the second commandment is verses 4 5 and 6 and it says 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.710
 you will notice image or any resemblance of what is above in heaven or below 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.679
 on earth 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.190
 nor in the waters below the earth 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.350
 you will not bow to them nor are they rare because I am jehovah your god 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.210

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.789

 James mercy villares to those who love me and fourth my commandments this is 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.350

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.960
 you will not take the name of jehovah your god in vain because he will not take innocent 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.390
 jehovah to take is a name in vain 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.120
 then we have the fourth commandment that is in verse 8 from 8 to 11 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.980
 what does it say 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.909

 which is inside your doors 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.390
 because in six days he did jehovah to the heavens and the earth the sea and all the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 things that in them a and I rest on the seventh day 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.360
 therefore geo padem said the Sabbath and the anti 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.910
 this is the fourth commandment now let's go for the fifth commandment 'verse 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.030
 2 0 honor your father and your mother so that your aunts can reach out on the earth 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.779

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:17.879

 7th verse 14 you will not commit adultery 8th verse 15 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.789
 nour taras 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.620
 9th verse 16 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.160
 you shall not speak against your neighbor false witness and tenth commandment and 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.579
 last verse 17 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.200
 you will not covet your neighbor's house 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.540
 you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his servant nor his maid in and his power 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.540
 and not his ass or anything of your neighbor 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.669
 we read the ten commandments 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.909
 the prophet daniel says that someone would say to change this holy law 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.220
 and I would go to change these commandments 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.970
 you know that this here was written by god's finger twice 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.499
 Now the question is 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.569
 who is the one who would change the ten commandments for many evangelicals 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.219
 for many Christian people in today's days Jesus supported the law and as 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.919
 I was saying and now I ask will be that he changed the law 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.499
 I'm going to ask that to Jesus 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.579
 I believe that Jesus is here by my side and I believe that Jesus is there by his side 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.199
 as well 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.910
 because Jesus said when two people or three were gathered in my name 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.760
 I would be there in the middle of them and we are here in the name of 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.349
 Jesus is not true then Jesus is here 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.289
 says he is here please 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.149
 dn permission that I will talk to him then you will accompany me here 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.519
 that I want to imagine Jesus to whom Jesus is here by my side 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.309
 I can believe that is not true 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.209
 Then I will look at Jesus 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.769
 and can converse with him 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.249
 Dear Jesus 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:49.120
 it's a great joy to be here with you 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.319
 and know that he had god are here with us people out there say that 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.319
 you gentleman fabulist the law when you died on the cross 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.829
 I would like to ask you, Mr. 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.689
 when you died the cross kabul and this the law 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.459
 you finished with the feet commandments 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.439
 that's what happened 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.439
 please have your answers 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.999
 thank you 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.640
 Jesus already answered me 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.330
 and the answer from him I will say will be you be here in the gospel of san 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.970
 Matthew in chapter 5 and verse 17 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.930
 the answer that jesus means now 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.930
 to say whether or not to support the law 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.410
 here it is 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.410
 Matthew 5 17 Jesus' answer 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.759
 do not think that I have come to abrogate the law by the prophets 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.349
 I have not had to approve but to fulfill 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.509
 understood my friend 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.059
 understood my friend 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:50.830
 here is clearly saying jesus saying 'no no no no no think 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.889
 do not even think that I came to abolish the law and the prophets 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.729
 I did not come to abolish the law I came to fulfill 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.740
 so when Daniel says someone is going to change the law Jesus says it's not me 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.460
 I did not come to do that 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.610
 Well yes it was Jesus then who also already the law of God 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.259
 who knows if the father not who knows if the father of jesus god creator 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.319
 I will continue to change the ten commandments 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.020
 it will be that God changed the ten commandments 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.509
 Jesus already said I'm not 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.089
 then I would like to know about god now I believe that god is here 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.020
 as well 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.939
 because our god is always with us 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.319
 and now I would like to address God 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.580
 imagining by my faith that god is here by my side and god is there 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.909
 also by his side 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.849
 Looking at God I would like to converse with him 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.129
 Dear God 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.979

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.469
 thank you 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.169
 God already answered me 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.949
 and I'm going to give you God's answer, this one, who's coming from Malaysia? 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.110
 chapter 3 verses 6 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.250
 take bible 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.150
 ask the father's answer 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.389
 of God the father is written 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.819
 because I jehovah did not change 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.749
 this is why Jacob's sons have not been consumed 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.999
 understood my friend 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:36.659
 understood well gone god answering me and you did not 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.960
 I the Lord did not change 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.469
 thank God that he does not change 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:46.360
 because if he will change if God said something today and another tomorrow if God 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.650
 give a read and change tomorrow I ask is trustworthy 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.450
 if he does that he is not trustworthy but the word of God affirms because I 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:01.870
 urged opa not changed thank God praised be the name of the Lord because no 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.539
 changes 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:08.559
 nor jesus change nor god changed neither the holy spirit change nor the bible 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:09.749
 change 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:11.099
 without dani change 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.219
 how to understand what the prophet Daniel says in chapter 7 verse 25 

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:19.439
 When someone says they are going to utter words against the tall one, someone goes 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.949
 to hurt the most holy if someone is going to change the times and the law 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.330
 nothing very well then now let's understand if you take the catechism 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.249
 Roman 

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:35.839
 the Roman catechism and that one person I was catechists five years 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.949
 catechist five years I went
