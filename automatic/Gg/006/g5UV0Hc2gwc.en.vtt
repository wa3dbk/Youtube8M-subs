00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
huge as I said ascension has nine doors

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.990 
huge as I said ascension has nine doors
and<00:02:25.549> this<00:02:25.849> map<00:02:26.120> has<00:02:26.329> 17<00:02:27.200> doors<00:02:27.709> called<00:02:28.670> death

and<00:02:42.280> caves<00:02:42.820> in<00:02:43.420> my<00:02:43.780> opinion<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
and caves in my opinion this is the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.120 
and caves in my opinion this is the
worst<00:02:45.310> map<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.030> four<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.540> think<00:02:47.410> shangri-la

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
worst map of the four I think shangri-la

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.280 
worst map of the four I think shangri-la
is<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> very<00:02:48.670> cool<00:02:48.910> map<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:49.450> it's<00:02:49.630> too<00:02:49.930> small

this<00:03:50.810> map<00:03:51.080> this<00:03:51.710> map<00:03:51.920> takes<00:03:52.310> place<00:03:52.550> on<00:03:52.700> the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
this map this map takes place on the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.750 
this map this map takes place on the
moon<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.750> game<00:03:53.990> starts<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.500> area<00:03:54.890> 51<00:03:55.070> where

coolest<00:03:59.480> thing<00:03:59.720> is<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.020> they're<00:04:00.440> sometimes

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
coolest thing is that they're sometimes

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.640 
coolest thing is that they're sometimes
Juggernog<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.300> if<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.600> kill<00:04:02.810> enough<00:04:03.140> zombies

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
Juggernog so if you kill enough zombies

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.110 
Juggernog so if you kill enough zombies
you<00:04:04.250> can<00:04:04.460> buy<00:04:04.610> jerk<00:04:05.120> before<00:04:05.510> round<00:04:06.200> one<00:04:06.830> also<00:04:07.820> a

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
you can buy jerk before round one also a

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.480 
you can buy jerk before round one also a
cool<00:04:08.540> thing<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:08.990> that<00:04:09.020> zombies<00:04:09.680> just<00:04:10.130> keep

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
cool thing is that zombies just keep

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.690 
cool thing is that zombies just keep
spawning<00:04:10.850> until<00:04:11.570> you<00:04:11.690> go<00:04:11.930> away<00:04:12.490> once<00:04:13.490> you'll

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
split it you get on a Kimbo but the fact

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.850 
split it you get on a Kimbo but the fact
is<00:04:26.870> like<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.710> one<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.040> often<00:04:28.390> if<00:04:29.560> it's<00:04:30.560> one

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
is like the one you often if it's one

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.080 
is like the one you often if it's one
gun<00:04:31.130> one<00:04:31.340> big<00:04:31.940> gun<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:32.720> lets<00:04:33.320> explode<00:04:34.310> zombies
