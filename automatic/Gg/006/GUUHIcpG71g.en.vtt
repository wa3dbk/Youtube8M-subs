00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
lines which is these blue lines here and

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
lines which is these blue lines here and
the<00:00:57.629> starting<00:00:58.140> point<00:00:58.440> has<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.340> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the starting point has to be this is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.720 
the starting point has to be this is
very<00:00:59.670> important<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.750> same<00:01:01.079> exact<00:01:01.620> point<00:01:02.129> I'll

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
very important the same exact point I'll

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
very important the same exact point I'll
explain<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.840> deep<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.439> detail

now so my two parallel lives and there

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.260 
now so my two parallel lives and there
it's<00:02:24.920> starting<00:02:25.460> at<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.730> exact<00:02:26.090> same<00:02:26.480> point

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.440 
pocket is going to be that's a garment
and<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:41.450> next<00:02:41.750> step<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.530> slash<00:02:43.340> into<00:02:44.270> this

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
and the next step is to slash into this

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.960 
and the next step is to slash into this
broken<00:02:44.960> line<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:47.090> my<00:02:47.210> weight<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.540> way<00:02:48.970> I'll

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
broken line to my weight this way I'll

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.920 
broken line to my weight this way I'll
pinch<00:02:52.000> my<00:02:53.000> work<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:54.620> put<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.860> little<00:02:55.930> slip

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
pinch my work just put a little slip

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.510 
pinch my work just put a little slip
into<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:59.120> open<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.200> out<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.800> insert<00:03:01.430> my

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
into that then open it out and insert my

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.990 
into that then open it out and insert my
scissors<00:03:04.570> now<00:03:05.570> I'm<00:03:05.660> going<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.020> stop<00:03:07.000> roughly

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
scissors now I'm going to stop roughly

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.890 
scissors now I'm going to stop roughly
about<00:03:08.090> one<00:03:08.450> centimeter<00:03:09.250> from<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:11.090> parallel

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
about one centimeter from the parallel

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.500 
about one centimeter from the parallel
lines<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:12.980> I'm<00:03:13.130> going<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.550> position<00:03:13.880> my

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
lines and then I'm going to position my

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.890 
lines and then I'm going to position my
scissors<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.530> cut<00:03:15.770> diagonally<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.390> stitch

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
scissors to cut diagonally to the stitch

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.210 
scissors to cut diagonally to the stitch
line<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:19.900> then<00:03:20.900> do<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.230> same<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.950> other

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
line and then do the same to the other

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.520 
line and then do the same to the other
parallel<00:03:23.180> line<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.980> create<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.250> little

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
parallel line to create a little

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.630 
parallel line to create a little
triangular<00:03:27.530> shape<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:31.160> then<00:03:31.340> I'm<00:03:31.400> going<00:03:31.580> to

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
triangular shape and then I'm going to

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.449 
triangular shape and then I'm going to
do<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.880> same<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.840> other<00:03:32.870> side<00:03:33.459> it's

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
do the same to the other side it's

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.180 
do the same to the other side it's
lashed<00:03:34.850> into<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.630> pocket<00:03:35.900> area<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.560> have<00:03:37.010> my

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
lashed into the pocket area and have my

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.930 
lashed into the pocket area and have my
two<00:03:37.250> triangles<00:03:38.180> at<00:03:38.570> each<00:03:38.870> end<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.610> now<00:03:40.610> going

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
two triangles at each end and now going

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.380 
two triangles at each end and now going
