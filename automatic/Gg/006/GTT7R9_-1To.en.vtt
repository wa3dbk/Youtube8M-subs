thing<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.040> didn't<00:02:51.340> notice<00:02:51.490> in<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.820> online

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970

the<00:02:55.510> impression<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.830> Flywire<00:02:57.220> went<00:02:57.460> all

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
the impression that the Flywire went all

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.310 
the impression that the Flywire went all
the<00:02:57.760> way<00:02:57.790> down<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.330> shoe<00:02:58.540> but<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.170> actually

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
the way down the shoe but it actually

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.380 
the way down the shoe but it actually
only<00:02:59.650> goes<00:02:59.830> up<00:02:59.860> by<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.460> ankle<00:03:00.880> area<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.300> then

only goes up by the ankle area and then

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.670 
only goes up by the ankle area and then
it's<00:03:01.540> down<00:03:01.600> by<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.870> forefoot<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.380> there's<00:03:02.590> no

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
the same case on the instep as well so

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.150 
the same case on the instep as well so
it's<00:03:16.630> not<00:03:16.750> really<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:17.140> big<00:03:17.230> thing<00:03:17.740> it's<00:03:18.100> just

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
it's not really a big thing it's just

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.380 
it's not really a big thing it's just
something<00:03:18.459> that<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:18.640> didn't<00:03:18.880> know<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.180> think

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
something that I didn't know and I think

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.940 
something that I didn't know and I think
that<00:03:19.510> most<00:03:19.690> people<00:03:20.020> wouldn't<00:03:20.290> know<00:03:20.440> unless

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
that most people wouldn't know unless

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.040 
that most people wouldn't know unless
they<00:03:21.190> actually<00:03:21.340> saw<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.730> shoe<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.180> person<00:03:22.600> as

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
they actually saw the shoe in person as

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.420 
they actually saw the shoe in person as
far<00:03:23.290> as<00:03:23.380> what's<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.740> inside<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.220> strap

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
far as what's on the inside of the strap

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.680 
far as what's on the inside of the strap
you<00:03:24.550> have<00:03:24.640> one<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.880> those<00:03:24.970> little<00:03:25.150> details<00:03:25.360> I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
you have one of those little details I

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.360 
you have one of those little details I
was<00:03:25.810> talking<00:03:26.110> about<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.770> says<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.040> only<00:03:27.220> way

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
was talking about it says the only way

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.820 
was talking about it says the only way
to<00:03:27.550> handle<00:03:28.000> pressure<00:03:28.240> is<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.020> apply<00:03:29.709> it

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
to handle pressure is to is to apply it

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.930 
to handle pressure is to is to apply it
which<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.220> something<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.640> think<00:03:30.730> is

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
which is something that I think is

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.820 
which is something that I think is
really<00:03:31.000> cool<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.840> next<00:03:32.110> Darrell<00:03:32.350> Revis<00:03:32.530> touch

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
really cool the next Darrell Revis touch

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.860 
really cool the next Darrell Revis touch
on<00:03:33.040> there<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.400> think<00:03:33.760> just<00:03:34.330> add<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.750> the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
on there that I think just add to the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.300 
on there that I think just add to the
overall<00:03:34.900> coolness<00:03:35.680> factor<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:36.160> this

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
overall coolness factor of this

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.070 
overall coolness factor of this
particular<00:03:36.459> release<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.750> see<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:37.959> as<00:03:38.050> a

they look really good in my opinion

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.200

obviously<00:05:42.530> its<00:05:42.680> performance<00:05:43.280> you<00:05:43.460> it's<00:05:43.910> made

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
obviously its performance you it's made

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.240 
obviously its performance you it's made
to<00:05:44.240> be<00:05:44.450> worn<00:05:44.479> with<00:05:45.050> shorts<00:05:45.440> so<00:05:45.860> they're<00:05:46.040> going

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
to be worn with shorts so they're going

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.710 
to be worn with shorts so they're going
to<00:05:46.310> look<00:05:46.400> good<00:05:46.610> but<00:05:46.820> for<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.120> most<00:05:47.270> part<00:05:47.419> I

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
to look good but for the most part I

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.240 
to look good but for the most part I
think<00:05:47.750> this<00:05:47.990> is<00:05:48.110> just<00:05:48.140> a<00:05:48.410> really<00:05:48.560> good<00:05:48.890> looking

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
think this is just a really good looking

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.850 
think this is just a really good looking
shoe<00:05:49.490> overall<00:05:50.150> it<00:05:50.990> has<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:51.229> unique<00:05:51.380> cutting

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
shoe overall it has that unique cutting

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.440 
shoe overall it has that unique cutting
the<00:05:51.950> ankle<00:05:52.280> and<00:05:52.430> they<00:05:52.790> really<00:05:53.030> have<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.210> nice

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
the ankle and they really have a nice

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.270 
the ankle and they really have a nice
contained<00:05:54.020> fit<00:05:54.350> to<00:05:54.470> them<00:05:54.620> so<00:05:54.770> even<00:05:54.979> if<00:05:55.070> you<00:05:55.130> did

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
contained fit to them so even if you did

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.010 
contained fit to them so even if you did
want<00:05:55.400> to<00:05:55.550> wear<00:05:55.669> them<00:05:55.820> unlaced<00:05:56.270> you're<00:05:56.870> not

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
with other pants or shorts it's just a

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.000 
with other pants or shorts it's just a
matter<00:06:14.870> of<00:06:14.990> picking<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.350> colorway<00:06:15.740> that<00:06:15.770> you

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
style as far as comfort is concerned

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.880 
style as far as comfort is concerned
they're<00:06:20.270> very<00:06:20.510> very<00:06:20.660> comfortable<00:06:21.140> shoes<00:06:21.410> but

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
they're very very comfortable shoes but

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.050 
they're very very comfortable shoes but
the<00:06:22.010> fit<00:06:22.190> is<00:06:22.340> a<00:06:22.370> lot<00:06:22.580> different<00:06:22.729> than<00:06:22.970> I

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
the fit is a lot different than I

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.030 
the fit is a lot different than I
expected<00:06:23.090> it<00:06:23.510> to<00:06:23.660> be<00:06:23.720> it<00:06:24.320> has<00:06:24.440> a<00:06:24.470> pretty<00:06:24.770> narrow

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
expected it to be it has a pretty narrow

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.890 
expected it to be it has a pretty narrow
fit<00:06:25.370> especially<00:06:25.490> through<00:06:25.970> the<00:06:26.090> mid-foot<00:06:26.450> so

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
fit especially through the mid-foot so

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.390 
fit especially through the mid-foot so
if<00:06:26.960> you<00:06:27.050> do<00:06:27.140> have<00:06:27.320> wider<00:06:27.590> feet<00:06:27.890> I<00:06:28.070> definitely
