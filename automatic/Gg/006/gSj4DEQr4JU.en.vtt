in<00:02:02.579> an<00:02:02.700> acrylic<00:02:03.210> case<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.840> was<00:02:04.469> showing<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.890> red

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
in an acrylic case it was showing a red

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
in an acrylic case it was showing a red
light<00:02:05.340> where<00:02:05.969> they're<00:02:06.149> typically<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
light where they're typically would be a

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.199 
light where they're typically would be a
blue<00:02:07.320> light<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.829> there<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.520> message<00:02:08.849> on

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
blue light and there was a message on

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.550 
blue light and there was a message on
the<00:02:09.330> screen<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.660> said<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> consoles

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the screen that said the consoles

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.740 
the screen that said the consoles
temperature<00:02:11.099> was<00:02:11.310> too<00:02:11.520> high<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.300> acrylic

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
temperature was too high the acrylic

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.820 
temperature was too high the acrylic
case<00:02:12.930> was<00:02:13.170> open

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
case was open

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.380 
case was open
within<00:02:14.070> minutes<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.490> error<00:02:14.760> message<00:02:14.850> went

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
within minutes the error message went

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.910 
within minutes the error message went
away<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.960> light<00:02:16.170> went<00:02:16.320> back<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.770> its

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
away and the light went back to its

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.760 
away and the light went back to its
normal<00:02:17.130> color<00:02:17.490> these<00:02:18.240> consoles<00:02:18.870> were<00:02:19.320> test

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
normal color these consoles were test

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.950 
normal color these consoles were test
units<00:02:20.220> they<00:02:20.370> seemed<00:02:20.640> fully<00:02:20.940> capable<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.660> every

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
units they seemed fully capable in every

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.740 
units they seemed fully capable in every
way<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.890> think<00:02:22.920> he<00:02:23.580> meant<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.910> say<00:02:24.060> these

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
way and I think he meant to say these

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.860 
way and I think he meant to say these
councils<00:02:25.320> weren't<00:02:25.740> test<00:02:26.550> units<00:02:27.060> they<00:02:27.570> seemed

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
councils weren't test units they seemed

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.260 
councils weren't test units they seemed
fully<00:02:28.140> capable<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.800> every<00:02:29.070> way<00:02:29.250> because<00:02:30.090> that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
fully capable in every way because that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.870 
fully capable in every way because that
would<00:02:30.420> make<00:02:30.570> more<00:02:30.840> sense<00:02:31.310> these<00:02:32.310> councils

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
would make more sense these councils

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.570 
would make more sense these councils
word<00:02:33.210> test<00:02:33.600> units<00:02:34.020> they<00:02:34.800> seem<00:02:35.070> fully<00:02:35.340> capable

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
word test units they seem fully capable

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.130 
word test units they seem fully capable
in<00:02:35.970> every<00:02:36.210> way<00:02:36.330> doesn't<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:36.930> make<00:02:37.080> sense

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
in every way doesn't really make sense

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.200 
in every way doesn't really make sense
so<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.710> think<00:02:37.860> he<00:02:38.160> meant<00:02:38.400> these<00:02:38.640> councils

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
so I think he meant these councils

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.230 
so I think he meant these councils
weren't<00:02:39.570> test<00:02:40.320> units<00:02:40.740> but<00:02:41.370> somebody<00:02:41.790> asked

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
weren't test units but somebody asked

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.560 
weren't test units but somebody asked
Shuhei<00:02:42.930> Yoshida<00:02:43.280> or<00:02:44.280> however<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.210> say<00:02:45.420> his

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
Shuhei Yoshida or however you say his

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.020 
Shuhei Yoshida or however you say his
name<00:02:45.600> one<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> big<00:02:46.440> Sony<00:02:46.800> guys<00:02:47.040> he<00:02:47.610> said<00:02:47.880> is

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
name one of the big Sony guys he said is

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.600 
name one of the big Sony guys he said is
this<00:02:48.180> red<00:02:48.480> line<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.960> deaths<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.680> ps4<00:02:49.980> true

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
this red line of deaths on the ps4 true

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.000 
this red line of deaths on the ps4 true
and<00:02:50.880> he<00:02:51.510> tweeted<00:02:52.080> him<00:02:52.200> back<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.590> said<00:02:52.740> not

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
and he tweeted him back and said not

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.930 
and he tweeted him back and said not
true<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.550> then<00:02:54.330> video<00:02:55.020> game<00:02:55.290> scene<00:02:55.620> com<00:02:56.100> made

true and then video game scene com made

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.270 
true and then video game scene com made
this<00:02:57.150> statement<00:02:57.440> we're<00:02:58.440> not<00:02:58.650> entirely<00:02:59.070> sure

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
this statement we're not entirely sure

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.640 
this statement we're not entirely sure
why<00:02:59.790> he<00:03:00.150> would<00:03:00.330> deem<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.720> story<00:03:01.050> not<00:03:01.350> true

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
why he would deem this story not true

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.070 
why he would deem this story not true
since<00:03:01.980> there's<00:03:02.160> photographic<00:03:02.520> proof<00:03:03.209> maybe

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
since there's photographic proof maybe

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.410 
since there's photographic proof maybe
only<00:03:04.350> dev<00:03:04.650> kit<00:03:04.890> models<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.459> ps4<00:03:05.790> contain

the temperature monitoring feature we

the temperature monitoring feature we
stand<00:03:09.060> by<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.360> story<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.959> hopefully<00:03:10.350> there

stand by the story and hopefully there
will<00:03:10.620> be<00:03:10.680> further<00:03:10.980> updates<00:03:11.520> forthcoming<00:03:11.970> but

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
will be further updates forthcoming but

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.449 
will be further updates forthcoming but
like<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.110> said<00:03:13.290> there's<00:03:13.560> photographic<00:03:13.800> proof

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
like you said there's photographic proof

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.550 
like you said there's photographic proof
it<00:03:14.790> obviously<00:03:15.360> overheated<00:03:16.020> but<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.380> was

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
it obviously overheated but it was

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.890 
it obviously overheated but it was
sitting<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.040> an<00:03:17.190> acrylic<00:03:17.610> case<00:03:17.820> for<00:03:18.330> hours

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
sitting in an acrylic case for hours

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.140 
sitting in an acrylic case for hours
upon<00:03:19.170> hours<00:03:19.560> now<00:03:20.370> does<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:20.910> make<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
upon hours now does this make a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.360 
upon hours now does this make a
difference<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.900> don't<00:03:22.650> think<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.100> don't

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
difference I don't think so I don't

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.850 
difference I don't think so I don't
think<00:03:23.580> unless<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.750> plan<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.200> living<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.709> a

that it's going to have huge overheating
