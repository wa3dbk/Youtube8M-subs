00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.839
The 70s saw a very significant innovation in football,

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.949
given that better grip was needed as the pitches became increasingly softer,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.919
which gave rise to the use of aluminium studs.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.019
The older rubber studs

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.029
were still produced, but a new type of stud had appeared.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.769
With the focus placed on being lightweight in the 90s, a new method

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.530
to manufacture boots arose. Synthetic microfiber boots were produced,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.250
which were marketed alongside the traditional leather boots.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.100
As a progression from those two important benchmark innovations in the football boot story,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.030
in 2014, Nike developed the next generation of football boot,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.550
in 2014, Nike developed the next generation of football boot,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.500
the Nike Magista.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.680
The idea behind the Magista doesn't involve making the boot as lightweight as possible like other synthetic microfiber boots,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.490
but rather to make the boot become a second skin, i.e. you don't realise

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.870
you are wearing football boots, meaning that all your foot movements feel as natural as possible.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.870
you are wearing football boots, meaning that all your foot movements feel as natural as possible.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.180
Although the collar is the most striking aspect of the new Magista, as we can see here,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.070
which Nike calls Dynamic Fit,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.600
I think the material from which the entire boot casing is made is the most significant aspect.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.890
It is made from a single piece and there are not any openings,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.970
not even beneath the laces.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.850
It is made completely from a material called Flyknit.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.680
Nike first developed Flyknit for running shoes, which was launched

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.520
prior to the London Olympic Games,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.200
and ended being a great success given the feedback expressed by the athletes that used the boots,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.400
leading to Nike contemplating how they could transfer the technology to other sports.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.490
After four years of intensive research since

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.450
the World Cup in South Africa, we can now see the new Magista for the first time in 2014,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.000
manufactured entirely from Flyknit.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
As well as being lightweight like the synthetic microfiber material,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.600
Flyknit adapts to the feet as closely as possible.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.300
We can see how flexible the material really is,

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.129
and that it covers the entire boot outer casing.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.900
This elasticity clearly means it can adapt to the foot,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.800
but other issues arise, such as contact with the ball not feeling as natural as it should,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.389
and the constant risk of water entering the boot.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.589
How has Nike resolved the issue? Well, they have applied an existing technology

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.579
used on boots manufactured in Kanga-lite or Nikeskin,

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.440
which is ACC, All Condition Control,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.380
involving the use of a membrane that covers the boot that will keep

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.520
the entire surface waterproof, without limiting

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.520
the flexible, adaptable aspects of this material.

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.549
Flyknit will allow perfect contact with the ball.

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.189
As we can see, the waterproof surface begins below the ankle.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.209
As we can see, the waterproof surface begins below the ankle.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.789
It means that the laces are almost obsolete,

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:04.970
and included because they can provide additional adjustment for the boot,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.850
but this Flyknit material is so elastic that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.400
the boot adapts perfectly to your feet.

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.889
Now we have looked at the boot casing,

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.219
what everyone has been talking about for months after seeing players wearing them

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.219
is called the Dynamic Fit, this collar we can see here

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.089
that covers the ankle.

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.289
The same Flyknit material has been used,

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:34.600
and it has the effect of making it feel like we are not wearing the boot,

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.949
but rather that it forms part of our foot,

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.109
and what better way to do that than connecting it to the leg,

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.789
i.e. as well as having a boot that adapts perfectly to the foot, it also adapts to the leg,

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.750
because in the end, in play we footballers use the entire leg rather than just the foot,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.140
and all movements we make should be transmitted to the boot,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.200
which the boot then has to convey. The feeling is

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.730
very hard to explain through a video, it is much better if you try them out,

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.540
and you will note that whatever the movement the body makes

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.300
is transmitted directly to the boot, given that it forms part of your body.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.400
When you wear the boot, you will find the Flyknit is so elastic

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.800
and so reactive to your feet

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.459
that there is no need for much additional strengthening.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.720
If we look at the insole, we can see it is the same as previous insoles,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.060
such as the CTR360

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.009
and Hypervenom,

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.000
and maybe the most striking aspect of this boot is the sole plate.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.300
As we can see, the sole plate is similar to the Hypervenom,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.960
with the two different density plates to allow

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.120
separate forms of traction,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.870
although possibly most importantly, the sole is made from Pebax-and-nylon,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.620
which has been used to make the boot both reactive and

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.780
to reduce the profile as much as possible,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.570
in order to achieve that sensation of being as close to pitch as possible,

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.400
which players really desire and wasn't the case with the previous Magista model.

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:07.000
The position of the studs is similar to the previous generation, the CTR 360,

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:11.660
which is a combination of conical studs with two long studs,

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.790
which allows for improved turning,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.500
and quick stops and starts,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.000
given that the boot is still aimed at players who wish to control the game.

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:26.459
As such, we were very proud to be part of an event that,

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:31.400
in my opinion, will change the future of football boot production,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.349
which does not mean an end to the traditional football boot, rather that a new method for football boot production has arrived.

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.449
It is likely that all brands

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.529
will produce a boot with these characteristics from now on,

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.909
and that when you try them for the first time, it will feel strange to note

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.630
the extra pressure around the toes.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.200
They are really  strange to wear on the first few occasions. As your feet start to adapt to this type of boot,

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.500
you will probably feel the need to continue using them,

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:01.700
whether Flyknit from Nike, or a similar technology.
