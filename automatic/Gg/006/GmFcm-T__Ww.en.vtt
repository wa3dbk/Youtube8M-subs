00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.070
 a pilot about his wife because 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.170

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.610
 do you want 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.350

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.690
 as pure talent there is no pilot 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.760
 best in the world 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.120

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.860
 risk of death excites people who 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.760
 is that niki lauda has just signed 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.220
 with the ferrari I'm faster than you and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.410
 I can improve the car and have 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.879
 proved to be a winner 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.739
 is a question or do you just want to do me 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.059
 pissing off we are witnessing 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.690
 an incredible battle between the two 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.690
 great pilots 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.369
 I know you don't get along with the like 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.100
 all the rest you think you will succeed in 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.890
 manage the pressure to become 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.720
 champion you really have to believe it 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.229
 you're a party guy we'll kill 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.299
 out there 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.420
 you're too far back I'm faster than 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.420
 you 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.369
 I'm saying superstar is over 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.100
 stronger than the fear of death is the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.590
 desire to win 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.840
 that is why I am here to pray to you 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.450
 be able to beat it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.340
 trust the rain and the track today 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.340
