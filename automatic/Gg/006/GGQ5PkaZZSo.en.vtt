my<00:01:24.240> head<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.020> sort<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.560> became<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
my head and it sort of became the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.109 
my head and it sort of became the
springboard<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.650> entire<00:01:29.070> rest<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.939> the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.219 
stereotypical call of duty fan I decided
not<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.820> go<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.390> original<00:02:03.930> idea

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
not to go with that original idea

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.160 
not to go with that original idea
because<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.189> thought<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:05.969> was<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.450> true

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
because I thought it was a little true

because I thought it was a little true
hardcore<00:02:08.119> gamer<00:02:09.380> focused<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.760> people

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
hardcore gamer focused you know people

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.480 
hardcore gamer focused you know people
who<00:02:12.870> are<00:02:12.960> really<00:02:13.020> into<00:02:13.620> halo<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.070> ecology

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
who are really into halo and ecology

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.270 
who are really into halo and ecology
they<00:02:14.790> might<00:02:15.000> hit<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.240> jokes<00:02:15.600> but

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
they might hit the jokes but

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.340 
they might hit the jokes but
when<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.730> need<00:02:17.090> anything<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.690> anybody<00:02:17.959> else

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
when you need anything to anybody else

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.220 
when you need anything to anybody else
so<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.010> decided<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.790> back<00:02:20.000> out<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.450> and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
so I decided to back out of that and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.440 
so I decided to back out of that and
turn<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.040> into<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.310> concept<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:22.910> was<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> little

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
turn it into a concept that was a little

where um anybody who hadn't seen red vs.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.780 
where um anybody who hadn't seen red vs.
blue<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:24.110> would<00:03:24.410> have<00:03:24.530> no<00:03:24.829> idea<00:03:25.250> why<00:03:25.730> this

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790

why it was supposed to be plenty so once
again<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.489> decided<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.000> take<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.209> step<00:03:32.450> back<00:03:32.690> and
