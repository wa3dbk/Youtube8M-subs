you<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.430> interesting<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
you know to and it was interesting that

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.880

buy<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.500> think<00:04:04.739> that's<00:04:05.040> what<00:04:05.250> musicians

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
buy and I think that's what musicians

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.219

still<00:04:06.060> don't<00:04:06.299> understand<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.900> they<00:04:06.989> think

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
still don't understand is they think

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.189 
still don't understand is they think
that<00:04:07.379> boy<00:04:07.859> if<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:08.189> just<00:04:08.519> had<00:04:08.699> a<00:04:08.729> label<00:04:09.120> then<00:04:10.049> I

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
that boy if I just had a label then I

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.869 
that boy if I just had a label then I
could<00:04:10.409> just<00:04:10.439> sit<00:04:10.889> back<00:04:11.099> and<00:04:11.340> everybody<00:04:11.579> would
