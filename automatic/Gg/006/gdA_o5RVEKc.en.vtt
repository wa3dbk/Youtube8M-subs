to<00:04:06.260> make<00:04:06.650> them<00:04:06.829> look<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.220> lot<00:04:07.519> more<00:04:07.670> cute<00:04:08.000> than

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
to make them look a lot more cute than

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:17.410 
to make them look a lot more cute than
if<00:04:08.450> they<00:04:08.660> were<00:04:08.720> black

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.310 

you

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.260 

I<00:04:23.020> also<00:04:24.020> a<00:04:24.260> DIY<00:04:24.680> -<00:04:24.890> some<00:04:25.220> baskets<00:04:25.730> so<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.060> got

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
I also a DIY - some baskets so I got

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.730 
I also a DIY - some baskets so I got
some<00:04:26.450> of<00:04:26.540> these<00:04:26.690> from<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.170> Container<00:04:27.620> Store

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
some of these from the Container Store

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.320 
some of these from the Container Store
and<00:04:28.220> then<00:04:28.280> I'm<00:04:28.400> going<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.700> be<00:04:28.820> covering<00:04:29.120> them

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
and then I'm going to be covering them

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.270 
and then I'm going to be covering them
with<00:04:29.660> fabric<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.470> since<00:04:30.650> fabric<00:04:31.010> can<00:04:31.130> be<00:04:31.160> a

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
with fabric and since fabric can be a

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.890 
with fabric and since fabric can be a
little<00:04:31.520> bit<00:04:31.670> expensive<00:04:32.000> I'm<00:04:32.360> only<00:04:32.570> covering

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
little bit expensive I'm only covering

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.950 
little bit expensive I'm only covering
the<00:04:33.440> front<00:04:33.920> of<00:04:34.160> them<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.910> I'm<00:04:35.360> just<00:04:35.540> going<00:04:35.750> to

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
the front of them and I'm just going to

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.410 
the front of them and I'm just going to
be<00:04:36.320> cutting<00:04:36.710> up<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.980> fabric<00:04:37.370> into<00:04:37.550> squares<00:04:38.090> to

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
be cutting up the fabric into squares to

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.870 
be cutting up the fabric into squares to
fit<00:04:38.720> my<00:04:39.140> baskets<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.010> I'm<00:04:40.340> going<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.700> make

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
fit my baskets and I'm going to make

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.550 
fit my baskets and I'm going to make
sure<00:04:40.910> they're<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.330> right<00:04:41.450> size<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.990> then<00:04:42.530> I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
sure they're the right size and then I

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.700 
sure they're the right size and then I
glue<00:04:42.860> them<00:04:43.010> on<00:04:43.220> with<00:04:43.550> some<00:04:44.140> e6000<00:04:45.140> glue<00:04:45.170> so<00:04:45.650> I

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
glue them on with some e6000 glue so I

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.890 
glue them on with some e6000 glue so I
just<00:04:45.920> put<00:04:46.100> this<00:04:46.220> glue<00:04:46.520> going<00:04:47.060> all<00:04:47.240> around<00:04:47.630> the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
just put this glue going all around the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.170 
just put this glue going all around the
edges<00:04:48.230> of<00:04:48.350> my<00:04:48.500> basket<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:49.190> I<00:04:49.790> stuck<00:04:50.060> the

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
edges of my basket and I stuck the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.570 
edges of my basket and I stuck the
fabric<00:04:50.570> on<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:50.990> also<00:04:51.170> glued<00:04:51.710> down<00:04:52.040> the

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
fabric on and I also glued down the

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.760 
fabric on and I also glued down the
edges<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.510> fabric<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.140> basket<00:04:54.560> just

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
edges of the fabric to the basket just

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:08.390 
edges of the fabric to the basket just
to<00:04:55.310> try<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:55.550> make<00:04:55.670> it<00:04:55.790> as<00:04:56.090> secure<00:04:56.540> as<00:04:56.780> possible

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.110 

no

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.360 

so<00:05:14.120> once<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.450> finished<00:05:14.870> my<00:05:15.170> basket<00:05:15.770> then<00:05:16.070> I<00:05:16.130> just

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
so once I finished my basket then I just

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.980 
so once I finished my basket then I just
put<00:05:16.550> my<00:05:16.670> stuff<00:05:16.910> in<00:05:16.970> them<00:05:17.300> so<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.540> had<00:05:17.720> one<00:05:17.870> for

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
put my stuff in them so I had one for

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.440 
put my stuff in them so I had one for
electronics<00:05:18.710> I<00:05:18.860> also<00:05:19.130> put<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.520> lot<00:05:19.700> of<00:05:19.910> clothes

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
electronics I also put a lot of clothes

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.510 
electronics I also put a lot of clothes
in<00:05:20.750> them<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.200> I'm<00:05:21.260> kind<00:05:21.470> of<00:05:21.530> using<00:05:21.800> this<00:05:21.920> as<00:05:21.980> my

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
in them so I'm kind of using this as my

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.100 
in them so I'm kind of using this as my
dresser<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.150> it's<00:05:23.270> nice<00:05:23.450> because<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:23.930> don't

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
dresser and it's nice because I don't

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.660 
dresser and it's nice because I don't
have<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.440> make<00:05:24.590> my<00:05:24.740> clothes<00:05:25.010> be<00:05:25.190> folded<00:05:25.580> or

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
have to make my clothes be folded or

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.910 
have to make my clothes be folded or
anything<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.270> can't<00:05:26.630> even<00:05:26.870> tell<00:05:27.230> but<00:05:27.890> I

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
anything and you can't even tell but I

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.470 
anything and you can't even tell but I
love<00:05:28.190> this<00:05:28.400> and<00:05:28.610> I<00:05:28.670> think<00:05:28.730> it<00:05:29.000> turned<00:05:29.120> out<00:05:29.300> so

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
love this and I think it turned out so

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.120 
love this and I think it turned out so
cute<00:05:29.690> it's<00:05:29.900> probably<00:05:30.260> my<00:05:30.380> favorite<00:05:30.710> part<00:05:30.950> of

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
cute it's probably my favorite part of

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.920 
cute it's probably my favorite part of
my<00:05:31.220> room<00:05:31.370> because<00:05:31.850> I<00:05:31.880> love<00:05:32.210> all<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.510> patterns

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
my room because I love all the patterns

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.690 
my room because I love all the patterns
and<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.230> colors<00:05:33.470> there's<00:05:34.310> not<00:05:34.460> much

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
and the colors there's not much

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.450 
and the colors there's not much
sometimes<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.960> silence<00:05:36.170> got<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.800> mind<00:05:37.070> to

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
sometimes the silence got the mind to

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.750 
sometimes the silence got the mind to
move<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.790> a<00:05:37.820> place<00:05:38.030> so<00:05:38.330> far<00:05:38.570> away<00:05:39.370> next<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.640> am

ribbon and then I just stuck it to my
wall<00:05:53.240> and<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.660> actually<00:05:53.840> put<00:05:54.290> the<00:05:54.410> squares

going<00:05:55.010> all<00:05:55.250> across<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.760> ribbon<00:05:56.000> so<00:05:56.240> that<00:05:56.270> it

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
going all across the ribbon so that it

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.060 
going all across the ribbon so that it
would<00:05:56.510> be<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.690> more<00:05:56.990> secure<00:05:57.350> and<00:05:57.860> if<00:05:57.950> you're

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
would be a more secure and if you're

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.710 
would be a more secure and if you're
going<00:05:58.310> to<00:05:58.430> do<00:05:58.520> this<00:05:58.670> you<00:05:58.880> are<00:05:58.910> going<00:05:59.210> to<00:05:59.450> need

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
going to do this you are going to need

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.550 
going to do this you are going to need
some<00:06:00.140> help

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
some help

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.080

probably because you're going to need

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.690

extra<00:06:18.620> ribbon<00:06:18.830> so<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.130> just<00:06:19.280> tied<00:06:19.520> it<00:06:19.550> around<00:06:19.820> my

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150

lamps and I had some extra fabric for my
baskets<00:06:23.420> so<00:06:23.690> I<00:06:23.720> decided<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.410> make<00:06:24.890> a<00:06:25.100> pillow

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610
