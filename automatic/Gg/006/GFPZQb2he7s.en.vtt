00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.980
 he love media representatives a hearty 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.099
 Welcome to our press conference 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.960
 after the game seen 25 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.910
 spielag fc ingolstadt 0 against the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.060
 karlsruher sc 1 to 3 win for the ksc 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.020
 this afternoon and the whole 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.660
 in front of 12,000 156 people watch the first word 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.490
 As usual, he gave birth to the guest trainer 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.340
 kaczynski wants to continue 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.230
 ask for a game 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.530
 I think when I'm the first half 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.700
 summarize relatively balanced 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 at the team make standard goal 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.750
 then it is true that we were 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.920
 Overall, not quite as in there as we are 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.719
 have imagined that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.010
 I think you have already noticed that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.719
 needed a bit of time that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.489
 it was not quite so bubbly it was 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.270
 maybe less time was available 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.840
 this game 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.420
 in the second half then dominates 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.579
 ingolstadt the game also has a two 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.390
 possibilities 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.879
 yes and then we have that right 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.770
 then purely fought one more time with the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.420
 but can gain with the change 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.610
 again with them with damage 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.270
 kilian second tip I also have one 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.830
 sign set that was not here with it 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.369
 Satisfied that was the turn around 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.750
 want and yes we have 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.270
 course, the actions in the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 Last week was not going this week 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 cleansed the way it is in football 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.630
 on Mondays anatomy nips against Leipzig 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.979
 I believe I have nine high-profile chance 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 the things are not pure 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.290
 and today then call two 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.049
 sensational shots and and then gives 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.850
 the game on our side of course 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.140
 overall ingolstadt probably 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.509
 playful on this day a bit 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.009
 better no question but as we ourselves 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.079
 who fought in there and what the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.880
 Team morale has shown I have to 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.540
 pull the hat and noticed it 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.700
 does not work that way 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.680
 and then we really really 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.000
 All hewn and the us again 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.899
 torn and the game really 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.040
 brought over the stage 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.729
 Thank you Mr. Kauczinski Ralf, please 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.850
 your conclusion to the game 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.689
 Congratulations on the victory 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.510
 the ksc i have a very good game 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.130
 seen by my team 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.900
 we put away a residue 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.920
 are then again in the second half 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.120
 have gone full risk 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.110
 post shot goalkeeper's worth off and 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.180
 actually only energetic half 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.210
 have come and hardly come to breathe 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.760
 let but it is just that in the 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.440
 gate or in the gate then leaves the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.560
 consequence also was missing today and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.910
 The us then a bit in the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.480
 have stifled nice games yourself 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.400
 And I think football can be so brutal 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.410
 just be on and then often 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.570
 if you do not open the gates and 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.450
 that is why , of course, very disappointed 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.860
 I do not play so much better 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.720
 but we must on all cases 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.430
 home again more consistent result 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.950
 go and before the 1 2 the situation the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.780
 this leads us to counter this 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.310
 get until then actually the opponent 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.950
 barely had a chance second half 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.450
 that was already before the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.580
 television cameras selected discussed 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.080
 I always try and even to the 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.880
 to blame because we are not in the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.050
 Lage was not blocking the ball 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.250
 even if the ball rolls but you can 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.610
 still block the ball 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.590
 That's why we have to challenge ourselves 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.030
 that we did not stop it 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.680
 opponents here could finally 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.450
 yes, that's how it is and how 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.690
 We especially have to go home 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.420
 not the luck at the moment 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.920
 to draw such games on our side 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.490
 We had many close in the round 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.260
 games 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.760
 which are then tilted on our side 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.800
 At the moment they do not have to do that 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.570
 luckily try luck again 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.770
 also succeed at home succeeding abroad 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.660
 this a bit better at the moment we 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.410
 but we still have a few encounters 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.940
 Then thank you Ralf your questions 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.390
 please short note then comes 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.390
 microphone 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.370
 not the case no further questions 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.630
 but she has toni kicker please 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.550
 first row thought a question to mr 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.350
 hasenhÃ¼ttl after the game we have it 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.090
 trying to build your team or 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.660
 that of course now the sentences 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.489
 but say how 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.950
 What kind of direction is it there 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.510
 I do not remember what I said 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.890
 have 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.800
 which is to be processed for disappointment 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.060
 of course important in the moment again 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.830
 I think that we are not much better 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.760
 Playing football can be done today 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.560
 that was not any opponent and in 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.330
 in this way, too, I find 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.830
 to master for a very long time 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.380
 that is not self-evident and 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.170
 Nevertheless, that's not all in football 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.670
 Being dominant is one thing but one 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.520
 bad a good game to be praised 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.110
 to stand without dots is the other one 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.510
 and it does not do that nicely is not 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:57.770
 pleasant and yet I do not have that 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.300
 that we somehow and that ours 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.670
 Football is not working right now 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.870
 If I had the feeling then it would have to 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.830
 I strengthen with the team 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.370
 go court but I do not have 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.170
 and I still have a lot of sake 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.340
 seen a lot of sacrifice 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:17.230
 run nice tracks today 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.230
 empty hands and that's not nice 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.520
 would ask more 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:30.489
 is not the case then a quick look 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.909
 never forward to the sexual 

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:35.679
 our guests from ksc then receive the 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.509
 first fc kaiserslautern on sunday and 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:39.399
 our team on saturday then too 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.039
 guest in braunschweig before it in the 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:43.239
 country break is another one 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.949
 nice afternoon guests a good 

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:47.610
 driveway and until next time in the 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.610
 sports market
