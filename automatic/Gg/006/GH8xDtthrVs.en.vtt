00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
because of its mechanical way out we

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.660 
because of its mechanical way out we
have<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.590> much<00:02:25.739> more<00:02:25.950> freedom<00:02:26.010> than<00:02:26.430> we've

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
have so much more freedom than we've

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.640 
have so much more freedom than we've
ever<00:02:26.730> had<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.870> end<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.320> can<00:02:28.560> be

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
ever had for it to that end we can be

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.170 
ever had for it to that end we can be
much<00:02:28.830> more<00:02:29.040> creative<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:32.940> what's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
much more creative and so what's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.640 
much more creative and so what's
determining<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.780> shape<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.170> car<00:02:34.380> now<00:02:34.590> is

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
determining the shape of the car now is

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.830 
determining the shape of the car now is
less<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.310> what's<00:02:35.519> inside<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:36.150> more<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.600> what<00:02:36.810> we

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
less of what's inside it more of what we

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.570 
less of what's inside it more of what we

efficiency as a beauty

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.729 
efficiency as a beauty
and<00:02:47.209> it's<00:02:47.629> not<00:02:47.720> just<00:02:47.780> about<00:02:48.019> setting<00:02:48.440> beauty

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
and it's not just about setting beauty

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.190 
and it's not just about setting beauty
boats<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.069> mechanical<00:02:49.700> beauty<00:02:50.000> as<00:02:50.120> well<00:02:50.200> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
boats but mechanical beauty as well to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.340 
boats but mechanical beauty as well to
that<00:02:51.379> end<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.980> see<00:02:52.519> much<00:02:52.730> more<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:52.970> an<00:02:53.090> art<00:02:53.239> form

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
that end I see much more of an art form
