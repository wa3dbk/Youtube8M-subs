00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:05.737

00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:10.472
Mohamed Abbas narrates the events of Sunday, and the students' protest against the announcement on Dec. 7, 2012:

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:14.298
We were at a peaceful protest

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:18.978
We headed to the administration of Gezira University and we met the gatekeeper

00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:25.578
We handed him our letter, sealed with the Union's stamp

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:28.857
The Dean told us: I can't do anything for you until 4.00 PM, do what you want to

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:31.415
until 4 p.m.?

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:36.246
We told him does this mean we have to keep standing here until 4.30 PM?

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:38.498
He answered saying that it's our problem.

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:40.498
As we were returning, we got called back in by the Dean of Students' Affairs

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:46.178
His name is Rudwan Ahmed Gasmelseed.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.938
He gathered all of us but did not say a word.

00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:52.138
He said he had something to tell us

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:58.338
He had coordinated with the National Islamist Students' Authority

00:00:58.338 --> 00:01:07.337
While we were gathered, we were alarmed by the girls yelling from inside the lecture room

00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:11.138
We rushed there and when we arrived,

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:14.884
we found the Islamist students armed with skewers (metal rods)

00:01:14.884 --> 00:01:18.178
There was a battalion of them, trained and ready (a "katiba" or brigade of the Islamist Student Movement).

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.896
Their Katiba (brigade) is called Abu Gatata Katiba

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:29.777
I tried to retreat, but someone took a strike at my in my face

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:34.551

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:36.386

00:01:36.386 --> 00:01:39.337
We all took a step back

00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:45.777
At the same moment, the Dean, Dr. Rudwan fled as soon as he saw the Islamist students

00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:51.733
We withdrew and the battalion regrouped and attacked us again

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:56.898
