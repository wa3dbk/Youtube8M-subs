00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.080
 in this lesson we will talk about units 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.290
 measure the amount of information about the bits 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.130
 and bytes as well as their derivatives 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.590
 smallest particle measurement 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.130
 information this will be written as 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.670
 Latin letter b can also 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.130
 sign up a little russian google and 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.340
 further in ascending order goes byte 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 he is written in capital letter as 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.450
 Russian and Latin one byte 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.760
 contains 8 bits in this and consists 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.309
 difference 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.579
 measuring information from metric 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.300
 systems such as mass measurement 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.649
 volume or length where everything is a multiple of 10 of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.960
 there and thousands of bits and bytes cannot 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.180
 measured down 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.050
 they can only be measured in large 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 there is no side 1 mile 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.170
 bytes or 1 micro bits can be counted 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.500
 only in a big way and at the same time 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.470
 slightly different words are used like us 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:21.840
 see on the body 1 bit circuit this is 1000 bit 1 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:26.790
 megabit is 1000 kilometers of bits this is 1000 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.500
 megabit one terabit is 1000 gigabits with 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.290
 bytes everything happens a little 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.590
 in another different here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:40.079
 not a thousand she 1024 in one body byte 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.500
 1024 bytes in one megabyte 1024 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.250
 kilobyte in one gigabyte for 1024 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.079
 megabytes in one terabyte 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.720
 1024 gigabytes to convert bits to 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.180
 bytes you just need to multiply by eight 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.490
 This is the simplest arithmetic operation. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.310
 which can take a while to 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.090
 translate from megabytes 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.819
 the bits need to be divided by 8 below me 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.880
 in Russian written from the smallest to 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.060
 more as units 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.150
 my left is the smallest unit of it 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.269
 a bit further goes byte which is bigger 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.250
 bits eight times then kilobits 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:27.870
 then kilobytes then megabits and megabytes 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.040
 and so on also there are units which 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.640
 more terabyte for example petabyte then 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.299
 goes exabyte and so on they also 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.610
 differ by 1024 from previous 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.290
 gigabyte 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.040
 let's take a look at a small example 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.980
 how to view information 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.860
 for example, I discovered almost the first 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.269
 the folder and to view it 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.069
 size you need to click on the file and at the bottom 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.069
 we will be written 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.000
 the size of our file and another 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.760
 information 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.750
 You can also find out information by clicking 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.170
 select the properties with the right mouse button 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:18.030
 here we have all the information that will appear 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.049
 there are 92 kilo bytes 94 two hundred eight bytes 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:28.130
 also not to click on the file you can 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:31.920
 just hover and see the size 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.350
 You can also find out the size of the folder also on 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.350
 seeing the mouse is just on the folder and waiting 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.030
 a couple of seconds see the third line on top 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.519
 size 2 and 9 megabytes to immediately 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.100
 view all sizes you need 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:52.410
 change the window view go to the table view and 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:56.130
 the fourth column indicates the size to 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.310
 for example here we see 27 thousand one hundred 64 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.609
 kilobyte if we deploy this 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.319
 information here will see size 26 5 this 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:09.739
 due to the fact that in the mega database 1024 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.560
 kilobyte so the sizes differ 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:17.770
 but slightly different 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.770
 In principle, this is all thanks for your attention
