you<00:02:45.030> sort<00:02:45.359> of<00:02:45.510> would<00:02:45.600> expect<00:02:46.019> he's<00:02:46.590> very

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
you sort of would expect he's very

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
I mean by that is he's strong he's not

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.800 
I mean by that is he's strong he's not
slow<00:02:49.710> he's<00:02:50.100> got<00:02:50.280> decent<00:02:50.580> shooting<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.720> he's

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
slow he's got decent shooting and he's

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.580 
slow he's got decent shooting and he's
also<00:02:52.790> it's<00:02:53.790> hard<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.120> explain<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:54.780> he<00:02:55.320> has<00:02:55.440> got

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
also it's hard to explain but he has got

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.080 
also it's hard to explain but he has got
something<00:02:55.860> about<00:02:56.100> him<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.460> hold<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.910> ball

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
something about him it can hold the ball

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.480 
something about him it can hold the ball
up<00:02:57.120> well<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:57.960> just<00:02:58.050> he<00:02:58.500> doesn't<00:02:58.980> seem<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> get

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
up well it's just he doesn't seem to get

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.400 
up well it's just he doesn't seem to get

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
ten chances he's probably going to be

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.220
