00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.430
 tires 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.190
 where can I see that when you apologize for nothing 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.000
 road holding tenancy between paper. and scrupulously controlled including the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.640
 noise level emitted 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.810
 certainly in the lead on the last stage to validate prof. 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.390
 it all starts in the top site research labs follow me 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.160

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.620
 new tires 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.750
 development takes several years 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.440
 it must be said that a particularly demanding job more than 200 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.840
 materials and 36 I trust you the Russian tire 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.690
 to put the most powerful computer in difficulty these elements then 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.690
 we must unite them, let's see how 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.480
 the car that is on my shoulders and is called a drum 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.280
 the different layers are applied starting from the inside of the tire 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
 some layers are armed with cables and are called pl 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.050
 2 metal strands in extensible are placed each on one side then 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.250
 tab now swells and you can already guess the shape of the future 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.590
 tire 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.990
 other components are then added later and as for a cake you need to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080
 put them in the oven 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.970
 cooking is done here in these huge ovens 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.930
 because your cooking will be wondering why it is raw and cauciu e

 and elasticity 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
 is the vulcanization process 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.370
 moreover, the inside of the oven consists of a mold that goes to 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.549
 impress the tread with another blood 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.639
 allow the thermostat to cook for 15 minutes between 100 and 150 degrees according to i 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.180
 cases
