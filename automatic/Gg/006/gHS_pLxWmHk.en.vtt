00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.410
Alright, so it has been a while since our
very last video, so I guess we owe you guys

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.070
an apology because we've been a little bit
lazy.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.769
But we do have a good reason.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.100
This summer we came back to Canada not only
to get married but also to go back to school.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.420
We just started our classes in September.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.750
We're going to be students for the next eight
months as we complete our Bachelor of Education.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.930
That is the reason we've been a little busy.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.870
We've been planning lessons and teaching classes
but we're trying to get back into it, so today

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.000
we're going to be taking you to the campus.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.210
And we're really excited to give you a tour
of our campus.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.510
It is a beautiful campus and this has been
a big change for us going from traveling to

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.079
going back to school and even to being in
Canada.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.310
We normally don't live in Canada.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.329
We're used to be abroad.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.210
What we're going to do from now on is we're
going to try to make some videos in Canada

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.980
because we want to show you what it is like
to be here.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.940
Yep, so off we go.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.460
We're just waiting to catch the bus, which
is free for students.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.150
I think that is amazing.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.389
All I have to do is show my little card and
you get to ride around town and you don't

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:16.329
pay a cent.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.619
So cold!

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.009
It must be kind of shocking for you guys to
see us in our winter clothes.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.139
Normally we're decked out in goofy backpacking
t-shirts and shorts and flip flops but now

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:29.139
we're all bundled up today.

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:33.999
I've got my toque on, I've got my thick fall
jacket on.

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.869
It is cold outside.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.311
It was actually scheduled to snow today according
to the weatherman but that changed so now

00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:45.880
we have blue skies.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:58.659
Alright, so we are here at the Queen's University
campus and I think fall is the most beautiful

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.399
time of the year to visit.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.299
We still have some ivy left on the limestone
buildings and the colors are starting to change.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.080
The leaves are falling down and we are here
on a Sunday morning.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.129
It is just really quiet and really peaceful.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:26.569
One of the main reasons we've decided to come
back to school right now is because this is

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.340
the final year of the eight month Education
program in Ontario.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.530
It is the last province in Canada that offers
this.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.500
Every other Education program now is going
for two years and there is no way we could

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.000
hack going to school for two years.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.920
That is why we're studying now.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.069
Another reason we're really excited is that
we have an overseas practicum placement and

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.480
we're not going to tell you where it is but
we'll give you a little bit of a hint.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:10.030
It is going to be in South America and it
is going to happen in March.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:28.511
I've spotted a squirrel behind me.

00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:35.939
He's having a snack.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:46.480
Giant Maple Leafs.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.329
And that is it for our little campus tour.

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.889
We're just going to show you a few more clips
of Kingston in the fall.
