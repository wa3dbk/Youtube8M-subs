00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that stuff like this then if you start a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.020 
that stuff like this then if you start a
little<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:20.820> closer<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:23.030> okay

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
little bit closer like this okay

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.130 
little bit closer like this okay
therefore<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.740> faster<00:01:26.670> draw<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.840> put

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.890 
it okay this is the head and then only
one<00:01:31.439> tail<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.579> make<00:01:33.240> if<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.570> learn

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
one tail will be there make if I learn

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.219 
one tail will be there make if I learn

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
both the sides both the tails it's just

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.990 
both the sides both the tails it's just
a<00:02:44.879> practice<00:02:45.360> okay<00:02:46.069> because<00:02:47.069> we<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.549> going<00:02:47.819> to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
a practice okay because we are going to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.860 
a practice okay because we are going to
use<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.569> same<00:02:48.780> thing<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:50.459> future<00:02:51.150> okay<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.720> put

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
use the same thing in future okay so put

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.420 
use the same thing in future okay so put
here<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.470> learn<00:02:52.650> whatever<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.280> have

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
here just to learn whatever you have

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.420 
here just to learn whatever you have
time<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.630> press<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.530> tick<00:02:55.980> tick<00:02:56.190> tick

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
time just to press it tick tick tick

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.539 
time just to press it tick tick tick
let's<00:02:56.640> put<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.750> closer<00:02:58.049> like<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.650> one<00:02:58.860> how

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
let's put it closer like this one how

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.610 
let's put it closer like this one how
you<00:02:59.610> can<00:02:59.849> put<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.900> other<00:03:00.959> side<00:03:01.140> like

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
you can put it on the other side like

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.280 
you can put it on the other side like
that<00:03:01.880> then<00:03:02.880> under<00:03:03.360> both<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.569> side<00:03:03.930> select

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
that then under both the side select

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.640 
that then under both the side select
that<00:03:04.819> okay<00:03:05.849> therefore<00:03:06.630> otherwise<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.470> can

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
that okay therefore otherwise you can

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.430 
that okay therefore otherwise you can
learn<00:03:07.860> another<00:03:08.730> small<00:03:09.030> line<00:03:09.269> just<00:03:09.810> straight

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
learn another small line just straight

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.949 
learn another small line just straight
line<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.730> go<00:03:11.910> straight<00:03:12.329> line<00:03:12.690> like

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
line it's just to go straight line like

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.789 
line it's just to go straight line like
this<00:03:13.519> now<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.579> know<00:03:14.849> how<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.599> do<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.170> strokes

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
this now you know how to do the strokes

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.370 
this now you know how to do the strokes
okay<00:03:17.519> anywhere<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.389> just<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.780> fill<00:03:19.049> all

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
page like them okay this is then I'm the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.559 
page like them okay this is then I'm the
stroke<00:03:23.760> method<00:03:24.239> okay<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.350> can<00:03:25.530> go

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
stroke method okay you just you can go

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.090 
stroke method okay you just you can go
other<00:03:27.569> side<00:03:27.840> then<00:03:28.680> he<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:28.980> cross<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.519> let<00:03:29.700> it

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
other side then he can cross it let it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.170 
other side then he can cross it let it
do<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.340> just<00:03:32.579> do<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.299> just<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:34.410> ghost<00:03:34.620> right

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
do you just do like just a ghost right

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.729 
do you just do like just a ghost right
then<00:03:36.180> see<00:03:37.139> you<00:03:37.380> cross<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:39.680> okay<00:03:40.680> you

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
then see you cross like this okay you

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:41.360 
then see you cross like this okay you
got<00:03:41.040> it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
got it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.759 
got it
these<00:03:41.910> are<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.269> some<00:03:42.480> strokes<00:03:42.959> okay<00:03:43.470> some

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
these are the some strokes okay some

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.490 
these are the some strokes okay some
another<00:03:44.340> one<00:03:44.780> see<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.900> will<00:03:46.079> be<00:03:46.109> like<00:03:46.470> a

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
another one see it will be like a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.640 
another one see it will be like a
wriggling<00:03:46.859> one<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.959> small<00:03:49.410> dragon

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
wriggling one like like a small dragon

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.879 
wriggling one like like a small dragon
sometimes<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.459> have<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.730> fill<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.299> you

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
sometimes you have to fill in like you

like you like this one support like this
one<00:03:57.000> then<00:03:57.920> circular<00:03:58.920> motion<00:03:59.430> do<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.970> have<00:04:00.180> to

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
one then circular motion do you have to

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.039 
one then circular motion do you have to
learn<00:04:00.569> everything<00:04:00.989> by<00:04:01.200> circle<00:04:01.859> just<00:04:02.459> about

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
learn everything by circle just about

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.009 
learn everything by circle just about
put<00:04:04.049> inside<00:04:04.440> connect<00:04:04.889> this<00:04:05.099> one<00:04:05.540> just<00:04:06.540> too

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
put inside connect this one just too

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.490 
put inside connect this one just too
fast<00:04:07.500> they<00:04:07.889> put<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.220> circle<00:04:08.639> like<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.000> one

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
fast they put the circle like this one

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.020 
fast they put the circle like this one
it<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.889> put<00:04:11.480> circle<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.609> like<00:04:14.790> this

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
it just to put circle you can like this

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.180 
it just to put circle you can like this
sector<00:04:15.480> he<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:17.389> rolled<00:04:18.769> already<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:19.979> will

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
sector he just rolled already you will

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.659 
sector he just rolled already you will
make<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.639> circle<00:04:21.120> before<00:04:22.250> these<00:04:23.250> are<00:04:23.280> the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
make the circle before these are the

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.089 
make the circle before these are the
strokes<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.270> can<00:04:24.300> make<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.590> then<00:04:25.830> learn

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
strokes you can make it and then learn

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.610 
strokes you can make it and then learn
it

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
it

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.640 
it
again<00:04:27.220> then<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:28.090> have<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.449> practice<00:04:29.290> of<00:04:29.440> The

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
again then you have the practice of The

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.930 
again then you have the practice of The
Strokes<00:04:30.240> okay<00:04:31.350> next<00:04:32.350> we<00:04:32.680> will<00:04:32.800> go<00:04:33.040> to<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.370> next

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
Strokes okay next we will go to the next

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.500 
Strokes okay next we will go to the next
lesson

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
lesson

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.320
