guys is a sort of you flirt with the
notes<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:54.990> arpeggios<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.340> way<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.490> like

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
notes in the arpeggios is the way I like

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.719 
notes in the arpeggios is the way I like
to<00:01:56.939> put<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:58.049> basically<00:01:58.829> means<00:01:59.189> similar

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
to put it and it basically means similar

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.140 
to put it and it basically means similar
to<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.000> jazz<00:02:00.240> when<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.720> go<00:02:00.840> like

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.850 

we<00:02:04.150> stick<00:02:04.480> a<00:02:04.510> passing<00:02:05.080> cord<00:02:05.410> which<00:02:05.830> is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
we stick a passing cord which is

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.370 
we stick a passing cord which is
basically<00:02:06.730> just<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.660> cord<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.200> we're

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
basically just the cord that we're

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.030 
basically just the cord that we're
aiming<00:02:08.740> for<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.580> but<00:02:10.210> up<00:02:10.450> one<00:02:10.780> down<00:02:11.140> or<00:02:11.590> one

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
aiming for and but up one down or one

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.970 
aiming for and but up one down or one
fret<00:02:12.340> on<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.580> off<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.450> beats<00:02:13.750> two<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.800> give

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
fret on the off for on beats two to give

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.560 
fret on the off for on beats two to give
it<00:02:15.100> an<00:02:15.160> interesting<00:02:15.580> sound<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:16.000> exactly<00:02:16.420> what

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
it an interesting sound is exactly what

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.540 
it an interesting sound is exactly what
we<00:02:16.660> do<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.900> arpeggio<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.560> what<00:02:18.130> instead<00:02:18.430> of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
we do the arpeggio so what instead of

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.870 
we do the arpeggio so what instead of
going<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:21.130> might<00:02:21.310> go<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.980> for<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.430> all<00:02:24.670> I'm

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
going we might go and for that all I'm

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.640 
going we might go and for that all I'm
doing<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.690> might<00:02:25.840> be<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:26.020> sound<00:02:26.260> because

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
doing and it might be a sound because

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.960 
doing and it might be a sound because
when<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.830> first<00:02:27.040> have<00:02:27.280> someone<00:02:27.580> do<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.820> I

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
when I first have someone do this I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.220 
when I first have someone do this I
thought<00:02:28.090> well<00:02:28.210> that's<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.540> sound<00:02:28.720> I'm<00:02:28.900> after

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
thought well that's the sound I'm after

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.210 
thought well that's the sound I'm after
all<00:02:29.740> they're<00:02:30.130> doing<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.930> adding<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.200> note<00:02:32.860> one

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
all they're doing is adding a note one

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.370 
all they're doing is adding a note one
fret<00:02:33.520> down<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:33.970> one<00:02:34.360> semitone<00:02:34.750> or<00:02:34.930> one

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
fret down so one semitone or one

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.949 
fret down so one semitone or one

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.960 

I'm<00:03:10.930> skipping<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.530> one<00:03:11.769> out<00:03:11.920> for<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.790> table

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
I'm skipping that one out for the table

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.220 
I'm skipping that one out for the table
actually<00:03:14.580> but<00:03:15.580> what<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:15.850> can<00:03:16.030> do<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:17.019> can

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
actually but what you can do is you can

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.410 
actually but what you can do is you can
go<00:03:17.410> even<00:03:17.830> crazy<00:03:18.250> with<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:18.880> do<00:03:19.030> things

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
go even crazy with that and do things

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.030 
go even crazy with that and do things
like<00:03:19.540> trills<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.049> mordant<00:03:20.500> which<00:03:20.739> are<00:03:20.920> like

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
like trills and mordant which are like

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.990 
like trills and mordant which are like
classical<00:03:21.790> music<00:03:22.019> or<00:03:23.019> classical

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000

ornamentations<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.180> things<00:03:25.360> so<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:25.900> can<00:03:26.019> land

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
ornamentations and things so we can land

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.199 
ornamentations and things so we can land
we<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.739> start<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.280> original<00:03:27.700> note<00:03:27.880> move

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
we can start on the original note move

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.810 
we can start on the original note move
up<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.570> semitone<00:03:28.840> back<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.890> original<00:03:30.310> down

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
up a semitone back to the original down

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.530 
up a semitone back to the original down
a<00:03:30.850> semitone

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
a semitone

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.479 
a semitone
back<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.620> original<00:03:32.920> again<00:03:33.070> so<00:03:33.190> we<00:03:33.280> can<00:03:33.310> go

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
back to the original again so we can go

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:47.580 
back to the original again so we can go
do<00:03:33.730> like<00:03:42.360> together<00:03:43.360> interesting<00:03:43.930> sound<00:03:46.590> so

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
do like together interesting sound so

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.440 
do like together interesting sound so
that<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:47.920> really<00:03:48.280> easy<00:03:48.310> way<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.820> get<00:03:49.180> some

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
that is a really easy way to get some

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.930 
that is a really easy way to get some

gypsy jazz flavor into your guitar

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.580 
gypsy jazz flavor into your guitar
playing<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.450> works<00:03:52.660> really<00:03:52.870> well<00:03:52.959> on<00:03:53.200> acoustic

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
playing it works really well on acoustic

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.320 
playing it works really well on acoustic
guitar<00:03:53.860> basically<00:03:54.610> all<00:03:54.760> we're<00:03:54.940> doing<00:03:55.209> is

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
guitar basically all we're doing is

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.630 
guitar basically all we're doing is
we're<00:03:55.480> taking<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.920> arpeggio<00:03:56.920> or<00:03:57.190> basic

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640

arpeggio<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.450> sticking<00:03:59.230> usually<00:04:00.130> works<00:04:00.310> best

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
arpeggio and sticking usually works best

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.729 
arpeggio and sticking usually works best
at<00:04:00.850> minor<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.330> just<00:04:01.510> sticking<00:04:01.780> chromatic

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
at minor and just sticking chromatic
