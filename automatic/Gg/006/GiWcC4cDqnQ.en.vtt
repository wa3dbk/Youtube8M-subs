well<00:00:00.450> although<00:00:00.750> it<00:00:00.900> was<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> defeat<00:00:01.439> at<00:00:01.680> Everton

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
well although it was a defeat at Everton

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.919 
well although it was a defeat at Everton
it<00:00:02.250> wasn't<00:00:02.520> perhaps<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.000> worst<00:00:03.449> performance

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
it wasn't perhaps the worst performance

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.450 
it wasn't perhaps the worst performance
from<00:00:04.049> your<00:00:04.200> side<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.620> season<00:00:04.890> so<00:00:05.040> they're

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
from your side of the season so they're

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.680 
from your side of the season so they're
a<00:00:05.490> lot<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.700> positives<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.330> been<00:00:06.420> taken

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
a lot of positives that have been taken

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.540 
a lot of positives that have been taken
into<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:06.960> week's<00:00:07.200> training<00:00:07.730> yes<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:09.389> try

into this week's training yes you try

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.770 
into this week's training yes you try
disappointed<00:00:11.550> about<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:12.530> result<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:14.780> we

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
disappointed about that result but we

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.480 
disappointed about that result but we
know<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.460> these<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.789> difficult<00:00:18.210> games

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
know that that these are difficult games

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.429 
know that that these are difficult games
because<00:00:20.750> even<00:00:22.100> when<00:00:23.100> they<00:00:23.250> play<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:23.640> home<00:00:24.439> they

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
because even when they play at home they

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.519 
because even when they play at home they
are<00:00:27.560> don't<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.070> not<00:00:29.279> caring<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.529> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
are don't they are not caring about the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.530 
are don't they are not caring about the
way<00:00:31.679> how<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.099> play<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:33.770> only<00:00:34.770> concern

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
way how they play they only concern

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.190 
way how they play they only concern
about<00:00:36.590> getting<00:00:37.590> points<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.870> that's<00:00:39.870> that's

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
about getting points and that's that's

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.709 
about getting points and that's that's
the<00:00:40.530> end<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> season<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.489> that's<00:00:41.719> much

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the end of the season and that's much

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.240 
the end of the season and that's much
different<00:00:42.750> than<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> beginning<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
different than in the beginning of the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.150 
different than in the beginning of the
season<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:45.110> think<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.410> sometimes<00:00:46.710> more

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
season I think we get sometimes more

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.020 
season I think we get sometimes more
space<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> play<00:00:48.050> they<00:00:49.050> know<00:00:49.289> exactly<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
space to play they know exactly the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.930 
space to play they know exactly the
qualities<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.719> our<00:00:52.110> team<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.610> means

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
qualities of our team and that means

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.490 
qualities of our team and that means
that<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:55.079> play<00:00:55.320> always<00:00:55.800> against<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:57.000> very

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
that you play always against a very

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.450 
that you play always against a very
defensive<00:00:58.640> system<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.329> opponent<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
defensive system of the opponent and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
defensive system of the opponent and
that<00:01:02.460> will<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:02.940> different<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.229> Saturday

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that will not be different this Saturday

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.280 
that will not be different this Saturday
and<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:06.180> more<00:01:06.360> difficult<00:01:06.570> because

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and and that's more difficult because

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
and and that's more difficult because
you<00:01:07.680> need<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.400> patient<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:10.020> need<00:01:11.510> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you need to be more patient you need to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.219 
you need to be more patient you need to
bring<00:01:12.750> more<00:01:13.590> quality<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.280> front<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.229> then

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
bring more quality in front and then

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.380 
bring more quality in front and then
that's<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.430> bit<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:17.700> difficult<00:01:17.909> than

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that's a little bit more difficult than

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.399 
that's a little bit more difficult than
than<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> beginning<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:21.409> that's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
than in the beginning and then that's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.280 
than in the beginning and then that's
all<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.860> our<00:01:23.820> performance<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:25.110> know

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
all about our performance but we know

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.480 
all about our performance but we know
and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.549> experience<00:01:27.150> now<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.490> we

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and then the experience now is that we

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.469 
and then the experience now is that we
know<00:01:29.670> how<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:30.060> play<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.610> we<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.090> handle

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
know how they play and we have to handle

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.660 
know how they play and we have to handle
that<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> better<00:01:34.229> way<00:01:34.439> other<00:01:35.189> players<00:01:35.490> still

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that on a better way other players still

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
that on a better way other players still
confident<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.630> make<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> special

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
confident they can make this a special

Crystal Palace and Burnley in the last
two<00:02:46.269> home<00:02:46.480> games<00:02:46.659> to<00:02:47.139> take<00:02:47.319> confidence<00:02:47.560> from

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
two home games to take confidence from

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.890 
two home games to take confidence from
that<00:02:47.980> yeah<00:02:48.609> every<00:02:48.909> will<00:02:49.209> look<00:02:49.689> very

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
that yeah every will look very

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.390 
that yeah every will look very
comfortable<00:02:51.239> playing<00:02:52.239> at<00:02:52.540> home<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.189> we<00:02:54.189> know

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
comfortable playing at home and we know

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.979 
comfortable playing at home and we know
the<00:02:55.269> system<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:56.260> Hill<00:02:56.739> is<00:02:56.769> using<00:02:57.370> normally

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
the system that Hill is using normally

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.349 
the system that Hill is using normally
its<00:02:58.989> most<00:02:59.379> of<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> time<00:02:59.859> five<00:03:00.489> defenders<00:03:01.090> and

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
its most of the time five defenders and

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.869 
its most of the time five defenders and
that<00:03:01.810> means<00:03:02.079> there's<00:03:02.680> no<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.859> lot<00:03:03.129> of<00:03:03.250> space<00:03:03.549> and

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
that means there's no a lot of space and

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.259 
that means there's no a lot of space and
then<00:03:04.689> you<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:05.139> to<00:03:05.169> do<00:03:05.650> which<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:07.090> good

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
then you have to do which the the good

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.830 
then you have to do which the the good
movement<00:03:07.599> on<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:09.189> right<00:03:09.370> moment<00:03:09.639> and<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
movement on the right moment and and and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.339 
movement on the right moment and and and
i<00:03:11.079> think<00:03:11.590> maybe<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:13.480> be<00:03:13.629> a<00:03:13.659> little<00:03:13.870> bit<00:03:14.019> more

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
i think maybe to be a little bit more

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.789 
i think maybe to be a little bit more
aggressive<00:03:14.799> in<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.909> box<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.500> little<00:03:17.739> bit

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
aggressive in the box and a little bit

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.189 
aggressive in the box and a little bit
more<00:03:18.010> clinical<00:03:18.669> than<00:03:19.449> the<00:03:19.599> last<00:03:19.780> few<00:03:19.959> games

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
more clinical than the last few games

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.469 
more clinical than the last few games
he'll<00:03:21.129> have<00:03:21.310> been<00:03:21.489> dragged<00:03:21.819> into<00:03:21.970> the

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
he'll have been dragged into the

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.149 
he'll have been dragged into the
relegation<00:03:22.750> battle<00:03:23.349> at<00:03:23.409> the<00:03:23.500> bottom<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.859> the

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
relegation battle at the bottom of the

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.949 
relegation battle at the bottom of the
table<00:03:24.310> does<00:03:24.669> that<00:03:24.790> make<00:03:24.940> him<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.150> tougher

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
table does that make him a tougher

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.559 
table does that make him a tougher
opponent<00:03:26.829> on<00:03:27.010> on<00:03:27.250> saturday<00:03:27.729> yeah<00:03:28.239> it's<00:03:28.419> a

tough one because they are fighting

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.939

against relegation and that they need
points<00:03:33.750> they<00:03:34.889> didn't<00:03:35.889> had<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.069> very<00:03:36.459> bad<00:03:36.729> game

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
and then that's always difficult in this

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.909 
and then that's always difficult in this
situation<00:03:47.769> was<00:03:48.599> for<00:03:49.599> them<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:50.590> they<00:03:50.739> will

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
situation was for them but they will

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.890 
situation was for them but they will
come<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.489> they<00:03:52.030> will<00:03:52.060> have<00:03:52.389> the<00:03:52.540> confidence

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
come and they will have the confidence

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.860 
come and they will have the confidence
and<00:03:53.229> they<00:03:53.379> will<00:03:53.560> have<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.919> organization<00:03:54.870> to

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
and they will have the organization to

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.839 
and they will have the organization to
make<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.199> very<00:03:56.349> difficult<00:03:56.620> for<00:03:56.919> us<00:03:57.189> and<00:03:57.519> we

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
make it very difficult for us and we

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.599 
make it very difficult for us and we
know<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.569> we<00:03:58.810> have<00:03:59.439> to<00:03:59.590> handle<00:03:59.889> that<00:04:00.069> in

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
know that and we have to handle that in

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.610 
know that and we have to handle that in
your<00:04:00.790> last<00:04:01.090> 7<00:04:01.239> games<00:04:01.479> you<00:04:01.750> play<00:04:01.900> for<00:04:02.139> teams<00:04:02.379> who

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
your last 7 games you play for teams who

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.439 
your last 7 games you play for teams who
are<00:04:02.680> in<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:03.069> bottom<00:04:03.250> six<00:04:03.849> some<00:04:04.090> people<00:04:04.359> may

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
are in the bottom six some people may

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:05.849 
are in the bottom six some people may
look<00:04:04.599> at<00:04:04.750> that<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.049> think<00:04:05.079> that<00:04:05.590> Southampton

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
look at that and think that Southampton

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.500 
look at that and think that Southampton
have<00:04:06.189> got<00:04:06.340> quite<00:04:06.489> an<00:04:06.639> easy<00:04:06.790> run<00:04:07.060> into<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.359> end

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
have got quite an easy run into the end

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.300 
have got quite an easy run into the end
of<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.689> season<00:04:07.840> because<00:04:08.470> they're<00:04:08.859> fighting

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
of the season because they're fighting

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.009 
of the season because they're fighting
and<00:04:09.549> so<00:04:09.909> determined<00:04:10.389> to<00:04:10.419> stay<00:04:10.659> up<00:04:10.810> does<00:04:10.989> it

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
and so determined to stay up does it

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.869 
and so determined to stay up does it
make<00:04:11.199> it<00:04:11.349> harder<00:04:11.709> than<00:04:12.040> then<00:04:12.340> some<00:04:12.519> people<00:04:12.790> may

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
make it harder than then some people may

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.999 
make it harder than then some people may
think<00:04:12.909> not<00:04:13.569> at<00:04:13.720> least<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:16.239> opponents<00:04:16.840> are

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
think not at least the opponents are

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
full ways away spirit and fighting for

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.760 
full ways away spirit and fighting for
one<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.609> last<00:04:21.789> chances<00:04:22.599> to<00:04:22.659> to<00:04:23.139> do<00:04:23.349> stay<00:04:23.590> on

the<00:04:23.830> Premier<00:04:24.190> League<00:04:24.219> and<00:04:24.810> that's<00:04:25.810> always

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
the Premier League and that's always

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
the Premier League and that's always
difficult

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
difficult

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.790 
difficult

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
finish this season not i think that the
