00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
around for 10 plus years I believe so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.880 
around for 10 plus years I believe so
people<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.260> every<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> couple

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
people have these in every like a couple

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.380 
people have these in every like a couple
years<00:00:47.039> or<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.399> maybe<00:00:47.640> three<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.000> years<00:00:48.210> you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
years or so maybe three four years you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
years or so maybe three four years you
just<00:00:48.420> replace<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.579> then<00:00:50.579> you're<00:00:50.700> all

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
good to go and I think it's only maybe

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.900 
good to go and I think it's only maybe
10<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.170> 15<00:00:52.500> bucks<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.860> replace<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.399> pads<00:00:53.579> I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.590 
are swivel based here so you can I don't
know<00:01:11.580> depending<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.330> needs<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
need if you want to put around your neck

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.020 
need if you want to put around your neck
and<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.220> want<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.549> turn<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.820> away<00:01:14.880> you

and you want to just turn them away you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.249 
and you want to just turn them away you
can<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
can do that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
can do that
so<00:01:16.740> let's<00:01:16.950> slide<00:01:17.430> these<00:01:17.580> back<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so let's slide these back here at the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.240 
so let's slide these back here at the
top<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.600> has<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.439> bit<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.710> padding<00:01:19.920> it's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
top here has a bit of padding it's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
top here has a bit of padding it's
nothing<00:01:20.580> crazy<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
nothing crazy but I like that because it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
nothing crazy but I like that because it
keeps<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> profile<00:01:23.280> down<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.640> these<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> can

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
keeps the profile down on these you can

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
keeps the profile down on these you can
actually<00:01:24.210> wear<00:01:24.420> these<00:01:24.570> around<00:01:25.350> outside<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
actually wear these around outside and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.410 
actually wear these around outside and
stuff<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.490> they're<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.670> too<00:01:26.880> big<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.270> bulky

comparison here for audio and so you

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.490 
comparison here for audio and so you
guys<00:04:27.210> can<00:04:27.450> hear<00:04:27.630> how<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.870> sounds<00:04:27.900> I'm<00:04:28.290> going<00:04:28.380> to

again once if these ever break or
something<00:06:02.070> like<00:06:02.160> that<00:06:02.220> I'll<00:06:02.400> probably<00:06:02.550> pick

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
these up again there's also a different

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.520 
these up again there's also a different
variation<00:06:04.620> of<00:06:04.710> these<00:06:04.860> that<00:06:05.430> have<00:06:05.700> I<00:06:06.530> forget

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
variation of these that have I forget

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.440 
variation of these that have I forget
what<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:07.919> model<00:06:08.220> is<00:06:08.310> but<00:06:08.580> basically<00:06:09.000> they're

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
what the model is but basically they're

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.340 
what the model is but basically they're
blue<00:06:09.690> here<00:06:09.900> that's<00:06:10.080> how<00:06:10.140> you<00:06:10.229> can

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
blue here that's how you can

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.590 
blue here that's how you can
differentiate<00:06:10.650> it's<00:06:11.130> blue<00:06:11.640> and<00:06:11.669> it's<00:06:12.180> I<00:06:12.450> think

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
differentiate it's blue and it's I think

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.780 
differentiate it's blue and it's I think
it's<00:06:12.990> more<00:06:13.140> of<00:06:13.200> a<00:06:13.260> professional<00:06:13.890> line<00:06:14.310> beyond

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
it's more of a professional line beyond

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.670 
it's more of a professional line beyond
these<00:06:15.030> I<00:06:15.090> don't<00:06:15.510> know<00:06:15.690> exactly<00:06:16.080> there's<00:06:16.500> just

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
these I don't know exactly there's just

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.020 
these I don't know exactly there's just
two<00:06:16.830> variations<00:06:17.340> I<00:06:17.430> believe<00:06:17.669> and<00:06:17.880> then

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
two variations I believe and then

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.760 
two variations I believe and then
there's<00:06:18.180> also<00:06:18.330> budget<00:06:18.960> ones<00:06:19.229> of<00:06:19.380> these<00:06:19.470> also

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
there's also budget ones of these also

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.490 
there's also budget ones of these also
