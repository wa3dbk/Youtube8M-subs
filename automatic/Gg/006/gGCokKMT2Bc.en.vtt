00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
right through zombies make them look a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.510 
right through zombies make them look a
little<00:04:26.080> bit<00:04:26.260> more<00:04:27.130> feral<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:28.050> creepy<00:04:29.100> or<00:04:30.100> you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
little bit more feral and creepy or you

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.710 
little bit more feral and creepy or you
just<00:04:30.550> put<00:04:30.820> them<00:04:30.910> in<00:04:30.970> your<00:04:31.000> bits<00:04:31.210> box<00:04:31.419> and<00:04:31.630> use

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
just put them in your bits box and use

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.990 
just put them in your bits box and use
it<00:04:31.840> for<00:04:31.960> later<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.350> only<00:04:32.860> thing<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:33.039> that<00:04:33.160> the

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
it for later the only thing is that the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.930 
it for later the only thing is that the
way<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.300> arms<00:04:34.660> are<00:04:34.750> molded<00:04:35.200> there

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
way the arms are molded there

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.700 
way the arms are molded there
this<00:04:36.120> specifically<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.780> fit<00:04:37.020> onto<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.500> ghoul

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
this specifically to fit onto the ghoul

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.050 
this specifically to fit onto the ghoul
frame<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.430> might<00:04:38.670> have<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:38.850> do<00:04:39.030> some

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
frame so you might have to do some

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.390 
frame so you might have to do some
cutting<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.320> green<00:04:40.500> stuffing<00:04:40.950> but<00:04:41.160> other

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
cutting and green stuffing but other

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.380 
cutting and green stuffing but other
than<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.750> they<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:43.670> think<00:04:44.670> they<00:04:45.030> look<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.300> lot

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
than that they I think they look a lot

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.180 
than that they I think they look a lot
less<00:04:45.570> cartoony<00:04:45.990> than<00:04:46.350> those<00:04:46.530> zombie<00:04:46.830> arms

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
less cartoony than those zombie arms

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.340 
less cartoony than those zombie arms
that<00:04:47.760> are<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.810> right<00:04:48.930> now<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.140> not<00:04:49.260> that

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
that are and the right now and not that

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.780 
that are and the right now and not that
design<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.740> arms<00:04:49.950> look<00:04:50.070> cartoony<00:04:50.520> they<00:04:50.640> just

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
design the arms look cartoony they just

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.340 
design the arms look cartoony they just
look<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.000> little<00:04:51.120> bit<00:04:51.270> disproportionate<00:04:52.110> in

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
look a little bit disproportionate in

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.480 
look a little bit disproportionate in
size<00:04:52.590> because<00:04:53.460> they're<00:04:53.610> made<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:53.940> long<00:04:54.120> ago<00:04:54.350> so

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
size because they're made so long ago so

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.390 
size because they're made so long ago so
these<00:04:56.490> goals<00:04:57.120> were<00:04:57.480> made<00:04:57.890> seems<00:04:58.890> like<00:04:59.070> with<00:04:59.370> a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
these goals were made seems like with a

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.260 
these goals were made seems like with a
lot<00:04:59.670> more<00:04:59.910> of<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.750> streamlined<00:05:01.260> process<00:05:02.270> so

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
lot more of a streamlined process so

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.180 
lot more of a streamlined process so
that<00:05:03.300> everything<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.440> muscle<00:05:04.770> isn't<00:05:04.890> seen

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
that everything the muscle isn't seen

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.860 
that everything the muscle isn't seen
you<00:05:05.310> look<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.520> lot<00:05:05.670> smaller<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:07.650> taut<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:08.870> just

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
you look a lot smaller and taut and just

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.710 
you look a lot smaller and taut and just
more<00:05:10.550> dynamic<00:05:11.550> then<00:05:11.910> there's<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.390> zombie

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
more dynamic then there's the zombie

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.780 
more dynamic then there's the zombie
model<00:05:13.500> frame<00:05:13.740> where<00:05:14.100> they<00:05:14.220> just<00:05:14.400> look<00:05:14.520> kind<00:05:14.730> of

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
model frame where they just look kind of

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.030 
model frame where they just look kind of
slow<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.390> lumbering<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:16.640> like<00:05:17.640> this<00:05:17.760> guy<00:05:18.000> I

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
slow and lumbering I like this guy I

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.370 
slow and lumbering I like this guy I
guess<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.190> boss<00:05:20.400> character<00:05:21.120> he's<00:05:21.840> got<00:05:22.080> like<00:05:22.350> a

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
guess the boss character he's got like a

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.810 
guess the boss character he's got like a
skeleton<00:05:23.000> on<00:05:24.000> his<00:05:24.180> back<00:05:25.370> you've<00:05:26.370> also<00:05:26.520> got

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
skeleton on his back you've also got

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.170 
skeleton on his back you've also got
besides<00:05:27.150> these<00:05:27.920> extra<00:05:28.920> pieces<00:05:29.100> you<00:05:29.460> do<00:05:29.880> have

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
besides these extra pieces you do have

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.640 
besides these extra pieces you do have
one<00:05:30.630> two<00:05:31.230> three<00:05:31.890> four<00:05:32.220> five<00:05:32.550> six<00:05:32.690> seven<00:05:33.690> I<00:05:34.440> cut

off<00:05:34.740> one<00:05:34.920> of<00:05:34.950> the<00:05:35.100> bones<00:05:35.310> chop<00:05:35.940> that<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.180> half

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
off one of the bones chop that in half

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.920 
off one of the bones chop that in half
and<00:05:36.510> used<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:36.840> to<00:05:37.190> add<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.700> one<00:05:38.820> of<00:05:38.910> my<00:05:39.000> ghouls

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
and used it to add to one of my ghouls

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.690 
and used it to add to one of my ghouls
here<00:05:40.290> but<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.650> do<00:05:40.770> have<00:05:40.980> these<00:05:41.220> extra<00:05:41.550> bone
