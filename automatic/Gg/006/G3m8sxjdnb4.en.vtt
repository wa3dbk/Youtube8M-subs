I<00:01:34.829> came<00:01:35.159> with<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.340> helmet<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.119> looked

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
I came with my helmet and it looked

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.060 
I came with my helmet and it looked
terrifying<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:39.200> taking<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> apart<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.799> how<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
terrifying on taking it apart and how to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.010 
terrifying on taking it apart and how to
put<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.610> back<00:01:41.790> together<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.390> washing<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
put it back together and washing it and
stuff<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.710> thought<00:01:44.369> I'd<00:01:44.520> take<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> shortcut

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
stuff so I thought I'd take a shortcut

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.109 
stuff so I thought I'd take a shortcut
and<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.810> how<00:01:45.930> baby<00:01:46.140> wipes<00:01:46.500> work<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:50.119> just

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and see how baby wipes work so I just

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
and see how baby wipes work so I just
grabbed<00:01:51.390> some<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> my<00:01:52.439> son's<00:01:52.649> butt<00:01:52.979> wipes<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
grabbed some of my son's butt wipes and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.899 
grabbed some of my son's butt wipes and
they<00:01:54.119> worked<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.540> well<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:56.729> was

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
they worked really well and that was

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.499
