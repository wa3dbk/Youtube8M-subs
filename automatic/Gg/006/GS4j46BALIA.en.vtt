00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.279
 linen jean lebrun can finish but the rose 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 in grigny in the pas-de-calais 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.060
 but the rosette and a nursery and that's 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.900
 also a garden is a garden 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.859
 presentation of roses among the others 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.420
 plants a garden where there is a vegetable garden where 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.059
 there are rock gardens an orchard 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.340
 and then the rose bushes are scattered throughout 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.809
 all this space 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.320
 they are divided according to their use 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.110
 to the airbus stem or clusters in charming 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.820
 them in the trees or as here 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.309
 desrosiers that are used in 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.969
 groundcover because we're on a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 rock garden like the garden here offers 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.329
 several different environments 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.949
 work here and to experiment with 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 commercial varieties better also our 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.350
 creations to try them 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.810
 in all these different environments for 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.290
 know their behavior either to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.909
 crawl either climb the rose garden such 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.299
 we hear is a place where we 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.530
 collect roses 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.040
 I prefer the term garden of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.840
 rose garden roses in the garden of 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.470
 roses no longer have this aspect collection 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.990
 rosebushes in the rose garden there 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.650
 also has other plants the plants 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.860
 companions at the rose showcase 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.259
 a rose bush is very important 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.509
 the rosebush la rosa its unique beauty but 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.430
 it can also be highlighted 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.280
 we always say there is a rose 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.360
 for every person on earth every 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 human m 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.570
 at least one rose every human and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.210
 die is grown a rose bush and in 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.509
 the spirit in my mind followed by the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.770
 nursery but above all creators 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.509
 I'm trying to create things that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.869
 do not exist to goods that can 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.360
 stick that may correspond to 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.280
 new environments the creation of 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.039
 new varieties of roses is at 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.690
 half reflected I would say there are some 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.180
 basics of reflection and after there is the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.160
 chance there is inspiration you have to be 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.560
 visionary to have a difference he 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.000
 need to make a difference and have to give 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.750
 something unique to the person who 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.830
 is unique 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.220
 there are about 140 species of roses 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.910
 wild in the northern hemisphere 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.260
 it goes from the article to the zones 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.970
 tropical 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.430
 there are surely about thirty of his 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.860
 wild roses that were used in 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.420
 crossing hybridization a lot 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.840
 others have not been used yet 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.080
 are not known all these species 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.760
 botanicals carry the genes of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.220
 adaptation genes to environments 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.190
 precise where young people who give a 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.400
 morphology a precise anatomy for 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.980
 each species the creation from this 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.330
 moment it is easy because all 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.519
 these young people who are not yet present 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.430
 in modern roses are waiting 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.019
 to be integrated in the creator 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.870
 in new creative programs 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.409
 age will inevitably bring new 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.360
 characters to the roses of tomorrow so we 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.420
 let's go get some roses again 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.700
 botany that just counter 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.200
 difficult to integrate their genes into 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.530
 the new roses and 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.959
 the combination of gold genes of 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.390
 hybridization are multiple plus 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.400
 botanical species are crossed together 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.060
 plus the genes plus the combinations of 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.630
 young people will give individuals new 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.849
 and different we try to create the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.290
 natural rose must be worn 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.360
 necessarily beautiful roses always 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.720
 as opulent colored but with a 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.970
 aspect with a character that is very 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.390
 very important is the resistance to 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.180
 diseases and cold resistance to 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.360
 the environment to create a rose bush he 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.340
 it takes about two minutes 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.670
 the gesture is simple or levy pollen pr 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.400
 of a variety and put it on the 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.320
 pistil of another variety that's very 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.300
 easy it's very short that's what 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.550
 bee in nature but after 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.870
 the big job is the semi of the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.350
 seed the true dimension of the seed of 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.900
 sowing the care that must be provided to the 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.490
 little baby rozier who are born and who 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.560
 will develop which will figure that 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.780
 will develop in different 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.380
 culture environments and that's fine 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.880
 last long 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.900
 this is called observation and 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.970
 the selection will take about 6 7 to 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.389
 10 or even 12 years for a rose bush 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:55.180
 among others water may come out of 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.990
 this selection program and take the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.440
 garden route 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.560
 creation is a way of 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.090
 to concretize to spend 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.080
 dreams and then 7.1 means of 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.840
 speak out 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.410
 already the creator of roses today 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.870
 can very well become a creator of the 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.639
 laugh tomorrow from another in another 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.740
 species because it is first envied 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.740
 to create who's invading him
