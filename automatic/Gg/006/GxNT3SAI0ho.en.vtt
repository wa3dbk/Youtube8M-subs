00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200 
both players pretty much doing the same
exact<00:01:50.189> thing<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.520> far<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.880> looks<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.180> though

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
exact thing so far it looks as though

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999 
exact thing so far it looks as though
june<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:52.320> bit<00:01:52.470> ahead<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.950> that

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
june we is a little bit ahead on that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.280 
june we is a little bit ahead on that
extractor<00:01:53.880> count<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.750> by<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.960> time<00:01:55.079> that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
extractor count but by the time that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.039 
extractor count but by the time that
those<00:01:55.590> two<00:01:55.829> armies<00:01:56.220> engage<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.630> should<00:01:57.899> be

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
those two armies engage it should be

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.410 
those two armies engage it should be
about<00:01:58.229> even<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.520> will<00:01:59.939> come<00:02:00.149> down

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
about even so it really will come down

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.810 
about even so it really will come down
to<00:02:00.450> micro<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.829> battles<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.340> far<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.670> we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
to micro in these battles so far as we

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
to micro in these battles so far as we
now<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.119> three<00:02:03.360> extractors<00:02:03.780> quickly<00:02:04.140> making

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
now see three extractors quickly making

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.670 
now see three extractors quickly making
its<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.219> both<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.030> these<00:02:06.329> sides

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
its way in on both of these sides

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
its way in on both of these sides
overlords<00:02:07.680> now<00:02:07.829> being<00:02:08.130> trained<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:09.060> just

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270

banelings that is a key question now i
have<00:02:18.810> seen<00:02:19.140> players<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.890> opted<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.090> get

have seen players and opted to not get

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
have seen players and opted to not get
the<00:02:21.900> metabolic<00:02:22.440> boost<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.860> go<00:02:23.040> for<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> roach

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
the metabolic boost and go for a roach

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.700 
the metabolic boost and go for a roach
warren<00:02:23.970> instead<00:02:24.270> as<00:02:24.420> roaches<00:02:25.200> are<00:02:25.350> fairly

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
warren instead as roaches are fairly

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.340 
warren instead as roaches are fairly
strong<00:02:26.250> against<00:02:27.090> zerglings<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.990> we'll<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.320> if

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
strong against zerglings so we'll see if

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.080 
strong against zerglings so we'll see if
we're<00:02:28.890> going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.160> any<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.520> no<00:02:29.850> both

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
players now going into queens and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.320 
players now going into queens and
zerglings<00:02:32.220> are<00:02:32.370> ready<00:02:32.550> metabolic<00:02:33.030> was<00:02:33.180> now

zerglings are ready metabolic was now

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.449 
zerglings are ready metabolic was now
being<00:02:33.540> trained<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.050> by<00:02:34.290> June<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.709> we<00:02:35.160> should<00:02:35.190> be

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
being trained in by June we we should be

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.980 
being trained in by June we we should be
getting<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.730> metabolic<00:02:36.180> who<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.360> coming<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.840> in

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
getting a metabolic who is coming in in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.949 
getting a metabolic who is coming in in
just<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.500> moment<00:02:37.890> there<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.790> go<00:02:39.000> coming<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.780> from

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
just a moment there we go coming in from

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.570 
just a moment there we go coming in from
strife<00:02:40.200> Co<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.620> yeah<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.130> going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.550> a

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
strife Co so yeah it is going to be a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.870 
strife Co so yeah it is going to be a
pure<00:02:41.990> mirror<00:02:42.990> match<00:02:43.290> as<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.100> production<00:02:44.610> tabs

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
pure mirror match as the production tabs

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.810 
pure mirror match as the production tabs
are<00:02:45.180> almost<00:02:45.630> identical<00:02:46.160> within<00:02:47.160> two<00:02:47.550> or<00:02:47.580> three

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
are almost identical within two or three

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.540 
are almost identical within two or three
seconds<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.660> each<00:02:48.930> other<00:02:49.220> overlords<00:02:50.220> are<00:02:50.340> now

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
seconds of each other overlords are now

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.580 
seconds of each other overlords are now
being<00:02:50.790> sporadically<00:02:51.360> placed<00:02:51.720> across<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.380> map

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
being sporadically placed across the map

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.160 
being sporadically placed across the map
so<00:02:53.430> what<00:02:53.640> you're<00:02:53.760> going<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.540> overlords

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
so what you're going to see is overlords

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.570 
so what you're going to see is overlords
pretty<00:02:55.560> much<00:02:55.709> highlighting<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.220> entire

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
pretty much highlighting the entire

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.400 
pretty much highlighting the entire
center<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> map<00:02:57.420> both<00:02:57.690> sides<00:02:57.959> will<00:02:58.260> be

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
center of the map both sides will be

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.170 
center of the map both sides will be
able<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.739> see<00:02:58.950> when<00:02:59.430> another<00:02:59.730> player<00:02:59.940> is

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
able to see when another player is

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.550 
able to see when another player is
trying<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.510> come<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.110> can<00:03:01.260> already<00:03:01.350> see

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
trying to come in you can already see

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.530 
trying to come in you can already see

low<00:03:09.810> grounds<00:03:10.140> on<00:03:10.230> june<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:10.590> now<00:03:10.709> going<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.130> for

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
low grounds on june we now going in for

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.460 
low grounds on june we now going in for
an<00:03:11.489> expansion<00:03:11.880> attempt<00:03:12.360> now<00:03:12.810> I'm<00:03:13.080> trying<00:03:13.380> to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
an expansion attempt now I'm trying to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.810 
an expansion attempt now I'm trying to
hide<00:03:13.620> along<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:13.950> backside<00:03:14.220> he<00:03:14.370> does<00:03:14.610> see

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
hide along that backside he does see

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.180 
hide along that backside he does see
that<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.209> Overlord<00:03:15.660> there<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.080> now<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.770> one

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
that one Overlord there and now that one

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.830 
that one Overlord there and now that one
drone<00:03:17.520> was<00:03:17.730> able<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.060> start<00:03:18.180> mineral<00:03:18.540> passing

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
drone was able to start mineral passing

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.789 
drone was able to start mineral passing
through<00:03:18.989> there<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.230> those<00:03:19.380> servings<00:03:19.709> I'm

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
through there so those servings I'm
