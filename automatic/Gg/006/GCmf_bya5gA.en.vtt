we're gonna try to work all of that air
out<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.960> our<00:01:55.170> dough<00:01:57.740> by<00:01:58.740> kneading<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
out of our dough by kneading it and you

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.550 
out of our dough by kneading it and you
can<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.820> now<00:02:00.829> yeah<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.219> nice
