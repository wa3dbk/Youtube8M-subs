00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.629
 welcome to an anus can podcast 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.629
 chapter 5 earth one 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.009
 on all relief relief and on pieces 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.949
 is then sometimes in climate zones and landscape 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.810
 together that is through my earth and this is 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.470
 the part that you now see in image of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.230
 at each interrogation of graph also 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.769
 exam material and we start with paragraph 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.240
 2 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.669
 the atlantic ocean is becoming 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.770
 bigger and we first look at what are 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.710
 the central questions therefore topicality 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.690
 principle it is that why is it 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 important that we have the geological 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.309
 time scale 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.719
 know where to place and what time you 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.020
 knows the earth and where is it important 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.600
 to map this and look first 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.660
 just an animation of how the earth 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.780
 Yes 400 million years ago 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.000
 with continents that moves that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.730
 arises from clover technique and sweet 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.439
 subduction and diverging plates and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.820
 mid-ocean ridges 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.720
 but that will come in the next few gifts 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 back that it took place that way 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.740
 the future will continue to do that is one 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.170
 given 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.180
 Well you just saw pangea and you see 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 very good that now brazil latin 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.880
 America comes loose from Africa that it is in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.920
 malawi is now formed by the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.920
 collision of india 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.030
 and if you go to the future then see 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 you know that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.560
 Australia is moving even further 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 in the end antarctica therefore the South Pole 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.570
 it comes up 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.930
 America suddenly against Russia 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.460
 so actually you can from europe 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.810
 just for pleasure you just walk 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.310
 this keeps on going and how 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.939
 comes the call is topical 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 at least the calculations of 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.979
 professor always has week after that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.380
 found that he found it by chance 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.950
 that brazil very nice 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.069
 the coastline on the west coast of africa 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.200
 he says that must fit or early 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.659
 have sat together and has too 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.260
 investigated what was in the soil and hand 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:22.230
 of plant remains and a soil 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.389
 He has found that that remains 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.829
 planet to each other or could eat them 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.980
 You stuck again continents together 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:32.040
 sat so that the shifting 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.019
 The theory has since been confirmed 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.000
 by satellite images that we annually 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.260
 take pictures of the continents and we 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.030
 see it 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.030
 shifts centimeter by centimeter 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.879
 starting from how it used to do and 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:49.010
 that it will stay that way in the future 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.010
 do then current affairs principle 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.209
 to Earth is 4.6 billion years old and 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.069
 do you want to be able to watch well then 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.859
 you have to divide your own into time scales 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.239
 because in principle it is too much to 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.919
 contain 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.560
 maybe you are running the world through 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.530
 university just a little wise 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.989
 14 encyclopedias in succession 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.530
 thick encyclopedias of 4 500 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.590
 pages in that when you view 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.209
 what the modern age is that there are 14 th 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.669
 part is the last page and then it 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.949
 last point is approximately where the 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:28.470
 people has a reasonable influence 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.750
 leave one last page of those 14 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.150
 Sharing is something that people agree with 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.769
 so that is how long the earth has been and through that 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.659
 to be classified in this type of time scales 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.220
 it becomes a bit clearer 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.919
 we are already here that it is peer 80 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.049
 million yes go for example the chalk 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.540
 this is from the cambrium make sure you 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.560
 you can still p but that is so far back 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.319
 then we actually see very little of that 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.120
 you don't actually have to know them either 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.739
 Well we know and you still get this ticket 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.739
 once with me they are all in 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.069
 and every period is unique in every period 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.889
 is my own characteristics 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.329
 tip or many little volcanic eruptions 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.879
 has a certain composition of the 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.039
 atmosphere yes presence of nitrogen 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.370
 oxygen carbon and that ratio 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:19.260
 the climate between those three too 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.180
 importance and potential of life 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.570
 what it lived and what was 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.570
 possible 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.520
 this is a very complicated one 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.039
 and you have to be able to do them all 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.070
 know if you are going to study directing 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:41.039
 but that doesn't matter to you 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.740
 importance is more this ticket and it state 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:47.909
 pretty good at relieving you at least the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.349
 times of and then not the chapters 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.539
 has the main time but the period 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:55.860
 so the cambrium 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.180
 the quarter you get it after this etc. 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.599
 what 's so special about it makes you 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.960
 to do an internship in order and at the 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:07.289
 hand of the life that came before that 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.599
 you examine a lot of things but also 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.560
 for in the future 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:15.089
 for example here you see an example 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.250
 from a symbolic and in the carboon 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:20.240
 you have lots of amphibians and was hot 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.800
 then you see in the fossils you see 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.419
 leaves back in plants and call this 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.010
 they guide fossils 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.229
 so you were allowed in a piece of stone and 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.849
 trioliet then you know 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.190
 travel so lives in a cambrium 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.560
 all pieces of stone in which a tribute 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.900
 sit that comes from the cambrium 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.589
 And that's why the guide is so fond of it 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:44.010
 interest because you can then and lead out 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:45.870
 what time the rock or the tree 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.219
 what you investigate where it comes from 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.810
 and how long it has been in old age 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.380
 you can determine in two ways you can 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.010
 the absolute determination is simply measuring in 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.010
 radioactivity 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.310
 have all substances on earth and 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.680
 radioactivity irradiation and it takes 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.810
 as it gets older 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.839
 so if you have less radiation from wood 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.180
 it's also older and you can do it relatively 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:14.039
 view compared to guides 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.770
 so sealer you say to dr 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.630
 Triple showed those who have amphibians 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.630
 who is older than that 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.130
 and what can we learn from everyone 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.480
 climate change case 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:33.200
 if we have the same kind of compositions 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:37.560
 retrieve and even sort 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.240
 vegetation etc and in animals and you see 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.340
 the climate is changing and then it has 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.910
 once the grain the same way then 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.920
 can you 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.900
 predict where we are going 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.140
 go if they like 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:53.040
 world are also evolution 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.840
 also an exit atmosphere course life now 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.700
 also people who go to march what is 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.940
 there an atmosphere and we can 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:03.990
 Anyway and then started creating and too 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.880
 for kind of what atmosphere is good 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.300
 for us and what has consequences and what 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.370
 the result becomes life think of 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.790
 take co2 that it is also bad for that 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.790
 coral 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.090
 we can also look at energy sources 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.590
 in what period are there now 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.720
 made fossil fuels 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.590
 produced and can use it 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.700
 to make 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:32.190
 and where is it even more short then 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:35.160
 topicality and see you based on it 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.080
 predict the future in the past and point 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.070
 two and three by looking closely at 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.410
 Past 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.620
 And to understand that you can be the future 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:46.020
 perhaps better predict and understand 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:49.640
 and also you can on the basis of age 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.600
 see how continents behave from rocks 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.420
 have moved changes 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.220
 and so on 

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.560
 this is paragraph 2 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.320
 also view the rest of the podcast from 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.150
 this chapter of main success 

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.530
 also from all other domains too 

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.330
 podcast 

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.920
 made that can help you with it 

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.920
 learn success with it
