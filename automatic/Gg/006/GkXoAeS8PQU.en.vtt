 friends hello with you Michael jumpers all 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.910
 times greets you on a new channel by 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.370
 bodybuilding 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.499
 bodybuilding and sports nutrition now 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.900
 only here therefore subscribe 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.280
 to not miss anything and today we 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.260
 talk to you about complex 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.930
 amino acids as you can see they 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.780
 presented in different forms this capsules 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.880
 liquid powder tablets 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.430
 we will understand how they differ from each other 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.680
 friend also comparable with proteins and 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.680
 find out when to take them better 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.570
 amino acids are the building blocks of which 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.430
 squirrels are made up if you don't know what 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.520
 such proteins please look 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.060
 This video we will understand in detail 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.920
 This question will know what functions of protein 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.840
 have our body amino acids 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.989
 there are various there are replaceable there are 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.670
 essential amino acids and complexes they 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.700
 just consist of both types 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.980
 amino acids essential amino acids 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.079
 those that are not synthesized by the body and 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.330
 must necessarily come along with 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.670
 food if you eat 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.220
 wrong unbalanced not 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.250
 rationally then your body will 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.290
 lack of essential amino acids is 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.780
 manifested by various diseases right up 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.820
 to insanity but it is extreme and 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.260
 this is only possible if you 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.780
 vegan 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.700
 before shooting this movie we 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.130
 Instagram asked you to throw us 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.710
 their questions about amino acids that 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.310
 you are interested here is one of the most 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.040
 popular questions of our subscribers 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.150
 Is it possible to do without amino acids 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.180
 if you use protein and what 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.180
 the difference of amino acids from protein these 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.799
 questions asked us Andrei volunteer 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.430
 Catherine Maximova 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.650
 well and some other subscribers well 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.000
 let's compare what amino acids 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.799
 differ from powdered protein that 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.710
 need to do first when you 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.680
 take the bank any complex 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.280
 amino acids, that is, you need to look not at 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.560
 beautiful bright logos are so bright 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.200
 names which 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.890
 encourages you to buy and vice versa 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.260
 turn on the back and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.420
 look at the composition of a very important point 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.330
 I want to draw your special to this 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.840
 attention are the ingredients indicated 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.900
 as part of the product they are written here by 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.870
 order of their decrease in this product then 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.430
 there in the first place we see the hydrolyzate 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.430
 whey protein gelatin what is it 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.170
 It tells us that that is the most 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.299
 high content in this product 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.069
 exactly whey protein hydrolyzate 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.120
 and then there is gelatin but very often 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.580
 the manufacturer does not indicate in which 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.530
 exactly the percentage of these 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.560
 ingredients are presented in this 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.360
 product 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.200
 you need to understand that buying complex 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.930
 amino acids 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.480
 you often buy just protein 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.670
 either compressed into a tablet or 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.250
 packaged in gelatin capsule 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.739
 it may be different may be isolate 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.570
 concentrate or hydrolyzed but we never 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.000
 answered the question of what amino acids 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.150
 differ from protein but essentially nothing 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.090
 don't differ you overpay for 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.329
 amino acids and overpay you more 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.370
 for your convenience and comfort that you need 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.920
 take some pills throw them 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.660
 freak drink a glass of water and when 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.430
 you use yourself 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.069
 protein shakes you need to have 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.019
 necks with you all this stirs drink 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.109
 then wash the shaker somewhere to put not 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.340
 forget it at work or somewhere else 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.019
 in fact for this you all and 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.209
 overpay for your comfort and 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.060
 convenience also amino acid complexes 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.250
 do not contain can be harmful and 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.319
 dyes and flavors which 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.489
 added to proteins and powders so they 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.019
 were tastier but if you want to get 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.680
 maximum effect of amino acid 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.930
 complexes 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.870
 choose products that are 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.850
 made on the basis of hydrolyzate 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.700
 whey protein they digest 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.430
 fastest and their advisable 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.829
 use before and after training when 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.380
 the body is in dire need of 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.360
 amino acids for restoring 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.580
 not if you don't get your due 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.110
 the amount of protein in your diet is well 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.600
 about 2 grams of protein per kilogram 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.690
 body weight you can additionally 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.460
 take amino acids before eating one more 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.150
 the question we were often asked in 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.380
 instagram 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.270
 about serving size but since amino acids 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.730
 it 's still part of the protein 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.950
 then the portion here is also calculated 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.740
 as debilka or in particular as for 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.860
 powdered protein that is up to 30 grams 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.610
 for a single portion it turns out that in such 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.470
 jar in which 280 capsules are contained 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.430
 about 10 full 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.670
 30 thunder portions of a squirrel but such 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.100
 the product is most likely suitable for 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.160
 which money does not matter much 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.130
 Well, they do not like to knead myself 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.780
 protein shakes 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.580
 also in the market of sports nutrition there 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.610
 amino acid complexes which 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.100
 presented in free form what is it 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.250
 it means that they are not connected between 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.050
 any chemical bonds 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.950
 they are absorbed much faster even than 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.840
 hydra lization of the Jurassic exact protein and these 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.940
 amino acids are represented by products 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.190
 companies olimp here are yellow banks which 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.350
 you see below well and a separate story 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.170
 these are liquid amino acid complexes 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.240
 but be careful with them in their composition 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.060
 contains a large number of simple 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.940
 carbohydrate that is sugars essential 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.800
 the source of protein there is a simple 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.330
 scientifically called gelatin 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.700
 collagen hydrolyzate 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.720
 it is poor in its amino acid 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.700
 composition therefore 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.860
 slightly affects the increase 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.140
 muscle mass and more effect 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.140
 it is to strengthen the joints of the ligamentous 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.390
 apparatus but from liquid amino acids can 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.590
 make a nice drink by diluting them 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.600
 water and drink during exercise I 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.630
 tried to answer almost everything 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.440
 your questions and amino acid complexes 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.720
 I hope this will help you to do 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.990
 right choice and don't forget that you 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.460
 are on the bodybuilding channel 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.310
 subscribe also subscribe to 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.380

 ask us questions every day 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.830
 comments with you was Mikhail jumpers 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:39.310
 happy hello everyone with you bristles 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:43.330
 Alexander seems to be clear on the new channel here 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:46.450
 cool dudes so today it will go 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.490
 I will tell you about creatine 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:52.710
 stereotypes 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.710
 which you have to clean and
