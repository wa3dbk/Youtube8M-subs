00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello youtube friends today I bring you one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.839
 comparison between the super screen 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 amoled hd and the super amoled plus of 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.030
 super amoled hd is in the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:19.830
 galaxy s3 with 306 pixels per inch and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.619
 a resolution of 1280 x 720 and 48 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 inches of the galaxy s2 is found 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.110
 with 4.3 inches at a resolution of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.810
 800 x 480 and 217 pixels per inch 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.390
 let's compare how the letters look 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.740
 it is without increasing in both navigating in 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.470
 both 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.220
 efficiency efficiency and color 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.410
 let's start with the color 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.070
 let's put the same image for 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.070
 compare it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100
 that of the fruit is 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.719
 both screens are extraordinary are 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.689
 very good friends overcome the super 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.979
 amoled I like what if they saturate a 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.670
 Tiny colors but they are very 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.790
 efficient 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.439
 we see that the super amoled plus gives more 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.119
 realism to color because it does not saturate it 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.680
 so much but the super I love the amoled hd 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 as it saturates a little the color seems 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 which looks much better if we leave them 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.380
 two the two without increasing we verify that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.720
 the 217 pixels per inch in the lemon 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.750
 this 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.450
 well you notice there is a little bit of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.950
 distortion in the and east and in 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.680
 change the super amoled hd we see that 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.900
 although much I did not draw near 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.990
 will distinguish both 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.470
 if we compare an image of whites and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.320
 blue here we would have the same image 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 we see how I told you that the super amoled 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.280
 hd saturates the color more by what we see 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.670
 here that would be more blue and here a lot 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 whiter we see also in the orange 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.030
 there is green here 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.480
 is 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.990
 a little bit more real here and here has 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.100
 saturated as more with the orange 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:23.320
 if we compare it with 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.030
 with this image that are various colors 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.390
 particularly right now the super 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.950
 amoled plus gives much more realism to 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.489
 the photo 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.900
 and the super amoled hd gives it as more 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.150
 fiction we compare here same mind as 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.450
 the white saturates more in this screen 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.610
 the brown of this is also saturated 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.610
 we see the sky also that is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.400
 saturated in the hd 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.610
 but both screens are great as 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.450
 I was saying you can see the resolution 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.050
 in this galaxy s2 a little bit more than in 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.460
 the galaxy s3 that we do not have any 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.390
 problem and now we do see 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.690
 a video the video that brings the galaxy s 4 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.020
 to see the efficiency I have it here 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.020
 here 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.450
 here we would not have both at once 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.090
 we see how the brands saturn more than one 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.209
 color the super amoled plus if I had a 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.540
 a little more pixels per inch 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.680
 it would be noticed 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.680
 a lot more 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.670
 if we check here by colors 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.890
 that is no longer 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.709
 super amoled light particularly though 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.930
 the Texas border with 41 of 4 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:16.650
 inches with 8 because it looks better but 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.320
 for saturation and all that saturates more 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.060
 is that is in why it would be a 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.820
 point in favor in this one 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.490
 but now 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.490
 if we sail in 2 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.150
 here I have some photos that I have 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.150
 Discharged 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.660
 we would have to open being 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.550
 fans on mobile 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.420
 so we can see the resolution without 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.110
 expand how the two would look 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:52.200
 well that 3 opened faster to have 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.390
 two more cores and two megawatts plus the 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.849
 processor then open hand here 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.660
 we would have to increase 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.230
 we would take the same news 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.230
 here 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:14.400
 we would have the galaxy s2 as we see 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.740
 more or less difficult to read it but if not 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.200
 we take with the galaxy s3 we do not have 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.030
 no problem 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.860
 if the difference is not enough 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.060
 from the super amoled plus to the super 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.650
 amoled hd 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.860
 and we would not be very well 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.630
 as we surpass it of plus although the 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.600
 we expand the letters to that note 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.350
 more that resolution is lower and here 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.160
 we also noticed that the super 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.560
 amoled hd gives much more white than 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.580
 super amoled plus 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:55.039
 if we check compare 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.039
 angry birds from afar 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.290
 without expanding on either of the two 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.290
 screens 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.600
 here we also check the how 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.600
 we could 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.590
 both are very efficient 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.760
 and now when we move on we're going to 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.760
 check 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.880
 the super amoled 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.500
 plus there we would have the two broad 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.689
 lower you will have verified that the 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.580
 super amoled plus 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:44.699
 the green bugs do not just exist in 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.639
 the eyes and on the face or nothing the change 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:50.779
 in health a moleta hd we are 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.779
 we distinguish much better 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:01.699
 and this is in terms of effectiveness and already 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.689
 stop the two cameras of both phones 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:07.089
 with clear screen 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:10.059
 and here a small and short video 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:12.689
 to compare these two screens that 

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:15.849
 they respond very well to the touch 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:18.390
 simply that we play a little 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:20.490
 without almost touching the finger 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.650
 me before I put the plastic to 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.150
 this is one thing to say without 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:29.610
 touch already answered and both are very 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.000
 good screens and thank you very much and you 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.680
 I liked the video I like and if 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.300
 he likes it a lot so subscribe to me 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.300
 channel thank you to another
