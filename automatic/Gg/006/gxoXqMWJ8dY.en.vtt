on behalf of expert village I'm Eric
Williams<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.659> I'm<00:00:03.840> here<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.200> tell<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.440> about

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
Williams and I'm here to tell you about

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.450 
Williams and I'm here to tell you about
reading<00:00:05.250> music<00:00:06.290> so<00:00:07.290> following<00:00:07.770> up<00:00:08.040> with<00:00:08.069> our

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
reading music so following up with our

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.419 
reading music so following up with our
discussion<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.480> flats<00:00:10.190> let's<00:00:11.190> take<00:00:11.400> a

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
discussion of the flats let's take a

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879 
discussion of the flats let's take a
look<00:00:11.639> at<00:00:11.730> sharps<00:00:12.150> if<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.139> move<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> next

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
look at sharps if we move to the next

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.510 
look at sharps if we move to the next
measure<00:00:14.299> we<00:00:15.299> have<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:16.020> F<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:17.310> know<00:00:17.490> that

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
measure we have an F and we know that

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.790 
measure we have an F and we know that
because<00:00:17.910> we're<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> bass<00:00:18.510> clef<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
because we're in the bass clef and the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.130 
because we're in the bass clef and the
bass<00:00:20.039> clef<00:00:20.250> has<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.820> dot<00:00:21.029> above<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.840> below

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
bass clef has the dot above and below

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
bass clef has the dot above and below
the<00:00:22.170> F<00:00:22.650> line<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.850> that's<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.119> dead<00:00:24.330> giveaway

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the F line so that's a dead giveaway

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.750 
the F line so that's a dead giveaway
that<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.170> F<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.250> want<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> try

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
that that's F but if you want to try

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
that that's F but if you want to try
you're<00:00:27.060> good<00:00:27.330> boys<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.869> fine<00:00:28.260> hallways

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
you're good boys do fine hallways

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.939 
you're good boys do fine hallways
that'll<00:00:29.699> also<00:00:29.880> bring<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.949> anyway

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that'll also bring you to have anyway

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.170 
that'll also bring you to have anyway
here's<00:00:32.430> F<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.480> very<00:00:33.719> next<00:00:34.050> note<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.739> an<00:00:35.399> F<00:00:35.640> with

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
here's F the very next note is an F with

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.810 
here's F the very next note is an F with
a<00:00:36.210> sharp<00:00:36.719> symbol<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.469> front<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.489> means

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
a sharp symbol in front of it that means

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.650 
a sharp symbol in front of it that means
to<00:00:39.000> raise<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.719> F<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.230> half<00:00:40.469> step<00:00:40.739> higher<00:00:41.660> then

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
to raise the F a half step higher then

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.040 
to raise the F a half step higher then
the<00:00:42.690> very<00:00:42.989> next<00:00:43.110> note<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.920> also<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.820> F<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.899> we

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the very next note is also on F but we

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.889 
the very next note is also on F but we
have<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.530> natural<00:00:47.070> sign<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.210> front<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
have that natural sign in front of the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.610 
have that natural sign in front of the
app<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.640> I'll<00:00:51.030> bed<00:00:51.390> by<00:00:51.629> now<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.899> understand

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
app so I'll bed by now you understand

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
app so I'll bed by now you understand
why<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:53.879> let<00:00:54.059> me<00:00:54.090> tell<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
why that's there but let me tell you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
why that's there but let me tell you
anyway<00:00:55.699> this<00:00:56.699> F<00:00:57.059> sharp<00:00:57.500> would<00:00:58.500> normally

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
anyway this F sharp would normally

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.569 
anyway this F sharp would normally
impact<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.480> F<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> sharp<00:01:02.070> also

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
impact this F and make it a sharp also

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.289 
impact this F and make it a sharp also
because<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> rules<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:04.019> accidentals

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
because that is the rules of accidentals

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.910 
because that is the rules of accidentals
accidentals<00:01:06.299> by<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> way<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.680> name<00:01:07.890> for

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
accidentals by the way is the name for

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.850 
accidentals by the way is the name for
all<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.580> things<00:01:08.909> we're<00:01:09.150> talking<00:01:09.330> about

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
all these things we're talking about

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.289 
all these things we're talking about
accidentals<00:01:10.860> incorporate<00:01:11.460> flat<00:01:11.760> symbols

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
accidentals incorporate flat symbols

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.520 
accidentals incorporate flat symbols
sharp<00:01:13.020> symbols<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.909> Natural<00:01:14.909> Science<00:01:15.530> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sharp symbols and Natural Science so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.690 
sharp symbols and Natural Science so
then<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.640> accidental<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.049> F<00:01:19.259> sharp<00:01:19.830> would

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
then the accidental on the F sharp would

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.840 
then the accidental on the F sharp would
normally<00:01:21.119> make<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.750> F<00:01:21.869> sharp<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:23.070> since

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
normally make this an F sharp but since

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030 
normally make this an F sharp but since
we<00:01:24.030> don't<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.960> case<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.350> don't<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.830> that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
we don't in this case we don't want that

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.310 
we don't in this case we don't want that
to<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.369> sharp<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.750> use<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> natural

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to be sharp we have to use the natural

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.569 
to be sharp we have to use the natural
sign<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.990> reduce<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.320> back<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.890> regular<00:01:32.130> app

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
sign to reduce this back to regular app

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.340 
sign to reduce this back to regular app
so<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.509> F<00:01:33.810> F<00:01:34.500> sharp<00:01:34.920> F<00:01:35.340> natural<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.350> again

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so we have F F sharp F natural and again

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 
so we have F F sharp F natural and again
the<00:01:37.920> reason<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.460> don't<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> natural<00:01:39.360> sign

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the reason we don't have a natural sign

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.960 
the reason we don't have a natural sign
in<00:01:39.869> front<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.409> F<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.759> it's

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
in front of this F is because it's

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.749 
in front of this F is because it's
understood<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.079> plain<00:01:43.350> F<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.610> we

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
understood that it's just plain F and we

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.310 
understood that it's just plain F and we
don't<00:01:44.850> need<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.270> put<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> natural<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.020> front<00:01:46.079> of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
don't need to put a natural in front of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440 
don't need to put a natural in front of
it<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.770> would<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.070> confuse<00:01:47.399> people<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it that would just confuse people and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.469 
it that would just confuse people and
you<00:01:49.049> don't<00:01:49.170> want<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.920> we've<00:01:50.579> got<00:01:50.670> F<00:01:50.939> F

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you don't want that so we've got F F

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.289 
you don't want that so we've got F F
sharp<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:53.009> F<00:01:53.250> natural<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:54.090> all

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
sharp and then F natural because all

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.780 
sharp and then F natural because all
this<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.750> already<00:01:55.020> confusing<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.890> but

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
this is already confusing now but

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.670 
this is already confusing now but
hopefully<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.659> makes<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:58.110> sense<00:01:58.409> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
hopefully this makes more sense that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.100 
hopefully this makes more sense that
explains<00:01:59.430> flats<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.180> sharps<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.170> naturals
