 good ladies, here I bring you some 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.890
 few curiosities of the legend of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.679
 zelda if you already know them well for you 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.259
 let's start in the link to the past we can 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.199
 see three colorful torches which 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.390
 they bear great resemblance to mesh 2 the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.029
 zukas have a resemblance to the mask of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.180
 camaro de majora's mask the tower of the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.090
 city ​​clock represents good and evil 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.070
 if we look at it from two perspectives of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.730
 day we can see what can be said 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.989
 a demon and at night an angel 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.390
 curiously in the house of giovanni there 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.360
 gold coins when what is handled 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.460
 as money are also blondes 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070
 mentions that light and shadow are both 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 sides of the same coin so it is 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.000
 can say that the same mistake is made 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.460
 or you can also say that the coins 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 they could be so to speak a simple 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.590
 accessory since the blonde is what 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.020
 We drive in stewarts word if we ask

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 the intimate clothes in wind waker we could 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.880
 say that the prince eats and carries the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.969
 image of a nape 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.280
 in animal pair crossing 3ds we can see 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.200
 the mask that leads to kill in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.520

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.069
 we launch will give us three options that if 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.619
 the bomb was silver gold or a bomb 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.450
 ordinary if we answer with 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.729
 the truth will reward us with a greater 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.979
 pump capacity this makes a 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.709
 reference to the legend of the lake and the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.140
