pointing<00:04:32.160> up<00:04:32.580> there<00:04:32.820> but<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.180> course<00:04:33.390> for<00:04:33.750> this

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
pointing up there but of course for this

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.680 
pointing up there but of course for this
figure<00:04:34.200> it's<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.500> little<00:04:34.710> held<00:04:34.950> back<00:04:35.010> so<00:04:35.690> I'm

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
figure it's a little held back so I'm

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.070 
figure it's a little held back so I'm
kind<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.680> wish<00:04:37.800> they<00:04:38.270> they<00:04:39.270> really<00:04:39.450> get<00:04:39.990> the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
kind of wish they they really get the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.260 
kind of wish they they really get the
hair<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.920> same<00:04:41.340> exact<00:04:41.730> style<00:04:41.910> kind<00:04:42.210> of

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.180 
hair to that same exact style kind of
cool<00:04:42.480> but<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.960> guess<00:04:43.500> they<00:04:43.620> had<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.770> restrict

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
cool but I guess they had to restrict

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.090 
cool but I guess they had to restrict
themselves<00:04:44.400> for<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:46.080> helmet<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.770> helmet<00:04:46.860> is

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
themselves for the helmet the helmet is

really nice it is removable very soft

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.150 
really nice it is removable very soft
plastic<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:50.640> it<00:04:50.820> slip<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.300> on<00:04:51.420> there<00:04:51.890> very<00:04:52.890> very

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160
