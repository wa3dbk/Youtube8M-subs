00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
 Hello dear readers 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.340
 Now I would like to show you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.949
 like a gate 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:10.299
 correlate new generation 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.519
 devices 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.469
 by speed 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.900
 process of law 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.340
 we have a motorola and 30 on the left to list the devices 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.409
 incredible press 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.159
 the first thing you notice 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.649
 Tao speed and smoothness and not matzo 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.309
 seemingly pay attention even 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.500
 discuss well 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 but if we move in the hands of peep programs 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 besides for him there is such a difficult 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.100
 for the animation netsid strike 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090
 that is, Libya, so here's your fingers to do something 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.530
 can you believe that 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.960
 finger movements and prana images 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.309
 out of sync growing procedure 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.360
 well because it can be seen here is why a couple 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.970
 scroll 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.870
 see yes 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.870
 that the press does not have time 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 another thing but in motorola on order 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.140
 here she is here too, too 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.170
 debts have a small political analyst new 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.170
 significantly less 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 but also see 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.260
 But the percentage of me personally, the situation is 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.460
 from old parats 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.420
 nothing 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 I did not bother it at all 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.910
 We used the little things actually Pavel 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:41.670
 does 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090
 and clever 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.010
 so insignificant to me 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.790
 percentage on that 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.570
 in general country performance 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.450
 quite difficult given the fact that 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.110
 slave 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.420
 operating system android current 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.470
 versions 2 and 2 2 and 3 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.410
 it is not optimized to work with 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.080
 dual core processor arm 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.630
 processors post so here 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.380
 such a very strange situation no matter how we 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.309
 wanted to rot 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.219
 Anyway, such a big open 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.719
 percentage of dual-core devices 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.539
 processors we will not get 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.409
 Nevertheless, there is a difference, for example 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.679
 food min app 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.559
 The percentage this version of one usually weighs 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.589
 200 megabytes if memory serves 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.859
 Happen the date of their supercar version 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.459
 casters 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.200
 special processes 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.959
 will hold the game 2 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.959
 and in this case you can see the difference 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.189
 true 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.510
 for three countries street on may 25 says ilya abud 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.829
 previous generation teleforum 10 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.489
 more expensive let's see the difference 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.329
 eg 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.329
 at startup 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.429
 so that's why there you upload 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.539
 we can try 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.539
 with day 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:19.239
 in principle, everything is pretty normal everything 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.029
 goes fine with 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.919
 if we talk about a in the floor 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.999
 but of course the victims on the phone 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.479
 in motorola presented much better 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.199
 better texture better 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.679
 as more polygons were added 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.259
 accordingly as them 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.839
 better picture 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.759
 defeat on the asset cup has all 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.239
 such other 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.239
 in the protocol is bad 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:53.839
 m 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.949
 why do you need to show speed 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.889
 just now it's synthetic tests 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.639
 do not want 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.419
 In this case, the explosion showed the result. 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.649
 thousand people 400 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.739
 and in the case of an address of two and a half and above 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.009
 we can try a new one 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.529
 launch browser new work speed 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.979
 in the browser basically the same 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.129
 because there 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.129
 overseas browser per year 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.240
 loads 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.830
 everywhere will 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.680
 the only belly again 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.439
 Can be seen 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:46.490
 that the guests are not matzo and higher even here 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.740
 browser gave momot 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.779
 true scrolling talking 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.219
 less if there is any talk 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.159
 general impressions 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.409
 fell out 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.729
 principle roll speed work 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.729
 compared 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.240
 it works about the same tons 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.389
 I have some kind of such 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.830
 and improvement from the face is not 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.580
 I see 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.719
 maybe you can see you 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.719
 video shows better 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.449
 available download speeds provided 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.270
 that I have one channel at home 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.020
 Internet is also a mole 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.110
 I'm madly right 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.610
 the percentage that show them 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.319
 they say, fast launch by hand 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.990
 it's hard to compare again 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.119
 since every time on the interface 

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:52.120
 respectively 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.120
 celebrating will be load but 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.139
 and payment is the role of what is understandable pity 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.599
 I did not understand something then 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.159
 this honor runs faster 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.279
 there you are 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:15.279
 dual processor taraz 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.279
 so that you still have such an indicator on 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.460
 for example, to give 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.460
 I will show you how to open contracts 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.559
 messages this trend 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.870
 if not opened quickly here due to 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.559
 shell 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:40.180
 it happens wrong 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.180
 mentally 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.860
 it's most likely 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.999
 in the morning 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.839
 animation leave most of here 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.529
 this time 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:01.580
 animation score 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.580
 personalities and sms 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:07.879
 besides more 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:10.199
 there is no application for this 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:12.259
 deleted everything 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:13.599
 so 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.209
 show you benefits by st and here 

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:19.209
 you can still show 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:21.930
 debate 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.520
 Alas 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.110
 Alas, we can not 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.110
 not 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:35.800
 there is no fantastic break but 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.759
 And there is a feeling that the phone 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.809
 just faster i'll make you faster 

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:45.779
 we are in most central 

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:48.979
 percent therefore it is more convenient to work with him 

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:51.009
 more comfortable of course 

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:53.300
 stupid to deny that he is the future for 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.639
 dual core 

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.960
 the processor has further quad 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.310
 that they will appear shortly on 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.129
 network stove parade 

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:03.379
 so 

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:04.539
 connector 

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:06.369
 according to analogue 

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:07.750
 to already 

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.789
 compare 

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:10.389
 that the comparison was fair
