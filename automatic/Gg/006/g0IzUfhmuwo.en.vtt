the<00:01:35.579> hands<00:01:35.820> handset<00:01:36.509> design<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the hands handset design not just to

overall handset design but that's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
overall handset design but that's
something<00:01:41.820> we'll<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> wait<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.840> now

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
something we'll have to wait and see now

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
actually thinking what this phone is

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
actually thinking what this phone is
again<00:01:59.790> just<00:02:00.090> another<00:02:00.149> HTC<00:02:00.600> phone<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.799> HTC

again just another HTC phone the HTC

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.810 
again just another HTC phone the HTC
probably<00:02:02.729> designed<00:02:03.000> themselves<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
probably designed themselves and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.560 
probably designed themselves and
google's<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> put<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> same

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
google's is going to put the same

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
google's is going to put the same
similar<00:02:06.990> type<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.380> version<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> android<00:02:08.220> that

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
similar type of version of android that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.669 
similar type of version of android that
you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.550> find<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> joy<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:10.080> an<00:02:10.319> example

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
you can find on the joy as an example

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.589 
you can find on the joy as an example
right<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.760> lot<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> people<00:02:12.120> say<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.480> is

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
right now so a lot of people say this is

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.740 
right now so a lot of people say this is
probably<00:02:12.989> not<00:02:13.140> really

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
probably not really

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.960 
probably not really
big<00:02:13.990> big<00:02:14.290> deal<00:02:14.590> ask<00:02:14.920> your<00:02:15.310> part<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.580> making<00:02:15.850> out

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
big big deal ask your part of making out

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.310 
big big deal ask your part of making out
to<00:02:16.120> be<00:02:16.240> but<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.720> better<00:02:16.840> safe<00:02:17.110> than<00:02:17.260> sorry

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
to be but it's better safe than sorry

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.840 
to be but it's better safe than sorry
we're<00:02:17.650> going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.830> keep<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.400> but<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.730> is

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
we're going to keep on this but it is

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.430 
we're going to keep on this but it is
kind<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.150> weird<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.420> Google's<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:20.140> actually

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
kind of weird that Google's is actually

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.720 
kind of weird that Google's is actually
handing<00:02:20.710> this<00:02:20.770> phone<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> lot<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.610> dis

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
handing this phone out to a lot of dis

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.980 
handing this phone out to a lot of dis
employees<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.270> obviously<00:02:22.600> they<00:02:22.720> don't<00:02:22.810> want

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
employees but obviously they don't want

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.060 
employees but obviously they don't want
to<00:02:23.050> keep<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.350> secret<00:02:23.530> if<00:02:23.800> they're<00:02:23.950> doing

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
to keep it a secret if they're doing

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.790 
to keep it a secret if they're doing
this<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:25.080> definitely<00:02:26.080> speculated<00:02:26.770> that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
this so I definitely speculated that

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.500 
this so I definitely speculated that
it's<00:02:26.980> probably<00:02:27.100> something<00:02:27.550> just<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.150> g

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
it's probably something just like the g

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.180 
it's probably something just like the g
one<00:02:28.540> it's<00:02:29.110> going<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.350> be<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> Google<00:02:29.830> branded

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
one it's going to be a Google branded

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.800 
one it's going to be a Google branded
phone<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.610> Google<00:02:30.910> actually<00:02:31.030> supports<00:02:31.660> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
phone that Google actually supports and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.780 
phone that Google actually supports and
back<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.140> said<00:02:32.260> hey<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.310> phone<00:02:33.550> we

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
back and said hey we like this phone we

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.210 
back and said hey we like this phone we
use<00:02:34.030> this<00:02:34.180> phone<00:02:34.420> plus<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.500> running<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:35.950> joy

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
use this phone plus is running and joy

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.620 
use this phone plus is running and joy
so<00:02:36.490> go<00:02:36.670> out<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.790> buy<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:37.420> it's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
so go out and buy it so I think it's

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.790 
so go out and buy it so I think it's
probably<00:02:37.810> going<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.050> be<00:02:38.110> something<00:02:38.350> similar

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
probably going to be something similar

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.260 
probably going to be something similar
to<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.430> anyway<00:02:39.550> we'll<00:02:39.880> keep<00:02:40.030> our<00:02:40.150> eye<00:02:40.180> on
