00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.960 

so<00:05:13.200> that's<00:05:13.830> pretty<00:05:14.070> much<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.460> it's<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:14.850> very

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
so that's pretty much it it's a very

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.420 
so that's pretty much it it's a very
simple<00:05:15.240> process<00:05:15.990> which<00:05:16.020> I<00:05:16.380> do<00:05:16.440> every<00:05:16.860> two<00:05:17.310> to

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
simple process which I do every two to

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.240 
simple process which I do every two to
three<00:05:17.460> weeks<00:05:17.900> depending<00:05:18.900> on<00:05:19.050> how<00:05:19.230> fluffy<00:05:20.070> my

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
three weeks depending on how fluffy my

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.670 
three weeks depending on how fluffy my
hair<00:05:20.460> looks<00:05:20.730> when<00:05:21.480> you<00:05:21.570> have<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.750> pixie<00:05:22.140> cut<00:05:22.170> you

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
hair looks when you have a pixie cut you

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.340 
hair looks when you have a pixie cut you
just<00:05:22.920> known<00:05:23.100> as<00:05:23.280> hair<00:05:23.520> growth<00:05:23.790> really<00:05:24.630> quickly

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
just known as hair growth really quickly

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.140 
just known as hair growth really quickly
and<00:05:25.560> it's<00:05:25.890> not<00:05:26.040> necessarily<00:05:26.730> that<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.940> hair

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
and it's not necessarily that the hair

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.720 
and it's not necessarily that the hair
grows<00:05:27.450> quickly<00:05:27.780> it's<00:05:28.080> just<00:05:28.140> since<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.250> length

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
grows quickly it's just since the length

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.990 
grows quickly it's just since the length
is<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:30.180> short<00:05:30.600> any<00:05:30.930> hair<00:05:31.800> growth<00:05:32.190> you're<00:05:32.730> just

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
is so short any hair growth you're just

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.540 
is so short any hair growth you're just
going<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.180> notice<00:05:33.510> it<00:05:33.690> way<00:05:34.170> more<00:05:34.560> than<00:05:35.250> when

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
going to notice it way more than when

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.820 
going to notice it way more than when
you<00:05:35.580> have<00:05:35.760> long<00:05:36.090> hair<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.690> would<00:05:37.080> suggest<00:05:37.410> going

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
you have long hair I would suggest going

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.470
