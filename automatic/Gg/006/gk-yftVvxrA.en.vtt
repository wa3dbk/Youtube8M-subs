00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.650
 Now I want to show you in this video 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 how do i do a bunch 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.290
 I get such a tekane print 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.500
 great option for a walk just on 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.680
 let me if no such she will 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 clear dress code assimilated 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:33.570
 use regular tangle teezer back 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:37.850
 and more comfortable such a nightmare city head 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.850
 down very rarely print park power 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.460
 without the right to the top of the vampire itself 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:51.269
 on top 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 the whole image and will not need to take 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.600
 thanks floor 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.390
 I hold my left hand through the hole like 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.390
 i stay here no 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 I put my hand under the horoscope 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.560
 petechka 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.350
 and here is the rest I spin 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.350
 I want salt we want it 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.700
 photofact 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.670
 stretching 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.670
 I pull through 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.610
 on youtube already zilog and here 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.780
 it turns out that such a careless essence 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.310
 is that I reach out as if you were dealing 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.720
 my tail remains here is a bundle 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.070
 ponytail that rides once to the end I 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.770
 wrapped around and or seba was the end 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.070
 just wrapping the chain 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.020
 a mountain so that a basin can hold better 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.049
 there was some better form and just take 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:09.649
 because the top and office allowances here 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:14.739
 the second kind is two turns to get 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:18.160
 the field was neatly a bit to be 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.160
 careful because 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.519
 if you come down the night quietly sit down and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.519
 something will maintain integrity 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.140
 law 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.090
 it turns out such a bunch of success and looks 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.430
 very nice i like this one too 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.990
 every day and probably 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.040
 and the porsche must have draco wanted to do 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.040
 its more neat 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.500
 I hope this was useful to you 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.500
 logic there cards
