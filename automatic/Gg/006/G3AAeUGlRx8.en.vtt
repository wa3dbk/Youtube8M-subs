00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.879 
I I do believe that Assassin's Creed 3
is<00:05:30.970> not<00:05:31.750> just<00:05:31.960> gonna<00:05:32.080> stop<00:05:32.320> here<00:05:32.530> this<00:05:32.650> may<00:05:32.830> be

is not just gonna stop here this may be

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.200 
is not just gonna stop here this may be
the<00:05:33.130> last<00:05:33.370> one<00:05:34.830> maybe<00:05:35.830> I<00:05:36.159> kind<00:05:36.849> of<00:05:36.880> done<00:05:37.060> it

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
the last one maybe I kind of done it

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.950 
the last one maybe I kind of done it
when<00:05:38.139> I<00:05:38.169> say<00:05:38.349> the<00:05:38.470> last<00:05:38.680> one<00:05:38.919> like<00:05:39.159> as<00:05:39.610> far<00:05:39.880> as

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
when I say the last one like as far as

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.080 
when I say the last one like as far as
playing<00:05:40.960> as<00:05:41.229> an<00:05:41.380> assassin<00:05:41.650> debts<00:05:42.159> in<00:05:42.639> the<00:05:42.699> past

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
playing as an assassin debts in the past

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.810 
playing as an assassin debts in the past
if<00:05:43.510> there<00:05:43.780> is<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:43.960> Sanskrit<00:05:44.710> for<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:45.220> honestly

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
if there is a Sanskrit for I honestly

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.430 
if there is a Sanskrit for I honestly
think<00:05:46.090> this<00:05:46.240> time<00:05:46.479> it<00:05:46.659> will<00:05:46.810> just<00:05:47.020> be<00:05:47.139> like<00:05:47.260> in

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
think this time it will just be like in

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.990 
think this time it will just be like in
modern<00:05:47.710> amount<00:05:48.430> of<00:05:48.550> time<00:05:48.729> when<00:05:48.880> you're
