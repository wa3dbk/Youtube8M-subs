00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
start getting prepared for that so item
level<00:01:17.280> 110<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> think<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.939> makes<00:01:18.150> three<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
level 110 I think that makes three of

level 110 I think that makes three of
the<00:01:19.110> Rings<00:01:19.380> best<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.189> slot<00:01:20.689> there's<00:01:21.689> five

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the Rings best in slot there's five

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.289 
the Rings best in slot there's five
rings<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.740> don't<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.520> which<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
scholar one is definitely best in slot

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.560

at<00:01:26.340> least<00:01:26.520> while<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> healing<00:01:26.970> ring<00:01:27.299> for

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
people who don't do the second coil of

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.390 
people who don't do the second coil of
Bahamut<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:09.170> might<00:03:09.349> as<00:03:09.500> well<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:09.920> add<00:03:10.099> it<00:03:10.280> to

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
Bahamut you might as well just add it to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.170 
Bahamut you might as well just add it to
the<00:03:10.489> circus<00:03:10.819> Tower

besides<00:03:11.690> 2.4<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.560> coming<00:03:12.920> soon<00:03:13.099> I<00:03:13.250> just<00:03:13.640> don't

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
besides 2.4 is coming soon I just don't

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.130 
besides 2.4 is coming soon I just don't
see<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.910> reason<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.420> hold<00:03:14.599> back<00:03:14.840> there's

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
see a reason to hold back there's

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.180 
see a reason to hold back there's
there's<00:03:15.349> no<00:03:15.470> good<00:03:15.620> reason<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.890> hold<00:03:16.099> back

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
there's no good reason to hold back

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.949 
there's no good reason to hold back
sands<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.549> time<00:03:16.579> so<00:03:16.790> I'm<00:03:16.970> hoping<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:17.810> that

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
sands of time so I'm hoping that that

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.319 
sands of time so I'm hoping that that
decision<00:03:18.440> is<00:03:18.560> ultimately<00:03:19.220> made<00:03:19.549> another

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
decision is ultimately made another

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.449 
decision is ultimately made another
thing<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.720> may<00:03:20.840> be<00:03:20.900> happening<00:03:21.380> is<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:21.739> the

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
thing that may be happening is this the

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.759 
thing that may be happening is this the
savage<00:03:22.880> difficulty<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.750> first<00:03:23.959> coil<00:03:24.200> may

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
savage difficulty of the first coil may

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.610 
savage difficulty of the first coil may
be<00:03:25.220> added<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.940> seems<00:03:26.420> very<00:03:26.690> unlikely<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.380> me

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
be added it seems very unlikely to me

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.470 
be added it seems very unlikely to me
but<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.040> something<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.609> we<00:03:28.790> can<00:03:29.120> consider

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
but it is something that we can consider

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.780 
but it is something that we can consider
as<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.660> possibility<00:03:30.190> they've<00:03:31.190> said<00:03:31.489> that<00:03:31.609> there

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
as a possibility they've said that there

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.069 
as a possibility they've said that there
are<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.940> few<00:03:32.090> things<00:03:32.389> that<00:03:32.510> may<00:03:32.720> hold<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.989> back

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
are a few things that may hold it back

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.750 
are a few things that may hold it back
such<00:03:33.319> as<00:03:33.440> not<00:03:33.590> having<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:34.130> original<00:03:34.340> data

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
such as not having the original data

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.789 
such as not having the original data
they've<00:03:35.239> also<00:03:35.450> said<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:35.930> if<00:03:36.079> they<00:03:36.230> were<00:03:36.260> to

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
they've also said that if they were to

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.520 
they've also said that if they were to
do<00:03:37.040> savage<00:03:37.489> first<00:03:37.670> coil<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.090> may<00:03:38.329> delay<00:03:38.810> savage

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
do savage first coil it may delay savage

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.590 
do savage first coil it may delay savage
third<00:03:39.859> coil<00:03:40.160> which<00:03:40.850> leads<00:03:41.120> me<00:03:41.329> to<00:03:41.359> believe

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
third coil which leads me to believe

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.349 
third coil which leads me to believe
that<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.079> isn't<00:03:42.709> really<00:03:42.950> slated<00:03:43.850> for<00:03:43.880> anywhere

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
that it isn't really slated for anywhere

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.759 
that it isn't really slated for anywhere
near<00:03:44.630> two<00:03:44.930> point<00:03:45.260> three<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:45.530> as<00:03:45.590> much<00:03:45.709> as

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
near two point three and as much as

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.069 
near two point three and as much as
their<00:03:46.459> words<00:03:46.970> had<00:03:47.269> suggested<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.049> a

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
their words had suggested it is a

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.710 
their words had suggested it is a
possibility<00:03:48.889> it<00:03:49.069> seems<00:03:49.609> unlikely<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.389> me<00:03:50.510> at

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
possibility it seems unlikely to me at

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.140 
possibility it seems unlikely to me at
best<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.769> final<00:03:52.160> thing<00:03:52.340> among<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.790> bunch

that are happening in the patch too and

that are happening in the patch too and
then<00:04:07.489> there's<00:04:07.639> a<00:04:07.700> bunch<00:04:07.849> of<00:04:07.940> stuff<00:04:08.060> we<00:04:08.329> just

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
then there's a bunch of stuff we just

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.990 
then there's a bunch of stuff we just
have<00:04:08.750> no<00:04:09.049> idea<00:04:09.500> about<00:04:09.650> yet<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.250> then<00:04:10.819> there

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
have no idea about yet and then there

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.220 
have no idea about yet and then there
are<00:04:11.150> two<00:04:11.299> things<00:04:11.329> I<00:04:11.690> have<00:04:11.780> mentioned<00:04:11.840> here

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
are two things I have mentioned here

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.659 
are two things I have mentioned here
they<00:04:12.349> aren't<00:04:12.500> really<00:04:12.709> 2.38<00:04:13.310> but<00:04:13.549> they're

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
they aren't really 2.38 but they're

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.699 
they aren't really 2.38 but they're
happening<00:04:13.940> around<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.419> time<00:04:14.569> 2.38<00:04:15.230> is<00:04:15.440> coming

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
happening around the time 2.38 is coming

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.339 
happening around the time 2.38 is coming
out<00:04:15.859> so<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.789> or<00:04:17.180> Z<00:04:17.329> in<00:04:17.419> census<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.989> one<00:04:18.139> of<00:04:18.229> them

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
out so a or Z in census is one of them
