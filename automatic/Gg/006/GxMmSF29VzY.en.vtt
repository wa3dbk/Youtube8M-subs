Maya<00:00:04.400> this<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:06.089> very<00:00:06.720> simple<00:00:07.560> car

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
Maya this is a very simple car

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.669 
Maya this is a very simple car
I<00:00:09.710> want<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> animate<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.580> path<00:00:12.200> so<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.440> need

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
I want to animate it on a path so I need

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.890 
I want to animate it on a path so I need
to<00:00:13.769> create<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.219> curve<00:00:14.580> which<00:00:14.969> will<00:00:15.150> be<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.690> path

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
to create a curve which will be the path

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.490 
to create a curve which will be the path
it<00:00:16.230> will<00:00:16.410> drive<00:00:17.160> along<00:00:17.699> I'm<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.050> hit

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
it will drive along I'm going to hit

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.660 
it will drive along I'm going to hit
home<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.100> zoom<00:00:20.310> out<00:00:20.520> see<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.539> entire<00:00:21.689> grid<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
home to zoom out see my entire grid and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.310 
home to zoom out see my entire grid and
to<00:00:23.670> create<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.119> curve<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.660> could<00:00:24.900> use<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.289> of

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
to create a curve I could use one of

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
to create a curve I could use one of
these<00:00:25.560> tools<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.539> use<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.340> CV

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
these tools but I like to use the CV

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.930 
these tools but I like to use the CV
curve<00:00:29.789> tool<00:00:31.219> I'm<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> click<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
curve tool I'm just going to click a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.930 
curve tool I'm just going to click a
couple<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.480> times<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.440> grid<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.070> create

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
couple of times on the grid to create

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.760 
couple of times on the grid to create
the<00:00:36.510> curve<00:00:37.430> enter<00:00:38.430> creates<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> curve<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
the curve enter creates the curve and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
the curve enter creates the curve and
I'll<00:00:40.770> rename<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.489> car<00:00:41.910> path<00:00:44.059> now<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> want<00:00:45.480> to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
I'll rename it car path now I want to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
I'll rename it car path now I want to
animate<00:00:46.079> my<00:00:46.500> car<00:00:47.309> along<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.390> path<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:50.280> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
animate my car along this path so I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.080 
animate my car along this path so I
select<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:51.629> car<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> shift<00:00:53.039> select<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.180> curve

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
select my car and shift select the curve

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
select my car and shift select the curve
then<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.820> animation

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
then I'm going to go to the animation

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.889 
then I'm going to go to the animation
menu<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.890> under<00:01:01.890> animate<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.329> find<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
menu and under animate you can find the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.560 
menu and under animate you can find the
motion<00:01:04.470> paths<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:06.540> will<00:01:06.780> attach<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:08.580> car

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
motion paths and I will attach this car

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.510 
motion paths and I will attach this car
to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.780> motion<00:01:10.170> path<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> am<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
to the motion path but I am going to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.039 
to the motion path but I am going to
look<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> options<00:01:13.939> there<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.810> options

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
look at the options there are my options

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.530 
look at the options there are my options
now<00:01:16.939> I<00:01:18.290> will<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.560> give<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.369> start<00:01:20.850> point

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
now I will just give it a start point

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.719 
now I will just give it a start point
sidewall<00:01:22.310> beef<00:01:23.310> starting<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.150> frame<00:01:24.299> 1<00:01:24.600> I

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
sidewall beef starting at frame 1 I

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.999 
sidewall beef starting at frame 1 I
wanted<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> follow<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> path<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.680> need<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
wanted to follow the path and I need to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.120 
wanted to follow the path and I need to
get<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> X's<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.020> front<00:01:31.380> axis<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
get the X's right so the front axis is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.789 
get the X's right so the front axis is
the<00:01:32.369> direction<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.659> will<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.079> driving<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the direction it will be driving in and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
the direction it will be driving in and
if<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.400> look<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.939> car<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> seems<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> be

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
if I look at my car it seems to be

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.370 
if I look at my car it seems to be
facing<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.159> z<00:01:38.939> direction<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.229> is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
facing in the z direction so this is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.450 
facing in the z direction so this is
correct<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.899> Vector<00:01:43.530> should<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
correct and the up Vector should be the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.389 
correct and the up Vector should be the
Y<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.890> vector<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.189> car

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
Y because that's the vector in a car

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
Y because that's the vector in a car
pointing<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.860> good<00:01:50.630> no<00:01:51.630> accent

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
pointing up so that's all good no accent

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.340 
pointing up so that's all good no accent
but<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.310> I'll<00:01:53.579> attach<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.600> car<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
but it is so I'll attach the car to the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.929 
but it is so I'll attach the car to the
path<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.009> seems<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.549> totally

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
path and it seems to have totally

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.780 
path and it seems to have totally
disappeared<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:58.560> didn't<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.399> ended<00:01:59.670> up

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
disappeared it didn't it just ended up

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.840 
disappeared it didn't it just ended up
on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> other<00:02:00.540> end<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.770> path<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.310> actually

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
on the other end of the path I actually

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.319 
on the other end of the path I actually
wanted<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.570> drive<00:02:03.810> towards<00:02:04.439> me<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:05.210> order<00:02:06.210> to

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
wanted to drive towards me in order to

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.869 
wanted to drive towards me in order to
do<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.930> need<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> reverse<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.369> path<00:02:08.550> it's

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
do that I need to reverse the path it's

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.650 
do that I need to reverse the path it's
now<00:02:09.030> driving<00:02:09.440> away<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.470> me<00:02:10.830> among<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.250> part

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
now driving away from me among this part

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.460 
now driving away from me among this part
so<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.410> select<00:02:12.830> my<00:02:13.040> path<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.700> will<00:02:14.450> go<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
so I select my path I will go to the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.090 
so I select my path I will go to the
surfaces<00:02:16.310> menu<00:02:16.670> because<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.290> logic<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.770> my

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
surfaces menu because the logic of my

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.340 
surfaces menu because the logic of my
art<00:02:19.550> tells<00:02:19.820> me<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.210> edit<00:02:20.660> curves<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.170> in

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
art tells me that edit curves is in

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.970 
art tells me that edit curves is in
surfaces<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:24.170> Edit<00:02:24.410> curves<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.950> can

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
surfaces and the Edit curves you can

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.410 
surfaces and the Edit curves you can
find<00:02:25.460> reverse<00:02:26.830> curve<00:02:27.830> direction<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.820> as<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.360> do

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
find reverse curve direction and as I do

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.840 
find reverse curve direction and as I do
that<00:02:29.660> you'll<00:02:29.870> see<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.860> cart<00:02:31.100> jumping<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.700> the
