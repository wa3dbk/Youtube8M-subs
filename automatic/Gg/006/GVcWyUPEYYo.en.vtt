00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 greetings longboard heras and lambs 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.240
 Now I'm going to make another video review 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.330
 suggesting and also giving you different 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.430
 this features of articles the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.090
 a burnout as always I do not have 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.530
 well yes yes I have videos of how 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.930
 they work for example now what I 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:28.430
 I will focus there the friends of books or 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:31.010
 you through skate road dotcom the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.870
 skate road shop in chihuahua this me 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.830
 they gave me this 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.220
 pulse test package for this review 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.460
 and then upload the video give my opinion 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.820
 and you also have this one up close 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.660
 a little bit more the characteristics of 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.620
 this product do not notice that he put t 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.780
 is a brand of pop for the longboard 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.960
 made in Mexico made there by a group 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.149
 of bombers then this one go 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.320
 starting but if your product 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.390
 logically it can not be compared with 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.850
 some brand that has been around for years 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.979
 These are recent but they are very good 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.710
 I for example hoped that pop 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.740
 come 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.220
 If this back maybe just 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.200
 to add it or not I know but if it comes 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.619
 precisely done so that if you do not have 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.930
 gloves you can put together your gloves 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.470
 working curtain and you can make your slides 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.700
 for example already comes with Velcro 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.270
 hard here behind the pop and bring a roll 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.470
 of good a strip of pop that receives 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.330
 velcro forgiveness that receives the poc this 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.600
 so that you can be the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.550
 either sewing adequate amount given 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.170
 Stuck on your gloves and make them 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.210
 is the material that you want can 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.179
 be of mechanical construction and so on 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.440
 not then it's a very good option 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:07.160
 they give a sticker there 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:11.700
 half crazy with simple box tie and then 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 this only costs 160 pesos the truth 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.780
 habitat as there is a lot of crisis there is no 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.790
 money then it is a very good option 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.470
 and the truth is they are very resistant 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.300
 ability to slip like this 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.220
 say it is 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.200
 they are so slippery 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.690
 like other brands and others 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.090
 materials that I have tried 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.450
 they are resistant or they are not worn 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.000
 so fast 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.180
 and they are cheap then they are very good 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.780
 option 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.439
 to use them your glide feels 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.609
 as a porous medium and has a skid like that 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:56.620
 as a medium a little more than half or 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:00.340
 I have tried for example the table 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.650
 white to sting if it makes skids 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.069
 but you do not spill so much with 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.689
 these raptor box a little bit more than 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.670
 slide a little more than with the table 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.670
 white to chop then it's superior 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.630
 compared to other brands that have 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.800
 a lot are very slippery these are not 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.830
 then there yes if you like a boot 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.420
 you can give it 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.980
 or you have the option not to choose or very 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.740
 slippery or a little less slippery and 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.280
 cheap then it's the option that I give them 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.060
 I give fluffy has a good size 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.060
 exactly to the palm of your hand 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.379
 This is a very good option for 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.379
 start 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.140
 in my case I do not use almost 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.870
 because I do not do so many floor slides anymore 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.900
 what 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.360
 this coleman maybe 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.360
 and then I hardly wore pocs 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.030
 I always use them for safety but almost 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.860
 I do not use them but when starting in the long 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.410
 wing the first thing you learn are the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.479
 skids not then this for those 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.900
 they use a lot because they wear a lot 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.660
 little and maybe they are have this more 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.270
 focused on light technicians 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.910
 or the slides like that with your hands 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.620
 on the floor is a very good option for 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.490
 do not spend your money so much or because 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.040
 pay so much for something that works the same 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.520
 of good and it's cheaper 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.320
 then I recommend them one hour 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.720
 they are only available through 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.260
 unction road diamantes 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.990
 Ismael will attend to them and can clarify them 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.580
 your doubts and other 100% recommended already 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.650
 then the market will probably open 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.720
 for different stores but for the 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.420
 moment if you want to try get in 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.930
 Contact with friends of box or tea and 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.030
 skate world to be made 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.670
 a sale and of the few then I know 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.030
 I recommend them and now only in 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.030
 Mexico
