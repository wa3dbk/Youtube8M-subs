00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
okay let's take a look at how to make a

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.579 
okay let's take a look at how to make a
big<00:00:02.580> book<00:00:02.820> yeah<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:03.689> can<00:00:03.870> see<00:00:04.049> that<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.290> have

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
some of the the laughs that you buy Home

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.759 
some of the the laughs that you buy Home
Depot<00:00:08.760> or<00:00:08.790> Lowe's<00:00:09.050> and<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.139> see<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> have<00:00:10.740> it

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
Depot or Lowe's and you see I have it

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.250 
Depot or Lowe's and you see I have it
cut<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.660> drilled<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:14.370> have

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
cut and I have it drilled and I have

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.700 
cut and I have it drilled and I have
fasteners<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.619> are<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:19.470> is

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
fasteners that are in here so this is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.700 
fasteners that are in here so this is
all<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.119> I've<00:00:21.320> pulled<00:00:22.320> apart

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
all you can see that I've pulled apart

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.900 
all you can see that I've pulled apart
the<00:00:22.920> two<00:00:22.949> pieces<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> lattice<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
the two pieces of of the lattice and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
the two pieces of of the lattice and
you're<00:00:26.910> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> tighten<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.660> using<00:00:28.650> either

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
you're going to tighten it using either

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.999 
you're going to tighten it using either
a<00:00:29.160> screw<00:00:29.789> or<00:00:30.029> you're<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.929> use<00:00:31.170> wing<00:00:31.710> nuts

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
a screw or you're going to use wing nuts

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.870 
a screw or you're going to use wing nuts
here's<00:00:33.000> an<00:00:33.149> example<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.550> book<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.730> has

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
here's an example of a book that has

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.900 
here's an example of a book that has
been<00:00:35.910> made<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.960> lattice<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.670> wing<00:00:38.670> nuts

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
been made with the lattice and wing nuts

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
been made with the lattice and wing nuts
the<00:00:39.149> wing<00:00:39.329> nuts<00:00:39.540> are<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> much<00:00:40.050> easier<00:00:40.469> way<00:00:40.980> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the wing nuts are a much easier way to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.760 
the wing nuts are a much easier way to
be<00:00:41.309> able<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.629> together<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
be able to put this together now the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.529 
be able to put this together now the
original<00:00:44.370> lattice<00:00:44.789> piece<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> be

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
original lattice piece is going to be

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.510 
original lattice piece is going to be
eight<00:00:45.750> feet<00:00:45.780> tall<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.070> you're<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> have

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
eight feet tall so you're going to have

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.920 
eight feet tall so you're going to have
to<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.760> into<00:00:47.969> Home<00:00:48.120> Depot<00:00:48.149> you're<00:00:48.750> going<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
to go into Home Depot you're going to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.529 
to go into Home Depot you're going to
have<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> go<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:50.190> Lowe's<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.969> find<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.420> it's

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
have to go into Lowe's and find it it's

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.290 
have to go into Lowe's and find it it's
usually<00:00:51.870> standing<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.649> vertical<00:00:52.980> rack<00:00:53.370> over

point out where you get the hardware and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.780 
point out where you get the hardware and
you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> hardware<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.520> these

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
you can see that the hardware are these

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.359 
you can see that the hardware are these
little<00:01:27.090> wing<00:01:27.299> nuts<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.549> they<00:01:29.549> twist<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:31.439> will

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
little wing nuts and they twist and will

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
little wing nuts and they twist and will
tighten<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.420> here's<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> other<00:01:34.020> bolt

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
tighten up and here's the other bolt

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.789 
tighten up and here's the other bolt
size<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.939> need<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.540> three<00:01:37.439> holes

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
size so you need to have three holes

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.810 
size so you need to have three holes
drilled<00:01:38.369> into<00:01:39.470> your<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:41.130> wood<00:01:41.369> lattice

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
drilled into your your wood lattice

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.620 
drilled into your your wood lattice
finding<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> put<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.090> paper<00:01:45.329> in

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
finding you have to put the paper in

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
finding you have to put the paper in
there<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.409> need<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.740> drill<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> holes

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
there you need to drill the holes

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
there you need to drill the holes
through<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.850> wood<00:01:48.030> through<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.689> paper<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
through the wood through the paper and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.450 
through the wood through the paper and
then<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.009> tighten<00:01:50.490> them<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:53.100> for

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
then you tighten them up so as for

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.600 
then you tighten them up so as for
making<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.479> pages<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
making the the pages you can see that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.690 
making the the pages you can see that
this<00:01:57.119> student<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.280> printed<00:01:59.280> out<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
this student here is printed out a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.190
