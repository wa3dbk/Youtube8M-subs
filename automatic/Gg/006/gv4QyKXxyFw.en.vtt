 and we started to be good bush 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.670
 things we have in mind was difficult the desired 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.820
 it was very difficult 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.310
 always and entering a new product to the market is difficult 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.159
 ip 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.110
 I get bored air tickets of the first culinary 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.480
 first-person people that is a landfill problem 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.780
 for us 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.330
 in november the young 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.780
 for that reason it affected 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.650
 what is collected, remember this message 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.549
 from Bolivia where of power 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.640
 he promoted his 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.909
 your company globally hunger that this patient 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.180
 but a little bit 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.279
 so advertising as outdoor promotion 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.250
 this service 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.199
 I felt something cloudy 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.179
 I think it's way above what these people accepted exports 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:25.059
 towards the north of promotion of the different advertising ceremonies of 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.519
 tourism in peru 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.159
 but then what the rally also responsible foreigners who wanted 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.759
 do the tour 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.669
 what is there 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.669
 but they have done to which the phrase stands out 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.679
 he has done it in the province not to go so has the bbc of london 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:46.489
 on YouTube in the end that there are many foreign correspondents 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.349
 that after having done they have talked about the product in its different 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.099
 countries that have spread it 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.929
 maybe it has been very helpful for us 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:57.349
 what are the goals 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.669
 ap short and medium term and careful 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.379
 student of the right band the goal is to do but 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.549
 not in the forms of Peru is to teach our 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.649
 that is why we have bulls where we take passengers to increase 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.619
 so that they know the different autochthonous inputs 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:20.169
 if all this mixed with the Israeli part channel a good part of the Incas 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.829
 as they carried the fish the chasquis say a lot about this 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.789
 that what interests the tourist 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:30.869
