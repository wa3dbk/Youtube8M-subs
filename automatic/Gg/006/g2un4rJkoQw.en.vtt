you<00:00:20.310> through<00:00:20.339> to<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> hardware<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.929> the<00:00:22.019> user

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
you through to the hardware and the user

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.310 
you through to the hardware and the user
interface<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.400> bit<00:00:23.579> so<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:25.109> guy

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
interface to is just a bit so this guy
