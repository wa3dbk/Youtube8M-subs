chance to try personally was the new

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.630 
chance to try personally was the new
xbox<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.200> controller<00:03:04.590> which<00:03:05.130> does<00:03:05.400> look<00:03:05.610> very

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
xbox one controller which does look very

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.610 
xbox one controller which does look very
similar<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.390> original<00:03:06.510> one<00:03:06.900> albeit<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
similar to the original one albeit the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.530 
similar to the original one albeit the
overall<00:03:07.890> shaping<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> bit<00:03:08.700> different<00:03:08.910> first

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
overall shaping is a bit different first

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.699 
overall shaping is a bit different first
off<00:03:09.750> they've<00:03:09.930> gotten<00:03:10.200> rid<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.530> really

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
off they've gotten rid of that really

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.380 
off they've gotten rid of that really
annoying<00:03:11.099> webbing<00:03:11.459> on<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.640> d-pad<00:03:11.790> which

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
annoying webbing on the d-pad which

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.509 
annoying webbing on the d-pad which
makes<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.750> lot<00:03:12.840> easier<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.410> use<00:03:13.590> also<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
makes it a lot easier to use also the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.099 
makes it a lot easier to use also the
triggers<00:03:14.819> are<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.970> little<00:03:15.120> more<00:03:15.299> shallow<00:03:15.510> but

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
triggers are a little more shallow but

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.150 
triggers are a little more shallow but
still<00:03:16.380> deep<00:03:16.590> enough<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.920> give<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.130> a

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
still deep enough to give you a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.860 
still deep enough to give you a
satisfying<00:03:17.640> trigger<00:03:17.970> pool<00:03:18.180> for<00:03:18.420> first-person

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
satisfying trigger pool for first-person

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.539 
satisfying trigger pool for first-person
shooters<00:03:19.200> now<00:03:19.650> one<00:03:19.829> change<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.220> really<00:03:20.430> did

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
shooters now one change I really did

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.920 
shooters now one change I really did
like<00:03:20.670> was<00:03:20.850> then<00:03:21.000> moving<00:03:21.239> away<00:03:21.390> from<00:03:21.510> having

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
like was then moving away from having

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.449 
like was then moving away from having
one<00:03:21.959> single<00:03:22.470> Rumble<00:03:22.650> feature<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.190> makes<00:03:23.310> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
one single Rumble feature that makes the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.280 
one single Rumble feature that makes the
whole<00:03:23.579> controller<00:03:23.940> shake<00:03:24.209> like<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.390> madman<00:03:24.840> to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
whole controller shake like a madman to

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.449 
whole controller shake like a madman to

having four separate parts the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.979 
having four separate parts the
controller<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.269> shake<00:03:27.480> based<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.840> what's

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
controller that shake based on what's

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.330 
controller that shake based on what's
happening<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> game<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.160> for<00:03:29.310> instance

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
happening in the game so for instance

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.830 
happening in the game so for instance
for<00:03:29.790> playing<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.030> shooter<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.480> get<00:03:30.569> shot<00:03:30.750> on

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
for playing a shooter and get shot on

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.479 
for playing a shooter and get shot on
the<00:03:30.900> right<00:03:30.930> side<00:03:31.290> only<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:32.040> right<00:03:32.220> side<00:03:32.400> of

the right side only the right side of
the<00:03:32.519> controller<00:03:32.819> will<00:03:33.000> shake<00:03:33.239> it's<00:03:33.810> also<00:03:33.989> not

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
the controller will shake it's also not

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.170 
the controller will shake it's also not
nearly<00:03:34.560> as<00:03:34.680> abrasive<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.819> it<00:03:35.880> feels<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.120> lot

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
nearly as abrasive so it feels a lot

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.280 
nearly as abrasive so it feels a lot
more<00:03:36.239> comfortable<00:03:36.540> when<00:03:36.840> you're<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.109> game

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
more comfortable when you're in a game

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.840 
more comfortable when you're in a game
and<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.829> giving<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.130> little<00:03:38.340> impulses

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
and it's just giving you little impulses

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.550 
and it's just giving you little impulses
to<00:03:38.940> let<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.150> know<00:03:39.269> what's<00:03:39.390> going<00:03:39.450> on<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:40.019> terms

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
to let you know what's going on in terms

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.960 
to let you know what's going on in terms
of<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.739> overall<00:03:40.769> shape<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.340> controller<00:03:41.760> it's

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
of the overall shape of controller it's

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.580 
of the overall shape of controller it's
very<00:03:42.150> similar<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.690> old<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:42.989> although<00:03:43.530> it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
very similar to the old one although it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.020 
very similar to the old one although it
does<00:03:43.709> have<00:03:43.739> slightly<00:03:44.160> thinner<00:03:44.519> grips<00:03:44.819> which

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
does have slightly thinner grips which

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.309 
does have slightly thinner grips which
actually<00:03:45.239> felt<00:03:45.630> more<00:03:45.780> comfortable<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:46.290> me

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
actually felt more comfortable for me

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.110 
actually felt more comfortable for me
once<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.620> got<00:03:46.739> used<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.160> now<00:03:47.459> one<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
once I got used to it now one of the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.550
