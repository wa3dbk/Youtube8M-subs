 new champion schin did show the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.010
 cotton have so as the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.160
 champion thymus then probably in 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.949
 Portuguese, it will be called 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 even though he already has four 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.520
 new skins and I like the pec the champion 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.589
 taxis will receive another one this splashs 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.780
 no further comments 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.270
 Fuck I found it a lot of the time mostly 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.479
 because your shark is now a rabbit 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.460
 satanic giant and had a theme as well as 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.950
 the presented their special 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.229
 even the champion had in his corner 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.420
 in white hair is also part 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.159
 of this art and here in the game the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 champion did also got a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.360
 presentation with a very legal theme 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 a fun concept for the champion 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.579
 so inside the champion game I did that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.500
 although still a sea creature 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.869
 now he's dressed as a bunny with a 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.280
 fantasy as much as fashion and the place 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.829
 of his president now he uses a 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.649
 trident carrot effect 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.140
 also a new return animation 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.880
 together with the differentiated audio at 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 his skills did not have great 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.530
 changes in the visual question, but the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.829
 lately like I say to you now 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.799
 will receive a giant rabbit built 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.149
 by the 7th spirit of zebu, but 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.880
 much of the time and also when you 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.070
 hit the team had an enemy the mark 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.259
 that is in your head is precisely a 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.090
 carrot so this is what I did 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.009
 but if I think it's really cool with mika 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.220
 she tells me that the value of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.080
 97 cycle of bridges and 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.570
 subject to change can also be 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.420
 Gets around the 1,350 we know 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.020
 definitely for the moment to 975 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.000
 OK 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.490
 and we also have here the update of the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.740
 champion gets worse and has read both a 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.670
 changes as well as 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.410
 skills 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.390
 Visually speaking here was opines 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.370
 Much better at night game is bringing 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.070
 many champions where they have to wait 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.530
 There will still be many changes 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.840
 here in lyon the daughter but still 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.430
 Time, time, I really liked the part. 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.470
 the champion and now I'm going to try 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.630
 explain to you a little more about the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.580
 skills and how they are 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.590
 good it is only passive that it is 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.840
 She calls the elitist dance and she goes 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.180
 identify the weaknesses or 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.520
 called vital of the champions who 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.740
 are close to it and if it 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.940
 be able to hit this weak spot or 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.890
 then this vital point 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.020
 the queue will cause true damage 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.400
 in that attack she's going to cause 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.440
 she will also heal a small 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.660
 amount of your life and will also 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.180
 receive speed of movement and always 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.970
 that you attack a vital post a new 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.280
 mark will appear after a while and 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.250
 if you do not attack this vital point 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.890
 after fifteen seconds a 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.110
 new vital point and this person magic 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.840
 basically consists of 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.940
 brand of the kwe champion however she is unique and 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.000
 exclusively for enemy champions and 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.250
 You have to attack the enemy champion in 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.650
 direction and that only vital brand appears 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.090
 she appears to the four sides is there 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.549
 left right up and down 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.989
 so if the mark looks like left side 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.360
 You have to make an attack on that 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.590
 direction if it appears to the champion 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.600
 You have to have the attack on that 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.820
 direction will depend heavily on the 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.070
 Lenny that you are and also on the side 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.920
 the map that you are the more 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.580
 more likely you will use the 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.930
 his passive superiority which he calls 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.450
 lunge you will now jump 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.190
 freely by the map and a fixed direction 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.510
 and when you have in your charge you 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.239
 will cause an attack on an enemy 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.450
 next to you this attack coming from your 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.370
 which will apply such contact effects 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.680
 gp champion and also the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.680
 champion summed up what gives champion worse goes 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.870
 have the same liability or will apply 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.970
 your contact effects 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.390
 prioritize enemy champion and also will 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.090
 prioritize the mark of its passive their 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.190
 celebrity w ripostar will make you 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.110
 fifa to take a defensive stance you 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.970
 will trim all damage and ability and 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.220
 control group you receive by 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.720
 a fraction of a second and then you 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.730
 to stop this damage 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.010
 You're going to counter attack in some direction. 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.500
 that you chose earlier you will 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.810
 cause damage and also slowness in the 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.790
 first champion you reach and case 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.010
 you appear any ability to 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.470
 stunning when you counterattack 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.140
 instead of slowness you will cause the 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.450
 every time and if enemy champion your 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.210
 and fencing works basically like this 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.290
 you go get him the bonus on your two 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.330
 upcoming attacks 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.040
 the first attack will not cause criticism 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.950
 never going to be critical even though you 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.860
 is 100% physical but will cause 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.470
 slowness and the second attack when you 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.560
 be with your and he's going to marry 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.700
 with 100% certainty is the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.500
 ability that will give you an attack 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.810
 double, with the first case being 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.090
 slowness and the second makes the critic 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.640
 end your last call of great 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.560
 challenge you will choose only one 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.720
 enemy champion you will use the 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.000
 ultimate in this champion you will receive 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.190
 then speed and also knowledge 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.620
 total on your vital points 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.570
 ie you will apply four brands 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.700
 of your passive and whenever you 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.880
 destroy one of these vital marks 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.040
 you will cause actual damage based on 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.990
 maximum life percentage 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.820
 and in case you destroy the four points 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.860
 vital of the championship ingo or 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.229
 who is a moral champion with at least one 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.630
 vital field destroyed the lady goes 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.280
 create a large zone of kura that 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.919
 will apply to her as much as 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.320
 for your allied champions will serve 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.390
 basically as the ultimate champion already 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.000
 it is not so this is basically the way 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.440
 that the pitch is worse is very simple 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.360
 the champion's mechanism 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.500
 I confess that since I came to test 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.990
 I got a little lost a little 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.600
 confused but with few minutes of 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.750
 gameplay I understood how it works is 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.520
 very easy you use your passive only has 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.440
 to be smart on which side to 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.570
 which direction is the vital point 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.180
 that you have to perform the 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.800
 attack in that direction is yours that you 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.930
 will use to escape to do some 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.600
 kind of game some kind of 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.639
 your team will block all 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.490
 attacks that come you in the short period 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.740
 of time and then will cause damage on a 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.110
 area that you chose your mistake in a 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.539
 double attack one cause slowness and another 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.100
 critical case and are the ultimate you will 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.630
 to mark a thousand champion with four 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.009
 brands of your liability 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.080
 every time you broke a brand you 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.180
 will cause real damage if you break the 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.770
 four brands or else this album will die 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.470
 with at least one broken machine 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.840
 you will create a healing field like this 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.449
 as the champion of the last seven also 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.400
 simple credit bic easy to understand 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:17.580
 Your last management is now a little bit 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.710
 more support than offensive but the 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.930
 move became more balanced 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.030
 I do not know how your opinions but I 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.740
 I really liked the champion's advice. 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.750
 I say in proof then what you found 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.580
 if you think it 's better or if 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.990
 it will get worse beauty than the staff 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.669
 can issue actions for you to have 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.500
 liked that you like and bass is 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.210
 very important in a committee that 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.740
 the party and your friends write tv 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.599
 to register if you recover the 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.639
 here in the cheap acronym of 

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.320
 success of facebook and twitter with very 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.610
 the bank for the games and also not 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.120
 forget to mention that the supporter here in the 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.280
