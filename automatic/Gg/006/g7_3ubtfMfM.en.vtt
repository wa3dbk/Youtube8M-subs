00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
me with a smoothing control so I can

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.710 
me with a smoothing control so I can
smooth<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> frequency<00:01:17.310> response<00:01:17.430> charts<00:01:20.720> by

smooth the frequency response charts by

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
smooth the frequency response charts by
selecting<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.290> hundred<00:01:22.619> percent<00:01:22.740> smoothing

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
selecting a hundred percent smoothing

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.969 
selecting a hundred percent smoothing
gives<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> much<00:01:24.150> much<00:01:25.140> clearer<00:01:25.470> view<00:01:25.500> on

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
gives you a much much clearer view on

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.510 
gives you a much much clearer view on
the<00:01:26.430> actual<00:01:26.729> trends<00:01:27.829> whereas<00:01:28.829> zero<00:01:29.070> percent

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the actual trends whereas zero percent

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.539 
the actual trends whereas zero percent
smoothing<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.890> finding<00:01:31.890> individual

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
smoothing is good for finding individual

multiple<00:01:42.329> different<00:01:42.659> dimensions<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.439> we're

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
multiple different dimensions so we're

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.740 
multiple different dimensions so we're
looking<00:01:44.369> at<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> frequency<00:01:44.670> response<00:01:45.090> we

looking at the frequency response we

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.289 
looking at the frequency response we
