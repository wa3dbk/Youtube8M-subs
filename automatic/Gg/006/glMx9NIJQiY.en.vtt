00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
 Psalm 55 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.700
 listen hate my prayer and do not you 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.940
 hide from my plea is attentive to 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.010
 answer the prayer and me with new 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.260
 because of the voice of the enemy by 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.420
 oppression of the impious because about me 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.090
 they drove away iniquity and in fury I 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.280
 They chase my heart is sore 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.810
 within me and terrors of death over 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.060
 I have fallen 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.000
 fear and trembling came upon me and 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.580
 terror has covered me and I said who 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.850
 give wings like a dove I would fly 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.670
 would rest would certainly flee away 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.920
 I would dwell in the desert, I would hasten to 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.429
 escape from the stormy wind in the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.440
 tempest destroys the bear mister confuses 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.499
 the language of them because I have seen 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.690
 violence and strife in the city day and 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.960
 night surround it on its walls and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.789
 iniquity and work there in the midst of it 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.089
 evil there in the middle of it and fraud 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.859
 and the deception do not depart from their squares 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.170
 because I'm not insulted by an enemy which 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.909
 I would have endured or risen up against me 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 that hated me because I would have 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.689
 hidden from him but your man 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.939
 apparently intimate mine guides me and my 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.430
 family that together we communicated 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.189
 sweetly secrets and we were in 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 friendship in the house of god that death 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.810
 surprise them descend alive to the sun 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.899
 because there are evils in their homes in 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.229
 half of them in regards to my goodbye 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.170
 cry and jehovah will save me late and 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.259
 tomorrow and at noon now I will claim and he 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.390
 he will hear my voice he will redeem my soul in peace 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.179
 of the war against me even though against me 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.220
 there are many I am anger and break them 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.920
 to then the one that remains from the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.159
 old because they do not change or 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.810
 they fear goodbye spread the wicked his hands 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.409
 against those who were at peace with him 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.750
 violated his covenant the sayings of his mouth are 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.090
 softer than butter but war 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.610
 there is in his heart he softens his words 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.229
 more thanks more they are swords 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.539
 naked 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.270
 made on jehovah your load and he will 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.420
 will sustain will not leave forever fallen 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.090
 the just more had God will bring down 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.430
 those to the well of perdition the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.129
 bloodthirsty and deceitful men 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.959
 they will not reach half of their days but 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.959
 I trust you
