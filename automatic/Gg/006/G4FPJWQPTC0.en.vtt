work<00:03:17.299> on<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:18.350> click<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.970> slow<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.239> you

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
work on so click that on the slow so you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.360 
work on so click that on the slow so you
can<00:03:20.420> slow<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.780> down<00:03:20.810> by<00:03:21.079> is<00:03:21.140> 50%<00:03:21.829> so<00:03:22.070> just<00:03:22.250> go

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
can slow it down by is 50% so just go

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.220 
can slow it down by is 50% so just go
ahead<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.610> type<00:03:22.730> in<00:03:22.910> 50<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.900> they'll<00:03:24.049> slow

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
ahead and type in 50 and they'll slow

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.960 
ahead and type in 50 and they'll slow
down<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.440> little<00:03:24.560> sound<00:03:24.799> like<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.100> what<00:03:25.850> the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
down a little sound like this what the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.410 
down a little sound like this what the
fork<00:03:26.360> oh<00:03:26.510> sorry<00:03:27.200> that's<00:03:27.829> 50<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.310> fast<00:03:28.579> you<00:03:28.910> want

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
fork oh sorry that's 50 to fast you want

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.150 
fork oh sorry that's 50 to fast you want
to<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.510> minus<00:03:29.870> 50<00:03:30.230> let's<00:03:30.680> make<00:03:30.829> sure<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:31.040> put

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
to go minus 50 let's make sure you put

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.220 
to go minus 50 let's make sure you put
minus<00:03:31.430> in<00:03:31.549> front<00:03:31.579> of<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.850> first<00:03:32.030> what<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
minus in front of it first what the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.800 
minus in front of it first what the
before<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:34.970> slows<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.329> down<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.480> little<00:03:35.600> bit

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
before so it slows it down a little bit

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.210 
before so it slows it down a little bit
it'll<00:03:36.350> make<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.530> little<00:03:36.650> bit<00:03:36.829> easier<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.100> work

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
it'll make a little bit easier to work

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.910 
it'll make a little bit easier to work

we're<00:03:49.220> going<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.370> do<00:03:49.519> is<00:03:49.700> we're<00:03:49.820> going<00:03:49.910> to

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.870 
we're going to do is we're going to
enter<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.360> enter<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:51.320> pitch<00:03:51.880> modification

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
enter and enter a pitch modification

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.670 
enter and enter a pitch modification
tool<00:03:53.060> it's<00:03:53.360> just<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.660> vocal<00:03:53.959> transformer<00:03:54.230> and

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
tool it's just the vocal transformer and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.060 
tool it's just the vocal transformer and
logic<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:56.150> what<00:03:56.299> I<00:03:56.329> like<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.600> use<00:03:56.720> for<00:03:56.930> this<00:03:57.079> and

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
logic so what I like to use for this and

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.350 
logic so what I like to use for this and
again<00:03:58.190> there's<00:03:58.489> many<00:03:58.700> different<00:03:58.820> ways<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.090> do

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
again there's many different ways to do

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.670 
again there's many different ways to do
this<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.660> just<00:03:59.690> depends<00:04:00.079> on<00:04:00.140> what<00:04:00.290> inserts

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
this it just depends on what inserts

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.229 
this it just depends on what inserts
you're<00:04:00.829> using<00:04:01.010> what<00:04:01.340> program<00:04:02.060> you're<00:04:02.209> using

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
cetera it's different Pro Tools but this

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.360 
cetera it's different Pro Tools but this
is<00:04:04.910> an<00:04:05.060> easy<00:04:05.180> way<00:04:05.329> to<00:04:05.360> do<00:04:05.540> in<00:04:05.660> logic<00:04:06.370> alright

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
is an easy way to do in logic alright

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.800 
is an easy way to do in logic alright
next<00:04:07.880> thing<00:04:08.000> we're<00:04:08.209> going<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.360> do<00:04:08.510> is<00:04:08.690> we're

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
basically what we told logic to do is

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.800 
basically what we told logic to do is
read<00:04:37.100> any<00:04:37.760> changes<00:04:38.270> in<00:04:38.389> this<00:04:38.480> button<00:04:38.780> right

not going to read it because we haven't
told<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:48.950> read<00:04:49.100> that<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:50.360> in<00:04:50.510> step<00:04:50.750> X<00:04:50.960> back

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
told it to read that so in step X back

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.140 
told it to read that so in step X back
to<00:04:51.169> 0<00:04:51.500> next<00:04:52.100> week<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.520> do<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:52.700> turn<00:04:52.880> this<00:04:53.030> little

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
to 0 next week to do is turn this little

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.960 
to 0 next week to do is turn this little
off<00:04:53.389> button<00:04:53.750> turn<00:04:54.139> it<00:04:54.200> on<00:04:54.320> touch<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.850> will

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
off button turn it on touch so that will

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.940 
off button turn it on touch so that will
read<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.360> when<00:04:56.900> we<00:04:57.050> play<00:04:57.229> it<00:04:57.350> from<00:04:57.440> now<00:04:57.590> on<00:04:57.770> it

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
read it when we play it from now on it

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.730 
read it when we play it from now on it
will<00:04:58.100> automatically<00:04:58.669> record<00:04:58.940> our<00:04:59.500> actions<00:05:00.500> on

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
will automatically record our actions on

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.100 
will automatically record our actions on
this<00:05:00.919> insert<00:05:01.280> as<00:05:01.430> we<00:05:01.610> go<00:05:01.760> along

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
this insert as we go along

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
this insert as we go along
so<00:05:03.110> basically<00:05:03.350> going<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.650> record<00:05:03.919> it<00:05:04.040> over

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
so basically going to record it over

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.350 
so basically going to record it over
this<00:05:04.370> area<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:04.729> what<00:05:04.910> I'm<00:05:04.970> going<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.120> do<00:05:05.240> is

virus feed off of it and bring it back
to<00:05:52.370> regular<00:05:52.490> speed<00:05:53.110> what<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.320> fear<00:05:54.970> there<00:05:55.970> you

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
to regular speed what the fear there you

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.180 
to regular speed what the fear there you
go<00:05:56.289> so<00:05:57.289> you<00:05:57.350> can<00:05:57.470> hear<00:05:57.620> a<00:05:57.680> nice<00:05:57.800> little<00:05:57.979> change

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
in that okay let's try this what the

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.529 
in that okay let's try this what the
fork<00:06:03.740> so<00:06:04.520> that's<00:06:04.700> what<00:06:04.940> that's<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.240> without

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
fork so that's what that's it without

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.710 
fork so that's what that's it without
the<00:06:05.750> effect<00:06:06.050> on<00:06:06.229> it<00:06:06.380> what<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.280> fork<00:06:07.669> what<00:06:08.510> the

fork

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.690 
fork
I'll<00:06:09.680> go<00:06:09.830> ahead<00:06:09.889> and<00:06:10.070> turn<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:10.310> effect<00:06:10.370> on

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
I'll go ahead and turn the effect on

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.600 
I'll go ahead and turn the effect on
what<00:06:13.700> the<00:06:14.139> what<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:15.550> what<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:16.990> what<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.050> curb

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610

so nice little dip there um bring this
back<00:06:23.180> up<00:06:23.360> to<00:06:23.479> zero<00:06:23.510> and<00:06:24.440> again<00:06:24.740> this<00:06:24.830> is<00:06:24.979> all

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
back up to zero and again this is all

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.000 
back up to zero and again this is all
track<00:06:25.310> automation<00:06:25.700> what<00:06:26.389> the<00:06:26.570> curb<00:06:26.960> what<00:06:27.830> the

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.190 
curb
I'm<00:06:28.909> going<00:06:29.060> to<00:06:29.120> bring<00:06:29.270> it<00:06:29.390> back<00:06:29.419> up<00:06:29.690> to<00:06:29.840> zero<00:06:29.870> as

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
I'm going to bring it back up to zero as

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.570 
I'm going to bring it back up to zero as
quickly<00:06:30.409> as<00:06:30.620> possible<00:06:31.039> because<00:06:31.190> it's<00:06:31.430> just

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
quickly as possible because it's just

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.420 
quickly as possible because it's just
for<00:06:31.789> that<00:06:31.909> one

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
for that one

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.890 
for that one
it's<00:06:33.150> basically<00:06:33.390> just<00:06:33.510> going<00:06:33.720> to<00:06:33.780> isolate

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
it's basically just going to isolate

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.520 
it's basically just going to isolate
that<00:06:34.170> one<00:06:34.440> word<00:06:34.620> with<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:34.950> effect<00:06:35.340> what<00:06:36.120> the

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
that one word with the effect what the

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.680 
that one word with the effect what the
what<00:06:37.530> the<00:06:37.560> fear<00:06:38.270> there<00:06:39.270> you<00:06:39.360> go

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
what the fear there you go

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.080 
what the fear there you go
pretty<00:06:40.290> simple<00:06:40.850> obviously<00:06:41.850> if<00:06:41.940> you're<00:06:42.060> doing

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
pretty simple obviously if you're doing

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.910 
pretty simple obviously if you're doing
it<00:06:42.270> for<00:06:42.420> real<00:06:42.540> it's<00:06:42.960> going<00:06:43.140> to<00:06:43.200> need<00:06:43.740> a<00:06:43.800> little

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
it for real it's going to need a little

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.320 
it for real it's going to need a little
bit<00:06:44.010> more<00:06:44.160> editing<00:06:44.580> and<00:06:44.760> it's<00:06:45.060> going<00:06:45.180> to<00:06:45.240> be<00:06:45.300> a

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
bit more editing and it's going to be a
