00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
American farmers and so when you say

that<00:00:14.099> there<00:00:14.280> may<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.490> better<00:00:14.969> alternatives<00:00:15.780> to

soil<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.770> pore<00:02:05.430> space<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> most

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
soil is pore space but then the most

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.650 
soil is pore space but then the most
important<00:02:07.140> part<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:08.220> soil<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.000> organic

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
important part of a soil is the organic

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.570 
important part of a soil is the organic
matter<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.259> your<00:02:10.470> head<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.099> your

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
matter that's like your head and your

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.040 
matter that's like your head and your
brains<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.060> controls<00:02:12.510> most<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
brains that controls most of the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.670 
brains that controls most of the
chemical

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
chemical

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.369 
chemical
reactions<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.489> most<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> life<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:16.140> with

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
reactions and most of the life is with

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.140 
reactions and most of the life is with
that<00:02:16.620> organic<00:02:17.189> matter<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.670> know<00:02:17.790> when<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
that organic matter you know when you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.000 
that organic matter you know when you
when<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.569> start<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:19.019> tell<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> soil<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
when you start to tell a soil what you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.009 
when you start to tell a soil what you
do<00:02:20.159> is<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.430> burn<00:02:20.760> up<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.090> organic<00:02:21.659> matter<00:02:21.840> so

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
do is you burn up the organic matter so

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.649 
do is you burn up the organic matter so
in<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.200> last<00:02:22.379> 100<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.280> 150<00:02:23.939> years<00:02:23.969> through

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
in the last 100 to 150 years through

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.860 
in the last 100 to 150 years through
tillage<00:02:24.959> we've<00:02:25.739> lost<00:02:26.040> probably<00:02:26.670> at<00:02:26.939> least<00:02:27.090> 60%

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
tillage we've lost probably at least 60%

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.869 
tillage we've lost probably at least 60%
of<00:02:28.349> our<00:02:28.469> organic<00:02:28.829> matter<00:02:29.099> some<00:02:29.340> studies<00:02:29.700> say

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
of our organic matter some studies say

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.670 
of our organic matter some studies say
as<00:02:30.000> much<00:02:30.209> as<00:02:30.420> 80<00:02:30.659> percent<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> organic

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
as much as 80 percent of the organic

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.869 
as much as 80 percent of the organic
matter<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:31.950> going<00:02:32.129> right<00:02:32.370> up<00:02:32.519> into<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
matter is going right up into the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.849 
matter is going right up into the
atmosphere<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.049> good<00:02:34.349> area

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
atmosphere and this is a good area

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.300 
atmosphere and this is a good area
because<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.879> was<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.269> black<00:02:36.510> swamp<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.889> in

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
because this was the black swamp in in

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.459 
because this was the black swamp in in
Northwest<00:02:38.790> Ohio<00:02:39.000> when<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.959> first<00:02:40.230> settlers

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
Northwest Ohio when the first settlers

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.860 
Northwest Ohio when the first settlers
came<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.219> they<00:02:41.459> said<00:02:41.730> our<00:02:41.760> soil<00:02:42.329> was<00:02:42.689> as

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
came here they said our soil was as

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.259 
came here they said our soil was as
black<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.290> midnight<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:44.639> when<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.909> look<00:02:45.150> at

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
black as midnight and when you look at

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.839 
black as midnight and when you look at
the<00:02:45.389> soil<00:02:45.659> now<00:02:46.079> you'll<00:02:46.709> see<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.129> it's<00:02:47.310> not<00:02:47.400> as

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
the soil now you'll see that it's not as

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.300 
the soil now you'll see that it's not as
black<00:02:48.599> it's<00:02:49.049> actually<00:02:49.439> kind<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.829> brown<00:02:50.069> it's

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
black it's actually kind of a brown it's

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.339 
black it's actually kind of a brown it's
lost<00:02:50.639> its<00:02:50.879> color<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.359> it's<00:02:51.510> lost<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.989> lot<00:02:52.139> of<00:02:52.169> its

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
lost its color so it's lost a lot of its

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.280 
lost its color so it's lost a lot of its
organic<00:02:52.889> run<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.269> tell<00:02:54.450> farmers<00:02:54.959> that

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
organic run I like to tell farmers that

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.979 
organic run I like to tell farmers that
a<00:02:56.099> lot<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.879> times<00:02:57.060> when<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.299> till<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.689> soil

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
a lot of times when you till the soil

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.229 
a lot of times when you till the soil
you<00:02:58.230> turn<00:02:58.439> it<00:02:58.590> into<00:02:58.709> cement<00:02:59.280> mix<00:02:59.549> okay<00:02:59.939> and<00:03:00.120> so

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
you turn it into cement mix okay and so

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.330 
you turn it into cement mix okay and so
the<00:03:00.359> soil<00:03:00.629> gets<00:03:00.870> very<00:03:01.139> hard<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.769> dense<00:03:02.010> and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the soil gets very hard and dense and

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.429 
the soil gets very hard and dense and
one<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> things<00:03:03.359> that<00:03:03.569> we've<00:03:03.689> learned<00:03:04.049> is

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
one of the things that we've learned is

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.190 
one of the things that we've learned is
that<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.639> was<00:03:05.819> going<00:03:05.939> to<00:03:06.030> drill<00:03:06.359> into<00:03:06.629> cement

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
that if I was going to drill into cement

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140 
that if I was going to drill into cement
I<00:03:07.349> would<00:03:07.560> start<00:03:07.829> with<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> small<00:03:08.459> drill<00:03:08.730> and

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
I would start with a small drill and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.119 
I would start with a small drill and
then<00:03:09.359> use<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.629> bigger<00:03:10.019> drill<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.620> go<00:03:10.739> through<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
then use a bigger drill to go through it

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.440 
then use a bigger drill to go through it
and<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.340> that's<00:03:11.519> what<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:11.819> do<00:03:11.969> with<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.239> cover

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
and so that's what we do with the cover

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.780 
and so that's what we do with the cover
crops<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.409> cover<00:03:13.680> crops<00:03:14.010> actually<00:03:14.250> have<00:03:14.579> very

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
crops the cover crops actually have very

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.689 
crops the cover crops actually have very
fine<00:03:15.150> roots<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.840> they<00:03:16.019> form<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.620> small<00:03:16.980> hole

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
fine roots and they form a small hole

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.180 
fine roots and they form a small hole
and<00:03:18.000> then<00:03:18.479> we<00:03:18.930> follow<00:03:19.229> that<00:03:19.470> with<00:03:19.769> corn<00:03:20.129> and

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
and then we follow that with corn and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.849 
and then we follow that with corn and
soybeans<00:03:20.729> and<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.840> those<00:03:22.049> corn<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.409> soybeans

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
soybeans and and those corn and soybeans

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.680 
soybeans and and those corn and soybeans
will<00:03:23.069> follow<00:03:23.370> those<00:03:23.669> same<00:03:23.909> channels<00:03:24.419> down

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
will follow those same channels down

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.869 
will follow those same channels down
through<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.199> soil<00:03:25.409> and<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.579> they<00:03:26.699> also

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
through the soil and and they also

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.729 
through the soil and and they also
follow<00:03:27.299> earthworm<00:03:27.959> holes<00:03:28.229> because

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
follow earthworm holes because

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.199 
follow earthworm holes because
earthworms<00:03:29.220> are<00:03:29.400> fairly<00:03:29.760> big<00:03:29.939> and<00:03:30.120> they're

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
earthworms are fairly big and they're

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.990 
earthworms are fairly big and they're
also<00:03:30.329> enriched<00:03:31.319> with<00:03:31.620> nutrients<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.459> so

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
also enriched with nutrients and so

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.969 
also enriched with nutrients and so
those<00:03:33.389> roots<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.439> proliferate

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
those roots just really proliferate

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.059 
those roots just really proliferate
around<00:03:35.729> those<00:03:36.180> earthworm<00:03:36.780> holes<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.500> that's

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
around those earthworm holes and that's

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.909 
around those earthworm holes and that's
how<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.400> then<00:03:38.819> can<00:03:39.449> actually<00:03:39.989> loosen<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> soil

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
how we then can actually loosen the soil

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.189 
how we then can actually loosen the soil
up<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.939> roots<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.689> loosen<00:03:43.109> the

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
up is it's the roots that loosen the

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.800 
up is it's the roots that loosen the
soil<00:03:43.530> up<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.889> give<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.069> carbon<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.389> the<00:03:45.419> soil

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
soil up and give that carbon to the soil

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.409 
soil up and give that carbon to the soil
and<00:03:46.079> also<00:03:46.889> is<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.430> storehouse<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:47.970> all<00:03:48.269> the

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
and also is a storehouse for all the

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.319 
and also is a storehouse for all the
nutrients<00:03:48.989> in<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.199> water

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
nutrients in the water

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.240 
nutrients in the water
so<00:03:51.329> a<00:03:51.359> lot<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:51.989> innovation<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.680> happening<00:03:52.859> it's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
so a lot of innovation is happening it's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.699 
so a lot of innovation is happening it's
really<00:03:53.519> an<00:03:53.609> exciting<00:03:53.939> time<00:03:54.359> because<00:03:54.709> farmers

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
really an exciting time because farmers

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.499 
really an exciting time because farmers
are<00:03:55.859> seeing<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.459> they<00:03:56.639> there's<00:03:57.060> different

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:57.509 
are seeing that they there's different

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.960 
are seeing that they there's different
ways<00:03:57.629> we<00:03:57.930> can<00:03:58.139> improve<00:03:58.739> our<00:03:58.949> soils<00:03:59.430> by<00:03:59.639> adding

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
ways we can improve our soils by adding

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.119 
ways we can improve our soils by adding
cover<00:04:00.180> crops<00:04:00.509> you<00:04:01.199> know<00:04:01.229> by<00:04:01.439> not<00:04:01.590> going<00:04:01.979> to

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
cover crops you know by not going to

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.280 
cover crops you know by not going to
steel<00:04:02.370> by<00:04:02.699> reducing<00:04:03.239> our<00:04:03.359> tillage<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.989> lot<00:04:04.169> of

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
steel by reducing our tillage a lot of

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.659 
steel by reducing our tillage a lot of
good<00:04:04.439> innovative<00:04:04.949> thinking<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.430> think<00:04:05.489> is

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
good innovative thinking I think is

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:21.229 
good innovative thinking I think is
happened

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239
