00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hi there welcome to my video in the

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.570 
hi there welcome to my video in the
video<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.950> my<00:00:05.160> LED<00:00:05.460> conversion<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:07.580> 14.4

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
video of my LED conversion of a 14.4

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.720 
video of my LED conversion of a 14.4
volt<00:00:08.809> work<00:00:09.809> light<00:00:10.790> was<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.080> Panasonic

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
volt work light was a Panasonic

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.599 
volt work light was a Panasonic
lithium-ion<00:00:14.730> 14.4<00:00:15.690> volt<00:00:15.719> work<00:00:16.470> light<00:00:16.800> which<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
lithium-ion 14.4 volt work light which I

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.179 
lithium-ion 14.4 volt work light which I
converted<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> LED<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:19.590> there's<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> back<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
converted to LED so there's the back of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.650 
converted to LED so there's the back of
it<00:00:20.310> back<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> led<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.350> heatsink<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
it back of the led the heatsink and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.849 
it back of the led the heatsink and
small<00:00:24.660> driver<00:00:25.019> board<00:00:25.380> there<00:00:26.840> this<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> LED

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
small driver board there this is the LED

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.750 
small driver board there this is the LED
itself<00:00:30.980> there's<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:33.120> 10<00:00:33.420> degree<00:00:34.399> lens<00:00:35.399> on

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
itself there's a it's 10 degree lens on

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
itself there's a it's 10 degree lens on
it<00:00:36.920> who<00:00:37.920> came<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:39.170> completing<00:00:40.170> unit<00:00:40.469> from

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
it who came as one completing unit from

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:49.360 
it who came as one completing unit from
eBay<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.899> I<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.110> simply<00:00:43.559> wired<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.920> up

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.830 

yes<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:51.289> one<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> bulbs<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.980> gone<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
yes as one of the bulbs have gone so I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.330 
yes as one of the bulbs have gone so I
just<00:00:55.020> smashed<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> bulb<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:55.920> soldered

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
just smashed the bulb and then soldered

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.920 
just smashed the bulb and then soldered
a<00:00:56.399> couple<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.670> wires<00:00:56.789> into<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.629> bulb<00:00:57.840> so

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a couple of wires into the the bulb so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.400 
a couple of wires into the the bulb so
you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.320> quickly<00:01:00.260> retrofit<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you can just quickly retrofit it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.219 
you can just quickly retrofit it
straight<00:01:01.680> into<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> bulb<00:01:02.280> holder<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.140> it's

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
straight into the bulb holder and it's

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.550 
straight into the bulb holder and it's
at<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> fight<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.979> three-way<00:01:08.580> LED<00:01:09.560> so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
at the fight it's a three-way LED so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.240 
at the fight it's a three-way LED so
it's<00:01:10.680> pretty<00:01:10.830> bright<00:01:14.960> part<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.250> converting

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it's pretty bright part of my converting

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.999 
it's pretty bright part of my converting
my<00:01:17.369> life<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.790> LED<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.890> my<00:01:20.420> led<00:01:22.009> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
my life to LED and then with my led to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.649 
my life to LED and then with my led to
you<00:01:23.189> 10<00:01:24.979> basements<00:01:25.979> they're<00:01:26.390> there<00:01:27.390> 48<00:01:27.950> SMD

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
you 10 basements they're there 48 SMD

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
you 10 basements they're there 48 SMD
LEDs<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.930> each<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:32.340> 4<00:01:32.670> watts

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
LEDs in each one about 4 watts

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.580 
LEDs in each one about 4 watts
consumption<00:01:34.400> which<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.869> in<00:01:36.869> total<00:01:37.259> what's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
consumption which is in total what's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.660 
consumption which is in total what's
after<00:01:38.159> 16<00:01:38.930> 16<00:01:39.930> watts<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.979> light<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> entire

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
after 16 16 watts to light the entire

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.420 
after 16 16 watts to light the entire
room<00:01:42.829> instead<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.060> 200<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.360> was<00:01:45.479> before

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
room instead of 200 which it was before

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.359 
room instead of 200 which it was before
so<00:01:47.430> he'll<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.670> difference<00:01:48.860> okay<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.250> just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so he'll of difference okay so if I just

00:01:50.369 --> 00:02:01.789 
so he'll of difference okay so if I just
pop<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:53.570> door<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> take<00:02:01.649> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
pop that back on door so take you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.720 
pop that back on door so take you
outside

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.810 

this<00:02:07.730> is<00:02:08.680> before<00:02:10.300> me<00:02:11.300> too<00:02:11.360> much<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.760> is

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
this is before me too much and this is

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:21.010 
this is before me too much and this is
after<00:02:18.970> these<00:02:19.970> different<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.630> looks<00:02:20.660> quite

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
after these different it looks quite

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.520 
after these different it looks quite
like<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.560> spotlight<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.490> video<00:02:22.730> but

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
like a spotlight on the video but

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.260 
like a spotlight on the video but
fetching<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.740> lot<00:02:24.890> bright<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.400> flood<00:02:31.150> then<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
fetching a lot bright and flood then the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.970 
fetching a lot bright and flood then the
annex<00:02:32.510> at<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> moment<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:35.770> recommend<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.830> do

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
annex at the moment I recommend you do

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.950 
annex at the moment I recommend you do
it<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:39.940> because<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.630> old<00:02:41.780> beau

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
it if you can because the the old beau

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.220 
it if you can because the the old beau
bulbs<00:02:43.000> there<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.210> before<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.020> only<00:02:45.110> have

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
bulbs there in it before you only have

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.430 
bulbs there in it before you only have
to<00:02:45.380> knock<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.690> they<00:02:47.690> blow<00:02:47.930> straight<00:02:48.260> away

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
to knock it and they blow straight away

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.530 
to knock it and they blow straight away
which<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.800> pretty<00:02:49.610> useless<00:02:49.820> considering<00:02:50.450> it's

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
which is pretty useless considering it's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.470 
which is pretty useless considering it's
a<00:02:50.570> work<00:02:50.750> like<00:02:52.060> ya<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.450> run<00:02:54.320> out
