00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.930
 the beginning of the project arises from the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.899
 idea of the president of the company 's 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.540
 today net to generate a ball game to 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.489
 hand that would give more diffusion to the game of 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.430
 the ball but it's wrong or it's a jump 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.440
 very important to be 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.350
 in homes around the world that the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.860
 Basque hand ball may be there that 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.930
 the first official ball game with 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.760
 pelotaris as the best professionals 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.100
 it's a jump that the ball had to give 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.510
 be next to other sports in the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.850
 people houses these devices 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.950
 the fact that you can upload the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.050
 videogame to virtual stores and 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.600
 is available anywhere in 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.310
 few hours 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.460
 make 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.380
 the promotion is worldwide and it 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.930
 can anyone play 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.509
 any age that has a device 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.390
 mobile or a tablet so that from in 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.929
 china usa mexico not only to make a 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.149
 video game ball but also 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.409
 because it's culture then do a little 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.490
 of the ball as more than it is 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.759
 international that everyone can 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.140
 enjoy it and especially that it be 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.759
 adaptable a mobile format that everything 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.770
 the world we have phones we do not play with 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.170
 they daily not the truth for ball 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.880
 and there was no need for a video game like this 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.209
 I think it's a step forward and very 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.209
 beautiful 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.900
 final when you make a soccer game 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.360
 how can there be now 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.940
 there are a lot of you already know how they are 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.740
 the cameras you already know how the 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.710
 controls you know that views have to be 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.450
 take but now clear here in a 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.570
 fronton because he does not know if he has to be 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.759
 in first person from afar as the 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.860
 knocks and you have to find out very well and 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.470
 the truth that there was a very hard work 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.210
 in that sense of study of mostly 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.970
 the theme of the balls as a technician in 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.060
 balls, we tried to explain 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.060
 the conception of the game the beats the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.050
 characteristics of each each pelotari a 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.660
 little good then how the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.000
 greatest challenge above all has been good 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.850
 move the game of the ball to a 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.580
 video game we did not have enough 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.880
 references we have been researching 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.320
 well a lot of sports video games 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.780
 tennis games that maybe the most 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.730
 seemed like the cousin is popular 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.500
 fifa games like no football games 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.780
 team 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.680
 but still but also their 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.210
 particularities 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.820
 if you realize that the ball is a 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.360
 sport in which there are many 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.180
 beats a multitude of variants is the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.550
 take out the rest each pelotari is 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.230
 different and above all it is a video game 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.000
 that has a lot of tactical predominance 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.540
 then it also has something of 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.400
 the complexity not only offer a game 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.410
 that technique is important but that 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.030
 also the player can make a one 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.620
 strategy series can only be done 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.620
 the least strategies that the ball does not 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.560
 the steps to make a model of a 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.379
 pelotari from a pelotari of 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.420
 flesh and bone is the first one done 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.920
 will be missing the photos in different 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.530
 positions different angles that we 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.170
 let us know the volume and form of 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.239
 pilot and from there we make a 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.750
 high level modeling that is 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.760
 basically it's like modeling in clay 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.740
 and from that high-level model 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.030
 we go to a model with less details 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.900
 which is the one that is really included in the 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.510
 game 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.460
 the real problem when it comes to moving to 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.390
 time to create graphics for a 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.430
 videogame is knowing how to measure when 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.160
 stop giving it so much realism and both 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.280
 so much level of detail to make it work 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.260
 well then I think the biggest challenge has 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.900
 it was precisely that not happening of something 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.330
 with a lot of quality to something that can be 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.040
 use mostly on a mobile in the case 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.260
 of the pediments the process is a bit 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.260
 simpler because it is not so organic 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.850
 like that of people we do not have the 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.350
 standard measures we have the measures 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.800
 real of a pediment we have the photos 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.130
 original of the pediment then it is es 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.230
 the process is simpler because 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.200
 you do not have to have as much eye as to 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.610
 modeling a person 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.610
 use it we draw
