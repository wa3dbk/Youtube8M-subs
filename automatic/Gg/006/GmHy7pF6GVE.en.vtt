just real quick from the back a couple
of<00:01:15.610> things<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:15.910> make<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.240> arm<00:01:16.360> trace<00:01:16.630> easier

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
of things that make the arm trace easier

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.530 
of things that make the arm trace easier
one<00:01:18.190> thing<00:01:18.400> you<00:01:18.610> want<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.000> make<00:01:19.090> sure<00:01:19.120> you<00:01:19.360> do

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
one thing you want to make sure you do

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.900 
one thing you want to make sure you do
is<00:01:19.780> fully<00:01:20.050> extend<00:01:20.380> your<00:01:20.470> arms<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:21.550> move<00:01:21.670> isn't

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
is fully extend your arms the move isn't

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.700 
is fully extend your arms the move isn't
really<00:01:22.510> going<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.690> look<00:01:22.810> right<00:01:23.020> if<00:01:23.560> you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
really going to look right if you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.380 
really going to look right if you
haven't<00:01:24.040> bent<00:01:24.250> or<00:01:24.790> rain<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.270> side<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:28.150> if

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
haven't bent or rain on the side so if

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.330 
haven't bent or rain on the side so if
you<00:01:28.450> want<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.690> look<00:01:28.780> clean<00:01:29.080> try<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.010> have<00:01:30.160> your

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
arms straight out the lay extended it's

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
arms straight out the lay extended it's
going<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.550> make<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:33.760> look<00:01:33.910> bigger<00:01:34.060> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
going to make it look bigger and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.300 
going to make it look bigger and
likewise<00:01:36.220> try<00:01:37.060> not<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.240> go<00:01:37.570> towards<00:01:38.350> one<00:01:39.100> arm

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
likewise try not to go towards one arm

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.740 
likewise try not to go towards one arm
until<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:41.020> arm<00:01:41.050> is<00:01:41.410> fully<00:01:42.250> extended<00:01:42.399> out<00:01:42.910> so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
until that arm is fully extended out so

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.660 
until that arm is fully extended out so
i'm<00:01:43.990> not<00:01:44.140> going<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.350> start<00:01:44.680> tracing<00:01:44.950> with<00:01:45.520> this

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
i'm not going to start tracing with this

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.350 
i'm not going to start tracing with this
arm<00:01:45.910> until<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:47.080> hit<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.890> point<00:01:48.190> I'm<00:01:49.060> arms

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
hit the fully extended side before you

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.460 
hit the fully extended side before you
go<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.180> trace<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.920> try<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:08.979> keep<00:02:09.160> tight<00:02:09.580> angles

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
go to trace it try to keep tight angles

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.979 
go to trace it try to keep tight angles
when<00:02:11.470> you're<00:02:11.560> doing<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.799> arm<00:02:11.920> trace<00:02:12.160> so

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
when you're doing the arm trace so

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.539 
when you're doing the arm trace so
instead<00:02:13.989> of<00:02:14.049> having<00:02:14.170> your<00:02:14.920> arms<00:02:14.980> at<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> side

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
right kind of awkward angles try to just

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.280 
right kind of awkward angles try to just
keep<00:02:22.120> nice<00:02:22.390> clean<00:02:23.049> crisp<00:02:24.989> angles<00:02:25.989> with<00:02:26.170> your

other<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.290> other<00:02:29.410> thing<00:02:29.470> with<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:29.799> move

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
other and the other thing with this move

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.300 
other and the other thing with this move
is<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.250> don't<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:32.590> do<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.160> with

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
is you don't have to just do it with

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.360 
is you don't have to just do it with
your<00:02:33.549> hands<00:02:34.150> out<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.130> most<00:02:36.280> common

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
your hands out that's the most common

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.600 
your hands out that's the most common
way<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.060> can<00:02:37.180> do<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.299> with<00:02:37.450> fists<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:39.459> do

so whatever kind of rider you want to

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.820 
so whatever kind of rider you want to
put<00:02:45.880> into<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.299> great<00:02:46.570> let's<00:02:47.350> try<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.560> move

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
put into it is great let's try the move

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.009 
put into it is great let's try the move
half<00:02:48.400> speed<00:02:48.670> with<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> nice<00:02:49.239> slow<00:02:49.480> count<00:02:49.690> then

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
half speed with a nice slow count then
