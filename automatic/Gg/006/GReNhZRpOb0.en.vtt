00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
nana fill or braided line start out with

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.830 
nana fill or braided line start out with
a<00:00:07.589> rope<00:00:07.830> here<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.189> show<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.490> go<00:00:09.450> through<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
a rope here and show you go through the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.830 
a rope here and show you go through the
eyelet<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.849> then<00:00:11.849> back<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.660> like

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
eyelet and then back out just like

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.099 
eyelet and then back out just like
you're<00:00:12.990> starting<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> polymer<00:00:13.679> not<00:00:15.109> give

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
you're starting to polymer not give

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.510 
you're starting to polymer not give
yourself<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.529> little<00:00:16.560> extra<00:00:16.800> line<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> work

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
yourself a little extra line to work

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.929 
yourself a little extra line to work
with<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> lot<00:00:19.350> easier<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.800> do

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
with on this one it's a lot easier to do

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.769 
with on this one it's a lot easier to do
flip<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.119> over<00:00:23.300> it's<00:00:24.300> easier<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
flip that over it's easier it if you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.870 
flip that over it's easier it if you
pinch<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.140> off<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.590> thaler<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.490> other<00:00:26.580> hand

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
pinch it off here thaler the other hand

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730 
pinch it off here thaler the other hand
and<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.599> next<00:00:27.900> step<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.500> make<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and this next step all you do is make a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.540 
and this next step all you do is make a
loop<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.250> itself<00:00:30.170> tuck<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> corner<00:00:31.679> into<00:00:32.430> your

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
loop on itself tuck the corner into your

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.049 
loop on itself tuck the corner into your
other<00:00:32.669> hand<00:00:34.250> okay<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.579> these<00:00:35.730> lines

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
other hand okay you have all these lines

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.150 
other hand okay you have all these lines
here<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.290> loop<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.070> all

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
here and you have this loop and all

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.250 
here and you have this loop and all
you're<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:38.910> around<00:00:39.260> through

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you're going to do is go around through

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.760 
you're going to do is go around through
that<00:00:40.469> loop<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.950> five<00:00:41.760> times<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.649> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that loop here five times you have this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.750 
that loop here five times you have this
closed<00:00:44.100> end<00:00:44.510> pull<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.719> down<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.579> line

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
closed end pull that down on the line

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.950 
closed end pull that down on the line
obviously<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> point<00:00:51.210> where<00:00:51.360> put<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
obviously that's the point where put a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.389 
obviously that's the point where put a
little<00:00:52.110> spit<00:00:52.410> or<00:00:52.620> water<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:52.980> whatever<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
little spit or water or whatever you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.729 
little spit or water or whatever you
want<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:53.969> cinch<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
want to do on there cinch that down and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.430 
want to do on there cinch that down and
then<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> take<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.520> end<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.260> line

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
then you can take this end and the line

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.150 
then you can take this end and the line
that<00:00:58.890> goes<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.460> rod<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:01.160> alternate

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that goes up to your rod and alternate

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.709 
that goes up to your rod and alternate
those<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.670> adjust<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:03.359> down<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
those you can adjust that right down to

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.090 
those you can adjust that right down to
your<00:01:03.750> eyelid

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.340 

here<00:01:09.670> is<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.860> 10<00:01:11.860> pound<00:01:12.070> nano<00:01:12.340> fill<00:01:13.350> through

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
here is the 10 pound nano fill through

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.030 
here is the 10 pound nano fill through
the<00:01:14.470> eyelet

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:31.620 

back<00:01:20.670> out

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.210 

delete

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:49.399 

go<00:01:39.580> around<00:01:39.910> everything

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.550 

and<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.219> closed<00:01:50.609> and<00:01:51.289> just<00:01:52.289> grab

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and that little closed and just grab

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.200 
and that little closed and just grab
that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.750 

grab<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.110> pull<00:02:02.190> let's<00:02:03.190> see<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.460> will<00:02:03.610> just

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
grab and pull let's see it will just

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.880 
grab and pull let's see it will just
sense<00:02:04.030> right<00:02:04.240> down<00:02:04.479> on<00:02:04.720> itself<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.650> not<00:02:05.740> I'll

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
sense right down on itself and not I'll

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.020 
sense right down on itself and not I'll
usually<00:02:06.040> end<00:02:06.340> up<00:02:06.430> pretty<00:02:06.700> high<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:07.720> just<00:02:07.900> take

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
usually end up pretty high you just take

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.809 
usually end up pretty high you just take
these<00:02:10.030> two<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.069> adjust<00:02:12.160> adjust<00:02:12.490> it

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
these two and you can adjust adjust it

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.740 
these two and you can adjust adjust it
right<00:02:13.000> down<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.959> your<00:02:17.080> lure

and<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.560> take<00:02:19.680> your<00:02:19.800> clippers<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.250> got

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
and you just take your clippers you got

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.210 
and you just take your clippers you got
one<00:02:21.780> straight<00:02:22.200> line<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.680> with<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> loop

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
one straight line in one with the loop

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.680 
one straight line in one with the loop
and<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:24.360> just<00:02:24.540> cut<00:02:24.690> those<00:02:24.870> right<00:02:25.200> off<00:02:26.690> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and you can just cut those right off it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.300 
and you can just cut those right off it
