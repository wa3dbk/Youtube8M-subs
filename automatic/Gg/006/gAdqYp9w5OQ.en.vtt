00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
prior to recording the footage for this

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.150 
prior to recording the footage for this
I<00:03:16.910> was<00:03:17.480> killed<00:03:17.720> by<00:03:17.810> hackers<00:03:18.170> twice<00:03:18.590> on<00:03:18.860> two

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
I was killed by hackers twice on two

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.340 
I was killed by hackers twice on two
different<00:03:19.430> servers<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.150> may<00:03:20.600> not<00:03:20.630> sound<00:03:21.110> too

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
different servers it may not sound too

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.650 
different servers it may not sound too
bad<00:03:21.670> simply<00:03:22.670> find<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.970> new<00:03:23.090> server<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.510> keep

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
bad simply find a new server and keep

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.600 
bad simply find a new server and keep
laying<00:03:23.870> right<00:03:24.260> well<00:03:25.100> here's<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.340> thing<00:03:25.580> about

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
laying right well here's the thing about

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.110 
laying right well here's the thing about
dying<00:03:26.210> in<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.510> war<00:03:26.690> z<00:03:27.580> initially<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.610> death<00:03:29.000> and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
dying in the war z initially a death and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.610 
dying in the war z initially a death and
a<00:03:29.240> server<00:03:29.510> meant<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:29.990> character<00:03:30.170> was<00:03:30.470> out

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
a server meant that a character was out

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.370 
a server meant that a character was out
of<00:03:30.650> commission<00:03:30.860> for<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.340> period<00:03:31.640> of<00:03:31.790> one<00:03:32.030> hour

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
of commission for a period of one hour

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.870 
of commission for a period of one hour
there<00:03:33.380> are<00:03:33.560> additional<00:03:33.860> character<00:03:34.400> slots<00:03:34.670> in

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
there are additional character slots in

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.830 
there are additional character slots in
which<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.120> can<00:03:35.270> make<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.450> new<00:03:35.660> character

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
which you can make a new character

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.570 
which you can make a new character
immediately<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.680> start<00:03:36.920> fresh<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.400> that's

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
immediately and start fresh so that's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.730 
immediately and start fresh so that's
not<00:03:37.790> too<00:03:37.850> bad<00:03:38.030> right<00:03:38.440> you're<00:03:39.440> going<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.680> be

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
not too bad right you're going to be

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.230 
not too bad right you're going to be
starting<00:03:39.980> fresh<00:03:40.250> anyway<00:03:40.700> once<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.060> first

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
starting fresh anyway once the first

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.880 
starting fresh anyway once the first
character<00:03:41.450> recovers<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:42.260> there's<00:03:42.410> no<00:03:42.680> real

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
character recovers so there's no real

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.520 
character recovers so there's no real
net<00:03:43.220> gain<00:03:43.459> or<00:03:43.610> loss<00:03:43.790> here<00:03:44.150> well<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.170> one<00:03:45.380> our

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
net gain or loss here well that one our

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.500
