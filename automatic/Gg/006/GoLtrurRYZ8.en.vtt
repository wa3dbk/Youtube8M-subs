00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.300
 hello welcome to all of you on 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.089
 that such today a new video 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.519
 presentation that carry neither more nor 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.380
 less than on one of the motherboards the 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.029
 most desirable of the market currently 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.840
 tsetse flies of most motherboards 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.940
 market prices 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 currently we are going to talk about the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.899
 extreme bag extreme of asus a card 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.129
 mother republic of gamer who is destined 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.600
 clearly to overclockers and 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.449
 users do the most demanding 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.280
 hyperbolic bundle therefore physical to 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.050
 fall to the ground so this is the program 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.820
 of this new video on cocktail is 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.179
 went as always we start with the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.640
 box 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.260
 already nothing but the box we want to 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.570
 the talk is to show how these 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.740
 beauties just below we discover at 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.850
 the motherboard we go without delay 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.250
 was interested in the bundle is already nothing 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.020
 the bundle is a pleasure to you 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.630
 to discover it so there are two 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.860
 things it's Christmas we just have 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.730
 the small plate to the motherboard 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.980
 black 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.780
 the old star to be matched we have the 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.910
 different little stickers for 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.580
 recognize that they are doing the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.350
 ssd and the hdd present in the machine 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.350
 we have of course small pilots 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.590
 a very complete guide with a part 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:53.420
 drivers and utilities the little 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:55.880
 usb cable for where his docks bridges 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.270
 s celi crossfire the all beast jet 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.370
 republic of gamer what sort and sort series 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.640
 celi the little card for the mini 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.899
 pci-express combo with wifi and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.610
 the other side if we want 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:21.769
 the m sata the cable for europe connect 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.280
 different cables sata the devices 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.439
 for measuring points of the voltages 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.159
 odors to easily install the 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:34.250
 power in usb3 all these things there the 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:37.879
 terminal blocks for the wifi card with the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.389
 small antennas for the 4th region have 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:48.010
 continued with a rear square for 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:48.010
 the sata and usb bed 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.689
 we continue with cable sata again 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.060
 always his white versions that are 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.310
 absolutely superb and finally last 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.209
 point and not least the rise etc 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.280
 so is that plugs into the dpi with 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.590
 of the usb also and that allows by 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.510
 example of having a remote display of 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.500
 different settings it's a little 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.329
 absolutely ultimate accessory that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.870
 will also deserve his little video 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:23.900
 particular we immediately go to the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.359
 motherboard here we are now at 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.459
 above this extreme us5 maxim with its 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:32.329
 format it's a bit more than average 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.680
 in 21 x format at what level 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.579
 find on it first we'll talk 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.959
 of these beautiful system of 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:44.419
 cooling with heat pipes and 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.519
 aluminum is very pretty 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.199
 place that will not pose a problem with 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.409
 long graphic cards around the 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.819
 socket we find 12 phases 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.819
 of feeds feeding these 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.620
 chips with a pine case and 1 8 pin at 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.959
 level of taken fans you go the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:11.239
 see it's the orgy one two three four 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:14.120
 five six seven eight briefs 8 taken fans 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.669
 it's quite rare to see as much here 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.450
 find four ports ddr3 that makes you 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.840
 take two thousand 800 megahertz 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.340
 we do not know maximum here we have the pole that 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.170
 centralize a little bit everything that is 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.140
 for overclocking we have for example 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.840
 legault button the selectors for the 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.710
 pci express the measuring points for 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.980
 the voltages the vga sense or the 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.400
 fashion it n 2 or the slow mode and still 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.660
 the post helps him get started if we 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.880
 continue a little further down we go 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.900
 find the 24 pins to power the 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.790
 motherboard the usb header 3.0 and finally 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.850
 the whole sata part with sata 6.0 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:01.530
 for red skins and sata 1 2 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:04.470
 for the black catches what makes us a 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.820
 total of six holds that will handle the sata 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.060
 iii and two taken that will handle that the 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.620
 sata ii next door there is a small block 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.390
 this little blog is the sub zero it's 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.620
 so to have the exact temperature 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.980
 of the motherboard when one is through 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.030
 example 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.950
 sue ellen 2 then we take the small 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.550
 button for the bio switch and all 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.930
 connectors for usb fronds 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.130
 banal all those things 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.890
 as well as a new esata port that is 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.210
 overwhelmed by SATA II at the 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.810
 part pci express 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.740
 we see it we also have a lot of fear in 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.520
 this format 5 in total have to exploit 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:49.730
 a card has entered kz2 karts in 8x 8x or 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:55.850
 three quarter time 8 16 8 or even 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:58.290
 four cards in 8 16 8 8 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.050
 did you understand everything at 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.320
 worse a little tour on the site of asus 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:09.540
 you will explain all that we'll go 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.470
 switch to the back connector with the 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.590
 thunder bolt 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.470
 the buttons for the rog connect or 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.810
 still reboot the motherboard 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:26.550
 three ports usb 2.0 the case for europe 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:29.190
 connect here the eternal 1002 usb 2.0 two 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.000
 optical outputs the hd 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:37.170
 the display port 1 ps 2 2 usb 3.0 of 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.280
 new and the sound in 7.1 with the output 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:46.890
 optical 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:49.410
 of course we finish with the turn in 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.060
 close- up of motherboard story of 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.010
 discover more closely the different 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:07:00.300
 components and the different systems of 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:07:04.020
 cooling the socket the phases 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.770
 power supply ports ddr3 2000 800 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.890
 megahertz 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:11.010
 the overclocking pole with the button 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.200
 power the rize is the post help them 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:17.730
 measuring points the vga scene that's 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:22.260
 legault button at the party level 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:24.060
 storage we see it has sata 6.0 on 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:33.020
 the red pigs of sata 3.0 on the 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:37.350
 black pigs here the n900 suffer the suns 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:40.950
 still a dissipator the pci part 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:43.980
 express with the different ports the 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:47.640
 all compatible what decades it was 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.980
 the extreme maximus 5 overcost tv and on 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.980
 you see you soon on 

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.980
