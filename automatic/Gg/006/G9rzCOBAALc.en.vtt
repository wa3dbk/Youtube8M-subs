00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 at the cartoon intro including the original in the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.550
 title song shoots a standing 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.059
 dragonball fans fast people in the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.130
 eyes 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.769
 but that's the best part 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.540
 dragon ball z battle of set that sounds 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.680
 but now harder than it is then 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 Filmchen also looks easy 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 Kneel well in the rest of the title 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.619
 we are not that excited 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.019
 why the game still not a fool 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.970
 is our test who has never seen anything 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.710
 owned by son goku and his friends 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.279
 he looks at the battle of set in the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.380
 tube 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.090
 in the over 60 single player missions 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.590
 Although we can do the most important fights 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.210
 deny the template 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.950
 But the story will be as good as it gets 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.290
 but not told is not a broken leg 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.000
 because in the feeling of two million 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.950
 Dragonball was playing six games outside 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.780
 chewed through the story often enough 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.460
 nevertheless it is a pity that not even 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.960
 the little cutscenes or the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.800
 mission descriptions about us 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.800
 clarify backgrounds 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.589
 Dragonball z is especially for his 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.799
 terrific fights known what is so 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.630
 closer than a text adventure implementation 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.700
 that's why battle is set 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.159
 like his countless quasi predecessors 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.259
 beat'em up in different from 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.939
 rural areas we are blighting 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.920
 one or more opponents 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.530
 The fighting system is very simple 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.470
 out in close combat we let the fists in 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.240
 Melee energy balls fly with it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.130
 we do not lose the overview 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.360
 we can be an enemy at the touch of a button 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.250
 permanently aim 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.439
 the battles are mostly by it 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.159
 but also good in scene set 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.659
 very confusing very quickly 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.430
 but we have to do something besides our character 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.390
 always our blue energy indicator 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.399
 to have an eye on 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.130
 we need them for television and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.390
 special attacks is the bar to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.220
 Half filled we can 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.210
 make special attacks from the pile like 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.010
 about this one 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.140
 By doing so , she is increasingly teaching herself 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.990
 she invites you for successful close combat attacks 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.090
 but again to play the fights 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.590
 very catchy but offer little 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.990
 Depression and thus become very 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.880
 fast monotonous as well feel 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.619
 many of the figures equal to true 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.670
 how does he go according to statistics 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.140
 damage energy 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.180
 but we do not really notice in the fight 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.100
 but what about the typical ones? 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.410
 transform the figures 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.810
 too few advantages with here for 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.170
 For example, a kamehameha from normal to 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.170
 groups 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.410
 and here one as superstar gem 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.790
 does not just look pretty much the same 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.350
 playful too not too much 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.590
 Difference as content actually 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.360
 by the way, who should come over now 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.580
 the additional life ads left 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.220
 That's the one of ours 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.440
 comrade for apple offset is on 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.430
 corp wedge also designed in 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.440
 individual players 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.870
 and that actually brings a little bit 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.550
 Change into the plodding in front of everyone 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.300
 We can mission our team ourselves 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.800
 compile 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.050
 assuming we have the characters 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.470
 already played free and they are for the 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.760
 chosen mission 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.709
 in the fight we can then common 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.480
 interventions perform about the opponent 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.720
 like a ping pong ball back and forth 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.720
 beat 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.890
 We also invite the genki together 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.750
 indicator on top in the middle is the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.850
 We can fully go to the docu a gang 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.250
 kagawa virtually destroy everything 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.140
 let go of tackle or off the bar 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.220
 energy forfeit about fallen 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.900
 to revive comrades 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.330
 for successfully completed missions 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.790
 it hails then collect cards and points 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.010
 with the collecting cards we give ours 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.440
 Fighting bonuses like more strength 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.120
 or more health for the points 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.170
 however, we can be objects 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.000
 buy the short-term bonuses bring 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.460
 dragonball z battle of sap also offers 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.020
 an online multiplayer mode up to 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.000
 eight players can play with or 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.700
 compete against each other and after 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.050
 your heart's content just blush with that 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.030
 buying thoughts might be the one 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.680
 become entertaining fun yourself 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.540
 we could play the multiplayer 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.540
 unfortunately not yet at the time of the test 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.830
 battle of set is technically like that 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.290
 the surroundings just weaken 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.290
 very static and lifeless and that though 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.330
 smaller elements are added destructible 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.900
 the textures are anything but 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.940
 are contemporary and the figures are 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.250
 sometimes very stiff in their movements 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.580
 or pay attention to the missing 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.680
 Animation of the clothes 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.539
 Apart from that, the title captures the title 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.729
 Look of the template thanks to the cell shading 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.860
 Steals wonderful and can with it 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.949
 even one or the other much texture 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.240
 conceal 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.710
 In addition, the effects are very successful 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.719
 and it pops neatly on the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.409
 screen when a bunch of warriors 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.409
 verkloppen 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.590
 for the little bit speech output though 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.510
 not decisive for the war but at least 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.210
 have it again the original voices 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.440
 the anime series came into play 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:05.100
 either the English or 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.330
 Japanese dragon ball z battle of set 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.760
 is like many already 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.760
 video games implementation of the template before 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.340
 a game for fans the fighting system has 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.440
 in spite of the good corp aspect easy 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.540
 not enough depth to offer serious 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.210
 from fans on long-term enthusiasm 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.190
 dragonball fans do not value one 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.650
 particularly detailed retelling 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.450
 the template can lay but definitely 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.450
 have fun fighting at the arena
