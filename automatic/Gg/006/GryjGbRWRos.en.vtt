 you are barracudas and now I will 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.550
 tell you about our competition for a long time 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.540
 finally promised 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.519
 fourth competition and so we 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.010
 divided our competition into two parts and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.820
 Now I will tell you in detail what 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.760
 must be done in order to become 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.060
 winner of this competition 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.460
 we divided into two parts and it came down 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.189
 what you need in the first part 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.170
 contest to recruit 8 qualifying 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.719
 points performing certain tasks 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.879
 list and as soon as you type them you 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.350
 wait for February 25 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.879
 in order to great and terrible 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.629
 random chose 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.140
 our winner randomizer will not be in 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.600
 one click 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.660
 and we will make a certain algorithm 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 a certain system by which you can 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.590
 will select winners so that it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.030
 it was more interesting so again 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.309
 what like to record 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.970
 it's not worth the points but at the same time 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.220
 adds + 1 feed your and so let's go 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.740
 look at the list of those tasks that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.159
 now they are not ready yet 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.259
 I'm writing it down right now. 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.200
 I decided to write down in more detail 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.490
 explain so you can understand so 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.580
 We are currently 6 tasks 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.520
 times two three 4 5 six yes sure 6 tasks 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.890
 and let's go through the list well in store 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.470
 Recording this record's natural stands 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.770
 one point is such an easy easy start 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.460
 so that in all there was motivation for 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.780
 order to go further and further on the list 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.329
 score the required number of points in 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.220
 the game we pull out a list of five games 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.970
 I have added one for this moment 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.710
 the game will be 5 games and next will be indicated 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.659
 the number of points you need 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.899
 recruit to qualify 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.250
 throw off all your screenshots in 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.640
 a certain daddy I'll add it 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.800
 I remind you how the game is made 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.800
 the way you take off the screenshot and on the side 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.900
 open your write just in the usual 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.330
 Notepad write your nickname so that it was 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.910
 visible so that you can understand what it is 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.130
 it is you who are in the game itself too 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.940
 see that is just do print 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.340
 screen screen 5 games by one point if 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.620
 you pass the qualification that is you 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.220
 it turns out already here five points we can 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.390
 recruit qualifications further let's go 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.880
 take a picture of your workplace with 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.470
 original inscription play com what we 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.959
 we mean by task data 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.540
 need to take a picture of the table with 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.850
 your computer where you sit i mean 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.850
 we are just interested to see how 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.070
 each of you draws a place for which 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.310
 spend a huge amount of time but 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.230
 I hope awesome though maybe not 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.780
 very well what will we need 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.510
 take a photo of your not there tour 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.730
 keyboard mouse all together all this 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.120
 It is not on the desktop 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.040
 table on the table and the usual 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.160
 confirm that it is you who you should 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.900
 somehow note 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.060
 the play kant command is not for example i 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.580
 wrote for example lay out of pencils 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.400
 they will hand over there I don’t know how to show it 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.100
 fantasy than the more original will 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.980
 your inscription 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.260
 the more fun the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.010
 we really like it 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.340
 the best things celebrate the final 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.920
 and so fourth to fourth job 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.530
 fourth place I'm starting slowly 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.060
 handing out so guess one of the giras 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:52.010
 which will be set means that here 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.690
 I will explain this in more detail below. 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.810
 prescribe and besides that below we 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.959
 We will still mark the task data on 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.650
 streams ie go to the stream 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:08.730
 will have time to hear it first on our 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.519
 streams and so for example we make 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.470
 some character 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.440
 explain this character will be required 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.139
 from the game most likely the main character or 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.840
 some kind of charismatic hero well 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.600
 everyone knows for example for example 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.660
 some splinter cell or maybe 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.870
 be there assassin's creed borderlands not 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.389
 I know it doesn't matter, we make him explain 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.590
 so that we will say so in riddles 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:41.070
 understandable and you just write your answers 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.110
 and we directly to those who guess 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.570
 We write in lichku that yes you really 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.520
 guessing got one point please then 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.470
 this data does not share those who 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.700
 will share go to ban and 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:56.050
 accordingly will not receive 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:58.150
 the ability to achieve for ps4 further fifth 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.950
 task in principle I think for 4 all 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.500
 understandable so let's go further 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.200
 subscribe to stream channel list sites 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.810
 add separately here below I'll write 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.330
 list of sites where we go stream 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.780
 it's also such an easy way to make money 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.780
 1 point on the first for us will be 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.570
 useful and secondly for you too 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.390
 interesting to come see what we 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.460
 do on stream and accordingly to us 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.880
 it is necessary that you get rid of printscreen 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.560
 and that yes i'm subscribed here i will explain in 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.870
 list of sites how to do it and where 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.750
 add all links i add 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.550
 Naturally the sixth task and the last 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.710
 this week come up with a new project 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.260
 category for streamers describe the idea that 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.630
 it means you are writing your idea of ​​having 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.240
 what let's say so the transfer we could 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.410
 do on your stream or on 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.780
 youtube channel but for example 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.030
 come up with a game on stream yes that is 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.780
 the task of some panic challenge we 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.020
 watch the game and say what we like 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.540
 I do not like it, let 's review the game 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.850
 conclusion look say so and now 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.910
 think up roughly on base you play 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.650
 your game and you have to beat 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.800
 the game has changed dramatically and at the same time 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.810
 it became better here and our task to come up 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.880
 but this is how for example you can have 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.470
 his and that we added for those who want 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.170
 show imagination or have it 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.100
 fell somewhere 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.280
 a long time ago the idea he wanted 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.230
 offer nobody listened to him or he didn't 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.560
 I wrote because I was ashamed of your chance 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.170
