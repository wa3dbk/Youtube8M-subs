00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.850
 new gta 5 video I'm here with the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.519
 church is to tell you a news 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.620
 that just came out a few minutes ago 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.000
 about gta 5 you know that a while ago 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.290
 a few months ago then I went up the first 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.269
 trailer that they took out for new consoles 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.480
 they just took out another one and announced 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.270
 the official departure date for pc for 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.090
 xbox one and for playstation 4 but it has 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.640
 there was something wrong that is capable 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.769
 well the thing is that for those of us 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
 like the pcital we like the pc game 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.870
 play on pc by the theme of the modes 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 especially in gta because it has been delayed or 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.780
 they have set the date for departure 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.600
 of fish later on November 18 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.760
 for playstation 4 and that put and the 27 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.739
 January is four months later 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.680
 for fish at the end of January not 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.750
 we will have the PC version and that's why 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.079
 frame and me no no no no is that we do not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.699
 have liked a lot of power is that after 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.890
 of so many months waiting for it to come out 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 finally to see how it looked good 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.250
 with the new graphic improvements the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.229
 new animals that he has gotten that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 true in the new trailer casaca erased 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.970
 be a few minutes ago we've been 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.310
 all right 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.850
 and they have put an orca there is also a 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.440
 new dog that can be called skip it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.140
 you can call that it's going to be called like that 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.620
 it can be called skip and you can see it looks 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 rather better than in the current console 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.320
 to play 3 or xbox but good I do not know what 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 it will go to the end because when I leave 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.170
 I will not have any of the new 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.510
 consoles because I do not want to buy it or 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.390
 be I want it for pc so I'll do 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.030
 some donations so that you pay me the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.550
 console or I'll have to ask people 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.050
 that I put something like that because I do not know about 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.770
 where will I get a play 4 now 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.380
 so then it's a bitch the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.280
 I really do not know there are new images the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.110
 true that people are pretty 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.050
 pissed off here in the trailer I know a lot 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.790
 people a little angry because of the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.530
 news not because it's going to go out for 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.090
 other consoles and is that it is a bit 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.979
 of faith or for what reasons they have 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.840
 take out the pc version 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.880
 later there is none, that is, 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.400
 difference and it's the same or I think 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.399
 that the money the money that they have 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.929
 paid so that they pull this further back and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.480
 so the people then buy the consoles 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.120
 I the only application that I see because 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.120
 what reasons any for fucking is already 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.599
 the only reason why in the fish 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.489
 have delayed so much I think it's for 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.299
 that people will buy play four of 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.040
 team one 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.519
 I already think about buying me 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.730
 laporta to have it but I do not know 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.030
 It's a lot I do not know I do not really want the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.920
 play four the truth 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.490
 the things that they put in the forums and other 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.610
 Well a lot of people complaining that pc 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.530
 has been delayed and such and is this that at 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.970
 better they force you or that 18 on 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.319
 November and coming out in January are 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.450
 four months later I think it's a 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:57.190
 like they're forcing you to buy 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.170
 a console 04 the bitch is that I do not know 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.330
 when he left the trailer e3 makes a 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.760
 months they said that he would fall in a 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.459
 the end of this year I was coming to comingsoon 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.319
 in 2014 you know when the year would end 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.209
 says good is going to come out finally 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.590
 before the end of the year you'll have 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.870
 and now they say no that by January 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.090
 we can put that already for 2080 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.090
 they do not sell it my mother how disgusting 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.090
 and well, the things that have 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.830
 added a lot of things things 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.470
 graphically it is very cool and they are a 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.780
 improvement is seen that remarkable and in addition they are going to 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.520
 put new effects for the environment 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.830
 environment and such new animals that has 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.360
 said you also more the climates and everything 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.760
 that's going to change is in a bit you see 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.930
 here in the trailer a killer whale that looks 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.280
 be that he has gotten a lot more than 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.810
 animals in evil because currently 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.600
 there were only a few sharks out there 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.790
 lost and four fish that were also 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.400
 little strangers because they were like planes not 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.530
 I know if they also said that also 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.780
 they will include new exclusive content 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.480
 of other versions of gta or gta 4 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.330
 gta new vehicle is worth as it is 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.400
 example the plane is plane which is the one 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.950
 a seaplane that lands in the water 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.720
 and a car that I do not know if you will know 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.010
 that is the doge that is supposed to be a 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.530
 emblematic car of the saga gta iv 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.530
 also a new version of the bling that 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.680
 is the 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.180
 the balloon that we have if the airship that 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.829
 you did not tell me where they give you the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.989
 content that when you buy the game 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.220
 Well man you notice that they have worked or 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.630
 it is not of these that they take a game and 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.160
 it's going to be the same game just a little 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.110
 improved it shows that things have gotten 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.520
 new but it's that guy is better than 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.680
 an egg look like I like rock star 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.630
 but my son from an egg will be because I am 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.120
 of pc and that but I fucked a male egg 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.250
 that they will delay it is that it is a 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.860
 male bitch the thing would be that I 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.430
 I think it is the lace that pulls me 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.870
 the people that I want to wait seems that and 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.870
 in the trailer that has brought it nothing 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.610
 they see things from this game and from which 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.360
 we have now you can see the 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.910
 killer clowns also around here you see 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.950
 to michael to trevor fighting as always 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.290
 and little more water I'm also a bit 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.890
 that has improved although the one that we have 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.930
 now it looks very good races and the 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.120
 altruists are also seen here I do not know 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.680
 if there will be any mission over there 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.419
 I do not know if they throw anything at me the jetpack 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.860
 the jetpack had had to say it there 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.690
 to say it on the 10th so the jetta 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.780
 this is also talked about that 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.430
 month many many comments say that 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.860
 as well 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.260
 and that about things like you said about the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.820
 altruistic and it 's the jetpack to what they are 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.560
 include them in this version you do not know 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.660
 but not many things have been seen 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.550
 enpa's aliens trailer are already 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.700
 murderers and that maybe if you have to 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.110
 see something with that so I do not expect that 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.790
 you liked the video anything 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.220
 you put the comments and Carlos talks 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.720
 now or kayah forever good 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.480
 well what we hope they put new 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.470
 little things in this new version of 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.410
 consoles we'll see for pc that stops 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.890
 pc will be the boom because with the 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.170
 mods and others go on things that is another 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.730
 world is worth gta for pc that for consoles 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.370
 so I hope the console includes 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.490
 something new new missions new 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:04.270
 mystery framework is expert in that and 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.440
 we have that if everything goes well 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.090
 so nothing thank you very much subtract for 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.500
 have taken the game so that I 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.740
 I was wrong 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.740
 goodbye
