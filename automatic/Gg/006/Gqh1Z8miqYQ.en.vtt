00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.569
 in the bar sound 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.060
 and it is already 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.060
 yes 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.980
 some time ago but san went through 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.860
 valentine and then how could we 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.960
 let it go I left it for today the truth 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.490
 is that we want as a master in this 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.770
 of photo editing with the cell phone 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.220
 but if I give some challenges that are my 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.070
 photos does not appear 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.020
 They were a bit interested in this topic on the day of 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.620
 today to have as my edito my photos of 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.650
 urges 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.620
 I have never put an itunes card 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.830
 my cell phone or my account so none 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.570
 of the applications that I have is paid 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.610
 so if you have one time they are 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.860
 you can probably download any of 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.350
 these applications and if you have any 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.270
 phone that is android I think the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.490
 most also is for that platform 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.920
 so if you want to see how I edit my 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.470
 photos for instagram let's see is 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.380
 first I'm going to show you all this 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.060
 division in office and what I do is go 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.690
 an application that is called photo wonder 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.640
 what is this here and what I do 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.979
 regular is to go to the area that says 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.350
 beauty that is to fix one that 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.600
 another thing from the face and I will use 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.729
 this one that says skin that makes your face 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.220
 it looks like super super perfect without 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.020
 wrinkles and everything so super good as if 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.759
 you were porcelain and then I'm going to 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.420
 use this called time fight 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.670
 which is to thin areas or 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.110
 fatten them if you want to do it and then 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 let's take off a little bit of cheek 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.710
 I 'm just understanding how it's done 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.229
 and the point is that he has a little ball 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.539
 that changes size with what you can 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.329
 do as very detailed things or very 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.070
 big and you can also zoom in 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.049
 to do it much more detailed and here 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.759
 what autonomy nobody always knows 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.219
 help me go because I do not know if they have seen 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.009
 but it is something crooked then little by little 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.649
 like a little bit more straight and then 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.069
 let's go to the other parts of this 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.560
 application and here I am in double mission 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.049
 fix that is basically what takes away 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 the granites or things like that but like me 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.010
 I almost do not have pimples but if I have 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.569
 scars what I do is erase by 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.310
 example is from the nose and you 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.810
 have seen many times tried to 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.450
 disguise the does not erase completely 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.920
 but because something is something 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.170
 now almost always regular 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.650
 he used barack green which is basically 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.769
 a draft of dark circles and although it was 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.380
 dark with concealer is not always so 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.870
 reliable this method so I try to 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.849
 do this in almost all my photos and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.250
 they also give as a luminosity 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.800
 as if you had put on a concealer 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.130
 plus 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.500
 clarito and now I'm going in this one called 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.450
 large ice which is an effect that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.920
 love the truth is that I have the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.510
 eyes already big enough for 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.210
 proportion of my face but I like 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.160
 much how it looks and they remain huge and 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.020
 now I'm going to save it and so 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.940
 regular also always you have 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.400
 seen used this application that 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.980
 call square ready what is it 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.020
 the photos as in a white marquito there 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.360
 three different ways of doing it one 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.130
 is to extend it up but as in 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.380
 this format of photos and is elongated 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.720
 upwards no changes are seen after 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.180
 of that long the sides that gives you just 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.190
 these two frames to the edges and this 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.980
 that gives you a complete frame around 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.930
 the whole picture is the truth my favorite 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.820
 and I keep it and always keep in 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.550
 bigger quality I do not know why I have 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.130
 that mania now I'm going to show you this 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.440
 another application that I'm going down here 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.660
 leave all the names of all and in 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.090
 this what I usually do is 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.400
 apply or see laws that are like things 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.860
 that go up our photo and there 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.210
 several effects that I like quite 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.720
 one is this that is like lights that 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.880
 almost always when in a photo the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.830
 you move fast and then the shutter does not 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.170
 it closes and then it changes the light and it 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.360
 it stays there and also the other one that I like 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.670
 is this that they are like also flashes 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.530
 of light in various colors and see that a 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.020
 Sometimes they were watching us 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.900
 red and they also have these that are 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.670
 like of tempura of valentine and so 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.940
 regular so they have many things for 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.800
 times another application that I also 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.990
 like it's this one called rocky and what 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.330
 what I do with this one is almost always putting 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.640
 the letters because it has some very 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.250
 very parents and you write whatever and 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.410
 after picassent the little symbol of the 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.510
 letter and here they give you the options of 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.040
 all the sources he has and really 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.420
 I think it's there it was super super 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.830
 father all sources I like 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.650
 very much in case you want to put some 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.480
 message in your photo I think this is the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.090
 best 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.160
 and this one that is here is called wonder cam 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.140
 who is the sister of photo wonder so 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.850
 Take the photo from the beginning as 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.430
 a filter that looks super nice not 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.930
 I know how he does this thing and this is 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.910
 Grapefruit that also has some filters 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.220
 super parents are the ones I like the most 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.190
 the filters I prefer these many times 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.580
 that those who have instagram and have 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.010
 as for times and things and has ones that 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.280
 they are like polaroid photos and have 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.380
 years that is the qualities of the photos 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.370
 he's super super father and he gives you some 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.960
 effects that I like very much and 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.690
 I also have this other one called 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.640
 insta pick frame that is a I do not know if they have 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.850
 seen lately that I upload as photos 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.940
 well in just four small squares 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.550
 with this I do it they are basically 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.490
 layers to put the photos on and 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.550
 put as a collage here I will be 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.169
 teaching for example the change of the 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.860
 original photo that is this 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:53.009
 and the photo that is already edited without much 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.710
 cheek and with my nose straight and with 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.270
 the skin a little more perfect so 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.740
 as you can see if there is much much 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.499
 change of fact until as they are erased 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.139
 the wrinkles and all this all then 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:05.789
 I think it makes a big difference and 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.610
 you also see a little bit of the eyes 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:11.370
 because they are exaggeratedly big in addition 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.680
 that I already have them big and well 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.599
 nothing more than instagram and post 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.029
 I also have this option that I 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.710
 like a lot is called animals face and da 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.409
 some effects like super fun 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.449
 because it puts you faces like animals and 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.419
 there are many animals there are tigers and pandas 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.099
 and hairstyles to stools and everything then I think 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.110
 that is super fun you see a lot 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.729
 better when they are wide photos and since 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.800
 we are in this cell phone I spend my 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:38.039
 new user of snap chat is mont cross 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.439
 point 25 so we can be out there 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.710
 in touch and see all the crazy things 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:42.710
 what 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.770
 as I said my photos to upload them to 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.660
 you change but I want you to 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.370
 seemed very useful also comment more 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.470
 you use some application that 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.110
 they think that really is very nice 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.000
 leave me down here for what 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.950
 this video can be useful and they can 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.420
 share in any of your networks 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.970
 social and that way I would be 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.340
 helping to bring new people to the channel and 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.260
 we ended up with the valentine and for a 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.180
 We are going to be resting from 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.590
 all these temporary issues 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.720
 If you want to see something special 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.850
 special in this weather channel here 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.860
 below as a suggestion and I will try 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.110
 do it in a time that always goes 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.180
 help a lot very much where little fingers 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.500
 up these videos if you like them all 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.510
 or most of the ways of this channel 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.770
 subscribe cya because it's free here 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.720
 down there is a red button that says 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.720
 subscribe and if you do not find it I 'll go 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.320
 and one that comes and subscribe then 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.580
 more ethical and so simple I confess that 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.200
 that's it for this occasion is my 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.070
 name is night and see you in the 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.070
