00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.190
 «It was an incident shocked a 15-year-old student hit on Monday 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.090
 the deputy headmaster of Joseph von eichendorff school to the ground 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.809
 and stepped on him 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.429
 The teacher was injured the day after but he is back in the 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.930
 School I was shocked yesterday in the moment that happens my abbot what 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.409
 not what something happens 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.560
 and I lay on the floor and I percent 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.689
 As Reich Ward important as in a trance he lives Jürgen Fischer has the attack so 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.449
 I go here to a student group and 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.610
 After all, Gunkel told Gesine Schuline and a student 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 who had barred the hunt in Thursday before 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.160
 Percent of the school 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.910
 this student was still there and he addressed me or violently 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.350
 addressed and said why do they claim such things about me 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.430
 and I told him I do not know what it's about and 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.190
 yes ladies 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.910
 is also not going on has boxed pushed me and when I lay on the ground 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.480
 stepped on me twice 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.720
 the adolescent had previously noticed again and again massive 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.370
 and again and again teachers school social workers led the police with 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.730
 talk about it 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.510
 it probably helped little 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.070
 because he was temporarily excluded from class 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 and that's probably going to freak out with the 15-year-old on Monday 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.570
 now 40 years of schooling I'm percent my last team year 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.790
 official wine press seventh ends 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.980
 I did not think it possible that such an incident should happen 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.030
 Understand the Fussvolk could take place an incident like it in the cash register 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.430
 ever given 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.410
 No, not in this dimension 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.410
 So that Dragon your teacher has been so physically assaulted 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.410
 Of course, there are always scuffles in the schoolyards around the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.890
 denying that percent would also misunderstand the presence of many a reality 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.560
 but not the food unique case I also believe that the uniqueness 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.860
 This is also the hope of the students of the Eichendorffschule 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 All shocked for the first time would never have thought that is so far can come 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.329
 fire 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.390
 Peter Steinacher does not understand 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.160
 yes and that too with his teacher all dfb-chef someone who is 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.520
 Head student used to race a problem, the crowds have fishermen 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.840
 a popular teacher so after the attack of students colleagues 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.999
 is supported 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:12.650
 yesterday launched an action against violence informed all students about 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.059
 the incident and distributed backend 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:19.249
 this solidarity shows how high the social engagement of student teachers 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.109
 and parents at this school is this one another and mutual respect 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.109
 are taught to the students with many projects again and again 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.559
 The consequence is that we continue very hard in this school 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:31.609
 work on it 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.579
 to improve our climate even more «We consider it a good climate 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.680
 over about eleven Rechtspfleger conduct over he insults and 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.349
 Also talk about violence at schools talk more about listening to the police with the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.419
 15 years 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.899
 namely, has been reported for dangerous bodily injury 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:51.979
 according to a juvenile judge it may well be that he with 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.479
 He also has to change school 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.209
 or he is being trained 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.829
 and a little more of course he has to apologize to me in all 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.969
 Form but we will still help him at this school he has 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:06.260
 no future anymore 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.509
 we will help him at other schools 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.539
 To help the culprit, I want to once again become the culprit 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:15.559
 another proof that the Eichendorff school lives up to its principle 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.909
