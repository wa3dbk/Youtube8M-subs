modified versions of that whereas the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
modified versions of that whereas the
old<00:01:55.649> days<00:01:55.859> they<00:01:56.369> use<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> crosscut<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
old days they use the crosscut to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.599 
old days they use the crosscut to
actually<00:01:57.719> buff<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.200> fell<00:01:58.409> timber<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.950> now

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
actually buff in fell timber and now

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:00.980 
actually buff in fell timber and now
they<00:01:59.759> use<00:01:59.880> them<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.270> compete<00:02:00.539> with<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
they use them just to compete with and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.020 
they use them just to compete with and
they're<00:02:01.109> super<00:02:01.469> fast<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:02.039> lot<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.609> crosscut

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
they're super fast a lot of the crosscut

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.649 
they're super fast a lot of the crosscut
saws<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.479> actually<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.899> cut<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> chainsaw<00:02:05.659> we

these guys still have 10 toes
but<00:02:18.939> they<00:02:19.090> used<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.390> do<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.540> lot<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.959> that

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
but they used to do a lot of that that

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.690 
but they used to do a lot of that that
was<00:02:20.140> called<00:02:20.349> bucking<00:02:20.709> up<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:20.920> log<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.519> guys

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
was called bucking up a log the guys

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.610 
was called bucking up a log the guys
would<00:02:21.909> shop<00:02:22.180> between<00:02:22.510> their<00:02:22.659> feet<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.110> break<00:02:23.590> a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
would shop between their feet to break a

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.069 
would shop between their feet to break a
long<00:02:23.980> log<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.640> half<00:02:25.209> these<00:02:25.569> guys<00:02:25.629> are<00:02:25.959> just

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
long log in half these guys are just

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.990 
long log in half these guys are just
made<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> competition<00:02:26.799> what<00:02:27.220> they'll<00:02:27.370> do<00:02:27.579> they

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
made a competition what they'll do they

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.819 
made a competition what they'll do they
actually<00:02:28.209> cut<00:02:28.629> have<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.079> log<00:02:29.260> through<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
actually cut have to log through and

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.589 
actually cut have to log through and
then<00:02:30.189> they<00:02:30.340> turn<00:02:30.579> their<00:02:30.760> bodies<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.209> go<00:02:31.360> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
then they turn their bodies and go the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.089 
then they turn their bodies and go the
other<00:02:31.629> side<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.170> log<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.530> chop<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:32.769> until

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
other side of the log and chop it until

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.670 
other side of the log and chop it until
it<00:02:33.159> breaks<00:02:33.599> first<00:02:34.599> one<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.989> has<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> log<00:02:35.409> break

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
it breaks first one it has a log break

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.089 
it breaks first one it has a log break
in<00:02:35.799> half<00:02:35.980> as<00:02:36.099> your<00:02:36.220> winter<00:02:37.590> well<00:02:38.590> okay

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
in half as your winter well okay

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.920 
in half as your winter well okay
certainly<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:39.909> could<00:02:40.030> see<00:02:40.269> how<00:02:40.420> most<00:02:40.720> of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
certainly you could see how most of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.180 
certainly you could see how most of
these<00:02:41.019> techniques<00:02:41.500> would<00:02:41.709> have<00:02:41.860> been<00:02:41.950> used

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
these techniques would have been used

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.670 
these techniques would have been used
back<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.700> 1800's<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:43.989> what<00:02:44.260> about<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
back in the 1800's but what about the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.929 
back in the 1800's but what about the
hot<00:02:44.859> saw<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:46.239> hot<00:02:46.420> sauce<00:02:46.659> is<00:02:46.840> basically<00:02:47.439> just

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
hot saw the hot sauce is basically just

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.930 
hot saw the hot sauce is basically just
speed<00:02:48.939> noise<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.440> it's<00:02:50.650> good<00:02:51.220> for<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.549> crowd

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
speed noise so it's good for the crowd

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.020 
speed noise so it's good for the crowd
just<00:02:52.629> like<00:02:52.750> going<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.200> races<00:02:53.769> or<00:02:54.310> NASCAR

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
just like going to races or NASCAR

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.140 
just like going to races or NASCAR
IndyCar<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:56.829> all<00:02:57.459> about<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.849> speed<00:02:58.120> and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
IndyCar so it's all about the speed and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
IndyCar so it's all about the speed and
noise<00:02:59.609> the<00:03:00.609> official<00:03:01.060> Paul<00:03:01.269> Bunyan<00:03:01.659> show<00:03:01.900> has

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
they actually exhibit the old log

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.720 
they actually exhibit the old log
rolling<00:03:11.409> where<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.889> guys<00:03:12.040> get<00:03:12.220> up<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.489> log

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
rolling where the guys get up on a log

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.729 
rolling where the guys get up on a log
and<00:03:12.760> try<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.269> knock<00:03:13.329> each<00:03:13.540> other<00:03:13.870> off<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.319> that

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.990 
and try to knock each other off and that
really<00:03:14.950> goes<00:03:15.069> back<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.519> old<00:03:15.639> days<00:03:15.760> where

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
really goes back to the old days where

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.399 
really goes back to the old days where
the<00:03:16.030> logs<00:03:16.269> were<00:03:16.359> put<00:03:16.599> on<00:03:16.629> rivers<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.230> moved

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
the logs were put on rivers and moved

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.410 
the logs were put on rivers and moved
downstream<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.639> guys<00:03:18.790> had<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.090> jump<00:03:19.329> from

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
they actually instead of just raw

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.880 
they actually instead of just raw
horsepower<00:04:02.120> they<00:04:02.930> got<00:04:03.110> longer<00:04:03.290> arms<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.799> can

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
horsepower they got longer arms that can

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.770

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
generate more speed with their chops and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.479 
generate more speed with their chops and
they're<00:04:05.840> blows<00:04:06.080> that<00:04:06.709> throws<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.069> action

they're blows that throws the action

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.740 
they're blows that throws the action
just<00:04:07.670> as<00:04:07.790> hard<00:04:07.940> as<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.090> guy<00:04:08.120> that's<00:04:08.239> twice<00:04:08.540> as
