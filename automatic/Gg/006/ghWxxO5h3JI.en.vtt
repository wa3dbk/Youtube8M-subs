00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.470 

today<00:00:01.290> we're<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.620> talk<00:00:01.829> about<00:00:02.480> fixed

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
today we're going to talk about fixed

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.070 
today we're going to talk about fixed
voltage<00:00:04.040> versus<00:00:05.040> variable<00:00:05.370> voltage<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.509> what

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
voltage versus variable voltage and what

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.980 
voltage versus variable voltage and what
the<00:00:07.230> differences<00:00:07.740> are<00:00:08.630> when<00:00:09.630> you're<00:00:09.780> running

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
the differences are when you're running

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.259 
the differences are when you're running
your<00:00:10.230> train<00:00:10.650> you're<00:00:11.190> using<00:00:11.429> variable<00:00:12.120> voltage

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
your train you're using variable voltage

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.539 
your train you're using variable voltage
that<00:00:13.139> means<00:00:13.200> you're<00:00:13.620> increasing<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
that means you're increasing and

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.269 
that means you're increasing and
decreasing<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.299> throttle<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.350> speed<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:17.039> or

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
decreasing the throttle to speed up or

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.120 
decreasing the throttle to speed up or
slow<00:00:17.340> down<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> Train<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:19.439> direction<00:00:19.890> button

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
slow down the Train the direction button

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.359 
slow down the Train the direction button
basically<00:00:20.970> takes<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> power<00:00:22.010> turns<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.189> off

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
basically takes the power turns it off

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.689 
basically takes the power turns it off
and<00:00:23.400> turns<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.060> back<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.590> that<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:25.980> cycles

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and turns it back on that then cycles

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.470 
and turns it back on that then cycles
the<00:00:26.910> directional<00:00:27.449> state<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:28.019> train<00:00:29.480> when

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
amps or two ten

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.750 
amps or two ten
to<00:04:27.170> a<00:04:27.200> regulated<00:04:28.870> level<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:31.130> you<00:04:31.190> can<00:04:31.460> have<00:04:31.580> as

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
to a regulated level so you can have as

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.780 
to a regulated level so you can have as
much<00:04:32.000> as<00:04:32.240> 20<00:04:32.750> amps<00:04:33.260> at<00:04:33.410> 14<00:04:33.830> volts<00:04:34.250> which<00:04:34.550> would

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
much as 20 amps at 14 volts which would

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.180 
much as 20 amps at 14 volts which would
really<00:04:35.000> be<00:04:35.180> enough<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.600> run<00:04:35.810> just<00:04:36.140> about<00:04:36.380> every

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
really be enough to run just about every

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.060 
really be enough to run just about every
accessory<00:04:37.820> on<00:04:38.230> almost<00:04:39.230> every<00:04:39.590> layout<00:04:39.770> out

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
accessory on almost every layout out

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.410

there again or not again but your

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.720 
there again or not again but your
railroad<00:04:44.960> will<00:04:45.230> really<00:04:45.560> dictate<00:04:45.860> what<00:04:46.580> you

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
railroad will really dictate what you

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.680 
railroad will really dictate what you
need<00:04:47.050> as<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:48.440> grows<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.220> as<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.970> accessories

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
need as it grows and as the accessories

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.080 
need as it grows and as the accessories
and<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.590> features<00:04:52.040> of<00:04:52.070> your<00:04:52.370> railroad<00:04:52.580> grow

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
and the features of your railroad grow

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.810 
and the features of your railroad grow
your<00:04:53.900> transformers<00:04:54.770> or<00:04:54.950> your<00:04:55.100> power<00:04:55.310> supplies

your transformers or your power supplies

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.530 
your transformers or your power supplies
will<00:04:56.120> have<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.420> grow<00:04:56.570> with<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:58.180> so<00:04:59.180> there<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.510> a

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
will have to grow with it so there is a

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.690 
will have to grow with it so there is a
difference<00:05:00.080> between<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.830> variable<00:05:01.520> voltage

direction whistle bell at its disposal
fixed<00:05:11.270> is<00:05:11.420> just<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.780> fixed<00:05:12.200> amount<00:05:12.320> of<00:05:12.650> voltage
