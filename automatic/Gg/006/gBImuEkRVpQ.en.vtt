 to be with us live to have 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.330
 accepted our invitation despite the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.679
 extremely delicate circumstances that 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.210
 you currently him for the stadium 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.370
 French the towers of our lady I the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.839
 precise this morning will turn into 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.910
 party in rugby posts 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.460
 you are going to put a candle seat to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.630
 our lady soon to shop or talk 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.970
 never torn every Sunday but to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.640
 saint jeanne de chantal and the parish 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590
 get up in the 16th and yes for 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.029
 holy cloud so maybe we can 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.980
 obviously speaking we will not speak that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.350
 of that because your story is written 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.790
 over I was going to say two fields 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 today we will talk about 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.320
 abundantly first your investment 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.510
 in terms of promoting singing 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 liturgical Gregorian music 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.230
 sacred and filigree obviously from the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.510
 faith which is yours 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.460
 and then there is of course rugby 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.989
 naturally the French stage which is 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.160
 a Parisian club for those who do not 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.510
 do not follow particularly the news 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.710
 of rugby we can remind him who is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.420
 found in a delicate situation 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.739
 today we go a little bit talking about it 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.699
 at the very beginning if you want it well max 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.680
 guazini because this is one of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 the team anyway this morning you 're 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.270
 today victim of a scam of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.010
 the part of a foundation that should have 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.409
 resume the club and you are 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.790
 today perhaps under the threat 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.229
 of a relegation actually not even 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.760
 maybe by the way since the spell is going 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.950
 to decide for the French stadium club 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.689
 the French stadium club in and a few 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.340
 days can you come back on 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.570
 this story in two words is a 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.580
 Canadian foundation that should have 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.869
 take back your club put money 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.060
 then finally no it's perfect 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.530
 first I want to say that the appointment 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.780
 caunes had to radio our lady was 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 of the previous good and despite the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.460
 circumstances hello hulot would not have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.680
 or make false bond yesterday so I said 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.600
 that despite everything I will come his grave 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.729
 obviously in a situation 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.299
 completely dramatic we are in full 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.860
 tormented 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.710
 but I think I had to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.040
 honor him only with regard to one there 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.560
 will come back later it's true that 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.000
 at the base what happens is the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.219
 bankruptcy our advertising agency 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.009
 independent all had a control 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.570
 advertising which unfortunately we 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.899
 had in our projected budget 6 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.369
 million euros of sponsorship planned gold 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.990
 not only did our management not do 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.000
 its 6 million 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.250
 in addition to the money she has collected 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.020
 she had she gave us a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.470
 tiny part which makes that at the end of 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.650
 year 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.230
 it is missing about 4 and a few millions 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.640
 in time the accounts so at this 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.040
 moment there what we did we will open 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.390
 the capital of the club and there was a 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.000
 first round of table that was pretty 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.240
 difficult to concretize then next to 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.070
 that bernard laporte in good faith or 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.940
 double canadians they want to come 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.690
 in the club 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.930
 they want to invest in France etc and we 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.300
 presents us with documents from 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.140
 bank documents evidence of 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.060
 background of a large international bank 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.040
 signed by the great directors we are 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.600
 shows the movements of funds and we 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.830
 we have no reason to be wary 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.660
 especially since most of the cuts 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.640
 agony protagonists live in France 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.380
 so quite you knew them 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.830
 personally I have never met 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.120
 gianni met when I was given some 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.800
 documents I did not encounter the vice 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.720
 president who with signed all these 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.550
 documents there but we have no reason 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.620
 because it was not one saw reason 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.630
 the reason for the scam we could not see 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.959
 not why it would be wrong 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.700
 to be crazy and in fact we understood we 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.120
 understood because we did not know that 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.760
 with the pervert laporte had poured a 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.100
 sum of 183 1000 euros 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.810
 couch this type of scam and qualified 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.370
 that I would not qualify here because it 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.050
 would be misinterpreted 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.519
 very very classic in you promise 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.280
 we expected in people who are 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.930
 in difficult situations 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.459
 you are promised a lot of money but he 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.360
 have to pay the fees then you pay 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.769
 the fees you never see the money 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.239
 so to some sort of going back 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.280
 history of taking your money passage 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.190
 here and what happened to Bernard 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.470
 the port is for us a bay in a 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.820
 catastrophic situation then max 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.019
 guazini still you have not seen anything 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.000
 come because this foundation for 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.890
 Canadian childhood is it 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.480
 was not specifically listed 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.130
 neither from the UN nor from 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.720
 of institutions yes there could have been the 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.150
 to legitimize the summer she created by the un 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.980
 but the question has always told us what 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.380
 that we checked that they had our 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.510
 activity they have in their status or the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.630
 turn to go to montreal every 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.760
 documents they have they have a craft 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.180
 of investor so there is actually 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.890
 a foundation where he puts profits and 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.810
 charitable institutions 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.210
 but in fact are pastors 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.420
 besides and but they are at fault there was 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.250
 money so rogue pastors 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.630
 obviously you are convinced of 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.370
 the scam you yourself planted 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.800
 staff actually served us these 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.480
 documents is actually we were 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.160
 by the way, go to the league 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.620
 national rugby Friday returning 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.500
 our bank tells us to like a doubt 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.630
 in the documents that emanates and 17 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.430
 big banks so this weekend we have 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.320
 have an express inquiry done by our 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.590
 relationships at the highest level and one 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.600
 was convened Monday at 14:30 at headquarters 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.950
 European have made big banks and 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.110
 to go all the directors came 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.850
 are distant crazy and we have 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.840
 wrote this very morning a letter to 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.030
 prosecutor of the republic 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.740
 and I said we'll see right away 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.900
 competent police services and we have 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.640
 filed a complaint and therefore asks for the risk 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.060
 for the French stadium today it's 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.160
 to be relegated to leave the top 14 for 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.750
 the equivalent if we were to put the 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.700
 things from the point of view of football it's 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.230
 as if the psg or om was leaving 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.660
 leaving the stage went to league 2 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.210
 yes sullen weather the risk especially 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.120
 for the French stadium and 80 people 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:31.290
 who work and that's what I think 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.560
 to the renters to the staff so the risk 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:38.040
 it is there nevertheless we will try to 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.330
 find solutions before Monday and 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.310
 appeal to all the good wills 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.110
 what solutions of the situation but 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.090
 farnolle round table we already have 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.830
 started for his thoughts though as soon 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.840
 Monday night our self was called everything 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.270
 the world we do not want we will spend our 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.740
 day to this and I will not spend Thursday 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.240
 today my day to respond to 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.520
 journalists doing interviews 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.660
 because it was very very good 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.230
 understand that journalists do 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.210
 their work 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.290
 the important thing for us is to find 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.580
 people who come into the club this is 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.380
 no answer to the questions you have 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.780
 already phone calls that were held 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.370
 the media phone the press tap 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.010
 friends until one o'clock 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.300
 no but in the buyers but that one 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.110
 has contacts and then you have to know 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.090
 it's open 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.100
 everyone can come there is no 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.450
 everyone can come everyone 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.730
 can come to save the French stadium 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.170
 the deadline is Monday and Monday 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.330

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.010
 dnacg and it will not be necessary to provide 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.770
 bank statements offer the sayings 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.120
