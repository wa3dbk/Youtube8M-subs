00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
call it it might be just what we need to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.210 
call it it might be just what we need to
crack<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.120> thing<00:03:07.290> there<00:03:08.290> must<00:03:08.410> be<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.650> way<00:03:08.920> for

crack this thing there must be a way for

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.890 
crack this thing there must be a way for
you<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.340> take<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.880> colloids<00:03:10.360> resistance

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
you to take on the colloids resistance

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.520 
you to take on the colloids resistance
so<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.800> can<00:03:12.040> enter<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.340> vault<00:03:12.720> captain<00:03:13.720> where

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
so you can enter the vault captain where

the lab captain Gillan and I have been
doing<00:05:04.409> our<00:05:04.620> own<00:05:04.650> research<00:05:04.770> but<00:05:05.460> we<00:05:05.520> haven't

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.029 
doing our own research but we haven't

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.119 
doing our own research but we haven't
discovered<00:05:06.419> much<00:05:06.719> let's<00:05:07.620> just<00:05:07.919> say<00:05:08.099> I

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
discovered much let's just say I

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.489 
discovered much let's just say I
wouldn't<00:05:08.610> want<00:05:08.759> to<00:05:08.789> live<00:05:08.999> there<00:05:09.259> have<00:05:10.259> a<00:05:10.289> look

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:10.499 
wouldn't want to live there have a look

at<00:05:10.650> this<00:05:10.830> captain<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:11.909> can't<00:05:12.779> make<00:05:12.990> head<00:05:13.289> or

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
at this captain I I can't make head or

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.550 
at this captain I I can't make head or
tail<00:05:13.439> of<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:14.029> hmm<00:05:15.029> this<00:05:15.689> confirms<00:05:16.259> our

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
tail of it hmm this confirms our

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.950 
tail of it hmm this confirms our
suspicions<00:05:17.129> the<00:05:18.029> collar<00:05:18.270> codes<00:05:18.539> were<00:05:18.719> being

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
suspicions the collar codes were being

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.050 
suspicions the collar codes were being
mutated<00:05:19.589> to<00:05:19.710> clean<00:05:19.919> up<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.159> waste<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.819> it

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
mutated to clean up the waste and it

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.820 
mutated to clean up the waste and it
looks<00:05:21.360> like<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.779> chemical<00:05:22.139> mutagen<00:05:22.680> they

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
looks like the chemical mutagen they

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.670 
looks like the chemical mutagen they
were<00:05:22.889> using<00:05:23.159> could<00:05:23.759> theoretically<00:05:24.180> work<00:05:24.719> well

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
were using could theoretically work well

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.219 
were using could theoretically work well
that's<00:05:25.889> it<00:05:26.129> that's<00:05:26.639> our<00:05:26.879> saluted<00:05:27.360> right<00:05:27.569> we

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
that's it that's our saluted right we

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.999 
that's it that's our saluted right we
just<00:05:28.469> replicate<00:05:29.039> this<00:05:29.189> chemical<00:05:29.580> mutagen<00:05:30.149> um

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
just replicate this chemical mutagen um

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.700 
just replicate this chemical mutagen um
sir<00:05:32.149> there's<00:05:33.149> a<00:05:33.240> problem<00:05:33.479> our<00:05:34.199> chief
