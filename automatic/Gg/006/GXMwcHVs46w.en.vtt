the start you're out in the open a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090 
the start you're out in the open a
little<00:00:44.940> bit<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.719> you're<00:00:46.170> exposed<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
little bit so you're exposed of it to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790 
little bit so you're exposed of it to
the<00:00:47.190> enemy<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.030> could<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.420> shot<00:00:48.450> down<00:00:48.800> I'd

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the enemy you could get shot down I'd

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.470 
the enemy you could get shot down I'd
give<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.100> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> root<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.030> attack<00:00:51.239> about

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
give this kind of root for attack about

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.799 
give this kind of root for attack about
fifty<00:00:51.899> percent<00:00:51.930> rate<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.010> success<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:54.570> got<00:00:54.719> my

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
fifty percent rate of success you got my

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
fifty percent rate of success you got my
squadmates<00:00:55.079> chase<00:00:55.590> charging<00:00:56.129> him<00:00:56.219> behind<00:00:56.520> me

squadmates chase charging him behind me

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520 
squadmates chase charging him behind me
but<00:00:56.910> once<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.420> past<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.840> initial<00:00:58.020> bit

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
but once you get past that initial bit

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.830 
but once you get past that initial bit
if<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.820> hear<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> really

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
if you can get to hear this is a really

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
if you can get to hear this is a really
good<00:01:00.960> basis<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> form<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.920> attack<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.250> this
