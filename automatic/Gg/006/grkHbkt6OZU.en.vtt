these<00:01:13.310> out<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.940> pulls<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.300> whole<00:01:14.510> fly<00:01:14.750> sheet

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
these out it pulls the whole fly sheet

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.690 
these out it pulls the whole fly sheet
against<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.380> frame<00:01:15.530> of<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.740> tent<00:01:16.040> ensuring

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
against the frame of the tent ensuring

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.100 
against the frame of the tent ensuring
that<00:01:16.760> this<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.030> going<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.240> be<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.420> very<00:01:17.600> very

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
that this is going to be a very very

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.290 
that this is going to be a very very
stable<00:01:18.470> structure<00:01:18.950> even<00:01:19.159> on<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:19.820> really<00:01:20.150> windy

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
stable structure even on a really windy

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.080 
stable structure even on a really windy
day<00:01:20.740> all<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.980> the<00:01:22.070> guidelines<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.580> we<00:01:22.880> have

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
day all of the guidelines that we have

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.940 
day all of the guidelines that we have
are<00:01:23.360> all<00:01:23.659> luminous<00:01:24.140> all<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.470> way<00:01:24.560> around<00:01:24.680> the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
are all luminous all the way around the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.290 
are all luminous all the way around the
tent<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:25.580> that's<00:01:25.760> going<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.970> stop<00:01:26.120> you<00:01:26.270> from

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
tent so that's going to stop you from

tent so that's going to stop you from
tripping<00:01:26.750> over<00:01:26.870> them<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:27.380> then<00:01:27.710> each<00:01:27.890> one<00:01:28.159> has

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
tripping over them and then each one has

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.920 
tripping over them and then each one has
its<00:01:28.430> own<00:01:28.670> retainer<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:29.480> that<00:01:29.600> when<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:29.750> comes

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
its own retainer so that when it comes

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.719 
its own retainer so that when it comes
to<00:01:30.110> packing<00:01:30.290> down<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.740> tent<00:01:30.979> we<00:01:31.340> can<00:01:31.460> simply

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
to packing down the tent we can simply

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.399 
to packing down the tent we can simply

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
the other pegan points around here

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.060 
the other pegan points around here
ensuring<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.200> get<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.470> right<00:01:54.590> peg<00:01:54.890> in

ensuring that you get the right peg in
the<00:01:55.280> right<00:01:55.430> place<00:01:56.110> you'll<00:01:57.110> also<00:01:57.260> just<00:01:57.500> see

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
the right place you'll also just see

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.109 
the right place you'll also just see
here<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.070> have<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.250> large<00:01:58.520> ventilation

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
here that we have a large ventilation

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.760 
here that we have a large ventilation
panel<00:01:59.420> on<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.630> side<00:01:59.840> there<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.320> another<00:02:00.619> one

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
panel on the side there is another one

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.350 
panel on the side there is another one
on<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.920> other<00:02:01.040> side<00:02:01.340> obviously<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:02.000> also<00:02:02.270> on

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
on the other side obviously and also on

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.120 
on the other side obviously and also on
the<00:02:02.479> back<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:02.990> just<00:02:03.140> allows<00:02:03.260> cool<00:02:03.650> fresh<00:02:03.920> air

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
the back this just allows cool fresh air

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.010 
the back this just allows cool fresh air
into<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.460> tent<00:02:04.700> when<00:02:05.420> it's<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.659> little<00:02:05.900> bit

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
into the tent when it's a little bit

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.899 
into the tent when it's a little bit
warmer<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:06.440> if<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.650> get<00:02:06.799> too<00:02:06.950> chilly<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.729> we

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
warmer but if you get too chilly and we

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.520 
warmer but if you get too chilly and we
can<00:02:08.060> just<00:02:08.090> simply<00:02:08.539> close<00:02:08.869> down<00:02:09.080> these<00:02:09.259> vents

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
can just simply close down these vents

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.239 
can just simply close down these vents
like<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.499> when<00:02:12.499> we<00:02:12.620> come<00:02:12.739> around<00:02:12.829> to<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.129> front

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:13.249 
like so when we come around to the front

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.009 
like so when we come around to the front
of<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.489> tent<00:02:13.730> you'll<00:02:13.939> see<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.599> even<00:02:14.749> those

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
of the tent you'll see that even those

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:15.870 
of the tent you'll see that even those
are<00:02:15.260> real

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
are real

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.460 
are real
the<00:02:15.970> compact<00:02:16.390> tent<00:02:16.720> we<00:02:16.870> still<00:02:17.050> have<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> real

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
the compact tent we still have a real

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.590 
the compact tent we still have a real
good<00:02:17.680> size<00:02:17.950> front<00:02:18.220> opening<00:02:18.520> here<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.270> can

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
good size front opening here so you can

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.810 
good size front opening here so you can
classify<00:02:19.840> as<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.440> walk-in<00:02:20.860> tent<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.640> door

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
classify as a walk-in tent and the door

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.100 
classify as a walk-in tent and the door
is<00:02:21.850> wide<00:02:22.060> enough<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:22.480> able<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.690> get<00:02:22.840> all<00:02:22.960> of

to the outside ventilation panels on the
temp<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:50.560> growing<00:02:50.770> treat<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.070> we<00:02:51.190> use<00:02:51.340> in

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
temp the growing treat that we use in

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.250 
temp the growing treat that we use in
here<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.910> double<00:02:52.270> quoted<00:02:52.450> polyethylene

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
here is a double quoted polyethylene

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.050 
here is a double quoted polyethylene
material<00:02:53.740> so<00:02:54.070> it's<00:02:54.220> really<00:02:54.400> tough<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.880> really

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
material so it's really tough and really

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.790 
material so it's really tough and really
durable<00:02:55.420> then<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.020> has<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.140> hydrostatic<00:02:56.530> head

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
durable then it has a hydrostatic head

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.830 
durable then it has a hydrostatic head
of<00:02:57.070> ten<00:02:57.250> thousand<00:02:57.610> millimeters<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.540> fully
