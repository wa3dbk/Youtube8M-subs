00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
guess although when you thinking about

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.190 
guess although when you thinking about
you<00:03:05.200> I've<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.410> wasted<00:03:05.739> 30<00:03:06.040> k<00:03:06.340> basically<00:03:06.790> um

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
you I've just wasted 30 k basically um

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.240 
you I've just wasted 30 k basically um
