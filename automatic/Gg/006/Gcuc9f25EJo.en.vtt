00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.259
 he stays with us close but afterwards to say goodbye we are going to meet 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.320
 She also asked me to speak very slowly very slowly so that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.550
 understand Spanish well although I think he speaks it very well lenhart state 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.770
 welcome 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.250
 for many thanks 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.400
 li na ll 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 as for purposes we were behind and how do you think 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.890
 with this agreement directly arrive until tomorrow 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.890
 and doing that kind of protocol has something of our bull culture 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.550
 It is true that you abengoa a culture completely outside of Spain in you 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.250
 the Latin culture 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.540
 but to and now to which she was and girls was six years old 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.090
 and to discover some book in you, I kind of have an idea 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.480
 and for me 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 it was a very important thing 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.280
 to 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.830
 opened my eyes 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.700
 when putting in images 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.200
 and she added 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.670
 in Spanish painter 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.840
 from there 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.530
 avilés celebrates was the whims 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.320
 i to make up 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560
 and already think in hindsight 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.640
 what is so beneficial 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.650
 something that Mr. Ramón de los Ríos said to us as a principle to the contrast so 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.979
 great that he was going to see 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.090
 in addition that we approached shock lineage 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.470
 for royalties 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.890
 I imagine it is a change of contrasts not only in the physical 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.200
 it may seem frivolous or superficial they pose in the physical but 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.190
 also at the time of contacting our culture title obtained no 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.369
 ping a problem 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.320
 connected with this way of being 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 in the photograph you want to approach the famous store 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.540
 for example here 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 that we are a hundred we have had a public not 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.589
 the public 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:10.549
 good 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.859
 and today I do not know 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.569
 neither more nor margin 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 percent speaks for me 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.950
 This is over 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.209
 and this attack the broadband 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 i the band the world 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.399
 Now no, it does not work because 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.409
 here 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.879
 the interesting in the wide arena are moments that are due to the square 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.900
 bulls when there is not anything interesting 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.280
 the boy is more relaxed than small 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.210
 with any detail pc able to take an artistic photo at any time 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.409
 let's go walking in Lima 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.189
 that the people of Seville are also exhibiting photos from home 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.839
 here for example how have you had the ability to capture every moment 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.029
 with your camera because in addition your work tool does not your camera 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:57.609
 Photos 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.340
 I took to understand the world by my eyes 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.109
 and I expressed myself with my camera 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.589
 with this 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.780
 that beat in addition never separates day by what I see always you have 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.289
 to catch any instant that they 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.019
 to 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.360
 i this one are handled in the wrong place the technician inhabit 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.419
 the law k 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.249
 iy is yonny a montilivi 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:24.620
 gmail and I told the camera how he wants it 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.450
 because what kind of cameras are the ones that make movies for this 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.319
 power 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.269
 and you have to beat him 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.670
 tnk-bp moez has some understood picture that this wind 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.370
 good technically second to the camera as the bae lim unlock 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.740
 bat is perfect 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.939
 that is the only perfection that there is 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.319
 in the world 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.799
 and is that the flame bayly 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.659
 it is not difficult and wait also here to work with a camera very 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.659
 big with very large cash called day 2 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.749
 and also believes that from the same perspective in which that institution 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:04.599
 or nothing they talking about san antón to the inadec of children in the whites in the 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.650
 a lot of plates that have been used we will go walking 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.919
 so that this exhibition is simultaneously 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.099
 the report I want to ask you a question 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.469
 there is once inside what I could study in photojournalism in the 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:17.579
 faculty 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.729
 eckert type of photos 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.430
 but I also did not study jch journalism but within what I 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.530
 I agreed with the photographic technique 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.319
 piqué is asked if we are not going to give him the feat 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.500
 you prefer the spontaneous photo 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.990
 hello ready 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.020
 understands 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.319
 yes am 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.620
 no matter 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.590
 to the one 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.919
 thing that matters 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.689
 nursing is the margin 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.090
 if the image nothing something 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.420
 mow margin 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.169
 the pattern that has power 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.610
 great part yes this bet 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.270
 coda spontaneous doctor 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.490
 and you think that afterwards the public perceives if it is prepared or is 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.480
 spontaneous 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.960
 the public does not notice it 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.789
 anl 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.860
 if it published avn 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.270
 he wants to consent against him 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.050
 a my images this is what counts that is what is important this is the first 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.780
 and therefore 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.420
 he said that the alliance does not have much of Andalusian although he was not born here in the 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.919
 park so he is applying me 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.190
 little matter less important the technique is not going to stop 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.639
 side 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.719
 the osasuna 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.120
 it matters and a lot 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.059
 but that the important thing is that it narrates and that transmits feeling not that it arrives 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.050
 alarm the spectators to give to the heart 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.050
 before doing these percent photographs so the bullring stood out 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.160
 you were there watching a bit what was 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.190
 criminally come to Spain 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.190
 who to seville and plates with the camera of its kind 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.860
 who says the accident was that I 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.240
 k burn the radiant 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.270
 my first and alter 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.150
 through photos 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
 here in Syria in the plaza maestranza 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.199
 he was my first boyfriend 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.229
 of pictures 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.360
 justly 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.719
 perote first roll of photos 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:05.550
 b 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.159
 in your life my life in syria 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:12.889
 what a wonder if for that for me to attract this expedition so day and 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.510
 bring the book that to the sentimental box 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.620
 that's why medina said when he started taking pictures this young man 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.740
 very young 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.159
 married tamén with a German film director 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:26.930
 I was 32 years old 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.330
 it is not simple and very young still has a life ahead 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.939
 if this woman let him see so many artists that we have with 40 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.500
 fifty sixty years 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.270
 they also still have a lot of work 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.979
 artistic for doing good we do not want to forget this picture we have here 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.160
 because there is also something that Mr. Ramón told us about the days 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.220
 and it is that unnim has supposed to demand any detail she does not look for 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.860
 the face of the famous 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.270
 west of what we have to do if what you are looking for 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.169
 the gesture detail for example here we are seeing children also that 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.969
 They are learning 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:07.879
 this is the requirement if the school in the 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.289
 How did you stay with the kids in the quarry young people who start 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.750
 with this world of the bull you liked 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.750
 as you learn is very young 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.589
 yes i like the park 

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:28.339
 abbot for it has learned only thing that matters is that it is to be someone 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:29.900
 i 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.139
 they will be lending 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:34.509
 very hard match 

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.729
 and this is always interesting 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:39.979
 in hostile chess happy congratulations have known you 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.430
 I have spoken the maquis pastito possible so that it is not understood zelaya speaks 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.909
 -Suitably Spanish nobody would say that pink 

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:50.229
 if it were not for the pale aspect so static and so blond that it has
