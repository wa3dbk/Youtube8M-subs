00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.590 
connections in this game are terrible
but<00:03:10.870> i<00:03:11.140> could<00:03:11.380> see<00:03:11.530> them<00:03:11.680> upgrading<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.250> or

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
but i could see them upgrading it or

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.940 
but i could see them upgrading it or
upgrading<00:03:13.600> upgrade<00:03:13.960> updating<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.560> think<00:03:14.860> I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
upgrading upgrade updating I think I

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.920 
upgrading upgrade updating I think I
don't<00:03:15.070> know<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.250> word<00:03:15.340> for<00:03:15.550> it<00:03:15.610> but<00:03:15.930> basically

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
don't know the word for it but basically

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.560 
don't know the word for it but basically
improving<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.340> lag<00:03:18.550> in<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.910> guarantee<00:03:19.450> and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
improving the lag in this guarantee and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.030 
improving the lag in this guarantee and
improvement<00:03:20.050> like<00:03:20.110> improving<00:03:20.890> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
improvement like improving the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.980 
improvement like improving the
connections<00:03:21.550> in<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.760> game<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.840> it's

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
connections in this game so that it's

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.990 
connections in this game so that it's
actually<00:03:23.350> somewhat<00:03:23.800> playable<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.760> right<00:03:24.880> so

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
actually somewhat playable all right so

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.670 
actually somewhat playable all right so
next<00:03:25.120> up<00:03:25.330> this<00:03:25.480> pollens<00:03:25.930> now<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.500> is

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
next up this pollens now this is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.620 
next up this pollens now this is
something<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.280> could<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.820> know<00:03:27.940> connect<00:03:28.540> to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
something that could you know connect to

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.840 
something that could you know connect to

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
map very quick so in the initial spawn

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.240 
map very quick so in the initial spawn
system<00:04:09.610> how<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.060> works<00:04:10.300> is<00:04:10.770> they'll<00:04:11.770> spawn<00:04:12.040> you

enjoy it it's hard but it is very

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.580 
enjoy it it's hard but it is very
enjoyable<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.720> think<00:04:46.930> these<00:04:47.169> three

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
enjoyable and I think these three

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.550 
enjoyable and I think these three
patches<00:04:47.860> are<00:04:48.310> crucial<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.509> game<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:49.960> don't

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
patches are crucial to the game I don't

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.869 
patches are crucial to the game I don't
know<00:04:50.620> some<00:04:50.830> people<00:04:51.069> may<00:04:51.190> disagree<00:04:51.340> with<00:04:51.759> me

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
know some people may disagree with me

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.730 
know some people may disagree with me
but<00:04:51.909> I<00:04:52.150> think<00:04:52.300> these<00:04:52.659> are<00:04:52.720> very<00:04:53.229> crucial

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
but I think these are very crucial

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.249 
but I think these are very crucial
points<00:04:54.150> that<00:04:55.150> need<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:55.389> be<00:04:55.419> fixed<00:04:55.659> and<00:04:55.930> they

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
points that need to be fixed and they

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.140 
points that need to be fixed and they
need<00:04:56.409> to<00:04:56.440> be<00:04:56.500> patched<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.099> I<00:04:57.520> think<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:57.940> game

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
need to be patched and I think the game

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.930 
need to be patched and I think the game
will<00:04:58.300> be<00:04:58.650> quite<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.680> bit<00:04:59.889> better<00:05:00.009> if<00:05:00.370> they<00:05:00.759> can

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
will be quite a bit better if they can

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.850 
will be quite a bit better if they can
fix<00:05:01.240> these<00:05:01.449> three<00:05:01.690> things<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:02.139> know<00:05:02.620> they're

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
fix these three things I know they're

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.379 
fix these three things I know they're
probably<00:05:03.069> already<00:05:03.370> looking<00:05:03.729> into<00:05:03.819> it<00:05:04.120> but<00:05:04.150> I

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
probably already looking into it but I

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.240 
probably already looking into it but I
thought<00:05:04.599> I'd<00:05:04.750> just<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:05.169> know<00:05:05.289> get<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.099> word

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
thought I'd just you know get the word

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.680 
thought I'd just you know get the word
out<00:05:06.400> there<00:05:06.460> that<00:05:06.759> these<00:05:06.909> three<00:05:07.180> things<00:05:07.210> are

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
out there that these three things are

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.029 
out there that these three things are
very<00:05:08.440> very<00:05:08.889> very<00:05:09.659> in<00:05:10.659> need<00:05:11.080> of<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.259> patch<00:05:11.470> so
