00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
windscreen on the stove as well because

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.850 
windscreen on the stove as well because
it<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.730> also<00:03:04.000> very<00:03:04.330> susceptible<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.319> wind

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
it is also very susceptible to wind

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.380 
it is also very susceptible to wind
however<00:03:06.430> we<00:03:06.640> don't<00:03:06.819> have<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.150> issue<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.780> here

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
however we don't have that issue in here

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.869 
however we don't have that issue in here
we're<00:03:10.390> going<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.660> place<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:11.280> place<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.670> lid
