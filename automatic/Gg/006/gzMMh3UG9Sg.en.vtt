00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
have the earth EXO terror incubator that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
have the earth EXO terror incubator that
we<00:00:28.500> bought<00:00:29.119> pretty<00:00:30.119> simple<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.510> it's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
we bought pretty simple to use now it's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.160 
we bought pretty simple to use now it's
pretty<00:00:33.750> quiet

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
pretty quiet

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.620 
pretty quiet
it's<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> mute<00:00:35.070> mode<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.640> well<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.480> all

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it's got like a mute mode as well it all

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.389 
it's got like a mute mode as well it all
plugs<00:00:36.930> into<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.380> back<00:00:37.579> it's<00:00:38.579> fantastic<00:00:40.399> also

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
plugs into the back it's fantastic also

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.760 
plugs into the back it's fantastic also
has<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> light<00:00:41.969> which<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.420> pretty<00:00:42.989> awesome<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
has a light which is pretty awesome I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.930 
has a light which is pretty awesome I
think<00:00:43.829> I'll<00:00:44.160> leave<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.730> minute

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
think I'll leave that on for a minute

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
think I'll leave that on for a minute
because<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.210> shows<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.600> quite<00:00:45.750> nicely<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.710> as

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
because it shows it quite nicely but as

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.410 
because it shows it quite nicely but as
you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.399> pretty<00:00:47.670> simple<00:00:47.789> oh<00:00:48.360> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you can see it's pretty simple oh you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.740 
you can see it's pretty simple oh you
can<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:48.960> Celsius<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.739> Fahrenheit

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
can have it in Celsius or Fahrenheit

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.790 
can have it in Celsius or Fahrenheit
obviously<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.020> want<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> increase<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
obviously if you want to increase the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.610 
obviously if you want to increase the
temperature<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.370> decrease<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.379> it's<00:00:55.379> just

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
temperature or decrease it it's just

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.760 
temperature or decrease it it's just
simple<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.930> pretty<00:00:58.170> easy<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.649> then

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
simple as so it's pretty easy and then

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.170 
simple as so it's pretty easy and then
you<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> leave<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you just leave it in to get up to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.160 
you just leave it in to get up to
temperature<00:01:01.430> yeah<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:03.899> sort<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
temperature yeah I think that's sort of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
temperature yeah I think that's sort of
the<00:01:04.439> current<00:01:04.650> temperature<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.580> but

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the current temperature that is out but

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.250 
the current temperature that is out but
it<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.090> working<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> about<00:01:06.720> 23

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it will be working up to about 23

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.070 
it will be working up to about 23
degrees<00:01:07.650> as<00:01:07.799> requested<00:01:08.570> on/off<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.600> buttons

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
degrees as requested on/off the buttons

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
degrees as requested on/off the buttons
right<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.439> looks<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> really<00:01:11.400> nice<00:01:11.729> unit

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
right it looks like a really nice unit

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.219 
right it looks like a really nice unit
and<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> also<00:01:12.720> use<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:14.360> traveling<00:01:15.360> so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and you can also use it for traveling so

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.289 
and you can also use it for traveling so
if<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.740> transporting<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.549> geckos<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
if you're transporting in geckos and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
if you're transporting in geckos and
stuff<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> option<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.369> because

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
stuff you have the option here because

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
stuff you have the option here because
it<00:01:20.790> also<00:01:20.909> comes<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> car<00:01:21.780> charger<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.650> well

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it also comes with a car charger as well

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.950 
it also comes with a car charger as well
which<00:01:23.040> plugs<00:01:23.490> straight<00:01:23.670> into<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.509> cigarette

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
which plugs straight into your cigarette

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.940 
which plugs straight into your cigarette
lighter<00:01:27.409> handle<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.619> opens<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:30.740> sure<00:01:31.740> neat

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
lighter handle here opens up sure neat

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.890 
lighter handle here opens up sure neat
that<00:01:32.100> only<00:01:32.340> puts<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> light<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.600> helps

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that only puts the light really helps

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.530 
that only puts the light really helps
yeah<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.829> that's<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> instructions<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
yeah so that's the instructions in it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.789 
yeah so that's the instructions in it
for<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> minute<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.140> basically<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
for the minute so it's basically like a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.749 
for the minute so it's basically like a
mini<00:01:38.070> fridge

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
mini fridge

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.880 
mini fridge
you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.180> use<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.630> cooling<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.259> heating<00:01:40.290> so

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you can use it for cooling or heating so

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.870 
you can use it for cooling or heating so
if<00:01:40.950> you've<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.220> animals<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:41.759> into

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
if you've got animals that go into

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.660 
if you've got animals that go into
hibernation<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.460> as

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
hibernation you can do it for that as

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.300 
hibernation you can do it for that as
well<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.090> couple<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.990> trays<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> few

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
well a couple of trays you do have a few

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.760 
well a couple of trays you do have a few
levels<00:01:47.780> three<00:01:48.780> levels<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> can

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
levels three levels here that you can

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
levels three levels here that you can
have<00:01:50.009> once<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.240> our<00:01:51.390> babies<00:01:51.780> we'll<00:01:52.049> we'll

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
have once we get our babies we'll we'll

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.600 
have once we get our babies we'll we'll
stick<00:01:52.560> them<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.979> also<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> would

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
stick them in and also here it would

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850 
stick them in and also here it would
have<00:01:53.700> water<00:01:53.850> trade<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.479> humidity<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:55.649> is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
have water trade for humidity which is

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.050 
have water trade for humidity which is
right<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> as<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.579> hear<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.909> pretty

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
right so as you can hear it's pretty

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.810 
right so as you can hear it's pretty
quiet<00:02:00.829> I'm<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.070> quite<00:02:02.280> impressed<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:02.640> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
quiet I'm really quite impressed with it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.719 
quiet I'm really quite impressed with it
so<00:02:03.030> once<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.530> babies<00:02:04.890> from<00:02:05.040> tally<00:02:05.399> who

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
so once we get the babies from tally who

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.419 
so once we get the babies from tally who
is<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.719> here<00:02:06.930> somewhere

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
is in here somewhere

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.710 
is in here somewhere
we'll<00:02:08.429> obviously<00:02:08.640> Stickley<00:02:09.179> straight<00:02:09.509> into

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
we'll obviously Stickley straight into

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.279 
we'll obviously Stickley straight into
here<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
here and

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.679 
here and
so<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.439> have<00:02:10.560> bit<00:02:10.769> optimum<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.269> obviously

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
so you have bit optimum and obviously

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.390 
so you have bit optimum and obviously
see<00:02:12.959> how<00:02:13.079> it<00:02:13.200> goes<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:13.950> loved<00:02:14.159> this

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
see how it goes and I just loved this

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.550 
see how it goes and I just loved this
little<00:02:14.609> light<00:02:14.909> thing<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.599> if<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.290> want<00:02:16.469> to

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
little light thing so if you want to

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.630 
little light thing so if you want to
check<00:02:16.829> if<00:02:17.609> you've<00:02:17.819> got<00:02:18.060> any<00:02:18.209> babies<00:02:18.629> worn<00:02:19.170> yet

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
check if you've got any babies worn yet

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.899 
check if you've got any babies worn yet
BAM<00:02:20.640> done<00:02:21.500> um<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.829> yeah<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.310> mean<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.790> great

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
BAM done um so yeah I mean this is great

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.729 
BAM done um so yeah I mean this is great
but<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.209> kit<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:24.719> do<00:02:24.780> sort<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.230> recommend<00:02:25.620> it

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
but a kit and I do sort of recommend it

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.899 
but a kit and I do sort of recommend it
we<00:02:25.799> could<00:02:25.950> obviously<00:02:26.129> give<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.640> try<00:02:26.790> and

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
we could obviously give this a try and

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.390 
we could obviously give this a try and
see<00:02:27.120> how<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.390> goes<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.069> there's<00:02:29.069> been<00:02:29.220> some

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
see how it goes so there's been some

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.399 
see how it goes so there's been some
really<00:02:29.519> good<00:02:29.700> reviews<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.359> it<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.900> quite

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
really good reviews on it it's a quite

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.030 
really good reviews on it it's a quite
compact<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:32.879> can<00:02:33.090> sort<00:02:33.329> of<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.980> who<00:02:34.980> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
compact so you can sort of see who it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.530 
compact so you can sort of see who it
was<00:02:35.189> me<00:02:35.400> falling<00:02:35.609> uh-huh

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
was me falling uh-huh

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.259 
was me falling uh-huh
but<00:02:36.780> yes<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.769> know<00:02:37.889> a<00:02:37.920> decent<00:02:38.310> size<00:02:38.849> it's

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
but yes it's you know a decent size it's

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.910 
but yes it's you know a decent size it's
gonna<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.719> what<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.049> need<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.709> we'll

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
gonna do what we need and then we'll

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.140 
gonna do what we need and then we'll
have<00:02:41.129> our<00:02:41.639> happy<00:02:41.939> little<00:02:42.239> geckos<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:44.790> I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
have our happy little geckos and then I

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.550 
have our happy little geckos and then I
just<00:02:45.359> need<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.599> tidy<00:02:45.810> up<00:02:45.959> here<00:02:46.049> because<00:02:46.409> it's<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
just need to tidy up here because it's a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.500 
just need to tidy up here because it's a
bit<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.889> dumping<00:02:47.370> ground<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.760> gecko<00:02:48.209> stuff

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
bit of a dumping ground for gecko stuff

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.390 
bit of a dumping ground for gecko stuff
so<00:02:48.959> then<00:02:49.169> we'll<00:02:49.439> we'll<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.950> babies<00:02:50.280> up

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
so then we'll we'll have the babies up

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.420 
so then we'll we'll have the babies up
there<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.879> it<00:02:50.970> kind<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.359> it<00:02:52.230> will<00:02:52.919> be<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> nice

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
there so it kind of it will be a nice

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.819 
there so it kind of it will be a nice
cycle<00:02:53.939> of<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:55.290> know<00:02:55.409> like<00:02:55.939> babies<00:02:57.500> adults<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
cycle of you know like babies adults and

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.949 
cycle of you know like babies adults and

skinks and little Sheldon's up here he

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.679 
skinks and little Sheldon's up here he
seems<00:03:04.439> to<00:03:04.709> be<00:03:04.829> having<00:03:05.819> one<00:03:05.939> of<00:03:05.970> these<00:03:06.209> modes<00:03:06.450> of
