when<00:02:56.459> we<00:02:56.610> look<00:02:56.790> back<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.239> what<00:02:57.959> we<00:02:58.110> know

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
when we look back with what we know

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.229 
when we look back with what we know
today<00:02:58.530> kind<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.130> hindsight<00:02:59.580> as<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.730> powerful

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
today kind of hindsight as a powerful

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.240 
today kind of hindsight as a powerful
thing<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.780> also<00:03:00.810> distorts<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.650> lot<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:02.070> look

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
thing but it also distorts a lot we look

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.130 
thing but it also distorts a lot we look
back<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.610> we<00:03:02.670> think<00:03:03.000> God<00:03:03.660> why<00:03:03.840> didn't<00:03:04.080> all

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
back and we think God why didn't all

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.690 
back and we think God why didn't all
these<00:03:04.350> people<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.800> something<00:03:05.220> different
