okay guys stay for a review I have the
extreme<00:00:03.689> production<00:00:04.440> DFC<00:00:05.509> linkages<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
extreme production DFC linkages for the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.259 
extreme production DFC linkages for the
extreme<00:00:08.010> head<00:00:08.250> which<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.820> on<00:00:08.940> my<00:00:09.059> blade

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
extreme head which I have on my blade

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.730 
extreme head which I have on my blade
130<00:00:09.750> X<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.820> what's<00:00:12.480> really<00:00:12.750> cool<00:00:13.139> about<00:00:13.200> these

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
130 X and what's really cool about these

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.980 
130 X and what's really cool about these
DFC<00:00:14.460> arms<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.480> work<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
DFC arms is that they work with the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.930 
DFC arms is that they work with the
existing<00:00:16.350> Xtreme<00:00:17.010> pad<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.400> there's<00:00:17.580> no<00:00:17.760> need

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
existing Xtreme pad so there's no need

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.720 
existing Xtreme pad so there's no need
to<00:00:18.000> buy<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.570> separate<00:00:18.990> hub<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:19.470> anything<00:00:19.949> all

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730

you need to do is unscrew this ball that
goes<00:00:24.210> into<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.510> bleaker<00:00:25.130> screw<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> DFC

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
goes into your bleaker screw in the DFC

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.189 
goes into your bleaker screw in the DFC

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
which is a separate piece of just slides

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
which is a separate piece of just slides
right<00:00:34.380> off<00:00:34.590> once<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.610> take<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> screw

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
right off once you take out the screw

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.400 
right off once you take out the screw
and<00:00:37.100> then<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.280> install<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.910> arms<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and then you install your arms and you

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.530 
and then you install your arms and you
might<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.680> thinking<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> DFC<00:00:42.059> head<00:00:42.300> isn't

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
might be thinking like a DFC head isn't

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.380 
might be thinking like a DFC head isn't
necessary<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> blade<00:00:43.620> 130<00:00:44.070> X<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:45.239> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
necessary on the blade 130 X but it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.100 
necessary on the blade 130 X but it
actually<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.590> will<00:00:46.800> help<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.930> as<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
actually is it will help because as you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.959 
actually is it will help because as you
can<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.620> plastic<00:00:50.219> arms<00:00:50.579> whether<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
can see these plastic arms whether you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.600 
can see these plastic arms whether you
have<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> extreme<00:00:51.719> head<00:00:52.129> whether<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.370> have

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
have the extreme head whether you have

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.639 
have the extreme head whether you have
the<00:00:53.969> stock<00:00:54.239> head<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.690> any<00:00:54.870> other<00:00:55.230> aftermarket

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the stock head or any other aftermarket

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.020 
the stock head or any other aftermarket
had<00:00:55.980> these<00:00:56.730> plastic<00:00:57.600> linkages<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.289> here

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
had these plastic linkages right here

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
had these plastic linkages right here
they're<00:01:00.030> flexible<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> lot<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.260> play

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
they're flexible they have a lot of play

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.320 
they're flexible they have a lot of play
in<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:04.070> as<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.909> Bend<00:01:06.210> they

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
in them so as you can see they Bend they

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
in them so as you can see they Bend they
have<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> lot<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> movement<00:01:07.380> even<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
have a lot of movement even when the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.460 
have a lot of movement even when the
head<00:01:08.189> isn't<00:01:08.369> moving<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.900> that's<00:01:10.170> really

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
head isn't moving and that's really

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.560 
head isn't moving and that's really
gonna<00:01:10.710> affect<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.310> flight<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> DFC

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
gonna affect your flight and the DFC

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.570 
gonna affect your flight and the DFC
arms<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.140> gonna<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.500> rid<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.100> play

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
arms are gonna get rid of all that play

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
arms are gonna get rid of all that play

the<00:02:00.509> Y<00:02:00.659> extreme<00:02:01.170> wants<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.740> install<00:02:02.340> them

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the Y extreme wants you to install them

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.010 
the Y extreme wants you to install them
at<00:02:02.880> least<00:02:03.030> from<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> pictures<00:02:03.630> I've<00:02:03.810> seen

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
at least from the pictures I've seen

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.840 
at least from the pictures I've seen
online<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> way<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.369> link<00:02:05.700> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
online and the way that this link is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.889 
online and the way that this link is
installed<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.590> their<00:02:07.860> swash<00:02:08.220> plate

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
installed is that on their swash plate

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.710 
installed is that on their swash plate
they<00:02:09.899> want<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.500> install<00:02:10.920> them<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.720> where

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
they want you to install them on where

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.760 
they want you to install them on where
you'd<00:02:12.989> install<00:02:13.290> this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you'd install this

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.010 
you'd install this
ah<00:02:13.800> Cuenca<00:02:14.310> charms<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.270> extreme<00:02:15.570> linkage

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
ah Cuenca charms not the extreme linkage

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.880 
ah Cuenca charms not the extreme linkage
arms<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.160> gave<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.360> arms<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:19.020> 90<00:02:19.530> degree

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
arms but I gave the arms a 90 degree

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.930 
arms but I gave the arms a 90 degree
twist<00:02:22.010> anything<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.100> see<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> installed<00:02:23.790> them

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
twist anything can see I installed them

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.090 
twist anything can see I installed them
on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.210> extreme<00:02:24.720> arm<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.770> geometry

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
on the extreme arm and the geometry

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.300 
on the extreme arm and the geometry
looks<00:02:26.640> okay<00:02:27.030> with<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.310> that's

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
looks okay with it like that and that's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.730 
looks okay with it like that and that's
also<00:02:29.760> how<00:02:29.910> they<00:02:30.120> install<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.930> line<00:02:31.170> DFC

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
also how they install on a line DFC

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.980 
also how they install on a line DFC
heads<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.850> I'm<00:02:33.090> gonna<00:02:33.210> give<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.600> go<00:02:33.780> like

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
heads so I'm gonna give it a go like

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.010 
heads so I'm gonna give it a go like
this<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.440> looks<00:02:34.650> perfectly<00:02:35.130> fine<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.610> me<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.060> I

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
this it looks perfectly fine to me and I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.750 
this it looks perfectly fine to me and I
don't<00:02:37.080> see<00:02:37.380> having<00:02:37.560> any<00:02:38.010> trouble<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.520> flight

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
don't see having any trouble in flight

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.340 
don't see having any trouble in flight
with<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:40.050> it's<00:02:40.170> just

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
with it like this so I think it's just

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.250 
with it like this so I think it's just
down<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.860> personal<00:02:41.100> preference<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.990> will

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
down to personal preference but I will

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.020 
down to personal preference but I will
say<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.650> extreme<00:02:44.190> they<00:02:44.490> do<00:02:44.550> show<00:02:44.880> them

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
say that extreme they do show them

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.850 
say that extreme they do show them
installed<00:02:45.420> on<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.690> other<00:02:45.840> arms<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.620> I'm

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
installed on the other arms but I'm

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.040 
installed on the other arms but I'm
gonna<00:02:46.980> go<00:02:47.190> ahead<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.430> try<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:48.030> way<00:02:48.240> so

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
gonna go ahead and try it this way so

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.660 
gonna go ahead and try it this way so
now<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.260> gonna<00:02:49.410> go<00:02:49.800> ahead<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.070> install<00:02:50.460> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
now I'm gonna go ahead and install the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.160 
now I'm gonna go ahead and install the
second<00:02:51.030> arm<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.510> I'll<00:02:51.750> be<00:02:51.870> right<00:02:52.050> back

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
second arm and I'll be right back

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.660 
second arm and I'll be right back
okay<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.230> here<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.740> are<00:02:55.770> with<00:02:56.070> both<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.550> them
