if<00:00:00.450> you<00:00:00.659> imagine<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.350> world<00:00:01.680> where<00:00:02.550> everything

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
if you imagine a world where everything

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.780 
if you imagine a world where everything
touched<00:00:03.600> by<00:00:03.780> an<00:00:03.929> artist<00:00:04.529> suddenly<00:00:05.310> disappears

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
touched by an artist suddenly disappears

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.390 
touched by an artist suddenly disappears
then<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.970> recognize<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:09.630> any<00:00:10.260> artist<00:00:10.830> makes

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
then you recognize that any artist makes

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.030 
then you recognize that any artist makes
a<00:00:11.580> difference<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.780> making<00:00:13.080> art<00:00:13.440> really<00:00:13.799> does

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
a difference so making art really does

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.160 
a difference so making art really does
make<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.370> difference<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.330> transforms<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
make a difference and it transforms the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.290 
make a difference and it transforms the
world<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.680> terms<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.130> making<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.730> more

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
world in terms of making it more

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.750 
world in terms of making it more
beautiful<00:00:18.600> more<00:00:19.289> comfortable<00:00:19.980> more<00:00:20.369> alive

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
beautiful more comfortable more alive

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.380 
beautiful more comfortable more alive
more<00:00:21.240> visually<00:00:21.900> pleasing<00:00:22.820> better<00:00:23.820> designed

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
more visually pleasing better designed

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:36.080 
more visually pleasing better designed
more<00:00:25.350> thoughtful<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:27.000> across<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.750> board

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.470 

I<00:00:36.950> think<00:00:37.950> initially<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> student<00:00:38.910> enters

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
I think initially when a student enters

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.130 
I think initially when a student enters
art<00:00:40.350> school<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:41.280> our<00:00:41.520> art<00:00:41.850> education<00:00:42.390> they're

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
art school for our art education they're

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
art school for our art education they're
looking<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.650> becoming<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.310> visual<00:00:44.700> artist<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
looking at becoming a visual artist and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
looking at becoming a visual artist and
that's<00:00:45.510> perfectly<00:00:46.200> reasonable<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.130> once<00:00:47.400> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that's perfectly reasonable but once you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.660 
that's perfectly reasonable but once you
find<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.809> visual<00:00:49.620> art<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.130> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.400> force

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
find that visual art is going to force

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.750 
find that visual art is going to force
you<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:50.910> engage<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.840> eye<00:00:51.900> your<00:00:52.710> mind<00:00:53.010> your

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you to engage your eye your mind your

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.619 
you to engage your eye your mind your
head<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.780> spirit<00:00:55.430> yourself<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:57.059> psyche

head your spirit yourself your psyche

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.200

then<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.379> recognize<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:58.980> an<00:00:59.760> art<00:01:00.030> school

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
then you recognize that an art school

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
then you recognize that an art school
education<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.290> allows<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.040> to<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.460> a
