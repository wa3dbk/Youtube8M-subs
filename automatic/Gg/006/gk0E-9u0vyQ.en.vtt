00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.930
 then if you have all the flowers this simple as clear a look 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.570
 - the mauro galvÃ£o 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.590

 on Monday 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.350

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.770

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.460
 was caught up in success 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.550
 so you can spend high 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.689
 and there the states 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:09.959
 A little kiss they think 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.999
 the new service 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.009
 if you already have the victim 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.519
 was in the sector 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.809

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.679

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.999
 You got it, it's not difficult. 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.979

 pmdb took this date 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.379
 both the embrace of the drinks 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.889
 but you can also explain 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.979
 something even plastic that you have 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.309
 nothing happens by chance if this scenario has changed the sentence 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.389
 you can call in the art 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.299
 even if it's not true 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.529
 this ex-poor 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.529
 we took the opportunity to wish sergeant 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.760
 I'll get 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.099

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.279
 the last time they were injured mouse 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.810
 and I broke 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.810
 if you catch another 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:12.609
 I will put 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 then but it's not like that but now I'm going to put my name 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:18.829
 deputy leader 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.579
 I like to teach things that we have at home. 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.579
 because if it was something I know the time the replacements 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.949
 It's no fun getting started. 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.859
 I think I have here. 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.069
 the nasa 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.130
 david fell in the city 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.649
 the sentencing council 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:36.689
 the sides 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.069
 I know how it is 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.349
 in which you can start hours 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.349
 the same is 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.329
 Experient 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.669
 and you talk here 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.119
 Let's open a Christmas box too. 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.119
 the first idea that worked 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.079
 understand what this is 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:00.999
 I'll take 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.669
 the cooperative had 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.669
 epah placed in the sea 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.139
 I have here is so too allow no one and if someone I would have 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.939
 discarded 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.939
 sells were crowded 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.819
 but if you can put the box 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.199
 if you negative connotation 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.210
 What to do is not 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.999
 this is updating the sea and so 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.999
 you can put all 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.479
 pmdb is interested 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.419
 this is a creep here 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.159
 for me we have said 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:48.699
 your program on sbt 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.529
 unloaded the victims 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:51.460
 so you 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.250
 thor mid-point if you have a rosineide stapler or if the mark here 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.409
 I want to do none of this 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:00.849
 I'm just going to touch 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:01.729
 the tournament 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.789
 iara brook will have 130 kilometers other 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.569
 if it can be lost 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:08.750
 I'll be able to win 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.430
 I do not even want to face the team. 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.919
 Look, I just put it here, too. 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.919
 on the salary be supported on saints 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.479

 there will be other countries in the west 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.339
 and put 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.349
 it is a pity 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.580
 how the palm trees arrive 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.580
 Do you have identity? 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:35.479
 directed to housing
