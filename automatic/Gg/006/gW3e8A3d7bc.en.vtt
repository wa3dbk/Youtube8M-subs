Terre Haute was built on agriculture but
the<00:02:20.750> agriculture<00:02:21.530> really<00:02:21.740> started<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:23.000> supply

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
the agriculture really started to supply

the agriculture really started to supply
Fort<00:02:23.660> Harrison<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:25.100> early<00:02:25.459> farming<00:02:25.940> was<00:02:26.090> done

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330

the<00:02:42.560> early<00:02:42.770> 1800s<00:02:43.250> these<00:02:43.640> were<00:02:43.760> basically

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
the early 1800s these were basically

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.080 
the early 1800s these were basically
barges<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.260> didn't<00:02:45.560> have<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> motor<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.400> they

barges that didn't have a motor and they

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.460 
barges that didn't have a motor and they
would<00:02:47.209> launch<00:02:47.390> them<00:02:47.690> here<00:02:47.870> when<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.200> spring

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
would launch them here when the spring

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.680 
would launch them here when the spring
waters<00:02:49.250> were<00:02:49.430> higher<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:50.300> would<00:02:50.480> actually

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
waters were higher it would actually

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.390 
waters were higher it would actually
take<00:02:51.050> their<00:02:51.260> products<00:02:51.709> down<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.130> Ohio

when<00:03:02.300> steamboat<00:03:02.690> traffic<00:03:03.110> was<00:03:03.230> huge<00:03:03.470> up<00:03:03.680> here

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
when steamboat traffic was huge up here

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.510 
when steamboat traffic was huge up here
so<00:03:05.180> as<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.599> river<00:03:05.840> was<00:03:06.220> identified<00:03:07.220> as<00:03:07.490> a

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
so as the river was identified as a

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.030 
so as the river was identified as a
route<00:03:07.849> of<00:03:08.060> commerce<00:03:08.569> everybody<00:03:09.500> just<00:03:09.739> started

the years the river became polluted

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.920 
the years the river became polluted
because<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.790> industry<00:03:20.299> there<00:03:20.629> were<00:03:20.720> no

enjoying<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.139> river<00:04:30.320> because<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.860> is<00:04:30.950> a

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
enjoying the river because it is a

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.900 
enjoying the river because it is a
cleaner<00:04:31.310> place<00:04:32.830> so<00:04:33.830> as<00:04:34.130> we<00:04:34.280> float<00:04:34.550> down<00:04:34.760> the

wild ash River today one of the things I

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.100 
wild ash River today one of the things I
think<00:04:36.740> about<00:04:37.039> is<00:04:37.700> how<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.479> probably<00:04:38.870> the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
think about is how this is probably the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.469 
think about is how this is probably the
state's<00:04:39.380> most<00:04:39.620> important<00:04:40.130> asset<00:04:40.520> without<00:04:41.180> the

Wabash River Indiana probably wouldn't

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.000 
Wabash River Indiana probably wouldn't
