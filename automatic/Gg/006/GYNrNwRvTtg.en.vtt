00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
for me a ball is kind of like something

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.930 
for me a ball is kind of like something
I<00:00:03.659> can<00:00:04.009> put<00:00:05.009> my<00:00:05.700> feelings<00:00:06.089> into<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.839> can<00:00:07.940> skate

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
I can put my feelings into I can skate

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.720 
I can put my feelings into I can skate
the<00:00:09.210> way<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.420> really<00:00:09.990> want<00:00:10.230> with<00:00:10.590> nothing<00:00:11.550> else

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
the way I really want with nothing else

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.220 
the way I really want with nothing else
trying<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.389> hold<00:00:12.599> me<00:00:12.719> back

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
trying to hold me back

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.670 
trying to hold me back
it<00:00:13.679> just<00:00:14.269> permits<00:00:15.269> me<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.660> do<00:00:15.839> whatever<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.350> want

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680

it just permits me to do whatever I want
and<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.310> think<00:00:17.810> it's<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> only<00:00:19.880> places

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
and I think it's one of the only places

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.990 
and I think it's one of the only places
in<00:00:22.220> skateboarding<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.640> actually

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.000 

I'm<00:04:04.129> stoked<00:04:04.750> I'm<00:04:05.750> super<00:04:06.080> stoked<00:04:06.290> got<00:04:06.530> second

good<00:04:07.670> ask<00:04:07.879> for<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.090> better<00:04:08.239> event<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:08.840> he's<00:04:09.019> rad

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
good ask for a better event and he's rad

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.589 
good ask for a better event and he's rad
for<00:04:09.860> sure<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.129> file<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.549> gonna<00:04:10.790> be<00:04:11.000> when<00:04:11.450> I'm

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
for sure the file is gonna be when I'm

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.399 
for sure the file is gonna be when I'm
gonna<00:04:11.720> be<00:04:12.340> doing<00:04:13.690> probably<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.989> tricks<00:04:15.319> that

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
gonna be doing probably the tricks that

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.060 
gonna be doing probably the tricks that
are<00:04:15.890> hardest<00:04:16.609> for<00:04:16.880> me<00:04:16.910> so<00:04:17.419> I<00:04:17.870> think<00:04:18.829> that's

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
are hardest for me so I think that's

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.960 
are hardest for me so I think that's
what's<00:04:19.250> gonna<00:04:19.370> happen

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
what's gonna happen

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:29.190 
what's gonna happen

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
I don't care about winning really like I

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.050 
I don't care about winning really like I
really<00:04:32.470> never<00:04:32.860> felt<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.580> contest

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
really never felt that in the contest

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.750 
really never felt that in the contest
like<00:04:34.510> before<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.110> was<00:04:35.410> skating<00:04:35.800> with<00:04:35.890> my<00:04:35.920> three

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
looks like an energy out of the normal

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.030 
looks like an energy out of the normal
contest<00:04:46.150> space<00:04:46.420> it<00:04:46.660> was<00:04:46.780> just<00:04:47.020> something<00:04:47.200> like

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
contest space it was just something like

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.120

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
bowl or some like that it's more

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.530
