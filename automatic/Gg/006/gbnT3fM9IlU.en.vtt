00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
something like thirty inclusive and I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
something like thirty inclusive and I
think<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.189> edge<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:30.090> which<00:01:30.270> actually

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
think this back edge here which actually

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.420 
think this back edge here which actually
is<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.079> appears<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> bevel<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.250> was

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
is what appears like the bevel which was

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
is what appears like the bevel which was
done<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:33.150> looks<00:01:33.420> uneven<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:34.110> that's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
done it looks uneven here that's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.920 
done it looks uneven here that's
unevenness<00:01:34.890> from<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.430> grind<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> Meyer

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
unevenness from this grind that is Meyer

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.620 
unevenness from this grind that is Meyer
it<00:01:39.930> um<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.189> back<00:01:41.430> bevel<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.880> under<00:01:42.299> 10

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it um this back bevel is under 10

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.280 
it um this back bevel is under 10
degrees<00:01:42.990> inclusive<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.369> apex<00:01:45.000> 30<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:46.110> what

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
degrees inclusive so apex 30 but what

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.020 
degrees inclusive so apex 30 but what
look<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> micro<00:01:47.640> bevel<00:01:47.790> which

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
look but it's just a micro bevel which

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
look but it's just a micro bevel which
what's<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.170> less<00:01:49.530> than<00:01:49.560> ten

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
inclusive and I just thought we would do

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.120

see<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.420> apex<00:02:25.840> bevel<00:02:26.260> has<00:02:26.800> been<00:02:27.600> taken<00:02:28.600> up

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
see the the apex bevel has been taken up

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.410 
see the the apex bevel has been taken up
to<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> steeper<00:02:29.290> angle<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.180> cuts

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
to a steeper angle so that it cuts

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.410

better<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.310> again<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:33.490> not<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.760> chopper

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420

better and again it's not a chopper
geometry<00:02:35.110> here<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:38.140> high-quality

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720

period of time and otherwise is is

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.450 
period of time and otherwise is is
exactly<00:02:52.900> what<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:53.440> would<00:02:53.530> expect<00:02:53.950> from<00:02:54.220> a

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
exactly what you would expect from a

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.790 
exactly what you would expect from a
chopstick<00:02:54.940> which<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.240> that<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.110> piece<00:02:56.770> of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
chopstick which is that it's a piece of

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.970 
chopstick which is that it's a piece of
wood<00:02:57.480> glorified<00:02:58.480> slightly<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.440> turned<00:02:59.770> into

wood glorified slightly and turned into

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.230 
wood glorified slightly and turned into
something<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.550> pencil<00:03:00.790> without<00:03:01.030> of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
something like a pencil without of

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.680 
something like a pencil without of
leadcore<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:02.170> let's<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.370> how<00:03:04.210> this<00:03:04.450> low

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
leadcore so let's see how this low

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.250 
leadcore so let's see how this low
toughness<00:03:04.990> knife<00:03:05.410> will<00:03:05.710> fare<00:03:06.040> against<00:03:06.970> a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
toughness knife will fare against a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.800 
toughness knife will fare against a
chopstick<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.470> this<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.490> pine<00:03:10.120> board<00:03:10.510> which

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
chopstick and this is a pine board which

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.920 
chopstick and this is a pine board which
has<00:03:10.840> some<00:03:11.500> lead<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.610> fuck<00:03:13.180> knows<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:13.780> else

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
has some lead and fuck knows what else

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.630 
has some lead and fuck knows what else
in<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.850> use<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.450> keep<00:03:16.900> me<00:03:17.080> from

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
in it just to use to keep me from

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.460 
in it just to use to keep me from
banging<00:03:18.640> into<00:03:18.910> my<00:03:19.360> workbench<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.110> or<00:03:20.260> hitting

banging into my workbench and or hitting

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.320 
banging into my workbench and or hitting
a<00:03:20.650> screw<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.190> my<00:03:21.220> workbench<00:03:21.670> which<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.060> suspect

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
a screw in my workbench which I suspect

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.850 
a screw in my workbench which I suspect
that<00:03:22.540> might<00:03:22.840> be<00:03:22.989> able<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.290> do<00:03:23.380> some<00:03:23.530> apex

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
that might be able to do some apex

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.680 
that might be able to do some apex
damage<00:03:24.130> okay<00:03:24.430> quick<00:03:24.700> quick<00:03:25.150> overview<00:03:25.570> the

damage okay quick quick overview the
apex<00:03:26.080> you<00:03:26.170> can<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.650> all<00:03:27.130> clean<00:03:27.520> all<00:03:27.730> clear

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
apex you can see all clean all clear

this this is not a challenge we'll do it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.330 
this this is not a challenge we'll do it

look at that

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.640 
look at that
still<00:03:51.150> nothing<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.630> will<00:03:52.780> run<00:03:52.989> this<00:03:53.200> I'm<00:03:53.500> not

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
still nothing we will run this I'm not

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.460 
still nothing we will run this I'm not
sure<00:03:53.739> how<00:03:53.950> close<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.310> camera<00:03:54.670> will<00:03:54.850> focus<00:03:55.470> but

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
sure how close the camera will focus but

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.620 
sure how close the camera will focus but
again<00:03:56.650> we<00:03:56.800> can<00:03:56.950> see<00:03:57.130> low<00:03:57.400> toughness<00:03:57.790> steel<00:03:58.000> no

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
again we can see low toughness steel no

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.500 
again we can see low toughness steel no

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
through the chopstick you can see where

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.880 
through the chopstick you can see where
some<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.630> oil<00:04:22.630> on<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.200> used<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.500> protect

some of the oil on it I used to protect
it<00:04:24.070> came<00:04:24.550> off<00:04:24.760> no<00:04:25.479> damage

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
for right about here don't know why I'm

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.020 
for right about here don't know why I'm
now<00:04:56.410> failing<00:04:57.010> it<00:04:57.100> going<00:04:57.400> through<00:04:57.550> this<00:04:57.760> but

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
now failing it going through this but

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.450 
now failing it going through this but
okay<00:04:58.620> here<00:04:59.620> nope<00:05:00.460> no<00:05:00.880> damage<00:05:01.240> still<00:05:01.510> let's

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
okay here nope no damage still let's

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.860 
okay here nope no damage still let's
turn<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.610> chopstick<00:05:04.060> this<00:05:04.270> way<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.660> let<00:05:04.780> me

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
turn the chopstick this way and let me

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.870 
turn the chopstick this way and let me
hit<00:05:05.050> harder<00:05:05.440> make<00:05:05.620> sure<00:05:05.830> I'm<00:05:05.980> not<00:05:06.010> limp

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
hit harder make sure I'm not limp

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.310 
hit harder make sure I'm not limp
resting<00:05:07.300> this<00:05:08.850> okay<00:05:09.850> if<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:10.600> saw<00:05:10.840> that<00:05:10.870> I

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
resting this okay if you saw that I

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.290 
resting this okay if you saw that I
didn't<00:05:11.740> have<00:05:11.860> my<00:05:11.890> wrist<00:05:12.280> straight<00:05:12.850> enough<00:05:13.090> I

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
didn't have my wrist straight enough I

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.240 
didn't have my wrist straight enough I
twisted<00:05:13.960> slightly<00:05:14.380> on<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.560> downward<00:05:14.950> stroke

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
twisted slightly on the downward stroke

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.920 
twisted slightly on the downward stroke
so<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.520> probably<00:05:15.880> put<00:05:16.180> some<00:05:16.330> force<00:05:16.570> on<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:16.840> edge

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
so I probably put some force on the edge

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.860 
so I probably put some force on the edge
let's<00:05:17.500> see<00:05:17.680> what<00:05:17.800> we<00:05:17.890> got<00:05:18.390> huh<00:05:19.390> what<00:05:19.750> do<00:05:19.810> you

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
let's see what we got huh what do you

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.500 
let's see what we got huh what do you
know<00:05:19.930> still<00:05:20.740> no<00:05:21.669> damage<00:05:21.880> so<00:05:22.770> this<00:05:23.770> is<00:05:24.220> a<00:05:24.510> fringe

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
know still no damage so this is a fringe

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.720 
know still no damage so this is a fringe
low<00:05:26.050> toughness<00:05:26.320> knife<00:05:26.740> I<00:05:26.950> can<00:05:27.010> literally<00:05:27.400> take

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
low toughness knife I can literally take

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.490 
low toughness knife I can literally take
the<00:05:27.910> edge<00:05:28.030> and<00:05:28.300> put<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:28.900> against<00:05:29.230> a<00:05:29.320> hard

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
the edge and put it against a hard

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.430 
the edge and put it against a hard
surface<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.190> apply<00:05:31.120> pressure<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.960> rotate

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
surface and apply pressure and rotate

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.620 
surface and apply pressure and rotate
like<00:05:32.620> this<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:32.950> pop<00:05:33.310> chips<00:05:33.640> out<00:05:33.880> okay<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:34.479> is

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
like this and pop chips out okay it is

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.740 
like this and pop chips out okay it is
as<00:05:34.870> low<00:05:35.680> toughness<00:05:36.250> as<00:05:36.430> you<00:05:37.060> can<00:05:37.240> essentially

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
as low toughness as you can essentially

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.500 
as low toughness as you can essentially
get<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.290> still<00:05:38.560> have<00:05:38.740> anything<00:05:39.100> even<00:05:39.460> vaguely

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
get and still have anything even vaguely

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.680 
get and still have anything even vaguely
usable<00:05:40.510> in<00:05:40.690> terms<00:05:41.290> of<00:05:41.470> cutlery<00:05:41.860> and<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:43.360> would

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
usable in terms of cutlery and I would

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.780 
usable in terms of cutlery and I would
go<00:05:43.840> so<00:05:44.020> far<00:05:44.050> as<00:05:44.320> to<00:05:44.350> say<00:05:44.590> I<00:05:44.770> would<00:05:45.070> be<00:05:45.100> surprised

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
go so far as to say I would be surprised

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.250 
go so far as to say I would be surprised
if<00:05:47.340> if<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.940> were<00:05:49.090> able<00:05:49.510> to<00:05:49.540> damage<00:05:49.840> this

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
if if you were able to damage this

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.710 
if if you were able to damage this
chopping<00:05:50.890> something<00:05:51.550> like<00:05:51.729> a<00:05:51.910> chopstick<00:05:52.570> or

anything<00:05:52.960> else<00:05:53.169> like<00:05:53.290> that<00:05:54.120> these<00:05:55.120> it's<00:05:55.479> just

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
anything else like that these it's just

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.810 
anything else like that these it's just
not<00:05:56.110> something<00:05:56.620> a<00:05:56.680> decent<00:05:57.100> knife<00:05:57.280> will<00:05:57.580> do

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
not something a decent knife will do

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.680 
not something a decent knife will do
