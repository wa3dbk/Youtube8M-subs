00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
this figure next to your next next your

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.609 
this figure next to your next next your
puppies<00:01:40.490> six<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.759> seven<00:01:42.119> inch<00:01:42.299> scale<00:01:42.869> Marvel

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
puppies six or seven inch scale Marvel

puppies six or seven inch scale Marvel
legend<00:01:43.920> figure<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:45.090> yes<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.540> figure<00:01:45.960> will

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
legend figure with yes this figure will

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.310 
legend figure with yes this figure will
be<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.439> accurate<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.780> look<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.930> how<00:01:49.049> massive

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
be very accurate and look at how massive

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.910 
be very accurate and look at how massive
it<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.229> side<00:01:52.439> comparison

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
it is so it's just for side comparison

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.289 
it is so it's just for side comparison
here<00:01:55.920> he<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.899> sixteen<00:01:57.899> war<00:01:58.649> machine

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
here he is with the sixteen war machine

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.679 
here he is with the sixteen war machine
so<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.630> imagine<00:02:00.930> Bruce<00:02:01.890> Banner<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.360> six

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
so you can imagine Bruce Banner as a six

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.410 
so you can imagine Bruce Banner as a six
inch<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:05.250> he<00:02:05.369> gets<00:02:05.640> angry<00:02:05.880> he<00:02:06.149> turned

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
inch and when he gets angry he turned

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.479 
inch and when he gets angry he turned
into<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.259> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> make<00:02:07.680> sense<00:02:07.979> his

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
into this so it's kind of make sense his

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.020 
into this so it's kind of make sense his
is<00:02:09.239> very<00:02:09.300> accurate

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.430 

let's<00:02:12.480> see<00:02:12.630> what<00:02:12.810> he<00:02:12.870> looks<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:14.210> next<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.390> a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
let's see what he looks like next to a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.520 
let's see what he looks like next to a
7-inch<00:02:16.440> figure<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.380> got<00:02:19.560> not<00:02:19.860> bad<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:22.140> 6

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
7-inch figure so it's got not bad so 6

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.900 
7-inch figure so it's got not bad so 6
or<00:02:22.830> 7<00:02:23.430> inch<00:02:23.610> figure<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.390> would<00:02:24.660> be<00:02:25.550> this<00:02:26.550> figure

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
or 7 inch figure it would be this figure

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.100 
or 7 inch figure it would be this figure
would<00:02:27.090> blend<00:02:27.390> right<00:02:27.630> in

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
would blend right in

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.850 
would blend right in
or<00:02:28.500> should<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.920> say<00:02:29.100> fit<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.990> even<00:02:30.990> though<00:02:31.260> he<00:02:31.470> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
or should I say fit in even though he is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.500 
or should I say fit in even though he is
probably<00:02:32.730> well<00:02:33.360> he<00:02:33.510> probably<00:02:33.690> stands<00:02:34.170> out

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
probably well he probably stands out

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.560 
probably well he probably stands out
with<00:02:36.510> all<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.810> them<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.060> video<00:02:39.390> is

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
with all of them but this video is

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.520 
with all of them but this video is
mainly<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:40.170> side<00:02:40.500> comparison<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:42.350> it's<00:02:43.350> just

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
mainly for side comparison and it's just

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.050 
mainly for side comparison and it's just
a<00:02:43.620> quick<00:02:43.860> review

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
a quick review

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.430 
a quick review
so<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:47.070> articulation<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.630> good<00:02:48.900> as

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
so the articulation is not so good as

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.480 
so the articulation is not so good as
with<00:02:50.010> all<00:02:50.250> Marvel<00:02:50.790> Select<00:02:50.910> figure<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.860> had

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
with all Marvel Select figure and I had

though this figure has many points of

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.410 
though this figure has many points of
articulation<00:03:31.740> but<00:03:32.720> they<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.990> be<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:35.370> pain<00:03:36.180> in

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
articulation but they can be a pain in

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.630 
articulation but they can be a pain in
the<00:03:36.450> backside<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:37.440> move<00:03:37.650> around<00:03:37.740> because<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
the backside to move around because the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.370 
the backside to move around because the
figure<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.030> very<00:03:39.120> massive<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:42.080> some<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.230> them

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
figure is very massive and some of them

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.310 
figure is very massive and some of them
some<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.459> joints<00:03:44.910> are<00:03:45.060> loose<00:03:45.300> but<00:03:45.930> some<00:03:46.200> of

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
some of the joints are loose but some of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.199 
some of the joints are loose but some of
them<00:03:46.470> are<00:03:46.590> really<00:03:46.770> tight<00:03:47.160> for<00:03:47.610> example<00:03:48.090> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
them are really tight for example the

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.780 
them are really tight for example the
shoulder<00:03:48.780> joint<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:49.800> kind<00:03:50.459> of<00:03:50.520> have<00:03:50.670> to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
shoulder joint so you kind of have to

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.130 
shoulder joint so you kind of have to
use<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:51.030> lot<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.480> force<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:54.300> even<00:03:54.690> get<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.020> to

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
use a lot of force to even get it to

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.520 
use a lot of force to even get it to
budge<00:03:57.530> but<00:03:58.530> anyway<00:03:59.209> so<00:04:00.209> that's<00:04:00.450> all<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.930> have

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
budge but anyway so that's all you have

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.890 
budge but anyway so that's all you have

the<00:04:52.949> $20<00:04:53.850> range<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:55.050> we<00:04:55.740> expect<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.310> pay<00:04:57.470> around

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
the $20 range so we expect to pay around

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.390 
the $20 range so we expect to pay around
that<00:04:59.010> amount<00:04:59.419> but<00:05:00.419> I'm<00:05:01.050> not<00:05:01.260> sure<00:05:01.650> how<00:05:02.190> much
