00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.089
 return your fingers to a new video 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.620
 well it seems that we throw the house 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:08.500
 the window and also fall back 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.390
 during this early morning xbox live us 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.940
 derive from it on screen to me I have 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.770
 to say that he has connected me but hey 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.420
 coming up with enough reports from people 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.270
 that is not working in various 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.680
 countries and so on so let's go 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.110
 to the super mega graphics of a detector 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.100
 which is quite useful is the truth of 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.800
 sounding makes you see 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.449
 next and tell us how many 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.600
 how many reports that he is not 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.660
 working since there are already hours in 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.790
 this page the truth is that it is quite 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.300
 useful we see that the highest peak of 7,450 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.980
 between 4 and 7 in the afternoon 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 basically then it seems to be here stopped 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.790
 a little bit and then have at dawn to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.790
 from 3 because they have already returned to 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.610
 start all this again basically 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.160
 the highest percentage there is of these 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.310
 errors is to be achieved 56% then 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.430
 play online 33% and get into the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.040
 bazaar in the store 10% are those that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.530
 they are so spread out by stopping 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.850
 problems and others and reported now 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.720
 same as I say then in several countries 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.550
 is falling to you in some 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.680
 some will probably not work to 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.210
 others if a great hand to a great 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.670
 part and xico will work because then if 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.920
 we compare with the psn graph we see 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.100
 that the peaks are pretty more more 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.040
 great the truth 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.720
 good fucking as always in the truth 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.700
 there are many people that still good 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.290
 we still do not know the apparent cause of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.660
 all this can not be attacks of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.450
 two computer attacks attacks 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.280
 hackers what you want then also you 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 rumored that it was because of the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.450
 interview movie 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.630
 basically it's a comedy not in the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 they try to manage what they kill 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.130
 the type to be 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.760
 to say it as basically call it at 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.700
 supreme leader of North Korea and 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.840
 It seems that North Korea launched 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.910
 attacks and others to sony entertainment 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.490
 sony pictures that says and good 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.500
 basically the feve and blamed the chorea 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.120
 north then they said no what if 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.270
 then you do not want it then I do not know how many 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.940
 then also what will be attacks 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.340
 or something like that good guys who 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.900
 They also hacked and said they are going to 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.990
 have bombings and all this the cinemas 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.650
 good moves pretty pretty from 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.790
 flipado not the typical ones of Korea 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.010
 new north inside a missile and it kills me 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.840
 we have imagined and who has uploaded the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.780
 video do not hesitate good kids do not know no 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.050
 I think that's true the truth premiered in 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.880
 xbox live also in cinemas and others but 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.310
 good has also been released on youtube 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.130
 and all this and well I do not think it's 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.240
 going absolutely nothing with that yes already 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.320
 I do not think North Korea live xbox 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.790
 sn truth is possible that some little 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.560
 they are doing their best but I do not know 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.810
 they have more important things in which 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.810
 focus I do not know I imagine 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.069
 so, well, nothing more, guys, let's go like this 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.010
 is changing things I think that 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.709
 tomorrow goes to the member booth that 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.569
 tomorrow will work all right not for 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.940
 at least those but let's go I'll stay 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.560
 Then if it's still so good 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.690
 See you tomorrow probably me 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.110
 I will throw to the super bed 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.300
 and I think tomorrow morning 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.830
 all this will work so good nothing 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.060
 more guys this has been all in talk 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.060
 in the next video until next
