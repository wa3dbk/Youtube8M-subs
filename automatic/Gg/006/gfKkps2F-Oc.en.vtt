00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.170
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.120
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.610
 I also use horse racing 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.830
 Paste the Mapple bird 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:21.580
 It is still amazing snow 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:24.480
 I have a group of my family's line and I have an exchange called mobile line 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.920
 It is an application to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760
 Do you know everyone ? 8 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.880
 Hmm 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.360
 The report of the entrance performance of each place was heard while being seen 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.610
 Parents of parents 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.630
 It looks like the snow is amazing. 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.750
 Is why sister in I'm a Tochigi Prefecture 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.870
 It seems like I'm in Hokkaido only for such a day 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 That I'm the job I do not know what such the only 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.490
 That Sapporo in Hokkaido is the opposite 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.449
 It seems is not falling snow with a surprisingly also referred to as fine weather 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:09.039
 Maybe it won't be on the weekend this weekend too 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:13.070
 I would like to announce the forecast of Negishi Stakes immediately 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:15.070
 I immediately expected looks like 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 Hmm 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:28.420
 Well, I'm going to go through Goto with Air Harifa , which I'd like to make three in a row . 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:35.950
 First of all, there are a, but good 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:41.649
 I would like to evaluate the contents of the previous run Musashino stakes where the same Tokyo racecourse was held 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:46.869
 The last was weak to succumb to Widebach's intense run-in, though 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.409
 To 3 pieces or less to had been put of 3 Umami difference 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:55.280
 After all these two are the ground 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:02:03.259
 It was an impression that it was good, especially the Air Harrier, who wears a major in the high pace 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:08.429
 So I think the evaluation is high, so this time as a member of the horse also seems to be a flower 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:13.709
 It is pretty slow that I can't find it, but it's good to be the limit 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.680
 As it is done as it is, as it is the last development to be attached to the second 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:22.500
 I feel like I'm pulling out 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:29.099
 By the way, guide bar, but we have bought in Fuchu before ideal bytes 3 run 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.689
 A little pace since Iso both had been in good deployment else taking contains the high pace-wide 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:36.670
 This time it seems to fall 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:41.590
 Taketoyo jockey is open Tsu hey's attention either to the same horse racing is the basis weight 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:46.930
 The guide weighs more than the face of Musashino Stakes 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:51.519
 I think that I want to push the air halifa also in this neighborhood 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:55.959
 After that, the dirt track of Tokyo Racecourse is a machine with 4 wins, 2 wins and 2 arrivals 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:03.730
 Miura duo Joe knee wear to the personality of a jockey twice 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:06.920
 As the other 1100m is dye transfer together, is it not all right to trust here ? 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.610
 After raising it to the other party I thought 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.610
 In the soil has been focused on the gay Come Barrett 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.069
 A line is also here after long-term rest 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:23.489
 It is data that was strong horse racing 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.599
 It was good that the distance was shortened, not just because I was resting. 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.620
 think 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.970
 This is still before 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:37.020
 We went out mainly on wind fungus, but these two races are blue and white 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:44.310
 Also took out the results in 1200 might also or distance of this much is correct 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:47.670
 It is a horse that can race in a group that is too far behind the British ancestor so there is no matter if you throw it 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.080
 I wonder if it will reach you 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:57.010
 Yaso strikes well but seems to be surprisingly popular with No. 6 popularity forecast 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:00.760
 Good I you eh permanent line 5 stations large and compatibility are you covered good 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.489
 It is dirt today and I want to expect here 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.489
 Is a 3-link like this in So 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.500
 What do you think 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:19.290
 That 's how the influence of snow may be on this week 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.290
 Tokyo than we are waving at you may be whether or not there 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.540
 Everyone there also 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.540
 I think it will be forecast on the day 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.080
 It was to let my best Moshio tired of 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.080
 Hmmm
