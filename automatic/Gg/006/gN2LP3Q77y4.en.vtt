better ways to prove your case

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.190 
better ways to prove your case
so<00:03:43.650> what<00:03:43.860> Sandra<00:03:44.250> Mansi<00:03:44.400> saw<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.000> 1977<00:03:45.989> could

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
so what Sandra Mansi saw in 1977 could

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.020 
so what Sandra Mansi saw in 1977 could
be<00:03:46.320> dismissed<00:03:46.560> if<00:03:47.070> she<00:03:47.250> hadn't<00:03:47.610> taken<00:03:47.670> a

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
be dismissed if she hadn't taken a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.420 
be dismissed if she hadn't taken a
photograph<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:48.870> she<00:03:49.530> did<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:49.950> let's<00:03:50.190> take<00:03:50.400> a

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
photograph but she did so let's take a

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.030 
photograph but she did so let's take a
look<00:03:50.640> at<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.940> Ben<00:03:51.750> Radford<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.709> committee
