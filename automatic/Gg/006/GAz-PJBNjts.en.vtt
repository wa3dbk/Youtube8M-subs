talking about in CVS so they weren't

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.920 
talking about in CVS so they weren't
actually<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> permanent<00:00:33.239> rack<00:00:33.600> although

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
actually in the permanent rack although

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.240 
actually in the permanent rack although
I<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.079> believe<00:00:34.200> these<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.800> permanent

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I do believe these are permanent

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.760 
I do believe these are permanent
basically<00:00:36.059> these<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.239> cream<00:00:36.809> lip<00:00:37.200> products

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
basically these are cream lip products

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.709 
basically these are cream lip products
that<00:00:37.920> apply<00:00:38.219> completely<00:00:39.000> opaquely<00:00:39.390> they

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
that apply completely opaquely they

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.380 
that apply completely opaquely they
promise<00:00:40.230> maximum<00:00:40.860> pigmentation<00:00:41.640> high<00:00:42.090> shine

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
promise maximum pigmentation high shine

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
promise maximum pigmentation high shine
and<00:00:42.890> feather-light<00:00:43.890> texture<00:00:44.309> feather-light

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and feather-light texture feather-light

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.220 
and feather-light texture feather-light
where<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> believe<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.020> most

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
where I believe I think they are most

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
where I believe I think they are most
comparable<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.190> Rimmel<00:00:47.640> show<00:00:47.879> off<00:00:48.030> lip

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
comparable to the Rimmel show off lip

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
comparable to the Rimmel show off lip
lacquers<00:00:48.780> although<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.469> quite<00:00:49.860> as

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
lacquers although they are not quite as

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.880 
lacquers although they are not quite as
high<00:00:50.309> shine<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.789> those<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.840> NYX<00:00:52.230> extreme

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
high shine as those and the NYX extreme

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
high shine as those and the NYX extreme
lip<00:00:53.370> creams<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.360> are

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
lip creams I think that's what they are

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
lip creams I think that's what they are
called<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.930> again<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.559> those<00:00:55.829> NYX<00:00:56.160> lip

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
called but again I think those NYX lip

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.520 
called but again I think those NYX lip
creams<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.840> more<00:00:57.870> high<00:00:58.199> shine

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
creams are a little bit more high shine

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
creams are a little bit more high shine
than<00:00:58.829> these<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.579> texture<00:01:00.120> though<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.570> very

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
than these the texture though is very

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
than these the texture though is very
very<00:01:01.140> similar<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> both<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> those<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
very similar to both of those and the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
very similar to both of those and the
lasting<00:01:02.640> power<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> same<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:03.600> well<00:01:03.840> all

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
lasting power is the same as well all

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.260 
lasting power is the same as well all
three<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.890> those<00:01:05.010> kind<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.369> deliver<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.939> ton<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
three of those kind of deliver a ton of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.109 
three of those kind of deliver a ton of
opacity<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> lot<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.070> product<00:01:08.640> they

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
opacity with not a lot of product they

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.179 
opacity with not a lot of product they
really<00:01:09.510> feel<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.260> liquid<00:01:10.710> lipsticks

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
really feel more like liquid lipsticks

really feel more like liquid lipsticks
and<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.170> kind<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> liquid

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590

lipsticks<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.070> been<00:01:14.159> launching

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
lipsticks that have been launching

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
lipsticks that have been launching
recently<00:01:15.000> sort<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.479> where<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.900> apply

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
recently sort of way where you apply

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.749 
recently sort of way where you apply
them<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.560> they<00:01:16.650> truly<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> liquid<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
them and they truly are a liquid and

them and they truly are a liquid and
they<00:01:17.850> dry<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.200> melted

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
they dry down it's like if you melted

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
they dry down it's like if you melted
down<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> lipstick<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> stayed<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> cream

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.330 
down a lipstick and it stayed in a cream
formula<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.470> apply<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.189> your

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
formula and you just apply that on your

formula and you just apply that on your
lips<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.150> exactly<00:01:24.720> how<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.170> feels<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.740> is

weeks<00:01:31.290> ago<00:01:31.439> where<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.220> texture<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.670> super

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
weeks ago where the texture was super

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
weeks ago where the texture was super
light<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.229> feathered

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
light but because of that it feathered

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.910 
light but because of that it feathered
this<00:01:35.280> manages<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.210> stay<00:01:36.659> light<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.350> give<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
this manages to stay light and give you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.980 
this manages to stay light and give you
a<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.369> nice<00:01:38.520> full<00:01:38.790> coverage<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> stays

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
a really nice full coverage but it stays

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
a really nice full coverage but it stays
in<00:01:40.350> place<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> say<00:01:41.970> it's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
in place now that's not to say it's

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
to your makeup repertoire this is not a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.110 
to your makeup repertoire this is not a
bad<00:02:35.100> way<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.250> go<00:02:35.459> they<00:02:35.640> are<00:02:35.700> easily<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
bad way to go they are easily the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.760 
bad way to go they are easily the
cheapest<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.780> other<00:02:36.959> two<00:02:37.170> options<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.709> I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
cheapest of the other two options that I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.410 
cheapest of the other two options that I
thought<00:02:38.040> they<00:02:38.160> were<00:02:38.220> most<00:02:38.580> similar<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
thought they were most similar to in the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.690 
thought they were most similar to in the
video<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.959> they<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.709> looks<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.130> from<00:02:41.430> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
video and they do it looks like from a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.330 
video and they do it looks like from a
comparison<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.870> shade<00:02:43.380> offerings<00:02:43.980> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
comparison of the shade offerings it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.220 
comparison of the shade offerings it
looks<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:44.700> these<00:02:44.820> have<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.240> few<00:02:45.720> other<00:02:45.900> shades

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
looks like these have a few other shades

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.570 
looks like these have a few other shades
that<00:02:46.440> maybe<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.740> Knicks<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> Rimmel

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
that maybe the Knicks and the Rimmel

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.550 
that maybe the Knicks and the Rimmel
apocalypses<00:02:48.180> don't<00:02:48.480> but<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:48.990> personally<00:02:49.470> have

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
apocalypses don't but I personally have

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.199 
apocalypses don't but I personally have
been<00:02:49.590> gravitating<00:02:50.190> towards<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.580> texture<00:02:51.060> in

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
been gravitating towards this texture in

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.030 
been gravitating towards this texture in
general<00:02:51.660> because<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.050> find<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.709> little

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
general because I find it is a little

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.590 
general because I find it is a little
bit<00:02:53.130> more<00:02:53.250> comfortable<00:02:53.700> than<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.000> lipstick<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
bit more comfortable than a lipstick and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.180 
bit more comfortable than a lipstick and
it<00:02:55.020> just<00:02:55.170> gives<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.500> lips<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.770> little<00:02:55.830> bit<00:02:55.980> more

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
it just gives the lips a little bit more

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.740 
it just gives the lips a little bit more
cushion<00:02:56.490> whereas<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:56.970> lipstick<00:02:57.450> feels<00:02:57.720> a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
cushion whereas a lipstick feels a

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.330 
cushion whereas a lipstick feels a
little<00:02:57.840> thinner<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.620> can<00:02:58.770> tend<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:58.950> drive<00:02:59.190> my

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
little thinner it can tend to drive my

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.640 
little thinner it can tend to drive my
lips<00:02:59.610> out<00:02:59.820> a<00:03:00.150> little<00:03:00.360> bit<00:03:00.600> whereas<00:03:01.110> these<00:03:01.290> give

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
lips out a little bit whereas these give

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.140 
lips out a little bit whereas these give
that<00:03:01.800> pigmentation<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.670> little<00:03:02.910> bit<00:03:03.000> more

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
that pigmentation a little bit more

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.540 
that pigmentation a little bit more
opacity<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.110> can<00:03:04.230> kind<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.560> gloss<00:03:04.890> over<00:03:04.920> any

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
opacity so it can kind of gloss over any

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.880 
opacity so it can kind of gloss over any
uneven<00:03:06.060> texture<00:03:06.570> any<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.380> kind<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.709> stuff

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
uneven texture any of that kind of stuff

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.770 
uneven texture any of that kind of stuff
on<00:03:08.070> your<00:03:08.160> lips<00:03:08.459> without<00:03:08.790> drying<00:03:09.269> down<00:03:09.450> or

on your lips without drying down or

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
drying your lips out the biggest

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.310 
drying your lips out the biggest
downside<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.209> these<00:03:12.330> are<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.900> they<00:03:13.050> aren't

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
downside to these are that they aren't

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.740 
downside to these are that they aren't
transfer<00:03:14.100> proof<00:03:14.430> although<00:03:14.730> they<00:03:15.300> don't<00:03:15.480> claim

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
transfer proof although they don't claim

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.110 
transfer proof although they don't claim
to<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.989> but<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.620> think<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.280> kind<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.580> these<00:03:17.880> kind

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
to be but I think it kind of these kind

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.030 
to be but I think it kind of these kind
of<00:03:18.180> make<00:03:18.300> up<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.500> they<00:03:19.620> do<00:03:19.680> come

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
of make up for it in that they do come

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.590 
of make up for it in that they do come
off<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.280> those<00:03:20.430> layers<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.030> you're<00:03:21.180> not<00:03:21.300> going

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
off in those layers so you're not going

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.630 
off in those layers so you're not going
to<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:22.440> know<00:03:22.560> touch<00:03:22.950> your<00:03:23.160> lips<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.550> your

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
to you know touch your lips to your

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.430 
to you know touch your lips to your
glass<00:03:23.880> or<00:03:24.180> eat<00:03:24.420> something<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.140> it'll<00:03:25.290> be

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
glass or eat something and it'll be

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.990 
glass or eat something and it'll be
completely<00:03:25.620> gone<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.489> said<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.820> kind<00:03:26.970> of

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
completely gone like I said it kind of

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.400 
completely gone like I said it kind of
comes<00:03:27.209> off<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.390> layer<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.019> it'll<00:03:28.200> gradually

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
comes off a layer so it'll gradually

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.990 
comes off a layer so it'll gradually
wear<00:03:28.830> away<00:03:28.920> throughout<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> day<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.850> then

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
wear away throughout the day and then

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.670 
wear away throughout the day and then
when<00:03:30.120> it's<00:03:30.269> gone<00:03:30.330> it's<00:03:30.720> gone<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.470> don't<00:03:31.560> have

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
when it's gone it's gone you don't have

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.470 
when it's gone it's gone you don't have
any<00:03:31.920> staining<00:03:32.310> or<00:03:32.640> uneven<00:03:33.030> wear<00:03:33.209> or<00:03:33.360> anything

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
any staining or uneven wear or anything

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.420 
any staining or uneven wear or anything
like<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.049> so<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:34.830> these<00:03:35.130> sound<00:03:35.370> like

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
like that so if these sound like

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.620
