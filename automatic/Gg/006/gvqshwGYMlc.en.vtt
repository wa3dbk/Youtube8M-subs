just<00:00:06.880> 15<00:00:07.299> pound<00:00:07.600> fell<00:00:07.810> satisfies<00:00:08.650> the<00:00:08.830> code<00:00:09.150> so

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
just 15 pound fell satisfies the code so

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.500 
just 15 pound fell satisfies the code so
that's<00:00:10.330> what<00:00:10.450> I'll<00:00:10.570> be<00:00:10.690> using<00:00:10.870> today<00:00:12.030> really<00:00:13.030> I

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
that's what I'll be using today really I

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.320 
that's what I'll be using today really I
prefer<00:00:14.260> this<00:00:14.530> as<00:00:14.830> a<00:00:14.889> product<00:00:15.849> to<00:00:16.059> wrap<00:00:16.179> the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
prefer this as a product to wrap the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.560 
prefer this as a product to wrap the
house<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:17.789> modern<00:00:18.789> house<00:00:18.910> wraps<00:00:19.180> work<00:00:19.390> well

house but modern house wraps work well
as<00:00:19.810> well<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:21.580> you<00:00:21.699> would<00:00:21.820> need<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.090> do<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:23.470> to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
as well what you would need to do is to

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.349 
as well what you would need to do is to
make<00:00:23.830> sure<00:00:24.070> that<00:00:24.490> everything<00:00:25.060> that<00:00:25.240> we

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
make sure that everything that we

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.509 
make sure that everything that we
applied<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.689> the<00:00:25.869> side<00:00:26.109> of<00:00:26.230> the<00:00:26.289> house

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
applied to the side of the house

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.359 
applied to the side of the house
shingles<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.380> code<00:00:29.560> will<00:00:29.590> call<00:00:29.980> for<00:00:30.220> our

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
shingles so the code will call for our

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.299 
shingles so the code will call for our

flashing a minimum of two inches so

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:51.689 
flashing a minimum of two inches so
we'll<00:00:37.389> start<00:00:37.600> at<00:00:37.719> that<00:00:37.809> point<00:00:50.429> again<00:00:51.429> just

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
we'll start at that point again just

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.660 
we'll start at that point again just
using<00:00:52.600> some<00:00:52.749> common<00:00:53.559> staples<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:54.369> get<00:00:54.519> it<00:00:54.609> in

using some common staples to get it in

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:13.520 
using some common staples to get it in
place<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.430> importance<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:10.030> this<00:01:10.149> paper

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and exit at the weep holes so this step

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.190 
and exit at the weep holes so this step

certainly should never be passed over

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.970 
certainly should never be passed over
we'll<00:01:29.200> continue<00:01:29.380> on

brick the backup must be watertight not
airtight<00:02:08.490> very<00:02:09.490> important<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:11.020> allows<00:02:11.350> for

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
airtight very important this allows for

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.290 
airtight very important this allows for
breathing<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.880> modern<00:02:13.150> house

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
breathing and so to the modern house

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.020 
breathing and so to the modern house
ramps<00:02:13.860> many<00:02:14.860> times<00:02:15.160> nowadays<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.730> build<00:02:15.910> homes

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
ramps many times nowadays we build homes

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.810 
ramps many times nowadays we build homes
too<00:02:16.300> tight<00:02:16.510> perhaps<00:02:17.500> you've<00:02:17.620> heard<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.920> of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
too tight perhaps you've heard of of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.920 
too tight perhaps you've heard of of
sick<00:02:19.120> buildings<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:21.370> don't<00:02:21.610> want

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
sick buildings so we don't want

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.410 
sick buildings so we don't want
something<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.200> stops<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.740> flow<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.920> air<00:02:24.420> but

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
something that stops the flow of air but

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.110 
something that stops the flow of air but
does<00:02:25.630> not<00:02:25.960> allow<00:02:26.290> water<00:02:26.590> at<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.250> same<00:02:27.430> time<00:02:27.670> to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
does not allow water at the same time to

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.090 
does not allow water at the same time to
get<00:02:28.240> into<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.480> house<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:28.930> at<00:02:29.710> each<00:02:29.830> lap

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
get into the house so at each lap

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.420 
get into the house so at each lap
obviously<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.910> breathes<00:02:31.240> well<00:02:31.540> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
obviously this breathes well and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.420 
obviously this breathes well and
functions<00:02:33.430> well

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.970 

we<00:02:37.000> found<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.329> nice<00:02:37.450> location<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.769> try<00:02:38.920> to

we found a nice location to try to
demonstrate<00:02:39.189> with<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> house<00:02:39.970> under

what I'd like you to remember from that

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.380 
what I'd like you to remember from that
presentation<00:02:47.530> was<00:02:47.920> what<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.489> said<00:02:48.610> about<00:02:48.909> water

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
presentation was what I said about water

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.240

water hose on a house before you lay the
brick<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.700> get<00:03:40.389> water<00:03:40.629> inside<00:03:41.639> guess<00:03:42.639> what's

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
brick and get water inside guess what's

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.390 
brick and get water inside guess what's
going<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.060> happen<00:03:43.359> after<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.690> lay<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.870> brick

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
going to happen after you lay the brick

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.879 
going to happen after you lay the brick
same<00:03:45.400> thing<00:03:45.669> it<00:03:45.849> should<00:03:46.299> be<00:03:46.510> watertight

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
same thing it should be watertight

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.860 
same thing it should be watertight
before<00:03:47.889> you<00:03:48.040> start<00:03:48.310> this<00:03:48.849> is<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> nice<00:03:49.299> example
