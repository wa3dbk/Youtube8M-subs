on<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.559> blog<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.880> Steve<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> Jenny<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.020> I'm

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
on my blog I get Steve the Jenny so I'm

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.350 
on my blog I get Steve the Jenny so I'm
just<00:01:07.619> peel<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> orange<00:01:08.580> obviously<00:01:09.060> take<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
just peel the orange obviously take the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.320 
just peel the orange obviously take the
peel<00:01:09.570> off<00:01:10.220> till<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.369> warms<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:11.970> bit

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
peel off till it warms up a little bit

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.270 
peel off till it warms up a little bit
so<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.200> easier<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.560> break<00:01:13.710> down<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.130> your

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
so it's easier to break down in your

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.090 
so it's easier to break down in your
blender<00:01:14.570> i'm<00:01:15.570> using<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.110> ninja<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.950> other

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100

vitamix which i do have I use it for

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.960 
vitamix which i do have I use it for
other<00:01:20.250> stuff<00:01:20.630> seems<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.460> like<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.790> us
