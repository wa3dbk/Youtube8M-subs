day when I did receive the package I was

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.699 
day when I did receive the package I was
in<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> car<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.660> was<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.110> excited<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.590> see

in the car and I was so excited to see
what<00:02:25.860> these<00:02:26.069> colors<00:02:26.310> look<00:02:26.519> like<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.060> I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
what these colors look like and I

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.759 
what these colors look like and I
actually<00:02:27.269> tried<00:02:27.630> them<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.110> my<00:02:28.140> natural

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
actually tried them out on my natural

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.650 
actually tried them out on my natural
nails<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.190> all<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> had<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.850> just<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.269> base<00:02:30.450> coat

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
nails and all I had was just a base coat

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.990 
nails and all I had was just a base coat
like<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.989> see<00:02:31.140> right<00:02:31.350> now<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.310> applied<00:02:32.640> two

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
like you see right now and I applied two

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.539 
like you see right now and I applied two
coats<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.930> these<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.380> my<00:02:34.410> nails<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.310> waited

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
coats of these on my nails and I waited

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.759 
coats of these on my nails and I waited
five<00:02:36.000> minutes<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:36.870> completely<00:02:37.290> tried

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
five minutes and they completely tried

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.920 
five minutes and they completely tried
and<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.130> was<00:02:38.340> not<00:02:38.549> in<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.880> Sun<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> didn't<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and I was not in the Sun I didn't have a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.070 
and I was not in the Sun I didn't have a
carrying<00:02:40.500> lamp<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:40.950> me<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:42.090> what<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.360> think<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
carrying lamp with me so what I think is

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.390 
carrying lamp with me so what I think is
that<00:02:43.110> these<00:02:43.620> are<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.130> normal<00:02:44.790> nail<00:02:45.750> polishes

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
that these are just normal nail polishes

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.190 
that these are just normal nail polishes
I<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.970> wish<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:48.510> didn't<00:02:48.840> put<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
I really wish like they didn't put the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.120 
I really wish like they didn't put the
gel<00:02:49.890> polish<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:51.049> on<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.440> bottle<00:02:53.010> because

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
gel polish on on to the bottle because

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.550 
gel polish on on to the bottle because
that's<00:02:53.489> kind<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.760> misleading<00:02:54.239> they<00:02:54.959> really

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
that's kind of misleading they really

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.400 
that's kind of misleading they really
remind<00:02:56.040> me<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> lot<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.060> Sally<00:02:57.810> Hansen<00:02:59.239> foil

thirty-six<00:03:18.859> watt<00:03:19.859> UV<00:03:20.250> lamp<00:03:20.579> so<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.000> can't<00:03:21.420> even

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
thirty-six watt UV lamp so I can't even

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.710

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
believe that you can wear these

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.060 
believe that you can wear these
basically<00:03:27.959> as<00:03:28.079> nail<00:03:28.290> polishes<00:03:28.769> because<00:03:29.040> I

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
basically as nail polishes because I

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.370 
basically as nail polishes because I
really<00:03:29.370> feel<00:03:29.579> that's<00:03:29.820> what<00:03:30.060> they<00:03:30.209> are<00:03:30.450> now<00:03:31.260> if

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
really feel that's what they are now if

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.380 
really feel that's what they are now if
you<00:03:31.500> want<00:03:31.739> them<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.070> last<00:03:32.250> longer<00:03:32.609> this<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
you want them to last longer this is the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.680 
you want them to last longer this is the
good<00:03:33.660> thing<00:03:33.870> about<00:03:34.049> these<00:03:34.410> kind<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.859> khaleesi

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
good thing about these kind of khaleesi

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.630 
good thing about these kind of khaleesi
polishes<00:03:36.690> rather<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.100> can<00:03:38.310> use<00:03:38.459> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
polishes rather is that you can use the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.630 
polishes rather is that you can use the
clear<00:03:40.220> clear<00:03:41.220> UV<00:03:41.790> cured<00:03:42.380> top<00:03:43.380> coat<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:44.040> cure

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
clear clear UV cured top coat to cure

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.759 
clear clear UV cured top coat to cure
them<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.569> what<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.019> going<00:03:46.319> to<00:03:46.380> make

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
them and this is what is going to make

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.030 
them and this is what is going to make
these<00:03:47.040> lasts<00:03:47.540> longer<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.780> that's<00:03:49.319> what<00:03:49.769> I

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
these lasts longer and that's what I

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.110 
these lasts longer and that's what I
really<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.819> this<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.150> just<00:03:51.390> basically

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
really think and this is just basically

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.539 
really think and this is just basically
like<00:03:54.120> any<00:03:54.329> other<00:03:54.600> UV<00:03:55.230> gel<00:03:55.440> topcoat<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:56.220> reminds

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
like any other UV gel topcoat it reminds

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.380 
like any other UV gel topcoat it reminds
me<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.760> lot<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
me a lot of the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.470 
me a lot of the
Beadie<00:03:57.780> top<00:03:58.470> coat<00:03:58.770> you<00:03:58.980> just<00:03:59.010> cure<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.490> for<00:03:59.550> one

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
Beadie top coat you just cure it for one

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.059 
Beadie top coat you just cure it for one
or<00:04:00.630> two<00:04:00.780> minutes<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.319> you're<00:04:01.500> good<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:01.860> go<00:04:01.890> and

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
or two minutes and you're good to go and

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.000 
or two minutes and you're good to go and
this<00:04:02.520> will<00:04:02.700> make<00:04:03.240> that<00:04:03.630> last<00:04:04.080> a<00:04:04.319> lot<00:04:04.470> longer<00:04:04.530> on

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
this will make that last a lot longer on

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.160 
this will make that last a lot longer on

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.650 
these are just regular nail polishes so
you<00:06:17.920> can<00:06:18.190> basically<00:06:18.430> just<00:06:18.880> use<00:06:19.180> the<00:06:19.420> UV

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
you can basically just use the UV

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.860 
you can basically just use the UV
topcoat<00:06:20.290> to<00:06:20.530> make<00:06:20.890> these<00:06:21.130> last<00:06:21.430> longer<00:06:22.300> I'm
