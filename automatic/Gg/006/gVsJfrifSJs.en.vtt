 Benedictines in fact have more than eight nine centuries of life

 fiandaca over the millennia has always been considered sacred siad for the purposes of gods 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.940
 of the same verification even in the Athenian constitution

 boh milano with the death penalty to discharge one of these plants 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.680
 the olive tree is a sacred plant for all the monotheistic religions of the basin of the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.880
 i'm gone bershka company our religion in all of our from the moment 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.529
 of the birth we fought this function until the moment of death 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.089
 an interesting feature of the olive tree for certain tips in 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:26.139
 especially 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.459
 is what their inner tissues were over the centuries and therefore yes

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.040
 it was paradoxically sacrificed as firewood those orders that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.249
 I seem smaller realities are the oldest ones 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.059
 now this can no longer be done because they have become heritage 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.819
 of the Puglia region not that it is a heritage of Italy and therefore not 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.839
 they can be used more as firewood

 I am only a keeper not the owners of this tent the 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.759
 propetario of this, a caretaker they were before me stood after me 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:13.469
 as you can see behind me from the presence of the ladder to be served in the 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.959
 these trees are raised by hand we are in December 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.369
 full olive harvest 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:22.079
