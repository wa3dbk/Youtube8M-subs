work from a photograph you took to a
portrait<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.520> George<00:00:36.059> Washington<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.020> am<00:00:38.010> using

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
portrait of George Washington I am using

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.680 
portrait of George Washington I am using
the<00:00:38.579> random<00:00:39.059> Lego<00:00:39.420> picture<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.230> took<00:00:40.850> okay<00:00:41.850> here

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the random Lego picture I took okay here

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.360 
the random Lego picture I took okay here
we<00:00:42.930> go<00:00:43.489> make<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> new<00:00:44.730> transparent<00:00:45.570> layer<00:00:46.370> fill

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
we go make a new transparent layer fill

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.240 
we go make a new transparent layer fill
it<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.850> black<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.420> set<00:00:48.840> its<00:00:49.050> opacity<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
it with black and set its opacity to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.060 
it with black and set its opacity to
about<00:00:50.460> 50<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:52.079> through<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.820 

now<00:00:58.070> we<00:00:58.130> are<00:00:58.640> going<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:59.090> draw<00:00:59.450> a<00:00:59.690> depth<00:00:59.960> map<00:01:00.470> in

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
now we are going to draw a depth map in

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.549 
now we are going to draw a depth map in
this<00:01:01.040> layer<00:01:01.630> don't<00:01:02.630> get<00:01:02.900> scared

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
this layer don't get scared

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.120 
this layer don't get scared
though<00:01:04.010> I<00:01:04.420> am<00:01:05.420> about<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.840> tell<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:06.500> what<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.950> do

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
though I am about to tell you what to do

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.080 
though I am about to tell you what to do
in<00:01:07.430> English<00:01:08.140> basically<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:10.310> draw<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:10.729> over

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
in English basically just draw it over

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.140 
in English basically just draw it over
your<00:01:11.360> picture<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:12.050> shades<00:01:12.410> of<00:01:12.619> great<00:01:13.150> bright

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
your picture in shades of great bright

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.500 
your picture in shades of great bright
shades<00:01:14.680> like<00:01:15.680> white<00:01:15.920> will<00:01:16.670> appear<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:17.360> be

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
shades like white will appear to be

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.460 
shades like white will appear to be
closest<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.410> camera<00:01:19.119> dark<00:01:20.119> shades<00:01:20.510> like

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
closest to the camera dark shades like

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.130 
closest to the camera dark shades like
black<00:01:21.800> are<00:01:22.070> farther<00:01:23.000> away<00:01:23.300> from<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.110> camera

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
black are farther away from the camera

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.450 
black are farther away from the camera
