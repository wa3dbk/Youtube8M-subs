similar topics or theories because you

retain the information effectively and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.290 
retain the information effectively and
give<00:02:32.950> your<00:02:33.070> mind<00:02:33.220> enough<00:02:33.520> time<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.880> process<00:02:34.090> it

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:45.390 
in their parts so that they pull out
easily<00:04:30.890> and<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.580> roots<00:04:31.730> don't<00:04:32.000> get<00:04:32.150> damaged

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:54.930 

I<00:04:52.530> chose<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.650> use<00:04:53.740> different<00:04:54.010> cacti<00:04:54.490> because

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
I chose to use different cacti because

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.150 
I chose to use different cacti because
they're<00:04:55.300> pretty<00:04:55.570> Hardy<00:04:56.110> plants<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:56.919> they

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
they're pretty Hardy plants so they

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.370 
they're pretty Hardy plants so they
don't<00:04:57.430> need<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.699> be<00:04:57.820> one<00:04:58.000> very<00:04:58.300> often<00:04:58.479> and<00:04:58.810> they

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
don't need to be one very often and they

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.350 
don't need to be one very often and they
come<00:04:59.590> in<00:04:59.710> these<00:04:59.800> really<00:04:59.860> cute<00:05:00.580> bright<00:05:00.940> colors
