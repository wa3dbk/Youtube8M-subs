00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
godly guys so I am curious to see how it

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.680 
godly guys so I am curious to see how it
fares<00:05:03.830> against<00:05:04.250> bigger<00:05:04.460> enemies<00:05:04.910> so<00:05:05.540> we're

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
fares against bigger enemies so we're

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.610 
fares against bigger enemies so we're
going<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:06.080> spawn<00:05:06.820> let's<00:05:07.820> see<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.300> hunter<00:05:08.840> uh-huh

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.500 

okay<00:05:12.620> so<00:05:13.190> but<00:05:13.640> yeah<00:05:13.790> by<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.000> way<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.240> guys

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
okay so but yeah by the way you guys

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.050 
okay so but yeah by the way you guys
didn't<00:05:14.750> know<00:05:14.810> who<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.020> map<00:05:15.200> was<00:05:15.740> yeah<00:05:16.190> anyway

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
didn't know who the map was yeah anyway

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:25.930 
didn't know who the map was yeah anyway
umm<00:05:18.669> Strider<00:05:19.669> yeah<00:05:22.450> okay<00:05:23.450> so<00:05:24.940> technically

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
umm Strider yeah okay so technically

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.210 
umm Strider yeah okay so technically
Strutters<00:05:26.450> can<00:05:26.600> only<00:05:26.720> die<00:05:26.990> by<00:05:27.200> explosives<00:05:27.890> or

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
Strutters can only die by explosives or

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.420 
Strutters can only die by explosives or
I<00:05:28.640> do<00:05:29.150> believe<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:29.990> technically<00:05:30.710> even<00:05:31.220> though

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
I do believe and technically even though

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.219 
I do believe and technically even though
that<00:05:31.550> does<00:05:31.790> seem<00:05:32.030> like<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.270> explodes<00:05:32.690> it's

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
that does seem like it explodes it's

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.480 
that does seem like it explodes it's
more<00:05:33.410> of<00:05:33.470> like<00:05:33.590> a<00:05:33.620> Gauss<00:05:33.919> Rifle<00:05:34.130> explosion

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
more of like a Gauss Rifle explosion

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.040 
more of like a Gauss Rifle explosion
instead<00:05:35.240> of<00:05:35.300> like<00:05:35.390> an<00:05:35.479> actual<00:05:35.750> rocket

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
instead of like an actual rocket

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.570 
instead of like an actual rocket
explosion<00:05:36.710> so<00:05:36.919> I<00:05:36.950> don't<00:05:37.130> think<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.400> gets

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
explosion so I don't think it gets

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.940 
explosion so I don't think it gets
detected<00:05:37.970> as<00:05:38.360> any<00:05:38.660> sort<00:05:39.169> of<00:05:39.290> damage<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.830> the

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
detected as any sort of damage to the

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.010 
detected as any sort of damage to the
Strider<00:05:40.250> which<00:05:40.460> is<00:05:40.580> very<00:05:40.820> unfortunate

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
Strider which is very unfortunate

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.480 
Strider which is very unfortunate
because<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:42.290> thing<00:05:42.530> is<00:05:42.560> beast<00:05:43.010> and<00:05:43.370> it

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
because this thing is beast and it

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.450 
because this thing is beast and it
cannot<00:05:43.700> even<00:05:43.850> kill<00:05:44.120> a<00:05:44.450> Strider<00:05:45.250> but<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:46.280> can

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
cannot even kill a Strider but I can

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.219 
cannot even kill a Strider but I can
kill<00:05:46.669> like<00:05:46.940> fifty<00:05:47.330> odessa's<00:05:47.750> in<00:05:47.870> one<00:05:47.990> shot

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
kill like fifty odessa's in one shot

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.820 
kill like fifty odessa's in one shot
what<00:05:49.160> about<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.460> N<00:05:49.580> lion<00:05:49.760> guard<00:05:50.860> whoa<00:05:52.180> hello

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
what about the N lion guard whoa hello

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.930 
what about the N lion guard whoa hello
so<00:05:54.830> it<00:05:54.979> does<00:05:55.280> not<00:05:55.550> one<00:05:55.850> shot<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.330> lion<00:05:56.570> guard

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
so it does not one shot the lion guard

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.370 
so it does not one shot the lion guard
but<00:05:58.940> it<00:05:59.150> still<00:05:59.390> takes<00:05:59.600> like<00:05:59.780> three<00:05:59.870> shots<00:06:00.169> oh

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
but it still takes like three shots oh

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.469 
but it still takes like three shots oh
that's<00:06:00.530> not<00:06:00.770> too<00:06:00.950> shabby<00:06:01.120> alright<00:06:02.120> guys<00:06:02.300> so

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
that's not too shabby alright guys so

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.880 
that's not too shabby alright guys so
next<00:06:02.630> up<00:06:02.780> I<00:06:02.930> wanted<00:06:03.200> to<00:06:03.260> test<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.710> actual

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
next up I wanted to test the actual

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.710 
next up I wanted to test the actual
range<00:06:04.430> on<00:06:04.820> how<00:06:04.910> far<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.270> bullet<00:06:05.540> will<00:06:05.690> travel

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
range on how far the bullet will travel

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.230 
range on how far the bullet will travel
I<00:06:06.470> don't<00:06:07.100> think<00:06:07.400> it<00:06:07.460> has<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.669> bullet<00:06:08.030> drop

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
I don't think it has a bullet drop

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.570 
I don't think it has a bullet drop
regardless<00:06:08.840> of<00:06:08.960> how<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.140> scope<00:06:09.530> looks<00:06:09.800> but<00:06:10.490> we

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
regardless of how the scope looks but we

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.550 
regardless of how the scope looks but we
have<00:06:10.700> someone<00:06:10.940> targeted<00:06:11.419> way<00:06:11.840> over<00:06:12.290> there<00:06:12.440> by

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
have someone targeted way over there by

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.380 
have someone targeted way over there by
the<00:06:12.620> beach<00:06:12.860> and<00:06:13.280> we're<00:06:13.640> going<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:13.910> see<00:06:14.090> if<00:06:14.270> I

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
the beach and we're going to see if I

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.070 
the beach and we're going to see if I
could<00:06:14.540> shoot<00:06:14.720> him

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.290 

okay<00:06:19.080> indeed<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:20.370> bullet<00:06:20.699> does<00:06:20.910> take<00:06:21.120> a<00:06:21.150> while

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
okay indeed the bullet does take a while

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.240 
okay indeed the bullet does take a while
to<00:06:21.330> get<00:06:21.540> there<00:06:21.720> but<00:06:21.870> I<00:06:21.930> think<00:06:21.990> he<00:06:22.620> still<00:06:23.070> dies

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
to get there but I think he still dies

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.610 
to get there but I think he still dies
anyway<00:06:23.520> I<00:06:24.060> think<00:06:24.660> he<00:06:24.840> dies<00:06:24.990> before<00:06:25.199> the<00:06:25.350> bullet

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
anyway I think he dies before the bullet

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.870 
anyway I think he dies before the bullet
