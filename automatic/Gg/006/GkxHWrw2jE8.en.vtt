TV black and he's figuring them out I
was<00:02:52.590> little<00:02:52.709> worried<00:02:53.159> because<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:54.030> thought

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
was little worried because I thought

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.970 
was little worried because I thought
they<00:02:54.299> might<00:02:54.420> fall<00:02:54.629> apart<00:02:54.750> same<00:02:55.590> with<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.829> game

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
they might fall apart same with the game
