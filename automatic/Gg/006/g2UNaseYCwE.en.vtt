00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.129
 hello I'm randall z maybe a lot of 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.780
 you do not know me the truth I do not know 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.400
 why because I do the audio of almost 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.620
 all videos and music almost 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.570
 all game admit to say that here I am and 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.570
 because of the end of the year and the new 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 year 2015 that we have my top 5 of the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.820
 last year's games although I did not play 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.300
 many the truth 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.800
 number 5 in number 5 we have to fight 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.480
 night sales review a game that to me the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.370
 it really impressed me I did not expect it 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.440
 when it was my birthday comes here the 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.760
 study they were all playing it no 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.320
 it took a long time until it will start 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.019
 Help scream like a 5 year old girl 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.699
 but what a game is this is a 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.650
 pretty simple game where you are 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.230
 sitting in a room trying to defend you 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.960
 of lunatic robots and I do not know how much 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.449
 more and the worst is that you do not have weapons 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.830
 you only have a small button to 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.570
 learn and turn off the light and another button 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.010
 to close the doors but be careful 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.240
 Do not run out of your energy because 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 then this will come 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.550
 number 4 since they announced it that 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.230
 it was in development and I was anxious 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.360
 he wrote them a letter congratulating the 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.770
 developers and do not stop screaming in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.720
 the playstation conference when 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.400
 he announced that he was going out for play 4 and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 I'm talking about daddy octopus 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.170
 doctor that human so charismatic and so 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.540
 normal that nobody can know that in 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.920
 reality is an octopus disguised that in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
 actually had children and had a great 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.460
 family who would not want to have a life 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.460
 like his I know that they 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.299
 number 3 the third main delivery in 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.130
 this saga fails that impressed me in 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.930
 first visually the graphics are 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.020
 incredible especially with your powers and 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.070
 the great variety of particles and effects 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.450
 screeners that are throughout the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.299
 game from the beginning to the end 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 but also history also 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.310
 acted so interesting and the great 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.860
 feeling of freedom that this gives you 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.020
 I play the grand opening of the map all 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.110
 the powers the skills you have 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.689
 they make you feel strong powerful free in 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.369
 this vastness of the world just does not 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.369
 near water number 2 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.670
 where being there was a pleasant surprise that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.579
 I took away the free games that he gave 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.340
 play station on the playstation plus go 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.780
 what a great game it turned out to be 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.909
 I just started playing it because 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.950
 I had the free game and because I 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.220
 they called them the cartoons but 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.400
 I invested him hours days weeks weeks is 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.819
 a super complicated super complex game 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.349
 you will die thousands of times and resort to 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.599
 thousands of wikis before you can 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.510
 move forward but go it's worth the end 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.519
 yes if it reaches the end it was pretty good 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.870
 and quite rewarding and it was one of the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.940
 few games that I have reached 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.090
 buy dlc I really recommend them 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.090
 much 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.629
 number 1 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.170
 south park district of truth or go that 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.490
 great game turned out to be this for a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.110
 moment I was afraid that there was not 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.540
 the light of day thanks to what happened 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.730
 with you and all that but oh surprise in 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.130
 the now wicked before good of 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.690
 ubisoft in saved them and go that 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.400
 it turned out to be an incredible game so 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.960
 incredible that made me want it again 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.790
 is reflected is after many years that 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.160
 I hated you, you start as a child 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.080
 new in the town that goes that makes you 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.810
 really feel like your part of the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.390
 series the graphics the performances the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.430
 stories humor the scenarios 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.190
 characters all up to every tiny 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.830
 detail brings you back in a super way 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.450
 well done to the series you feel like in 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.760
 a great episode or like in a 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.710
 full season of the cartoon and you 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.150
 you feel important and you feel that 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.590
 you are really getting to know all the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.180
 characters you've grown to love 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.830
 through two years go that is a 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.690
 super amazing experience and super 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.490
 funny super entertaining and what more 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.260
 I liked it was that it is not a rpg that you 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.060
 forces to be repeating tasks 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.700
 monotonous and stupid again and again 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.710
 but it's going to what's going is a way to 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.420
 very funny game where you can 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.850
 customize many things where in 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.630
 actually you own what you are 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.610
 my game of the year and so this 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.400
 it was my top 5 of the best 5 games of the 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.930
 year of 2014 I hope you liked it and 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.100
 Well here is a sample of the 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.720
 videos I was wearing here in whoever 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.010
 admit for those who forget 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.010
 me although I love them so much 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.830
 we will continue to see the following 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.830
 videos and then here is 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.650
 and
