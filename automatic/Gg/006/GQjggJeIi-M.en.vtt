here on your screen what I decided to do
is<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.070> take<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.879> could

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
is kind of just take it out so it could

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.990 
is kind of just take it out so it could
be<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.360> open<00:00:51.899> air<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:53.579> doesn't<00:00:53.850> matter

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
be in the open air and it doesn't matter

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.090 
be in the open air and it doesn't matter
how<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.829> from

how you do it you can do it from

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.979 
how you do it you can do it from
actually<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.789> inside<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> airport

where the hangar is that right there or

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.930 
where the hangar is that right there or
you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.600> take<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> did<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
what you're going to do is after you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.770 
what you're going to do is after you
have<00:01:04.500> taken<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.430> cargo<00:01:06.119> plane<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.570> want

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

have taken out your cargo plane you want
to<00:01:06.930> step<00:01:07.229> outside<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.610> want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.030> one

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to step outside and you want to get one

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.359 
to step outside and you want to get one
of<00:01:09.450> two<00:01:09.600> different<00:01:09.780> types<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.260> explosives<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
of two different types of explosives you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.830 
of two different types of explosives you
can<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.970> rocket<00:01:12.240> launcher<00:01:12.390> which

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
can do this with a rocket launcher which

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.390 
can do this with a rocket launcher which
I<00:01:13.049> pretty<00:01:13.350> much<00:01:13.439> recommend<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> light

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
I pretty much recommend to be a light

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.130 
I pretty much recommend to be a light
user<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> rocket<00:01:15.090> launcher<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
user with a rocket launcher or if you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
user with a rocket launcher or if you
don't<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.530> rocket<00:01:16.950> launcher<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.700> use

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
don't have a rocket launcher you can use

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
don't have a rocket launcher you can use
a<00:01:17.909> sticky<00:01:18.270> bomb<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.380> pretty<00:01:19.560> much<00:01:19.650> want

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
a sticky bomb and you pretty much want

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.920 
a sticky bomb and you pretty much want
to<00:01:20.159> hit<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.240> center<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
to hit it right in the center of the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.469 
to hit it right in the center of the
nose<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.100> airplane<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
nose of the airplane and it's going to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.499 
nose of the airplane and it's going to
actually<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.220> explode<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
actually just go and explode so what I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.590 
actually just go and explode so what I
did<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.049> ended<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.409> calling<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.860> blaster<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600

piece of metal and once you do that you
can<00:01:52.680> actually<00:01:52.890> hop<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.090> other<00:01:54.420> side<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
can actually hop on the other side of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.139 
can actually hop on the other side of
the<00:01:55.020> metal<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> gun<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.700> kind<00:01:57.090> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the metal and with a gun just kind of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
the metal and with a gun just kind of
tap<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.719> front<00:01:57.990> end<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.920> will

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.490 
tap the front end of it and you will
start<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.369> glide<00:01:59.939> now<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.049> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
start to glide now you want to do it you

and while you're on top of it
actually<00:02:13.400> just<00:02:13.519> keep<00:02:13.730> gliding<00:02:14.359> and<00:02:14.480> sliding

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
actually just keep gliding and sliding

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.750

constantly now with the one thing you
don't<00:02:16.909> want<00:02:16.999> to<00:02:17.180> do<00:02:17.269> is<00:02:17.389> you<00:02:17.420> don't<00:02:17.659> want<00:02:17.810> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
don't want to do is you don't want to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.690 
don't want to do is you don't want to
use<00:02:18.019> like<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.530> machine<00:02:18.829> gun<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.400> like

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
use like a machine gun and just like

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.429 
use like a machine gun and just like
hold<00:02:19.969> it<00:02:20.120> down<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.510> shoe<00:02:20.749> because<00:02:20.959> it's<00:02:21.260> going

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
hold it down the shoe because it's going

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.649 
hold it down the shoe because it's going
to<00:02:21.499> it<00:02:21.829> is<00:02:21.980> going<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.400> go<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.519> lot<00:02:22.760> faster<00:02:23.060> but

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
to it is going to go a lot faster but

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.059 
to it is going to go a lot faster but
it's<00:02:23.900> going<00:02:24.109> to<00:02:24.170> make<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.469> end<00:02:24.680> up<00:02:24.829> falling

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
it's going to make you end up falling

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.709 
it's going to make you end up falling
out<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.670> you're<00:02:26.120> going<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.299> be<00:02:26.389> like

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:26.719 
out and you're going to be like

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.449 
out and you're going to be like
constantly<00:02:27.290> moving<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.799> try<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.010> regain<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
constantly moving to try to regain the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.250 
constantly moving to try to regain the
balance<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.120> pretty<00:02:29.629> much<00:02:29.689> a<00:02:29.810> defeats<00:02:30.170> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
balance and pretty much a defeats the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.599 
balance and pretty much a defeats the
whole<00:02:30.290> purpose<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:31.010> actual<00:02:31.340> little

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
whole purpose of the actual little

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.879 
whole purpose of the actual little
glitch<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.200> yeah<00:02:33.200> that's<00:02:33.349> all<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.590> want<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.799> do

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
glitch so yeah that's all you want to do

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.470 
glitch so yeah that's all you want to do
what<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.069> recommend<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.579> use<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.969> a<00:02:35.000> pistol

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
what I recommend you use like a pistol

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.940 
what I recommend you use like a pistol
of<00:02:35.599> some<00:02:35.810> sort<00:02:36.079> and<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.379> kind<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.590> shoot<00:02:36.799> off

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
of some sort and just kind of shoot off

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.520 
of some sort and just kind of shoot off
rounds<00:02:37.549> off<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.819> front<00:02:38.079> well<00:02:39.079> after<00:02:39.139> you<00:02:39.379> do

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
rounds off the front well after you do

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.259 
rounds off the front well after you do
this<00:02:39.650> after<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.069> good<00:02:40.430> while<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.939> will<00:02:41.150> get
