00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.909
 compare driving performance not 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.979
 just you and you but the results

 journalists from Kazakhstan

 this test took part lecture

 part 350 f sport 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.790
 with a motor capacity of 3 and a half liters 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.940
 power 306 horsepower and BMW 535 m 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.630
 sport 3 liters power then also 306 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.930
 horse 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.970
 would like to warn this official 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.010
 machine specifications given to us 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.650
 American Automobile Association

 nickname judge by common fruit gods 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.610
 model of 500 she is about 2 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.989
 level and possess very low 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.030
 speed and dynamic 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.430
 characteristics of a particular delivery 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.380
 kilometers an hour lexus accelerates for 6.1 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.620
 seconds and the maximum speed of the machine 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.140
 is 250 kilometers from bmw it 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.670
 Essentially accelerates in 5.7 seconds on 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.820
 maximum machine speed also 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.620
 is 250 kilometers an hour both cars 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.760
 rear-wheel drive though they have and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.410
 all-wheel drive version 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.239
 well and the main difference from sports 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.269
 there are no versions gs350 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.670
 and BMW 535 a and lies in their price in 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:06.410
 america lexus gs 350 f sport 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.860
 worth 50 3390 dollars a b in 535 tp 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.560
 sport costs 50 9170 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.120
 Well, that is, in America, lexus for five thousand 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.430
 seven hundred and eighty five dollars worth 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.430
 cheaper in in which is not surprising since 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.320
 American bmw is bmw but lexus is 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.030
 just japanese consumer dignity 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.200
 which is just that 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.920
 with the same technical 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.680
 characteristics 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.109
 comfort level with bmw and mercedes om price 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.120
 Lexus at 67 thousand dollars below 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.680
 by the way a similar assessment of cars 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.320
 lecture exists not only at 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.359
 Americans and Europeans and even ours 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.090
 Russiaâ€™s neighbors for example in Russia 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.160
 lexus gs 350 f sport costs sixty 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.650
 eight thousand six hundred fifty dollars 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.840
 and fighting 535 a 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.450
 174 thousand five hundred seventy dollars then 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.720
 is in lexus russia cheaper bmw on 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.240
 5900 14 dollars of different prices approximately 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.130
 the same as the Americans and only ours 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.420
 Glorious Kazakhstan goes own 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.400
 the road is not only in politics and economics 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.510
 well and in automobile preference 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.330
 particulars we have door gs 350 f sport 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.710
 190 thousand four hundred dollars and bmw 535 a 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.569
 in the dispute is 80 2208 house well, that is, in 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.639
 difference from all normal 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.120
 the track feels cheaper and more expensive bbh on 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.800
 8192 dollars 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.750
 when I told the Americans about it 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.340
 they almost choked in surprise 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.229
 whistle they just couldn't afford 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.509
 imagine that somewhere in the world people live 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.090
 willing to pay for centuries more than 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.680
 bmw or mars and buly american 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.240
 exports told me that if you 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.360
 believe price grandfather what would be on level 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.699
 bmw or mercedes then no american i 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.590
 would buy cars a lecture buys them 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.660
 states only because of the low price and not 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.009
 moreover how to be honest and not myself 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.830
 understanding what's going on with the whole world on 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.169
 Kazakhstan cars for example why v535 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.570
 this sport costs 8 thousand dollars 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.509
 more expensive than in Russia and up and Jess 350 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.099
 f sport hd 22000 dollars although we are with 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.560
 Russia is in the same on 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.449
 space and by the way the VAT is lower than 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.009
 Rusichi but the price of cars 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.449
 incomparably higher however let's 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.020
 back to comparative test drive 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.699
 lexus and fighting and so chasing cars on 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.229
 general purpose roads and they 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.729
 demonstrated very close 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.680
 characteristics while comfort levels 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.280
 helicopters then was driving the ride 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.440
 characteristics 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.150
 we arrived at the closed circuit where 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.400
 the organizer is grass paved 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.440
 speedy snake that is fully justified and 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.570
 as well as all tests speed snake 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.220
 best to show all positive 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.560
 negative car characteristics 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.479
 with a sharp change in the trajectory of movement 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.870
 variable load on the left suspension 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.210
 Fri to make excuses 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.010
 speed so that test results are 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.410
 objective road organizers 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.480
 tests made decisions tests to hold 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.010
 wet and dry coating with 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.200
 off electronic system 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.120
 directional stability to carry out the test 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.940
 on both cars one pilot had to 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.740
 steve bar gridne was put simple 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.630
 the task is to pass the snake to the maximum 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.180
 possible speed on the verge of wheel failure 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.070
 name is the first race took place on dry 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.950
 track and you will fall unexpected surprise 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.650
 lexus turned out to be faster and more stable b 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.380
 all the animal Jess fly at speed 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.690
 just over 63 miles per hour that's about 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.050
 one hundred and two kilometers per hour as a while 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:18.700
 would you 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:20.590
 60 miles per hour or 97 km in the wet 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.100
 asphalt lecture again proved to be faster 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.030
 would you 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.730
 60 and 70 70 their world in chat or 98 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.160
 kilometers an hour how would you be 59.7 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.180
 miles per hour or ninety four s 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.070
 half an hour 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.600
 honestly test results he 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.460
 passed three times for each car 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.380
 slightly shocked everyone since 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.580
 Lexus cars are always inferior 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.130
 driving performance 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.100
 German car and suddenly the Japanese surpassed 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.050
 German school engineer to have this riddle 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.940
 There are only 2 answers. Vepa Japanese 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.190
 learned how to make cars better than Germans 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.190
 either the Germans are gradually degrading
