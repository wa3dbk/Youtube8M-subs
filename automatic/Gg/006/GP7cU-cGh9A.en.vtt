00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.410
 and as well as being welcome to another new 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.170
 milestone and that's how they saw it in the 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.110
 title and this king of great missed one the 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.869
 original the first milestone the one that gave a 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.700
 cue and it was the great start of this 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.460
 click saga that the truth I feel that 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.930
 it's the best of all and we're going to start 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.820
 Now I'm going to show you where it is 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.000
 but first of all I'm going to 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.559
 leave your premises to distance it ok one thing 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.559
 so he does not know how big he was missing 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:48.760
 one where he started was the first 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.649
 started on playstation one was a I think 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.420
 that it was a kit it was as much to us as grand 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.850
 theft auto san andreas that I think was 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.370
 the best- selling game play station2 but 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.260
 yes it was a great title so it was a very 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.450
 marked of playstation one because 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.270
 here the whole story started then if 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.660
 they want to find it is right here and 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.910
 look 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.770
 Now I'm going to show you ok and not 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.119
 We have already seen it, they saw it 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.190
 I wanted you to see it but look like that 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.140
 manages to put such what is called is age of a 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.090
 see, let's put them on like that and look what 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.460
 that we are going to put it just like that and look 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.260
 right next to you will see the image that was 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.640
 as big cautious 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.800
 the first milestone that came out is going to 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.170
 put what the letters are doing 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.980
 and see that the source is the same 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.750
 colors is the same then this game 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.700
 it was changing a lot over time 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.710
 because the first one you saw from a 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.510
 panorama so in fact you saw it like that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.700
 that's how you saw your dummy running and everything 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.590
 as if you were in a helicopter outside 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.320
 as a fourth person because if the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.080
 big car we have today is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.490
 third person this was like my fifth 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.990
 person because seriously what they from 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.790
 up in fact more or less so that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.160
 make a perspective I'm going to leave you 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.880
 also next on the screen I'm going to 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.260
 put 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 right now they will be seeing an image of 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.340
 how big was one missing or so that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.530
 see how it looked like from above 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.390
 the graphics were not good because it's not 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.280
 then the good so good graphics that 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.530
 yes let me tell you that the driver of that 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.110
 so that was a game more or less 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.170
 of the style he had good graphics for his 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.110
 so then it's something that to me 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.760
 liked this game actually came out in 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.770
 playstation one was not much of my time 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.510
 because I 'm not anymore I do not have 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.880
 twenty-something years then there are people who 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.380
 you can more of your time then the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.740
 which they were of their time they enjoyed 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.830
 what 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.960
 the time of the trilogy grand theft 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.490
 auto also san andrÃ©s and all that but 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.890
 the truth was a very good game indeed 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.020
 there is one as a recreation of what is going 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.810
 doing great fauto one that is about 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.460
 of big faudel chinatown wars ok east 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.890
 game that you will also be seeing in 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.360
 screen had the same type of camera 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.010
 because you saw it as well as from a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.170
 fifth perspective a fifth person 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.670
 that you saw it from above was a great 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.710
 perspective of fact this game was 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.270
 for nintendo ds and the truth to me 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.570
 quite like the genius apart from that 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.180
 how I had the game so I had it right 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.340
 modified with invincibility and everything 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.290
 then it was very funny in that game 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.410
 I know that maybe more people if I play it 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.390
 because it was already a best-selling game that 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.490
 what was great one missed to say it 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.860
 well because the big picture one was his 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.330
 first game of what was this saga and 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.180
 it was a great hit right now what 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.070
 we see the game that best hits the one that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.740
 more hit was great photo san andreas 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.960
 made here in mexico I know a lot 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.330
 people who say they still buy me the exam 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.950
 35 I say like san andreas 56 and it's 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.990
 pretty funny and so it does not have 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.220
 nothing to see but then here is what 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.140
 is doing this story 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.560
 but enjoy it the truth is something 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.960
 well what the rockstar company 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.280
 he remembers his old games and they 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.110
 make references to them then 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.820
