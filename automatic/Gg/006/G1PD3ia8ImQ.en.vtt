00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.810
 on youtube I bought this super game 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:08.810
 nintendo in 60 pesos that did not work 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.889
 the terms are seen on the screen no no 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.889
 nothing happens 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.449
 do not try to clean it and it did not work 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.939
 I go to their youtube ones how 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.840
 repair it and out there I found some 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 then I'm going to what I'm going to try to repair 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.220
 uncover the game with the old trick of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.970
 the pen 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.810
 clean I tried to clean them the connectors 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.400
 of these 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.400
 and I do not hold 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.010
 I do not have any knowledge I do not know 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 absolutely nothing about electronics what 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.890
 he says it's a bit of basic diversity 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.000
 then a multimeter happens I put it in 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 the resistance and check what it is that 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.199
 there would be continuity from here to the point to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.380
 where they connect up here 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.130
 and I started to check all one by one and 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.540
 I found out there 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.540
 one that is damaged 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.070
 one that is like 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 how broken 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 and looks 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.260
 then in the video he said that with a 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.550
 piece of 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:34.360
 of wire with a thread of these I went 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:38.830
 I bought a soldering iron solder 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.710
 and 12 a sandpaper of 1000 make this 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.930
 green part and that will be watched the part 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:50.050
 where is it where they miss then then 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.700
 to see if not if now it spoiled the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.960
 game but with a cost of 60 Persian 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.229
 then it will not earn me so much 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.670
 I will try to solder the bit of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.320
 wire to join here to see if it works 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.080
 well after a few hours of trying 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.080
 They are giving you a piece of 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.510
 a little thread of this cable and learn to 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.120
 use the soldering iron 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.850
 I could not do everything I did was to put 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.130
 just a droplet of solder 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.460
 to join here the part where I was 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.460
 broken 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.959
 and I put the droplet 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.010
 is here I put the droplet 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.659
 perform the continuity and if the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.049
 continuity of these areas around here like this 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.870
 the point can not be removed because 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.000
 I can use both hands to record 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.670
 we are going to make an opening , we are going to set it, not to see 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.810
 yes 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.810
 that's how it works 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.519
 Y 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.599
 and if it worked 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.599
 yeah 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.510
 good no more now for 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.540
 show gave me to see that in 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.480
 videos from youtube tutorials if 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.480
 they work and if they help thank you
