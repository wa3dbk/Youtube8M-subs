sending in loves indoor positioning via
an<00:00:07.710> API<00:00:08.280> rather<00:00:08.790> than<00:00:09.090> calculating<00:00:10.019> it

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
an API rather than calculating it

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.640 
an API rather than calculating it
locally<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.450> my<00:00:12.450> solo<00:00:12.719> maps<00:00:13.019> as<00:00:13.200> well

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
locally and my solo maps as well

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.680 
locally and my solo maps as well
those<00:00:14.519> guys<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:14.940> created<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> map<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.450> this

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
those guys have created a map of this

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.260 
those guys have created a map of this
mall<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.289> me<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:17.400> I've<00:00:17.580> picked<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.000> -<00:00:18.119> it

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
mall for me and I've picked it - it

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.200 
mall for me and I've picked it - it
could<00:00:19.260> go<00:00:19.380> decent<00:00:19.770> user<00:00:20.550> experience

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
could go decent user experience

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.720 
could go decent user experience
elevation<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> map<00:00:22.800> rather<00:00:23.430> than

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
elevation so this is the map rather than

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.939 
elevation so this is the map rather than
just<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.300> PNG<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.050> floor<00:00:25.500> plan<00:00:25.680> something

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
just a PNG of a floor plan something

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.269 
just a PNG of a floor plan something
like<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.330> this<00:00:27.359> re-renders<00:00:28.320> itself<00:00:28.650> very

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
like that this re-renders itself very

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.769 
like that this re-renders itself very
zoom<00:00:29.490> level<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.300> see<00:00:30.330> as<00:00:30.510> they're<00:00:30.630> going

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
zoom level you can see as they're going

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.959 

this<00:01:35.719> is<00:01:35.840> part<00:01:36.079> of<00:01:36.109> my<00:01:36.590> solo<00:01:37.149> SDK<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:39.729> see<00:01:40.729> it's

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
this is part of my solo SDK and see it's

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.580 
this is part of my solo SDK and see it's
popped<00:01:41.179> a<00:01:41.270> root<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.659> there<00:01:41.810> for<00:01:42.020> me<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:42.289> show<00:01:42.560> me

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
popped a root on there for me so show me

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.919 
popped a root on there for me so show me
the<00:01:42.770> best<00:01:42.920> way<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.130> get<00:01:43.369> there<00:01:43.659> I'll<00:01:44.659> be<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
the best way to get there I'll be the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.419 
the best way to get there I'll be the
rocket<00:01:45.229> science<00:01:45.500> in<00:01:45.619> here<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.189> get<00:01:46.340> the

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
rocket science in here but you get the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.770 
rocket science in here but you get the
idea<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.829> will<00:01:49.219> walk<00:01:49.759> that<00:01:50.000> way<00:01:50.149> now<00:01:50.359> and

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
idea and so I will walk that way now and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.319 
idea and so I will walk that way now and
let's<00:01:51.590> see<00:01:51.799> if<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.369> blue<00:01:52.549> dot<00:01:52.789> keeps<00:01:53.030> up<00:01:53.179> for

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
let's see if the blue dot keeps up for

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.120 
let's see if the blue dot keeps up for
me<00:01:53.450> how<00:01:53.959> long<00:01:54.079> no<00:01:56.289> I'm<00:01:57.289> not<00:01:57.439> good<00:01:57.560> at<00:01:57.649> censoring

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
me how long no I'm not good at censoring

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.740 
me how long no I'm not good at censoring
up<00:01:58.219> or<00:01:58.369> anything<00:01:58.549> else<00:01:58.819> after<00:01:58.969> keep<00:01:59.299> moving<00:01:59.659> my

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
up or anything else after keep moving my

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:22.980 
up or anything else after keep moving my
thumb<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.459> one<00:02:01.459> of<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.609> week

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.950 

by<00:02:23.560> now<00:02:23.740> famous<00:02:24.240> corridors<00:02:25.240> with<00:02:25.450> bushes<00:02:25.690> at

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
by now famous corridors with bushes at

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.130 
by now famous corridors with bushes at
the<00:02:26.080> end<00:02:26.200> as<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.160> can<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.520> on<00:02:27.700> there<00:02:27.990> that's<00:02:28.990> a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the end as you can see on there that's a

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.520 
the end as you can see on there that's a
little<00:02:29.290> over<00:02:29.500> there

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.400 

so<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.340> math<00:02:33.490> after<00:02:33.880> all<00:02:34.230> there's<00:02:35.230> another

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
so on the math after all there's another

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.320 
so on the math after all there's another
one<00:02:35.940> there<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.920> dark<00:02:39.880> grey<00:02:40.090> line

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
one there that is the dark grey line

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.349 
one there that is the dark grey line
headed<00:02:40.660> image<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.200> no<00:02:41.730> good<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:42.910> far

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:03:38.040 

coming<00:02:48.359> up<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.099> bendy

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.500 

okay<00:03:38.350> for<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.830> next<00:03:39.370> bend<00:03:40.000> run<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.390> left

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
okay for the next bend run to the left

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:55.869 
okay for the next bend run to the left
now<00:03:41.070> yeah<00:03:42.070> pretty<00:03:42.520> much<00:03:42.660> on<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.810> apex

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:05.470 

and<00:03:56.239> go<00:03:56.390> around<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.719> the<00:03:56.840> right

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.410 

it's<00:04:05.780> down<00:04:05.959> here

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
it's down here

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.420 
it's down here
should<00:04:07.720> be<00:04:07.930> suit<00:04:08.170> direct

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430
