discuss and decide on and realize that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.310 
discuss and decide on and realize that
we<00:01:28.770> all<00:01:28.920> had<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> agree<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:30.810> know<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:30.990> tell<00:01:31.170> me

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
we all had to agree you know and tell me

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.840 
we all had to agree you know and tell me
tell<00:01:31.799> us<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.220> about<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> pickups

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
tell us a little bit about the pickups

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.870 
tell us a little bit about the pickups
in<00:01:33.000> sure<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.170> way<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.409> works<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
in sure the way it works is this is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.450 
in sure the way it works is this is
wider<00:01:36.270> than<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> humbucking<00:01:37.079> actually<00:01:38.070> what's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
wider than a humbucking actually what's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.780 
wider than a humbucking actually what's
interesting<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:40.619> looks<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> blackberry

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.310 

this<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.939> wider<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.630> narrower<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
this is wider and this is narrower so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.899 
this is wider and this is narrower so
that<00:01:46.470> she<00:01:46.649> ain't<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:46.950> they're<00:01:47.310> sensing<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that she ain't there they're sensing a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
that she ain't there they're sensing a
different<00:01:48.240> length<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.570> string<00:01:48.840> when<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.770> hit

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
different length of string when you hit

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.920 
different length of string when you hit
one<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.340> switches<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.119> disconnects

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
one of these switches it disconnects

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.960 
one of these switches it disconnects
this<00:01:52.110> coil<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.680> then<00:01:52.860> adds<00:01:53.070> turns<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.759> it's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
this coil and then adds turns so it's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
this coil and then adds turns so it's
not<00:01:54.180> an<00:01:54.420> anemic<00:01:54.899> single<00:01:55.259> coil<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.649> real<00:01:55.860> one

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
not an anemic single coil as a real one

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.190 
not an anemic single coil as a real one
so<00:01:56.700> when<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> turn<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> change<00:01:57.990> volume

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so when you turn it just a change volume

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
so when you turn it just a change volume
it<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.649> change<00:01:58.890> his<00:01:59.070> tone<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.060> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
it just change his tone and so this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
it just change his tone and so this
one's<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.750> pickup<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.350> one's<00:02:01.560> for

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
one's for this pickup and this one's for

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.080 
one's for this pickup and this one's for
this<00:02:01.860> pickup<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> guitar<00:02:02.520> gets<00:02:02.909> eight

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
this pickup so the guitar gets eight

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.899 
this pickup so the guitar gets eight
tones<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.780> then<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.860> use<00:02:05.610> different

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
tones and then as you use different

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.969 
tones and then as you use different
variances<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> volume<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.170> tone<00:02:07.409> control

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
variances of the volume and tone control

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.660 
variances of the volume and tone control
there's<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.399> almost<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.819> limit<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.300> minim

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
there's like almost a limit on the minim

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.089 
there's like almost a limit on the minim
sounds<00:02:10.179> we<00:02:10.630> made<00:02:10.929> eight<00:02:11.170> prototypes<00:02:11.500> and

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
sounds we made eight prototypes and

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.110 
sounds we made eight prototypes and
there<00:02:12.250> were<00:02:12.310> lots<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.730> things<00:02:12.910> about<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
there were lots of things about the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.660 
there were lots of things about the
prototypes<00:02:13.599> we<00:02:13.750> all<00:02:14.340> universally<00:02:15.340> didn't

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
prototypes we all universally didn't

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.100 
prototypes we all universally didn't
like<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.330> what<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.630> ended<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:16.930> being

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
like and this is what it ended up being

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.740 
like and this is what it ended up being
me<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.760> guess<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> collective<00:02:19.300> effort<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.630> that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
me I guess a collective effort of that

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.150 
me I guess a collective effort of that
many<00:02:19.930> people<00:02:20.140> has<00:02:20.380> got<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.709> produce<00:02:20.950> something

about this particular instrument let's

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.069 
about this particular instrument let's
go<00:03:12.670> out<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.970> high<00:03:13.120> end<00:03:13.450> it's<00:03:13.720> got<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> lot<00:03:14.049> of

go out of high end it's got a lot of

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.990 
go out of high end it's got a lot of
basis<00:03:14.530> more<00:03:14.739> spread<00:03:15.130> out<00:03:15.160> than<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.609> normal

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
basis more spread out than a normal

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.090 
basis more spread out than a normal
guitar<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.480> doesn't<00:03:16.810> sound<00:03:17.049> like<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.500> strat<00:03:17.920> it

doesn't sound like a Pelle it doesn't
sound<00:03:19.390> like<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.630> PRS<00:03:20.079> it<00:03:20.230> doesn't<00:03:20.560> sound<00:03:20.739> like<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
sound like a PRS it doesn't sound like a

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.569 
sound like a PRS it doesn't sound like a
Gibson<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.590> doesn't<00:03:23.890> sound<00:03:24.070> like<00:03:24.280> any<00:03:24.430> that

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
Gibson it doesn't sound like any that

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.479 
Gibson it doesn't sound like any that
it's<00:03:24.700> got<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.850> new<00:03:25.120> tone<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.870> there's<00:03:26.380> a

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
it's got a new tone and there's a

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.680 
it's got a new tone and there's a
surprising<00:03:27.489> amount<00:03:27.609> of<00:03:27.850> bass<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.329> high-end

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
surprising amount of bass and high-end

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.800 
surprising amount of bass and high-end
that's<00:03:29.200> normally<00:03:29.950> would<00:03:30.790> be<00:03:30.970> harsh<00:03:31.299> sounding

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
that's normally would be harsh sounding

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.990 
that's normally would be harsh sounding
but<00:03:31.959> somehow<00:03:32.290> its<00:03:32.680> musical<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.519> we<00:03:33.670> know<00:03:33.850> the

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
but somehow its musical and we know the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.920 
but somehow its musical and we know the
physics<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.480> what<00:03:34.660> happened<00:03:35.140> but<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:35.440> happy

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
physics of what happened but it's happy

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.150 
physics of what happened but it's happy

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
so now we're gonna actually get to hear

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.430 
so now we're gonna actually get to hear
how<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:39.489> baby<00:03:39.549> sounds<00:03:39.850> right<00:03:40.359> sure<00:03:40.780> why<00:03:40.810> not
