00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and this is a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.590 
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and this is a
fantastic<00:00:49.589> phone<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> best<00:00:50.699> one<00:00:50.909> samsung<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
fantastic phone the best one samsung is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.660 
fantastic phone the best one samsung is
made<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.799> let's<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.400> how<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
made as of now and let's see how the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.810 
made as of now and let's see how the
iphone<00:00:54.119> 6<00:00:54.390> stacks<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:55.049> against<00:00:55.470> it<00:00:55.619> so<00:00:56.159> because

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
iphone 6 stacks up against it so because

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.579 
iphone 6 stacks up against it so because
it<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> phablet<00:00:57.629> let's<00:00:57.900> begin<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
it is a phablet let's begin with the

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.520 
it is a phablet let's begin with the
display<00:00:59.010> size<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> iphone<00:01:00.510> 6<00:01:00.780> has<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.140> size

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
display size so the iphone 6 has a size

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.759 
display size so the iphone 6 has a size
of<00:01:01.799> 5.5<00:01:02.640> inches<00:01:03.059> meanwhile<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.229> note<00:01:04.500> either

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
of 5.5 inches meanwhile the note either

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.310 
of 5.5 inches meanwhile the note either
display<00:01:05.189> size<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.820> five<00:01:06.270> point<00:01:06.570> seven<00:01:06.840> inches

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
display size of five point seven inches

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320 
display size of five point seven inches
so<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> note<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.430> point<00:01:08.760> two<00:01:08.820> inches<00:01:09.299> above

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
so the note is point two inches above

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
so the note is point two inches above
that<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.200> iphone<00:01:10.560> 6<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.460> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that of the iphone 6 and that is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.550 
that of the iphone 6 and that is
definitely<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.479> come<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.750> handy<00:01:12.960> while

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
definitely going to come in handy while

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.260 
definitely going to come in handy while
watching<00:01:14.040> movies<00:01:14.369> playing<00:01:14.760> games<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
watching movies playing games and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
watching movies playing games and
browsing<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> web<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:21.320> but<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.470> let's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
browsing the web and so on but now let's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440 
browsing the web and so on but now let's
move<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> resolution<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> these

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
move on to the resolution of these

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.260 
move on to the resolution of these
phones<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.800> iPhone<00:01:26.130> 6<00:01:26.490> has<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.760> panel

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
phones so with the iPhone 6 has a panel

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.380 
phones so with the iPhone 6 has a panel
at<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.660> 1920<00:01:28.440> x<00:01:28.590> 1080<00:01:28.770> p<00:01:29.250> giving<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:30.030> pixel

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
at is 1920 x 1080 p giving it a pixel

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.990 
at is 1920 x 1080 p giving it a pixel
density<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.840> 401<00:01:31.830> which<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.460> definitely<00:01:32.880> not

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
density of 401 which is definitely not

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.240 
density of 401 which is definitely not
bad<00:01:33.300> but<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.170> looking<00:01:34.409> at<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> note<00:01:34.890> which

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
bad but when looking at the note which

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
bad but when looking at the note which
is<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.610> phones<00:01:35.880> competition<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> not

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
is this phones competition it is not

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.890 
is this phones competition it is not
even<00:01:37.590> close<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> notes<00:01:39.090> panel<00:01:39.630> is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
even close because the notes panel is

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.940 
even close because the notes panel is
2560<00:01:40.800> x<00:01:41.190> 1440<00:01:41.730> giving<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> massive<00:01:43.350> pixel

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
2560 x 1440 giving it to a massive pixel

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.570 
2560 x 1440 giving it to a massive pixel
density<00:01:44.370> of<00:01:45.020> 515<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.650> i<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.190> can<00:01:47.310> easily

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
density of 515 so i think we can easily

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.090 
density of 515 so i think we can easily
say<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.330> note<00:01:48.510> 4<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.260> best<00:01:49.530> phablet

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
say that the note 4 is the best phablet

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.860 
say that the note 4 is the best phablet
when<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> comes<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> mini<00:01:50.880> display<00:01:51.240> both<00:01:51.659> in

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
when it comes to mini display both in

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.350 
when it comes to mini display both in
size<00:01:52.080> and<00:01:52.140> resolution<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.250> once<00:01:53.880> again<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
size and resolution and once again that

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.030 
size and resolution and once again that
is<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.540> big<00:01:54.840> deal<00:01:55.080> because<00:01:55.260> when<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> comes<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
is a big deal because when it comes to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.190 
is a big deal because when it comes to
phablets<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:57.030> biggest<00:01:57.479> selling<00:01:57.780> point<00:01:58.050> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
phablets the biggest selling point of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.469 
phablets the biggest selling point of
the<00:01:58.409> phone<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.370> display<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.180> that's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the phone is the display because that's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.899 
the phone is the display because that's
why<00:02:00.690> you're<00:02:00.900> buying<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.229> phablet<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.640> note

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
why you're buying a phablet and the note

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.899 
why you're buying a phablet and the note
does<00:02:03.299> pull<00:02:03.570> ahead<00:02:03.690> in<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.260> section<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.430> next

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
does pull ahead in this section so next

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.149 
does pull ahead in this section so next
up<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> build<00:02:06.870> quality<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.590> these<00:02:07.799> phones

between<00:05:38.150> one<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.570> two<00:05:39.020> gigabytes<00:05:39.470> of<00:05:39.650> ram<00:05:39.920> but

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
between one and two gigabytes of ram but

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.610 
between one and two gigabytes of ram but
you<00:05:40.700> guys<00:05:40.880> want<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.240> know<00:05:41.390> what<00:05:41.960> exactly<00:05:41.990> does

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
you guys want to know what exactly does

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.190 
you guys want to know what exactly does
all<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:42.980> mean<00:05:43.250> so<00:05:44.000> in<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.270> past<00:05:44.450> basically

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
all that mean so in the past basically

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.140 
all that mean so in the past basically
all<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.590> iphones<00:05:46.040> and<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.400> samsung<00:05:46.850> phones

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
all the iphones and the samsung phones

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.120 
all the iphones and the samsung phones
have<00:05:47.720> been<00:05:47.960> about<00:05:48.200> even<00:05:48.620> when<00:05:48.770> it<00:05:48.860> comes<00:05:49.010> to

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
have been about even when it comes to

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.860 
have been about even when it comes to
speed<00:05:49.430> even<00:05:49.910> though<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.210> specs<00:05:50.510> are<00:05:50.660> quite

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
speed even though the specs are quite

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.810 
speed even though the specs are quite
different<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:51.410> that<00:05:51.890> is<00:05:52.010> what<00:05:52.220> i<00:05:52.250> expect

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
different and that is what i expect

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.790 
different and that is what i expect
these<00:05:52.970> phones<00:05:53.210> to<00:05:53.300> be<00:05:53.510> like<00:05:53.720> so<00:05:54.320> even<00:05:54.620> though

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
these phones to be like so even though

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.560 
these phones to be like so even though
they<00:05:54.980> have<00:05:55.160> extremely<00:05:55.640> different<00:05:55.910> chipsets

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
they have extremely different chipsets

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.690 
they have extremely different chipsets
the<00:05:57.110> overall<00:05:57.560> speed<00:05:57.890> is<00:05:58.100> going<00:05:58.370> to<00:05:58.460> be<00:05:58.580> about

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
the overall speed is going to be about

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.390 
the overall speed is going to be about
the<00:05:59.000> same<00:05:59.240> now<00:05:59.930> the<00:05:59.990> last<00:06:00.530> thing<00:06:00.740> that<00:06:00.950> I<00:06:01.190> want

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
the same now the last thing that I want

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.730 
the same now the last thing that I want
to<00:06:01.460> talk<00:06:01.610> about<00:06:01.760> is<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.540> battery<00:06:02.960> capacity<00:06:03.560> on

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
to talk about is the battery capacity on

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.710 
to talk about is the battery capacity on
these<00:06:03.950> phones<00:06:04.160> because<00:06:04.640> all<00:06:05.000> of<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.270> things<00:06:05.480> I

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
these phones because all of the things I

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.630 
these phones because all of the things I
just<00:06:05.990> talked<00:06:06.200> about<00:06:06.350> is<00:06:06.740> completely<00:06:07.370> useless

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
just talked about is completely useless

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.570 
just talked about is completely useless
if<00:06:08.150> your<00:06:08.540> phone<00:06:08.780> is<00:06:08.810> dead<00:06:09.110> so<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.950> iphone<00:06:10.250> 6

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
if your phone is dead so the iphone 6

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.440 
if your phone is dead so the iphone 6
plus<00:06:10.670> has<00:06:11.210> a<00:06:11.240> battery<00:06:11.570> capacity<00:06:12.200> of<00:06:13.450> 2915

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
plus has a battery capacity of 2915

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.300 
plus has a battery capacity of 2915
milliamps<00:06:15.020> which<00:06:15.500> is<00:06:15.650> definitely<00:06:16.040> a<00:06:16.100> high

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
milliamps which is definitely a high

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.550 
milliamps which is definitely a high
capacity<00:06:16.940> but<00:06:17.360> in<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:17.630> note<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:18.170> battery

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
capacity but in the note the battery

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.390 
capacity but in the note the battery
capacity<00:06:19.100> is<00:06:20.050> 3220<00:06:21.050> milliamps<00:06:21.620> and<00:06:21.890> that<00:06:22.190> is<00:06:22.280> a

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
capacity is 3220 milliamps and that is a

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.820 
capacity is 3220 milliamps and that is a
difference<00:06:22.850> of<00:06:22.970> about<00:06:23.150> 300<00:06:24.140> milliamps<00:06:24.440> and

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
difference of about 300 milliamps and

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.370 
difference of about 300 milliamps and
honestly<00:06:25.520> speaking<00:06:25.880> that<00:06:26.450> definitely<00:06:26.960> can

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
honestly speaking that definitely can

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.530 
honestly speaking that definitely can
make<00:06:27.650> a<00:06:27.680> big<00:06:27.980> impact<00:06:28.190> on<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:28.790> battery<00:06:29.150> life<00:06:29.330> of

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
make a big impact on the battery life of

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.990 
make a big impact on the battery life of
the<00:06:29.660> phone<00:06:29.900> so<00:06:30.560> once<00:06:30.800> again<00:06:30.950> the<00:06:31.370> note<00:06:31.610> does

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
the phone so once again the note does

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.270 
the phone so once again the note does
have<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.480> advantage<00:06:32.740> so<00:06:33.740> let<00:06:33.920> me<00:06:33.950> know<00:06:34.160> what

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
have the advantage so let me know what

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.680 
have the advantage so let me know what
