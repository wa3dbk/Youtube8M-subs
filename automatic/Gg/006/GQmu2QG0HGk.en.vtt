definitely<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.700> lot<00:02:42.790> more<00:02:42.819> somber<00:02:43.390> than

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
definitely a lot more somber than

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.580 
definitely a lot more somber than
anything<00:02:43.690> we've<00:02:43.930> done<00:02:43.959> before<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.530> that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
anything we've done before is that

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.510 
anything we've done before is that
consciousness<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.370> from<00:02:45.580> your<00:02:45.730> past<00:02:47.489> while<00:02:48.489> I

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
consciousness is from your past while I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.370 
consciousness is from your past while I
read<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.819> script<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.239> it<00:02:49.360> was<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:50.200> was<00:02:50.349> a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
read the script and it was it was a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.050 
read the script and it was it was a
little<00:02:50.590> bit<00:02:50.739> more<00:02:50.830> somber<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.430> recognize

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
little bit more somber but I recognize

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.520 
little bit more somber but I recognize
there<00:02:52.270> was<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.390> great<00:02:52.810> opportunity<00:02:52.930> here<00:02:53.470> to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
there was a great opportunity here to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.309 
there was a great opportunity here to
play<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.739> character<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.360> not<00:02:55.360> no<00:02:55.959> one<00:02:56.110> would

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
play a character that not no one would

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.080 
play a character that not no one would
really<00:02:56.470> expect<00:02:56.890> as<00:02:57.310> opposed<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.700> some<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
really expect as opposed to some of the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.240 
really expect as opposed to some of the
other<00:02:58.209> things<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.410> were<00:02:59.770> fairly

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
other things that were fairly

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.910 
other things that were fairly
predictable<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:02.530> might<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:02.770> thought

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
predictable and you might have thought

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.699 
predictable and you might have thought
would<00:03:03.040> have<00:03:03.160> been<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.340> exact<00:03:03.670> right<00:03:04.709> seems

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
would have been the exact right seems

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.860 
would have been the exact right seems
less<00:03:05.890> interesting<00:03:06.370> than<00:03:06.400> try<00:03:07.209> trying

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
less interesting than try trying

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.200 
less interesting than try trying
something<00:03:08.050> new
