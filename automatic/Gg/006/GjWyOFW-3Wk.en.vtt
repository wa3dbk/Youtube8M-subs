00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
save and you'll quit now what this does

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.630 
save and you'll quit now what this does
is<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:29.970> gives<00:00:30.510> me<00:00:30.570> plus<00:00:30.869> 0.2<00:00:31.650> 3<00:00:31.920> mana<00:00:32.130> regen

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
is this gives me plus 0.2 3 mana regen

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150 
is this gives me plus 0.2 3 mana regen
per<00:00:33.000> five<00:00:33.329> seconds<00:00:33.899> regardless<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:34.950> level

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
per five seconds regardless of my level

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 
per five seconds regardless of my level
so<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.700> gives<00:00:35.940> me<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.329> advantage<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.230> can

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
so that gives me an advantage as you can

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.930 
so that gives me an advantage as you can
see<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.890> only<00:00:38.100> advantage<00:00:38.489> you'd<00:00:38.730> get

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
see this is the only advantage you'd get

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.389 
see this is the only advantage you'd get
if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> came<00:00:39.329> across<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> level<00:00:39.930> 30<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:41.070> game

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
if you came across a level 30 in game

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.100 
if you came across a level 30 in game
they<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.450> rune<00:00:42.750> trees

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
they would have all these rune trees

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.290 
they would have all these rune trees
unlocked<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.219> different<00:00:44.520> runes

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
unlocked with all these different runes

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.690 
unlocked with all these different runes
and<00:00:45.570> stuff<00:00:45.870> placed<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.379> them<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.340> they'll<00:00:47.489> have

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
and stuff placed in them so they'll have

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.940 
and stuff placed in them so they'll have
more<00:00:48.000> mana<00:00:48.239> regen<00:00:48.719> more<00:00:49.020> cool<00:00:49.289> down<00:00:49.500> regen<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
more mana regen more cool down regen and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.590 
more mana regen more cool down regen and
stuff<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.030> does<00:00:51.210> give<00:00:51.360> them<00:00:51.510> an

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
stuff like that so it does give them an

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.049 
stuff like that so it does give them an
advantage<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.250> completely

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
advantage because these are completely

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
advantage because these are completely
unobtainable<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.780> you're<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> lower<00:00:55.140> level<00:00:55.320> now
