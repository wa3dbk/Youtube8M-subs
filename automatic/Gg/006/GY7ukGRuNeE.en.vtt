and pause and then if I need to I'll
take<00:03:34.140> my<00:03:34.290> shot<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.280> really<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:35.580> comes<00:03:35.880> up

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
take my shot so really just comes up

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.570 
take my shot so really just comes up
with<00:03:36.239> practice<00:03:36.660> guys<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.220> killstreaks<00:03:38.220> is

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
with practice guys and killstreaks is

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.250 
with practice guys and killstreaks is
really<00:03:38.850> not<00:03:38.970> important<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.600> just<00:03:39.630> depends<00:03:40.170> on

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
really not important it just depends on

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.890 
really not important it just depends on
whatever<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.620> run<00:03:40.830> run<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.780> equipment<00:03:42.780> is

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
whatever you run run and equipment is

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.300 
whatever you run run and equipment is
really<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.260> same<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.709> checked<00:03:43.890> on<00:03:44.040> throwing

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
really the same so I checked on throwing

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.580 
really the same so I checked on throwing
knife<00:03:44.520> just<00:03:44.790> because<00:03:45.300> yeah<00:03:46.050> I<00:03:46.080> like<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.500> have

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
knife just because yeah I like to have

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.199 
knife just because yeah I like to have
the<00:03:46.680> throw<00:03:46.860> enough<00:03:47.100> on<00:03:47.250> when<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.459> snap<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.970> think

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
the throw enough on when I snap I think

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.580 
the throw enough on when I snap I think
it<00:03:48.330> makes<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> little<00:03:49.350> bit<00:03:49.470> more

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
it makes it that just a little bit more

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.580 
it makes it that just a little bit more
cool<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.070> just<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:51.360> little<00:03:51.450> bit<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.260> pointer

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
cool and just a little bit of a pointer

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.900 
cool and just a little bit of a pointer
out<00:03:52.680> guys<00:03:52.860> if<00:03:53.130> you're<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.310> sniper<00:03:53.580> in<00:03:53.730> you're<00:03:53.880> a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
out guys if you're a sniper in you're a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.010 
out guys if you're a sniper in you're a
bit<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.150> Scouts<00:03:54.420> night<00:03:54.630> but<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:54.989> a

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
bit of a Scouts night but this is a

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.560 
bit of a Scouts night but this is a
pretty<00:03:55.170> good<00:03:55.350> spot<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.800> sit<00:03:56.190> if<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.360> want<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
pretty good spot to sit if you want to

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.600 
pretty good spot to sit if you want to
watch<00:03:57.780> spawn<00:03:58.200> because<00:03:58.470> there<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> spawn<00:03:59.430> if

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
watch spawn because there is a spawn if

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.160 
watch spawn because there is a spawn if
your<00:03:59.760> teammates<00:04:00.180> are<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.360> downside<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.840> peace

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
your teammates are a downside to peace

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.229 
your teammates are a downside to peace
if<00:04:01.350> your<00:04:01.920> teammates<00:04:02.370> are<00:04:02.550> down<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:02.850> side<00:04:03.090> of

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
if your teammates are down this side of

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.300 
if your teammates are down this side of
the<00:04:03.390> map<00:04:03.570> um<00:04:03.840> most<00:04:04.500> likely<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.890> other<00:04:05.070> team<00:04:05.220> is

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
the map um most likely the other team is

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.470 
the map um most likely the other team is
going<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.610> rushing<00:04:05.880> down<00:04:06.030> from<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.300> end

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
going to be rushing down from that end

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.940 
going to be rushing down from that end
so<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:07.110> see<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.290> pick<00:04:07.530> up<00:04:07.650> my<00:04:07.770> killstreaks

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
so you see that pick up my killstreaks

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.729 
so you see that pick up my killstreaks
pretty<00:04:08.340> fast<00:04:08.580> here<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.410> predators<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.500> always

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
pretty fast here and predators is always

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.410 
pretty fast here and predators is always
a<00:04:10.769> good<00:04:10.980> one<00:04:11.190> or<00:04:11.370> UAV<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:12.000> run<00:04:12.120> when<00:04:12.300> you're

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
a good one or UAV to run when you're

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.030 
a good one or UAV to run when you're
sniping<00:04:12.600> just<00:04:12.989> depends<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.530> how<00:04:13.709> far<00:04:13.920> you

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
sniping just depends on how far you

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.590 
sniping just depends on how far you
think<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.489> get<00:04:14.640> with<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:14.910> sniper<00:04:15.120> rifle

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
think you can get with the sniper rifle

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.599 
think you can get with the sniper rifle
she's<00:04:16.080> really<00:04:16.290> does<00:04:16.709> depend<00:04:16.890> on<00:04:17.220> your<00:04:17.400> own

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
she's really does depend on your own

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.020 
she's really does depend on your own
like<00:04:18.299> skill<00:04:18.780> level<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.650> how<00:04:20.459> comfortable<00:04:20.700> you

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
like skill level and how comfortable you

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.730 
like skill level and how comfortable you
are<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.479> just<00:04:21.720> really<00:04:21.930> depends<00:04:22.169> on<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.470> so

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
are it just really depends on that so

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.379 
are it just really depends on that so
don't<00:04:23.430> be<00:04:23.520> putting<00:04:23.789> on<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.910> really<00:04:24.180> really

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
don't be putting on the really really

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.939 
don't be putting on the really really
high<00:04:24.599> killstreaks<00:04:24.840> because<00:04:25.470> that's<00:04:25.740> sort<00:04:25.860> of

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
high killstreaks because that's sort of

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.140 
high killstreaks because that's sort of
silly<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.250> don't<00:04:26.460> think<00:04:26.580> you're<00:04:26.669> going<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.090> see

but I'm my little turret thing is going

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.480 
but I'm my little turret thing is going

to pick up the last two kills here just

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.570 
to pick up the last two kills here just
because<00:06:17.639> it's<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:17.940> little<00:06:18.620> no<00:06:19.620> it's<00:06:19.770> beast<00:06:20.280> of<00:06:20.490> a

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
because it's a little no it's beast of a

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.820 
because it's a little no it's beast of a
thing<00:06:20.789> I'm<00:06:20.969> contact<00:06:21.930> bullets<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:22.469> I'm<00:06:22.560> pretty

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
thing I'm contact bullets and I'm pretty

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.320 
thing I'm contact bullets and I'm pretty
sure<00:06:22.919> that<00:06:23.190> eventually<00:06:23.669> it<00:06:23.849> can<00:06:24.030> get<00:06:24.090> shot

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
sure that eventually it can get shot

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.550 
sure that eventually it can get shot
down<00:06:24.360> after<00:06:24.810> takes<00:06:24.990> a<00:06:25.080> certain<00:06:25.259> amount<00:06:25.349> of

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
down after takes a certain amount of

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.920 
down after takes a certain amount of
damage<00:06:25.860> but<00:06:26.090> this<00:06:27.090> kill<00:06:27.330> streak<00:06:27.539> i<00:06:27.630> think<00:06:27.840> is

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
damage but this kill streak i think is

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.120 
damage but this kill streak i think is
pretty<00:06:28.080> good<00:06:28.289> for<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.469> tenth<00:06:28.620> kill<00:06:28.800> streak<00:06:29.039> i

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
pretty good for a tenth kill streak i

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.700 
pretty good for a tenth kill streak i
think<00:06:29.340> you<00:06:29.400> go<00:06:29.789> on<00:06:30.090> quite<00:06:30.389> a<00:06:30.419> tear<00:06:30.719> actually

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
think you go on quite a tear actually

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.290 
think you go on quite a tear actually
because<00:06:32.010> it<00:06:32.130> is<00:06:32.400> a<00:06:32.430> high-powered<00:06:32.940> gun<00:06:33.150> it's

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
because it is a high-powered gun it's

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.209 
because it is a high-powered gun it's
got<00:06:33.419> a<00:06:33.449> pretty<00:06:33.659> high-caliber<00:06:34.020> thing<00:06:34.469> so<00:06:34.740> if
