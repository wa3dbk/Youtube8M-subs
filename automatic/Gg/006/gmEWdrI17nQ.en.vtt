I found that it actually works out quite
well<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.450> way<00:04:02.569> because<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.959> forces<00:04:03.290> all<00:04:03.560> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
well that way because it forces all the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.129 
well that way because it forces all the
players<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.670> not<00:04:04.819> worry<00:04:05.269> about<00:04:05.630> all<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:05.900> that

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
players to not worry about all of that

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.259 
players to not worry about all of that

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
secondary role playing type stuff and

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.759 
secondary role playing type stuff and
just<00:04:08.389> focus<00:04:08.720> on<00:04:08.900> being<00:04:09.169> good<00:04:09.560> at<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
just focus on being good at the

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.520 
just focus on being good at the
objectives<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.579> shooting<00:04:11.329> after<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.319> few

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
objectives and shooting after a few

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.610 
objectives and shooting after a few
hours<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.859> that<00:04:13.040> then<00:04:13.370> maybe<00:04:13.730> you're<00:04:14.060> ready<00:04:14.269> to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
hours of that then maybe you're ready to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.870 
hours of that then maybe you're ready to
occasionally<00:04:15.620> use<00:04:15.829> the<00:04:16.010> medic<00:04:16.340> gun<00:04:16.609> or

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
occasionally use the medic gun or

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.000 
occasionally use the medic gun or
occasionally<00:04:17.570> equip<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:17.989> shotgun<00:04:18.560> instead<00:04:18.829> of

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
occasionally equip a shotgun instead of

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.310 
occasionally equip a shotgun instead of
an<00:04:19.099> assault<00:04:19.370> rifle<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:20.060> think<00:04:20.510> overall<00:04:21.019> this<00:04:21.229> is

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
an assault rifle I think overall this is

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.300 
an assault rifle I think overall this is
gonna<00:04:21.470> be<00:04:21.620> something<00:04:21.859> that's<00:04:22.010> gonna<00:04:22.099> help

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
gonna be something that's gonna help

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.530 
gonna be something that's gonna help
players<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.820> get<00:04:22.909> better<00:04:23.180> at

players to get better at
playing<00:04:23.690> those<00:04:23.900> roles<00:04:24.290> as<00:04:24.530> opposed<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.920> making

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
playing those roles as opposed to making

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.130 
playing those roles as opposed to making
you<00:04:25.280> choose<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.640> role<00:04:25.910> right<00:04:26.150> off<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.420> bat<00:04:26.600> and

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
you choose a role right off the bat and

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
everywhere so it really intensifies the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.220 
everywhere so it really intensifies the
feel<00:04:55.040> of<00:04:55.070> being<00:04:55.970> on<00:04:56.120> this<00:04:56.210> battlefield<00:04:56.420> and

around<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.240> bend<00:04:59.480> or<00:04:59.690> or<00:05:00.050> even<00:05:00.080> what's

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
around the bend or or even what's

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.750 
around the bend or or even what's
straight<00:05:00.620> ahead<00:05:00.770> because<00:05:01.280> you<00:05:01.400> can't<00:05:01.610> even

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
straight ahead because you can't even

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.190 
straight ahead because you can't even
really<00:05:01.970> see<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.390> know<00:05:02.420> all<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.780> way<00:05:02.870> across<00:05:03.170> a

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
really see you know all the way across a

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.020 
really see you know all the way across a
bridge<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.800> don't<00:05:03.950> know<00:05:04.070> what's<00:05:04.340> waiting<00:05:04.640> for

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
bridge you don't know what's waiting for

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.300 
bridge you don't know what's waiting for
you<00:05:05.150> on<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.300> other<00:05:05.420> side<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:06.830> course<00:05:07.100> there's

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
you on the other side of course there's

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.010 
you on the other side of course there's
a<00:05:07.370> lot<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.640> great<00:05:07.790> animation<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:08.480> Killzone<00:05:08.810> -

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
a lot of great animation and Killzone -

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.360 
a lot of great animation and Killzone -
and<00:05:09.320> that's<00:05:09.440> something<00:05:09.590> that's<00:05:09.860> carried<00:05:10.220> over

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
and that's something that's carried over

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.790 
and that's something that's carried over
from<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.730> original<00:05:10.820> Killzone<00:05:11.570> Killzone<00:05:12.410> to

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
from the original Killzone Killzone to

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.440 
from the original Killzone Killzone to
still<00:05:13.220> has<00:05:13.400> all<00:05:13.580> that<00:05:13.700> animation<00:05:14.210> but<00:05:14.360> it

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
still has all that animation but it

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.670 
still has all that animation but it
splits<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.960> difference<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.440> you<00:05:15.500> never

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
splits the difference and you never

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.870 
splits the difference and you never
really<00:05:15.950> feel<00:05:16.100> like<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.400> games<00:05:16.580> taking

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
really feel like the games taking

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.850 
really feel like the games taking
control<00:05:17.270> out<00:05:17.540> of<00:05:17.600> your<00:05:17.930> hands<00:05:18.200> just<00:05:18.380> so<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.770> can

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
control out of your hands just so it can

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.920 
control out of your hands just so it can
look<00:05:19.040> pretty<00:05:19.360> we<00:05:20.360> could<00:05:20.480> probably<00:05:20.690> spend

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
look pretty we could probably spend

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.630 
look pretty we could probably spend
another<00:05:21.170> hour<00:05:21.380> debating<00:05:22.100> whether<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.490> game

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
another hour debating whether the game

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.700 
another hour debating whether the game
looks<00:05:22.910> better<00:05:23.210> or<00:05:23.540> worse<00:05:23.930> than<00:05:24.230> the<00:05:24.320> original

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
looks better or worse than the original

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.290 
looks better or worse than the original
trailer<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.460> all<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.730> sort<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.030> stuff<00:05:26.090> but

trailer and all that sort of stuff but

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.880 
trailer and all that sort of stuff but
