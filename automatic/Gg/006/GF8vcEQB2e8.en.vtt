00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all of you guys and as usual 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.700
 they are frank and today I am here for this 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.639
 new video on gta 5 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.679
 watch it while you do it 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.910
 something on our hands in our dearest 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.250
 franklin then in this video 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.640
 as of course now on youtube 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.470
 are running 8 billion videos on 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.570
 I thought about making a little thing 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.099
 for now for now naturally then capable 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 when this video has already done so 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.280
 8 thousand episodes of going to do the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.020
 triathlon is yes guys because we say 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.219
 that on gta 5 there are several activities 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.469
 to do 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 I wanted to do flight school but saw 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.489
 that has already done fad 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.950
 then then to avoid maybe 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.360
 a few kids will come along 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 however, it is also due to fairness 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.030
 in short, I prefer not to do it even if I do 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 would have loved it would be 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 loved it anyway we go to do 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.109
 the triathlon which is a bad thing is 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 always a very beautiful thing makes me very much 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.049
 pleasure that one of you gave the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.030
 you know how to drive today 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.210
 back the bonnet that flies my mom one 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.799
 power is too strong too strong 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.420
 whatever it is I'm really playing 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.490
 much 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.439
 so I hope to always unlock new ones 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.280
 things in a bit maybe I can still 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.090
 then a hangar where then we can do 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.720
 finally the touristic project 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.820
 then let's see what's there 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.790
 something that is here not so much because 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 we have to do some nice ones 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.200
 no idea you truck i'm not sorry 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.479
 don't stay here forever 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.320
 then let's see where we do where 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.700
 there is the inscription there is that inscription 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.689
 let's go equine from here to that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.829
 small table 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.009
 it seems to me that here it is here for 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:58.140
 participate in the triathlon what and not 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.509
 on the dashed space please 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.759
 agree let's take part in the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.110
 lottery from a competition 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.270
 multidisciplinary swim pedal ride 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 to the finish line 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.989
 ok if you repeat hicks repeatedly 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 increase speed but consumer you have the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.380
 your resistance and up to here the more you are 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.820
 inside more 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.210
 they are quickly exaggerating with it 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.830
 effort I would also consume health if 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.030
 after a round the lower resistance side 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:28.910
 to the goal to recover a little tension yes 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:34.080
 he is preparing or trying 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:37.220
 and has gradually entered our 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.530
 competitor competitions simi swim 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.310
 boys are swimming like gods 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.290
 beasts 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.920
 mom my boys this race and it is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.080
 I avoid doing something like the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.460
 commentary because why else then me 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.870
 insulted however we try to swim 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.720
 and very quickly I'm pressing 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.760
 hicks like one smashed unless 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.930
 we must not go so no 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.290
 shooting from an endurance test 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.690
 running too fast is too much 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.690
 long you will get tired first and me and me 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.550
 frega famme understood then the first 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.410
 finish line is there are fifth type 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.240
 of the series that everyone presses you rics must 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.760
 press xc well when while 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.980
 speed and how long it's okay 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.780
 we continue to there is no way to 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.000
 swimming faster was not xrx me 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.310
 I still have to figure out how to get there first 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.180
 but it's okay to recover later because if 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.580
 no yes go well I'm fifth your fucks 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.720
 but then look I'm attached to this guy 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.860
 i'm kind of doing his third third ass 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.709
 to view the service of this is 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.930
 mine, what the fuck do you care 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.930
 come on come on 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.760
 went on a bike to but immediately but 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.230
 who no okay ok ok to understand and is one 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.810
 single bike I'll fuck your baby 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.520
 baby I'll fuck your ass but I guess what kind 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.520
 type we choose bicycle then 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.390
 departure in the old one makes the fall 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.130
 excellent tactical opponents 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.420
 ok the kids bike i think 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.489
 no one ever showed it up 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.950
 youtube then flab type we do how 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.520
 as real cyclists pro player function 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.400
 I am according to what is next it seems to me 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.919
 like running maybe so let's use now 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:36.050
 the cycling period to be able to 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:38.330
 save a little attention on 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.520
 look at me a little bit my ass looked at 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.729
 as franklin franklin moves it is 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:49.400
 too much too busy in the middle of the 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:51.020
 street and now I saw nothing are 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.220
 first month that one I have it right in 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.110
 ass that guys power anyway 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.110
 let me know how to comment and with 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.180
 like released the like because why 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.850
 they could give up very bad things 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.640
 if you like making other videos always on 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.870
 this activity a little port 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.620
 physical and social 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.880
 ok attention we see another goal 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.210
 another goal I don't know what now 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.210
 It happens 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:24.770
 I said the point judge to ok now is 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:30.110
 a race is a beast race just ok 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:32.419
 so let's go to a penalty run runs 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.430
 well this challenge definitely increases the 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.820
 resistance and that is not bad 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.740
 whatever it is you run nice runs to you 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.470
 first guys and first shortcuts 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.740
 pity that we do not know more than anything else 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:51.340
 because if he hadn't used 60 surely 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.340
 opens took a lot of mammamia 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.740
 thrilling guys this race 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.990
 see how the chorus is something else 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.479
 close I could not on the resistance that 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.960
 c's been kind but because these cocks but 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:06.169
