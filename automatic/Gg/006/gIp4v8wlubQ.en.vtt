00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.070 
little bit you can see on the screen
here<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:27.060> got<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.300> signal<00:02:27.690> that's<00:02:27.840> been

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
here it's it's got a signal that's been

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.820 
here it's it's got a signal that's been
displayed<00:02:28.530> from<00:02:28.950> earlier<00:02:30.620> I'm<00:02:31.620> using

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
displayed from earlier I'm using

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.680 
displayed from earlier I'm using
absinthe<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:32.819> which<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.510> very

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
absinthe here which is just a very

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.380 
absinthe here which is just a very
simple<00:02:33.870> way<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.230> generating<00:02:34.980> different<00:02:35.790> types

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
simple way of generating different types

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.710 
simple way of generating different types
of<00:02:37.220> waveforms<00:02:38.220> here<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:39.120> now<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.269> got<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.630> on

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
of waveforms here right now I got it on

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.460 
of waveforms here right now I got it on
a<00:02:39.750> vocal<00:02:40.200> sample<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:43.019> key<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.319> up

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
a vocal sample so I can I can key it up

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.420 
a vocal sample so I can I can key it up
and<00:02:43.709> display<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.760> signal<00:02:45.060> live<00:02:45.269> here

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
and display the the signal live here

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.930 
and display the the signal live here
likewise<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.760> change<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.580> sine

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
likewise I can change to a to a sine

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.759 
likewise I can change to a to a sine
wave<00:02:50.970> here<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:55.549> view<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.670> sine<00:02:56.880> wave<00:02:57.769> your

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
wave here and view the sine wave your

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.400 
wave here and view the sine wave your
real-time<00:02:59.780> down<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.349> this<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
real-time down here this is this is the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
real-time down here this is this is the
indicator<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.530> I'm<00:03:05.040> working<00:03:05.459> with<00:03:05.640> 13

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
indicator that I'm working with 13

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.390 
indicator that I'm working with 13
milliseconds<00:03:06.780> from<00:03:07.140> my<00:03:07.349> left<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.620> right<00:03:07.680> along

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
milliseconds from my left to right along

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.729 
milliseconds from my left to right along
the<00:03:08.790> bottom<00:03:08.910> here<00:03:09.120> there<00:03:09.329> are<00:03:09.690> 10<00:03:10.410> divisions

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
the bottom here there are 10 divisions

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.550 
the bottom here there are 10 divisions
so<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.610> tell<00:03:11.849> that<00:03:12.060> each<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.930> these<00:03:13.290> is

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
so I can tell that each of these is

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.589 
so I can tell that each of these is
going<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.829> be<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.400> point<00:03:14.579> three<00:03:14.819> milliseconds

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
going to be one point three milliseconds

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.830 
going to be one point three milliseconds
across<00:03:17.750> likewise<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.609> switch<00:03:20.609> over<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
across likewise I can switch over to a

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.199 
across likewise I can switch over to a
triangle<00:03:22.440> wave<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:25.160> do<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> triangle<00:03:26.519> wave

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.979 

and<00:03:30.350> I<00:03:31.700> can<00:03:32.700> also<00:03:32.819> do<00:03:33.120> square<00:03:33.840> wave<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
and I can also do square wave and the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.460 
and I can also do square wave and the
expected<00:03:37.290> square<00:03:37.709> wave<00:03:38.720> actually<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.989> not<00:03:40.139> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
expected square wave actually it's not a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.879 
expected square wave actually it's not a
perfect<00:03:40.859> square<00:03:40.950> wave<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.609> this<00:03:42.709> software<00:03:43.709> it

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
perfect square wave on this software it

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.720 
perfect square wave on this software it
looks<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.280> tapered<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.730> little<00:03:44.940> bit<00:03:46.730> and

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
looks like it's tapered a little bit and

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.830 
looks like it's tapered a little bit and
do<00:03:48.329> some<00:03:48.510> more<00:03:48.660> complex<00:03:50.600> waveforms<00:03:51.600> a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
do some more complex waveforms a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.589 
do some more complex waveforms a
modified<00:03:52.680> square<00:03:53.010> wave<00:03:53.220> there<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:55.019> on<00:03:55.829> all

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
modified square wave there so on all

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.470 
modified square wave there so on all
pretty<00:03:57.599> interesting<00:03:58.400> device<00:03:59.400> for<00:04:00.060> being<00:04:00.269> the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
pretty interesting device for being the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.080 
pretty interesting device for being the
size<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:01.049> is<00:04:01.139> limited<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.370> sampling<00:04:02.849> right

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
size it is limited it's a sampling right

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.500 
size it is limited it's a sampling right
though

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
though

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.650 
though
it<00:04:04.139> won't<00:04:04.349> quite<00:04:04.560> do<00:04:04.950> one<00:04:05.489> megahertz<00:04:05.819> but<00:04:06.299> it's

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
it won't quite do one megahertz but it's

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.349 
it won't quite do one megahertz but it's
good<00:04:07.470> enough<00:04:07.500> for<00:04:07.829> my<00:04:07.980> purposes<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:09.090> hope

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
good enough for my purposes and I hope

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.089 
good enough for my purposes and I hope
to<00:04:09.599> eventually<00:04:09.870> get<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.380> finished<00:04:10.739> put

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
to eventually get this finished put

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.800 
to eventually get this finished put
actual<00:04:11.430> push<00:04:11.639> buttons<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:12.120> here<00:04:12.389> instead<00:04:12.690> of

actual push buttons on here instead of

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.720 
actual push buttons on here instead of
having<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.169> jumper<00:04:14.099> those<00:04:14.340> with<00:04:14.700> a

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
having to jumper those with a
