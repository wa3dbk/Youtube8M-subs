00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.580
 our channel subscribers are my name 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.109
 Igor I am an expert on plants and today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 I will tell you about what to turn 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.540
 attention when buying fruit seedlings 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.540
 of plants 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.510
 Well, it is well known that in principle the future 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.340
 harvest the future your tree depends on 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.920
 of what sapling you often bought 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.359
 gardeners especially beginners go 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.310
 buy seedlings absolutely not 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.869
 represents what they want to buy and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.640
 in general how it should look like 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.439
 so now I will tell you a few 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.000
 simple rules that you must 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.809
 remember and use when buying 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.719
 any create 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.420
 well first of all my advice to you try not 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.360
 buying seedlings from random people often 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.950
 cars traded traded asphalt 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.300
 maybe there is a good viable 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.100
 seedlings the whole problem is that you are not 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 know what you are buying what is this dream 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 better go to the garden center where clearly 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.039
 certain varieties derived from 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.199
 nurseries have holes such at which 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.879
 The name of the variety is written and there is a guarantee 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.600
 the fact that you buy what you need 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.190
 this is the first second choose young 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.379
 seedling usually young seedlings 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.750
 take root much better and go faster 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.350
 in growth, they quickly adapt to the new 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.330
 setting 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.490
 carefully inspect the place of vaccination 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.130
 sapling they are all grafted onto some 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.500
 steady stock this is the place of the stumps 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.030
 see such a small cut is not big 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 mommy here is such a go 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.710
 the cultural part here it should be 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.220
 completely dry does not peel off completely 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 healthy and zazhivshim here if it is not for 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.720
 who lived if he peel off there tanks 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.640
 There are living cracks likely 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.380
 it is already damaged by labor fungus and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.930
 Accordingly, such a tree you simply 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.540
 die quickly you shouldn't try 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.280
 buy plants taller think taller 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.280
 buy faster will make it not 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.140
 quite the opposite 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.430
 give exactly the root system because 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.890
 what should be a certain proportion 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.380
 between the top and root system 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.290
 this is the most important to see the root 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.270
 system of course mostly sold with 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.430
 closed root system or 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.590
 packed here 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.259
 here are bags of wet sawdust with wet 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.610
 peat so if you want seriously to 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.350
 this case must be treated 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.069
 try ask the seller to 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.200
 unpacked showed you the root 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.409
 systems and so the spine we unpacked 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.079
 look should be big enough 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.700
 the number of small roots if small 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.200
 roots not only stump central 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.430
 the root is clear that this tree is more likely 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.930
 just not take root at least 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.450
 the probability is very small the greater 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.090
 Here are these small roots in principle 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.739
 better but they are of course here for matted 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.569
 because for a very long time lay in 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.099
 some kind of packaging material therefore 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.510
 of course they will need to be planted later 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.090
 straighten but basically they are in 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.049
 normal condition how to check it 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.900
 You can hold a fingernail like this along the spine 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:47.019
 it can be seen there white 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.609
 the wood is young and even some juice 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.859
 singling out means root is alive 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.299
 again when flexing because it is elastic to them 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.699
 he doesn't break if he was already 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.620
 overdried betray but surely break off 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.030
 middle there's overdried example but 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.109
 it's okay, you can basically 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.000
 remove immediately 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.099
 if you buy a seedling not in soda 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.930
 prices have random people somewhere on the road 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.180
 laid them on the pavement laid out 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.030
 notice how they sell there 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.319
 they just lie like that on asphalt 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.669
 probably not the first hour most likely 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.229
 the roots are already dry 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.780
 and again survival rate will be much 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:18.609
 low not all seedlings will survive there they are 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.400
 packed in what they are 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.280
 some in a tank with a chatter some 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.379
 clay ie roots are supported 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.720
 wet state covered with sacking 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.459
 wet well that's good at least 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.609
 here it can already be said not to be mistaken and 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.979
 take here a young sapling here 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.900
 if you take seedlings more adults 4 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.220
 5 years already science in principle already 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.209
 almost been up to wearing 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.530
 and usually sell with a lump of land with 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.840
 one side is really good 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.939
 roots live there most likely but it 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.579
 bad for not seeing what there 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.560
 roots keep in mind that the earth should be 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.569
 proportional to cro-cro not that is 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.859
 large enough crown enough 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.659
 big com though 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.209
 but keep in mind if you buy 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.919
 seedling imported which is given and for 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.719
 the borders here are made special 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.849
 way there pruned root system 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:09.009
 in such a way that it becomes 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.319
 compact is easier to translate 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:13.209
 lesson for far distances but at the same time 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.340
 suction capacity and and remains 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.130
 the former so there are just the roots 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.110
 there may be not very big earthen 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.459
 I am very big but the tree does not 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.980
 suffered increasing popularity 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.320
 acquires the sale of fruit seedlings 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.390
 plants in containers 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.700
 already formed root system with 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.560
 a lump of earth is another thing that again 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.020
 can you cheat in this regard that is 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.970
 sapling two days ago put here 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.560
 covered with earth they sell as if 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.180
 grown up in a container check it out 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.400
 principle very easy well firstly 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.500
 look at the bottom here already 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.030
 germinated roots are visible see this 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.700
 puts it means it grows enough 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.100
 long and the roots have already sprouted through the bottom 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.050
 Well , secondly, it is taken out in general 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.360
 quite difficult husband is something shallow roots there 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.980
 everything is already inside and it's so easy not to be 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.900
 you don't have to pull out 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.730
 tear it says that sapling 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.040
 grew up right here he has a good 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.230
 root system is the next thing we 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.090
 pay attention is the stamp itself 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.490
 fruit tree video it should be 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.950
 smooth without defects 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.780
 another very important wish is these 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.720
 branches that depart from the main 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.220
 trunk from trunk must move at an angle 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.650
 preferably 90 degrees that is 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.110
 almost right angle well allowed 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.270
 less but not less than 45 degrees this one 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.430
 twig is already critical 45 degrees here 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.290
 it's a good 90 degrees if they go 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.080
 quite parallel stamp dropped or 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.090
 parallel to the trunk is not to take if 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.650
 you buy fruit seedlings 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.870
 fruit is not decorative 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.420
 Try to buy seedlings that 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.860
 zoned in this area otherwise 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.080
 it may happen that you pay 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.180
 decent enough money for some 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.770
 an exotic look that you just don't have 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.340
 take root or for example take root on not 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.340
 will bear fruit 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.850
 Well, I say goodbye to you today 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.340
 he talked about how to choose 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.500
 fruit tree sapling
