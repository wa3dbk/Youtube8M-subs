how to make this really nice looking
wireframe<00:00:19.060> effect<00:00:19.750> it's<00:00:20.560> done<00:00:20.770> in<00:00:20.950> cinema<00:00:21.310> 4d

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
wireframe effect it's done in cinema 4d

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.560 
wireframe effect it's done in cinema 4d
and<00:00:21.670> I'm<00:00:21.820> going<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:22.000> be<00:00:22.060> showing<00:00:22.180> you<00:00:22.390> how<00:00:22.420> to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
do it on 3d text but this effect is not

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.450 
do it on 3d text but this effect is not
limited<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.380> 3d<00:00:26.680> text<00:00:26.920> you<00:00:27.010> can<00:00:27.130> do<00:00:27.250> it<00:00:27.340> or

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
limited to 3d text you can do it or

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.400 
limited to 3d text you can do it or
practically<00:00:27.970> anything<00:00:28.329> you're<00:00:28.869> working<00:00:29.079> on

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
in cinema 4d yeah let's get into it in

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.550 
in cinema 4d yeah let's get into it in
cinema<00:00:33.910> 4d<00:00:33.940> I've<00:00:34.270> already<00:00:34.390> made<00:00:34.660> my<00:00:34.720> 3d<00:00:35.290> text

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
cinema 4d I've already made my 3d text

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.460 
cinema 4d I've already made my 3d text
that<00:00:35.650> I'm<00:00:35.739> working<00:00:35.920> on<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:37.210> I<00:00:37.690> want<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.290> make<00:00:38.350> a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
that I'm working on so I want to make a

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.500 
that I'm working on so I want to make a
wire<00:00:38.739> frame<00:00:39.070> of<00:00:39.310> this<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:40.000> way<00:00:40.120> you<00:00:40.149> do<00:00:40.360> this

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
wire frame of this the way you do this

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.009 
wire frame of this the way you do this
is<00:00:40.690> simply<00:00:41.170> go<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:42.370> render<00:00:42.670> settings<00:00:43.019> go

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
is simply go to the render settings go

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.069 
is simply go to the render settings go
down<00:00:44.199> to<00:00:44.350> effect<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.070> select<00:00:45.910> cell<00:00:46.449> render

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
down to effect and select cell render

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.150 
down to effect and select cell render
like<00:00:47.859> so<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.719> now<00:00:49.719> that<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.199> is<00:00:50.230> enabled<00:00:50.980> if

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
like so and now that that is enabled if

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.790 
like so and now that that is enabled if
we<00:00:51.340> preview<00:00:51.879> you<00:00:52.660> sort<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:53.019> get<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.350> outline

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
we preview you sort of get that outline

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.250 
we preview you sort of get that outline
that<00:00:53.980> you<00:00:54.129> want<00:00:54.370> for<00:00:55.090> your<00:00:55.300> wire<00:00:55.600> frame<00:00:55.960> like

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
that you want for your wire frame like

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.500 
that you want for your wire frame like
so<00:00:56.589> so<00:00:56.829> go<00:00:57.460> ahead<00:00:57.579> render<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.149> out<00:00:58.210> I've

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
so so go ahead render that out I've

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.790 
so so go ahead render that out I've
already<00:00:58.660> done<00:00:58.899> that<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.199> save<00:00:59.410> some<00:00:59.589> time<00:00:59.739> for

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
already done that to save some time for

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.919 
already done that to save some time for
the<00:01:00.039> tutorial<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.329> if<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:01.480> go<00:01:01.570> back<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.809> the

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
the tutorial so if you go back to the

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.660 
the tutorial so if you go back to the
render<00:01:02.289> settings<00:01:02.320> back<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.039> cell<00:01:03.280> render

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
render settings back to the cell render

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.040 
render settings back to the cell render
you'll<00:01:04.180> notice<00:01:04.480> that<00:01:04.510> there's<00:01:04.660> a<00:01:04.870> lot<00:01:05.019> more

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
you'll notice that there's a lot more

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.050 
you'll notice that there's a lot more
options<00:01:05.440> in<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:07.320> tab<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:09.490> example<00:01:09.880> there's

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
options in that tab for example there's

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.550 
options in that tab for example there's
a<00:01:10.180> thing<00:01:10.390> called<00:01:10.420> edges<00:01:11.140> which<00:01:11.320> I'll<00:01:11.440> explain

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
a thing called edges which I'll explain

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.100 
a thing called edges which I'll explain
in<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.980> bit<00:01:12.010> what<00:01:12.940> edge<00:01:13.210> color<00:01:13.540> is<00:01:13.750> is<00:01:13.960> basically

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
in a bit what edge color is is basically

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.590 
in a bit what edge color is is basically
the<00:01:14.890> outline<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.550> what<00:01:15.760> background<00:01:16.000> color<00:01:16.390> is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
the outline and what background color is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.780 
the outline and what background color is
is<00:01:16.780> basically<00:01:17.020> just<00:01:17.380> yeah<00:01:18.070> what<00:01:18.400> literally

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
is basically just yeah what literally

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.690 
is basically just yeah what literally
the<00:01:18.970> background<00:01:19.360> color<00:01:19.480> I<00:01:20.490> normally<00:01:21.490> leave

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
the background color I normally leave

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.310 
the background color I normally leave
these<00:01:21.910> at<00:01:22.150> black<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.630> white<00:01:22.780> but<00:01:23.020> obviously

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
these at black and white but obviously

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.290 
these at black and white but obviously
you<00:01:23.440> guys<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.800> mess<00:01:23.920> around<00:01:23.950> with<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.370> do<00:01:25.150> what

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
you guys can mess around with it do what

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.530 
you guys can mess around with it do what
you<00:01:25.420> want<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.900> now<00:01:26.830> what<00:01:27.280> edges<00:01:27.730> does<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.240> sort

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
you want and now what edges does it sort

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.940 
you want and now what edges does it sort
of<00:01:28.600> makes<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.990> whole<00:01:29.200> new<00:01:29.410> look<00:01:29.620> for<00:01:29.860> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
of makes a whole new look for the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.400 
of makes a whole new look for the
wireframes<00:01:30.430> if<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:30.700> render<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.120> out<00:01:31.300> as<00:01:31.540> you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
wireframes if I render this out as you

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.470 
wireframes if I render this out as you
see<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.710> sort<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:33.010> adds<00:01:33.130> more<00:01:33.670> points<00:01:34.150> if<00:01:34.270> add

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
see it sort of adds more points if add

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.410 
see it sort of adds more points if add
more<00:01:34.750> lines<00:01:34.990> around<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.680> curves<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.520> stuff

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
more lines around the curves and stuff

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.540 
more lines around the curves and stuff
in<00:01:37.570> asked<00:01:38.140> quite<00:01:38.410> a<00:01:38.440> nice<00:01:38.650> look<00:01:39.100> so<00:01:39.340> I'm<00:01:39.430> just

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
in asked quite a nice look so I'm just

photoshop i'm gonna i just made a hide

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.970 
photoshop i'm gonna i just made a hide
over<00:01:45.520> these<00:01:45.670> layers<00:01:45.940> if<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.140> just<00:01:47.320> open<00:01:47.500> those

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
over these layers if I just open those

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.600 
over these layers if I just open those
files<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.550> I've<00:01:48.640> got<00:01:49.410> like<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:50.800> open<00:01:51.400> these

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
files that I've got like so open these

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.420 
files that I've got like so open these
up<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:52.530> first<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.680> all<00:01:53.710> if<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:53.980> just<00:01:54.160> move<00:01:54.370> my

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
up and first of all if I just move my

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.510 
up and first of all if I just move my
normal<00:01:55.030> 3d<00:01:55.450> text<00:01:55.870> into<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.740> fall<00:01:57.070> into<00:01:57.280> that

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
normal 3d text into that fall into that

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.020 
normal 3d text into that fall into that
file<00:01:58.150> like<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.160> then<00:02:00.160> I'm<00:02:00.550> gonna<00:02:00.790> have

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
file like so and then I'm gonna have

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.900 
file like so and then I'm gonna have
this<00:02:01.330> other<00:02:01.630> this<00:02:02.380> normal<00:02:02.950> wire<00:02:03.220> frame<00:02:03.580> behind

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
this other this normal wire frame behind

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.090 
this other this normal wire frame behind
it<00:02:04.300> so<00:02:04.450> I'm<00:02:04.510> just<00:02:04.600> going<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.810> drag<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.350> drop

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
it so I'm just going to drag that drop

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.119 
it so I'm just going to drag that drop
it<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.430> what<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.300> want<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.480> do<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.860> click<00:02:08.860> and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
it and what you want to do is click and

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.690 
it and what you want to do is click and
drag<00:02:09.459> till<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.269> locks<00:02:10.509> onto<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.500> preview<00:02:12.459> on

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
drag till it locks onto the preview on

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.030 
drag till it locks onto the preview on
to<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.970> actual<00:02:13.180> 3d<00:02:13.569> one<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:14.709> I'm<00:02:14.769> just<00:02:14.860> going

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
to the actual 3d one then I'm just going

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.580 
to the actual 3d one then I'm just going
to<00:02:15.129> bring<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.430> underneath<00:02:15.870> command<00:02:16.870> or<00:02:17.019> ctrl<00:02:17.349> T

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
to bring it underneath command or ctrl T

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.940 
to bring it underneath command or ctrl T
to<00:02:17.890> pop<00:02:18.340> up<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.790> resizing<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:20.050> make<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.860> a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
to pop up the resizing on make it a

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.220 
to pop up the resizing on make it a
little<00:02:21.100> bigger<00:02:21.340> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
little bigger and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.100 
little bigger and
 like<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:23.300> but<00:02:24.300> as<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.569> see<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> sort<00:02:25.050> of

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
 like that but as you see it sort of

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.839 
 like that but as you see it sort of
looks<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.709> doesn't<00:02:26.010> really<00:02:26.069> look<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.370> good

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
looks it doesn't really look that good

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.610 
looks it doesn't really look that good
as<00:02:27.060> I've<00:02:27.360> shown<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.840> example<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.379> had

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
as I've shown the example that had

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.309 
as I've shown the example that had
before<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:30.120> way<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.269> want<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.599> fix<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.080> is

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
before the way you want to fix this is

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.850 
before the way you want to fix this is
just<00:02:31.830> go<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.150> image<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:34.760> image<00:02:36.860> adjustments

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
just go to image and image adjustments

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.960 
just go to image and image adjustments
invert<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.840> see<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.049> image<00:02:40.459> adjustments<00:02:41.459> invert

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
invert I see so image adjustments invert

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.050 
invert I see so image adjustments invert
so<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.599> basically<00:02:42.780> inverts<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.379> colors<00:02:43.860> and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
so this basically inverts the colors and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.479 
so this basically inverts the colors and
so<00:02:45.060> what<00:02:45.480> was<00:02:45.810> black<00:02:46.200> became<00:02:46.650> white<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.190> like

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
so what was black became white and like

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.460 
so what was black became white and like
that<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.540> still<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.959> doesn't<00:02:49.110> really<00:02:49.290> look

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
that but still it doesn't really look

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.660 
that but still it doesn't really look
like<00:02:49.530> good<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> way<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.190> want<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.400> go<00:02:50.519> about

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
like good the way you want to go about

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.160 
like good the way you want to go about
this<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.120> change<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.450> blending<00:02:51.900> mode<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
this is change the blending mode to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.000 
this is change the blending mode to
either<00:02:52.739> light<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.790> screen<00:02:54.569> or<00:02:54.780> linear<00:02:55.560> door<00:02:55.799> so

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
either light it screen or linear door so

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
either light it screen or linear door so
that's<00:02:56.190> what<00:02:56.310> I'm<00:02:56.400> going<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.579> use<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.000> there

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
that's what I'm going to use and there

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.160 
that's what I'm going to use and there
you<00:02:57.959> go<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.260> sort<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.530> gives<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.890> that

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
you go that sort of gives it that

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.009 
you go that sort of gives it that
transparent<00:03:01.280> wireframe<00:03:02.280> look<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.900> can

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
transparent wireframe look and you can

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.720 
transparent wireframe look and you can
obviously<00:03:04.109> duplicate<00:03:04.859> this<00:03:05.040> layer<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.609> make

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
obviously duplicate this layer to make

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.390 
obviously duplicate this layer to make
it<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.970> bit<00:03:06.120> more<00:03:06.150> brighter<00:03:06.569> like<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.220> now

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
it a bit more brighter like so so now

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.330 
it a bit more brighter like so so now
I'm<00:03:08.670> going<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:09.090> get<00:03:09.329> this<00:03:09.569> edges<00:03:10.349> one<00:03:10.590> into<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
I'm going to get this edges one into the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.490 
I'm going to get this edges one into the
same<00:03:11.640> file<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.209> put<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.420> on<00:03:12.569> top<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.870> my<00:03:13.019> texts

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
same file and put it on top of my texts

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.970 
same file and put it on top of my texts
so<00:03:13.819> drag<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.150> top<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.480> your<00:03:15.720> text<00:03:16.079> click<00:03:16.799> and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
so drag it on top of your text click and

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.699 
so drag it on top of your text click and
drag<00:03:17.190> till<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.609> locks<00:03:17.849> onto<00:03:18.209> your<00:03:18.660> text<00:03:19.109> like

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
drag till it locks onto your text like

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.080 
drag till it locks onto your text like
so<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.849> that's<00:03:21.540> simply<00:03:21.720> like<00:03:22.049> we<00:03:22.200> did<00:03:22.349> before

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
so and that's simply like we did before

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.920 
so and that's simply like we did before
image<00:03:24.440> adjustments<00:03:25.440> invert<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.569> make<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.750> as

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
image adjustments invert and make it as

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.890 
image adjustments invert and make it as
a<00:03:27.989> linear<00:03:28.470> dodge<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:30.030> basically<00:03:30.359> guys<00:03:30.630> that's

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
a linear dodge so basically guys that's

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.599 
a linear dodge so basically guys that's
how<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.109> make<00:03:31.349> your<00:03:31.500> wire<00:03:31.739> frame<00:03:32.130> design

how to make your wire frame design

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.900 
how to make your wire frame design
wireframe<00:03:33.359> effect<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.049> cinema<00:03:34.410> 4d<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.549> hope
