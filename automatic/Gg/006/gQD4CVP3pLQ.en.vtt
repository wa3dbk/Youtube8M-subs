00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.750 
and another ball change although I'm not
so<00:07:06.330> sure<00:07:06.360> about<00:07:06.540> that<00:07:06.720> one<00:07:06.990> because<00:07:07.170> he<00:07:07.590> was

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
so sure about that one because he was

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.240 
so sure about that one because he was
just<00:07:08.760> pulling<00:07:09.120> a<00:07:09.300> pretty<00:07:09.510> big<00:07:09.720> game<00:07:09.990> with<00:07:10.800> this

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
just pulling a pretty big game with this

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.760 
just pulling a pretty big game with this
bowling<00:07:11.550> ball<00:07:11.580> here<00:07:11.940> so<00:07:12.240> I<00:07:12.450> think<00:07:13.440> there's<00:07:13.680> a

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
bowling ball here so I think there's a

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.360 
bowling ball here so I think there's a
point<00:07:13.980> where<00:07:15.110> you<00:07:16.110> start<00:07:16.560> to<00:07:16.680> fidget<00:07:16.920> a<00:07:17.190> bit

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370 
point where you start to fidget a bit

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.300 
point where you start to fidget a bit
too<00:07:17.550> much<00:07:17.790> and<00:07:18.000> it's<00:07:18.030> overkill<00:07:19.310> overthinking

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
too much and it's overkill overthinking

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.410 
too much and it's overkill overthinking
at<00:07:20.640> summerhill<00:07:21.540> absolutely<00:07:22.290> yeah<00:07:23.040> I<00:07:23.220> think

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:23.420 
at summerhill absolutely yeah I think

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.060 
at summerhill absolutely yeah I think
247<00:07:24.420> if<00:07:24.510> he<00:07:24.600> strikes<00:07:24.810> here<00:07:25.230> is<00:07:25.650> going<00:07:25.860> to<00:07:25.950> win

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070 
247 if he strikes here is going to win

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.860 
247 if he strikes here is going to win
just<00:07:26.310> about<00:07:26.490> everything<00:07:26.910> just<00:07:27.270> about<00:07:27.570> every
