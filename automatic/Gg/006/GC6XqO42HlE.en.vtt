00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
conference that happened actually at the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.819 
conference that happened actually at the
end<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.190> March<00:00:38.660> but<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.649> coolest

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
happened to me at Nvidia's tech

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.240 
happened to me at Nvidia's tech
conference<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.840> silly<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> even<00:00:46.739> say<00:00:47.129> it

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
conference and it's silly to even say it

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
conference and it's silly to even say it
this<00:00:47.370> way<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.750> given<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> opportunity

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
this way but I was given the opportunity

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.340 
this way but I was given the opportunity
while<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.579> drive<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> Tesla

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
while I was there to drive the Tesla

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.590 
while I was there to drive the Tesla
Model<00:00:52.379> S<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.730> might<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.059> asking<00:00:54.090> why

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
Model S now you might be asking why

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
Model S now you might be asking why
would<00:00:54.840> they<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.140> Tesla<00:00:55.530> Model<00:00:55.710> S<00:00:55.920> at<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
would they have a Tesla Model S at the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.010 
would they have a Tesla Model S at the
nvidia<00:00:56.789> tech<00:00:57.000> conference<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.629> why<00:00:57.780> would<00:00:57.989> i

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
nvidia tech conference and why would i

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.569 
nvidia tech conference and why would i
be<00:00:58.199> given<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> opportunity<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.129> drive<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
be given the opportunity to drive it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.110 
be given the opportunity to drive it
there<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> because<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.699> center<00:01:02.699> console

the core when you're sitting there in it

the core when you're sitting there in it
the<00:01:05.610> thing<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.030> interact<00:01:06.390> with<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
big tiger powered computer I'll be

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.730 
big tiger powered computer I'll be
entirely<00:01:09.869> honest<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.290> don't<00:01:10.350> know<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
entirely honest I don't know all the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
entirely honest I don't know all the
specifics<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> runs<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
specifics about it I know it runs a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
specifics about it I know it runs a
version<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.350> Linux<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.890> managed<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
version of Linux I managed to get that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.429 
version of Linux I managed to get that
out<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> guy<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.720> Tesla<00:01:16.200> who<00:01:16.290> was

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
out of the guy from Tesla who was

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.480 
out of the guy from Tesla who was
sitting<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> passenger<00:01:16.950> seat<00:01:17.159> while<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
sitting in the passenger seat while I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
sitting in the passenger seat while I
was<00:01:17.700> driving<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.360> know<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> Tegra

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
was driving it I know that it is a Tegra

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.560 
was driving it I know that it is a Tegra
based<00:01:20.009> processor<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> believe<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> Tegra<00:01:21.540> 3

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
based processor I believe it's a Tegra 3

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
based processor I believe it's a Tegra 3
that<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.200> running<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.500> top<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.920> hopefully

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that it's running on top of hopefully

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.070 
that it's running on top of hopefully
newer<00:01:23.820> versions<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> Tesla<00:01:24.840> will<00:01:24.930> come

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
newer versions of the Tesla will come

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.420 
newer versions of the Tesla will come
with<00:01:25.290> newer<00:01:25.590> versions<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> chip

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
with newer versions of the chip

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
with newer versions of the chip
hopefully<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> k1<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.229> going

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
hopefully the k1 because that is going

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.800 
hopefully the k1 because that is going
to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> ridiculously<00:01:29.549> awesome<00:01:29.820> chip<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.689> as

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to be a ridiculously awesome chip but as

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.090 
to be a ridiculously awesome chip but as
you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.470> I've<00:01:31.560> got<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.740> little<00:01:31.920> bit

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
you can see here I've got a little bit

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
you can see here I've got a little bit
of<00:01:32.130> footage<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:32.939> experience<00:01:33.450> there<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
of footage from my experience there and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.360 
opportunity to do but you can use that
to<00:02:58.260> make<00:02:58.350> phone<00:02:58.590> calls<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:58.980> everything<00:02:59.070> like

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
to make phone calls and everything like

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.920 
to make phone calls and everything like
that<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.820> there<00:03:00.150> was<00:03:00.240> even<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.480> point<00:03:00.720> where

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
that and there was even a point where

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.600 
that and there was even a point where
like<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.440> said<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.710> navigation<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.400> have

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
like I said the navigation you can have

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.980 
like I said the navigation you can have
in<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.730> center<00:03:03.030> console<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.930> really

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
in that center console it's this really

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.930 
in that center console it's this really
large<00:03:04.410> monitor<00:03:04.950> that's<00:03:05.160> kind<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.460> out<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.700> your

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
large monitor that's kind of out of your

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.000 
large monitor that's kind of out of your
line<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.120> sight<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:06.810> while<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:07.620> great<00:03:07.860> to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
line of sight so while it's great to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.290 
line of sight so while it's great to
have<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.310> there<00:03:08.490> especially<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.090> you've<00:03:09.180> got

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
have it there especially if you've got

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.460 
have it there especially if you've got
other<00:03:09.330> people<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.870> car<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.140> help<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.410> out

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
other people in the car to help you out

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.680 
other people in the car to help you out
there<00:03:11.340> was<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.490> way<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.730> get<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.180> transmit

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
there was a way to get it to transmit

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.360 
there was a way to get it to transmit
over<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.080> right<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.650> front<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.010> driver<00:03:14.250> so

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
over to right in front of the driver so

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.400 
over to right in front of the driver so
it<00:03:14.640> would<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.880> on<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.330> dash<00:03:15.690> right<00:03:16.050> in<00:03:16.200> front

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
it would be on the dash right in front

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.990 
it would be on the dash right in front
of<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.190> there<00:03:17.370> was<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:17.520> point<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.940> I'm

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
of you so there was a point and I'm

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.070 
of you so there was a point and I'm
probably<00:03:18.120> showing<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.630> video<00:03:18.840> right<00:03:19.050> now

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
probably showing you the video right now

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.260 
probably showing you the video right now
when<00:03:19.710> we<00:03:19.830> were<00:03:19.920> heading<00:03:20.190> back<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
when we were heading back and the the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.760 
when we were heading back and the the
guy<00:03:21.360> from<00:03:21.570> Tesla<00:03:21.900> was<00:03:21.990> like<00:03:22.080> oh<00:03:22.230> yeah<00:03:22.410> let's<00:03:22.590> go

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
guy from Tesla was like oh yeah let's go

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.260 
guy from Tesla was like oh yeah let's go
ahead<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:22.950> get<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> GPS<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.150> know

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
ahead and get the GPS up so you know

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.430 
ahead and get the GPS up so you know
where<00:03:24.420> you're<00:03:24.540> going<00:03:24.870> he<00:03:25.050> hit<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> button

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
the way that technology is used in this

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.900 
the way that technology is used in this
car<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.360> just<00:03:33.720> absolutely<00:03:34.170> awesome<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.220> on

car is just absolutely awesome and on

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.820 
car is just absolutely awesome and on
top<00:03:36.210> of<00:03:36.240> that<00:03:36.420> as<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.870> guy<00:03:37.200> mentions<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.740> the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
video the battery in this car which is

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.030 
video the battery in this car which is
really<00:03:39.930> what<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.290> lacking<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.890> lot<00:03:40.920> of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
really what is lacking in a lot of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.300 
really what is lacking in a lot of
electric<00:03:41.460> vehicles<00:03:41.490> is<00:03:42.180> at<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.930> minimum<00:03:43.310> 200

electric vehicles is at a minimum 200
mile<00:03:44.520> range<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.210> they're<00:03:45.690> looking<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.350> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
mile range and they're looking the the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.140 
mile range and they're looking the the
higher<00:03:46.860> end<00:03:47.100> model<00:03:47.430> which<00:03:47.580> is<00:03:47.610> only<00:03:47.850> slightly

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
higher end model which is only slightly

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.120 
higher end model which is only slightly
more<00:03:48.450> expensive<00:03:48.510> has<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.530> two<00:03:49.740> hundred<00:03:49.830> eighty

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
more expensive has a two hundred eighty

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.100 
more expensive has a two hundred eighty
mile<00:03:50.490> range<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.660> just<00:03:51.870> absolutely

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
mile range that is just absolutely

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.440 
mile range that is just absolutely
ridiculous<00:03:52.800> that's<00:03:53.100> not<00:03:53.340> road<00:03:53.790> trip<00:03:54.090> distance

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
ridiculous that's not road trip distance

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.750 
ridiculous that's not road trip distance
but<00:03:55.230> realistically<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.280> if<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.460> remember

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
but realistically and if I remember

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760 
but realistically and if I remember
correctly<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.870> use<00:03:58.110> one<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.320> their<00:03:58.470> super

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
correctly if you use one of their super

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.260 
correctly if you use one of their super
chargers<00:03:59.190> which<00:03:59.370> they<00:03:59.550> have<00:03:59.700> placed<00:04:00.030> at

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
chargers which they have placed at

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.140 
chargers which they have placed at
specific<00:04:00.600> points<00:04:01.230> along<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.040> road<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:03.030> can

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
specific points along the road you can

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.820 
specific points along the road you can
actually<00:04:03.300> stop<00:04:03.660> for<00:04:03.840> half<00:04:03.960> an<00:04:04.080> hour<00:04:04.140> charge<00:04:04.680> up

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
actually stop for half an hour charge up

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.310 
actually stop for half an hour charge up
your<00:04:04.860> car<00:04:05.130> keep<00:04:05.610> right<00:04:05.880> on<00:04:05.910> going<00:04:06.140> they<00:04:07.140> just

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
your car keep right on going they just

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.960 
your car keep right on going they just
did<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.560> first<00:04:07.770> cross-country<00:04:08.130> Drive<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:08.910> I

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
did the first cross-country Drive and I

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.790 
did the first cross-country Drive and I
think<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.300> was<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.480> tesla<00:04:09.930> model<00:04:10.050> s<00:04:10.290> they<00:04:10.470> did<00:04:10.680> it

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
think it was a tesla model s they did it

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.590 
think it was a tesla model s they did it
in<00:04:10.950> stopping<00:04:11.790> at<00:04:11.880> these<00:04:12.000> supercharger

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
in stopping at these supercharger

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.990 
in stopping at these supercharger
stations<00:04:12.959> along<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.230> way<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.890> as<00:04:13.920> those<00:04:14.610> sorts

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
stations along the way so as those sorts

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.880 
stations along the way so as those sorts
of<00:04:15.060> things<00:04:15.120> become<00:04:15.540> more<00:04:15.720> prevalent<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.650> will

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
of things become more prevalent it will

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.710 
of things become more prevalent it will
become<00:04:17.280> feasible<00:04:17.520> to<00:04:17.820> actually<00:04:18.330> take<00:04:18.540> this

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
become feasible to actually take this

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.539 
become feasible to actually take this
car<00:04:18.959> which<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.320> really<00:04:20.010> really<00:04:20.040> expensive

couple<00:04:41.100> hundred<00:04:41.190> miles<00:04:41.550> but<00:04:42.150> still<00:04:42.470> probably

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
couple hundred miles but still probably

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.860 
couple hundred miles but still probably
well<00:04:43.770> within<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.250> reason<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.820> falling<00:04:45.690> into

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
well within the reason of falling into

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.420 
well within the reason of falling into
that<00:04:45.990> same<00:04:46.169> amount<00:04:46.380> of<00:04:46.470> distance<00:04:46.620> as<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.220> car

that same amount of distance as the car

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.430 
that same amount of distance as the car
would<00:04:47.610> actually<00:04:47.970> be<00:04:48.090> able<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.300> travel<00:04:48.570> would<00:04:49.410> I

would actually be able to travel would I

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.810 
would actually be able to travel would I
be<00:04:49.530> willing<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.039> travel<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.490> kind<00:04:50.759> of

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
be willing to travel that kind of

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.390 
be willing to travel that kind of
distance<00:04:51.030> on<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.479> battery<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:52.229> don't<00:04:53.220> know<00:04:53.310> if

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
distance on a battery I don't know if

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.590 
distance on a battery I don't know if
I'm<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.520> hundred<00:04:53.669> percent<00:04:53.789> confident<00:04:54.389> in<00:04:54.509> it

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
I'm a hundred percent confident in it

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600 
I'm a hundred percent confident in it
yet<00:04:54.870> but<00:04:55.380> I'm<00:04:55.560> definitely<00:04:55.740> getting<00:04:56.130> there<00:04:56.460> I
