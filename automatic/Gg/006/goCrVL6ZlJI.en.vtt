what is it and who lost it Johan Broder
is<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:54.220> Danish<00:00:54.610> flute<00:00:55.000> maker<00:00:55.240> he<00:00:55.900> designed<00:00:56.320> the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
is a Danish flute maker he designed the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.090 
is a Danish flute maker he designed the
rotor<00:00:57.070> system<00:00:57.550> roughly<00:00:58.180> 20<00:00:58.720> years<00:00:58.990> after<00:00:59.350> he

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
rotor system roughly 20 years after he

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.040 
rotor system roughly 20 years after he
introduces<00:01:00.490> the<00:01:00.760> broker<00:01:01.120> mechanic<00:01:01.570> which

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
introduces the broker mechanic which

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.920 
introduces the broker mechanic which
earned<00:01:02.320> him<00:01:02.500> international<00:01:02.530> recognition

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
earned him international recognition

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.900 
earned him international recognition
this<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:05.110> an<00:01:05.199> advancement<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.160> system

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
this is an advancement of that system

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.940 
this is an advancement of that system
and<00:01:07.450> it<00:01:08.440> uses<00:01:10.020> one-piece<00:01:11.020> rod<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:11.619> keeper

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
and it uses one-piece rod and keeper

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.540 
and it uses one-piece rod and keeper
construction<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.260> curved<00:01:14.260> coupling<00:01:14.710> rods<00:01:14.890> so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
construction and curved coupling rods so

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.080 
construction and curved coupling rods so
it's<00:01:16.450> very<00:01:16.840> very<00:01:17.350> stable<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.190> that<00:01:18.790> means

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
it's very very stable and that means

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.690 
it's very very stable and that means
that<00:01:19.540> there's<00:01:19.960> much<00:01:20.410> less<00:01:20.770> wear<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.490> friction

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
that there's much less wear and friction

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.150 
that there's much less wear and friction
as<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:23.050> flute<00:01:23.440> is<00:01:23.560> played<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.740> design

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
as the flute is played also the design

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.999 
as the flute is played also the design
of<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.580> flute<00:01:27.880> allows<00:01:28.330> for<00:01:28.780> each<00:01:28.960> key<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.860> be

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
of the flute allows for each key to be

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.940 
of the flute allows for each key to be
individually<00:01:30.700> balanced<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:32.140> that's<00:01:32.440> why<00:01:32.890> you

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
individually balanced so that's why you

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.040 
individually balanced so that's why you
can<00:01:33.220> really<00:01:33.610> perfect<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.360> way<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.810> feels

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
can really perfect the way that it feels

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.800 
can really perfect the way that it feels
a<00:01:35.200> need<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.710> actually<00:01:36.070> can<00:01:36.430> choose<00:01:36.880> the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
a need so I actually can choose the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.710 
a need so I actually can choose the
pressure<00:01:38.650> of<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.100> springs<00:01:39.490> just<00:01:40.119> as<00:01:40.300> I<00:01:40.420> want

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
pressure of the springs just as I want

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.690 
pressure of the springs just as I want
correct<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:41.470> can<00:01:41.619> have<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.800> very<00:01:42.130> light<00:01:42.460> touch

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
correct you can have a very light touch

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.240 
correct you can have a very light touch
which<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.509> long<00:01:43.810> yes<00:01:44.110> so<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.560> can<00:01:44.590> balance<00:01:44.950> the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
which I long yes so you can balance the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.690 
which I long yes so you can balance the
action<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:46.300> your<00:01:46.420> taste<00:01:46.690> that's<00:01:47.470> great<00:01:47.860> does

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
action to your taste that's great does

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.400 
action to your taste that's great does
the<00:01:48.880> system<00:01:49.119> doesn't<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:49.899> anything<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.320> do

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
the system doesn't have anything to do

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.410 
the system doesn't have anything to do
with<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.619> cops<00:01:51.009> because<00:01:51.550> I<00:01:51.580> love<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.179> touch

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
with the cops because I love the touch

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.190 
with the cops because I love the touch
of<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.780> car

comprised of drop forged keys so what

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.660 
comprised of drop forged keys so what
that<00:02:40.150> means<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.250> instead<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.310> the

the Miyazawa mechanism is made of solid
pieces<00:02:53.349> of<00:02:53.590> metal<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.010> are<00:02:54.130> then<00:02:54.280> pressed

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
pieces of metal that are then pressed

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.229 
pieces of metal that are then pressed
into<00:02:55.290> place<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.680> form<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.430> key<00:02:57.549> cups<00:02:57.819> in<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
into place to form the key cups in the

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.539 
into place to form the key cups in the
mechanism<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.079> that<00:02:59.109> means<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.400> has

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
mechanism and that means that it has

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.550 
mechanism and that means that it has
never<00:03:00.700> been<00:03:00.880> melted<00:03:01.600> down<00:03:01.720> like<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.170> it

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
never been melted down like that it

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.160 
never been melted down like that it
maintains<00:03:03.130> its<00:03:03.430> structural<00:03:04.269> integrity<00:03:04.359> is

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
maintains its structural integrity is

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.949 
maintains its structural integrity is
that<00:03:05.470> why<00:03:05.680> not<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.370> white<00:03:06.970> feels<00:03:07.359> so<00:03:07.690> good

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
that why not is that white feels so good

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.930 
that why not is that white feels so good
that's<00:03:08.170> one<00:03:08.440> reason<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:08.889> feels<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.430> good<00:03:09.670> and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
that's one reason it feels so good and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.030 
that's one reason it feels so good and
one<00:03:10.090> reason<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.569> they're<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:10.780> stable<00:03:11.290> um

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
one reason that they're so stable um

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.030 
one reason that they're so stable um
another<00:03:12.639> reason<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.690> broker<00:03:13.900> system<00:03:14.200> so

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
another reason is the broker system so

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160 
another reason is the broker system so
tell<00:03:15.250> me<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.519> broker<00:03:15.850> system<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.810> all<00:03:16.930> we<00:03:17.079> can

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
tell me the broker system and all we can

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.890 
tell me the broker system and all we can
see<00:03:17.410> here<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:17.920> smooth<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.489> easy<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:19.630> it

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
see here is so smooth and easy is it

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.319 
see here is so smooth and easy is it
smooth<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:20.290> easy<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.709> backside<00:03:21.310> -<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:22.030> is

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
smooth and easy on the backside - it is

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.990 
smooth and easy on the backside - it is
it<00:03:22.989> employs<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.350> use<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:24.459> broker<00:03:24.790> thumb

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
it employs the use of the broker thumb

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.449 
it employs the use of the broker thumb
key<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:26.709> one<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.130> defining

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
key and that is one of the defining

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.699 
key and that is one of the defining
features<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.510> rotor<00:03:28.690> system<00:03:28.959> isn't<00:03:29.440> that

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
features of the rotor system isn't that

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.550 
features of the rotor system isn't that
thing<00:03:29.859> that<00:03:29.980> goes<00:03:30.220> on<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.519> side<00:03:30.850> it<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.569> the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
thing that goes on the side it is the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.220 
thing that goes on the side it is the
rod<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.489> roughly<00:03:34.000> double<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.480> length<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:35.049> a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
rod is roughly double the length of a

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.979 
rod is roughly double the length of a
traditional<00:03:35.799> funky<00:03:36.250> design<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:36.880> its<00:03:37.569> angle

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
traditional funky design and its angle

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.879 
traditional funky design and its angle
so<00:03:38.410> it's<00:03:38.980> longer-lasting<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:40.560> allows<00:03:41.560> the

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
so it's longer-lasting and allows the

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.009 
so it's longer-lasting and allows the
flute<00:03:42.099> maker<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.670> use<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:42.940> traditional<00:03:43.359> spring

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
flute maker to use a traditional spring

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.620 
flute maker to use a traditional spring
rather<00:03:44.530> than<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:45.040> flat<00:03:45.250> Springs<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.389> that

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
rather than the flat Springs so is that

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.569 
rather than the flat Springs so is that
white<00:03:46.870> kind<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.349> feels<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:47.889> smooth<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.400> is

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
white kind of feels so smooth it is

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.589 
white kind of feels so smooth it is
using<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.440> second<00:03:50.440> standard<00:03:50.889> spring<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.730> is

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
using the second standard spring it is

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.740 
using the second standard spring it is
much<00:03:53.230> more<00:03:53.440> responsive<00:03:54.099> and<00:03:54.459> much<00:03:55.239> smoother

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
much more responsive and much smoother

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.870 
much more responsive and much smoother
