all<00:01:50.210> around<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.660> decided<00:01:51.230> to<00:01:51.410> put<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.710> centre

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
with the two because obviously we can't

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.950 
with the two because obviously we can't
have<00:01:54.950> dead<00:01:55.100> links<00:01:55.310> going<00:01:55.580> into<00:01:55.820> them<00:01:55.940> as<00:01:56.690> they

have dead links going into them as they

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.540

like<00:03:11.690> Marcelo<00:03:12.280> really<00:03:13.280> fast<00:03:13.519> he<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:13.790> actually

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
like Marcelo really fast he is actually

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.059 
like Marcelo really fast he is actually
quite<00:03:14.239> expensive<00:03:14.599> you<00:03:14.900> can<00:03:15.019> see<00:03:15.109> their<00:03:15.290> 46,000

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
quite expensive you can see their 46,000

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.640 
quite expensive you can see their 46,000
i<00:03:16.129> paid<00:03:16.310> for<00:03:16.579> him<00:03:16.700> kakkar<00:03:17.569> obviously<00:03:18.290> came<00:03:18.470> for

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
i paid for him kakkar obviously came for

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.080 
i paid for him kakkar obviously came for
about<00:03:18.799> four<00:03:19.069> thousand<00:03:19.549> but<00:03:19.670> i<00:03:19.700> had<00:03:19.819> to<00:03:19.849> put<00:03:20.030> a

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
about four thousand but i had to put a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.809 
about four thousand but i had to put a
9000<00:03:20.810> card<00:03:21.049> on<00:03:21.200> him<00:03:21.349> to<00:03:21.470> make<00:03:21.500> him<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.889> cm<00:03:22.459> from

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
9000 card on him to make him a cm from

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.509 
9000 card on him to make him a cm from
the<00:03:22.910> sea<00:03:23.180> am<00:03:23.480> position<00:03:23.989> now<00:03:24.769> what<00:03:25.340> we're

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
the sea am position now what we're

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.089 
the sea am position now what we're
looking<00:03:25.849> at<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.299> are<00:03:26.389> looking<00:03:26.660> at

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
looking at is we are looking at

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.199 
looking at is we are looking at
obviously<00:03:28.099> there's<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.730> bit<00:03:28.849> of<00:03:28.910> an<00:03:29.030> issue

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
obviously there's a bit of an issue

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.580 
obviously there's a bit of an issue
there<00:03:29.569> we'll<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:29.959> quickly<00:03:30.079> swap<00:03:30.440> them

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
there we'll just quickly swap them

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.280 
there we'll just quickly swap them
around<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.889> show<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.160> chemistry<00:03:31.549> has<00:03:31.760> updated

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
around to show the chemistry has updated

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.180 
around to show the chemistry has updated
you<00:03:33.290> can<00:03:33.440> see<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.919> we're<00:03:34.040> actually

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
you can see that we're actually

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.140 
you can see that we're actually
struggling<00:03:34.940> for<00:03:35.299> chemistry<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:37.220> past<00:03:37.910> or<00:03:38.120> a

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
struggling for chemistry for past or a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.059 
struggling for chemistry for past or a
these<00:03:38.510> two<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:38.930> actually<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.230> glitch<00:03:39.530> these<00:03:39.859> two

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
these two is actually a glitch these two

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.470 
these two is actually a glitch these two
should<00:03:40.250> also<00:03:40.459> actually<00:03:40.880> be<00:03:41.120> getting<00:03:41.209> full

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
should also actually be getting full

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.710 
should also actually be getting full
chemistry<00:03:42.019> or<00:03:42.700> they<00:03:43.700> will<00:03:43.849> be<00:03:43.910> in<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.329> second

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
chemistry or they will be in a second

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.849 
chemistry or they will be in a second
there<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:44.959> can<00:03:45.109> see<00:03:45.139> they've<00:03:45.470> got<00:03:45.650> full

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
there you can see they've got full

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.370 
there you can see they've got full
chemistry<00:03:46.250> now<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.389> needed<00:03:47.840> someone<00:03:48.079> that

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
chemistry now so I needed someone that

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.809 
chemistry now so I needed someone that
was<00:03:48.500> going<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.680> give<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:48.859> strong<00:03:49.220> link<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.609> pass

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
was going to give a strong link to pass

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.629 
was going to give a strong link to pass
story<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.510> probably<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:51.739> strong<00:03:52.160> link<00:03:52.370> to

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
story and probably get a strong link to

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.370 
story and probably get a strong link to
one<00:03:52.849> of<00:03:52.940> my<00:03:53.030> center<00:03:53.419> backs<00:03:53.599> so<00:03:53.930> what<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.290> decided

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
one of my center backs so what I decided

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.580 
one of my center backs so what I decided
to<00:03:54.829> do<00:03:55.130> with<00:03:55.760> go<00:03:56.030> with<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.660> one<00:03:57.109> of<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.319> better

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
to do with go with the one of the better

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.030 
to do with go with the one of the better
players<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:58.900> league<00:03:59.900> one<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.440> get<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.709> strong

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
players in league one to get that strong

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.710 
players in league one to get that strong
link<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.519> that<00:04:01.579> is<00:04:01.849> Sissoko<00:04:02.510> you're

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
link and that is Sissoko you're

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.110 
link and that is Sissoko you're
obviously<00:04:02.930> plays<00:04:03.260> for<00:04:03.560> PSG<00:04:04.190> along<00:04:04.669> with<00:04:04.879> these

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
obviously plays for PSG along with these

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.960 
obviously plays for PSG along with these
two<00:04:05.389> guys<00:04:05.629> and<00:04:05.959> gets<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:07.190> strong<00:04:07.459> link<00:04:07.639> to<00:04:07.790> pass

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
two guys and gets a strong link to pass

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.610 
two guys and gets a strong link to pass
story<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.629> is<00:04:08.900> going<00:04:09.109> to<00:04:09.200> need<00:04:09.349> to<00:04:09.500> get

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
story and is going to need to get

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.069 
story and is going to need to get
another<00:04:09.829> strong<00:04:10.220> link<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.760> be<00:04:10.940> able<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.540> avoid

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
another strong link to be able to avoid

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.500 
another strong link to be able to avoid
getting<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:13.519> know<00:04:13.639> a<00:04:13.669> punishment<00:04:14.150> on<00:04:14.419> the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
getting you know a punishment on the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.870 
getting you know a punishment on the
chemistry<00:04:14.780> front<00:04:15.169> so<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.620> decided<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.400> go<00:04:16.549> for

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
chemistry front so I decided to go for

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.430 
chemistry front so I decided to go for
Thiago<00:04:17.359> silver<00:04:17.690> again<00:04:17.900> makes<00:04:18.139> a<00:04:18.229> reappearance

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
Thiago silver again makes a reappearance

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.110 
Thiago silver again makes a reappearance
from<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.949> last<00:04:19.190> squad<00:04:19.430> builder<00:04:19.760> obviously

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
from the last squad builder obviously

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.510 
from the last squad builder obviously
links<00:04:20.419> up<00:04:20.599> with<00:04:20.630> these<00:04:20.989> three<00:04:21.349> guys<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.799> if<00:04:22.400> we

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
links up with these three guys and if we

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.459 
links up with these three guys and if we
go<00:04:22.699> here<00:04:22.970> now<00:04:23.210> we<00:04:23.539> will<00:04:23.690> see<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.260> they<00:04:24.440> are

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:24.469 
go here now we will see that they are

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.480 
go here now we will see that they are
all<00:04:24.919> getting<00:04:25.610> full<00:04:26.030> chemist

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
all getting full chemist

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.830 
all getting full chemist
at<00:04:26.610> least<00:04:26.789> they<00:04:26.910> will<00:04:27.090> be<00:04:27.210> when<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.360> shot<00:04:27.720> them

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
at least they will be when I shot them

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.570 
at least they will be when I shot them
round<00:04:28.080> there<00:04:28.259> you<00:04:28.380> go<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.099> all<00:04:29.340> online

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
round there you go so all online

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.020 
round there you go so all online
chemistry<00:04:30.360> except<00:04:31.430> Pastore<00:04:32.430> who<00:04:32.759> should

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
chemistry except Pastore who should

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.400 
chemistry except Pastore who should
actually<00:04:33.180> be<00:04:33.419> getting<00:04:33.479> full<00:04:33.810> chemistry<00:04:34.229> this

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
actually be getting full chemistry this

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.490 
actually be getting full chemistry this
glitch<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.710> really<00:04:35.220> winding<00:04:35.400> me<00:04:35.550> up<00:04:35.580> now<00:04:36.500> there

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
glitch is really winding me up now there

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.230 
glitch is really winding me up now there
we<00:04:37.650> go<00:04:37.770> there<00:04:38.009> all<00:04:38.039> get<00:04:38.430> in<00:04:38.550> line<00:04:39.060> chemistry

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
we go there all get in line chemistry

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.499 
we go there all get in line chemistry
like<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.750> expected<00:04:40.500> them<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.910> that<00:04:42.330> is

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
like I expected them to and that is

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.059 
like I expected them to and that is
actually<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.020> team<00:04:43.229> it's<00:04:43.410> very<00:04:43.620> very<00:04:43.889> good

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
actually the team it's very very good

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.920 
actually the team it's very very good
team<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.520> think<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.330> probably<00:04:45.360> cost

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
team I think that it probably cost

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.879 
team I think that it probably cost
around<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.880> 800<00:04:47.880> 29<00:04:48.720> maybe<00:04:49.169> a<00:04:49.259> million<00:04:49.530> coins

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
around the 800 29 maybe a million coins

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.550 
around the 800 29 maybe a million coins
coin<00:04:50.460> mark<00:04:50.789> I'm<00:04:51.000> not<00:04:51.150> really<00:04:51.330> sure<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.930> you

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560
