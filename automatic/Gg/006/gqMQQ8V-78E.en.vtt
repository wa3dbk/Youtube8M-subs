00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.130
 professionalism are you leaving 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.190
 I'm big from the south 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.519
 I can not pay it 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.109
 we still do not thank you 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:12.339
 Campo Grande, MS 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.389
 a6 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.159
 the government's response 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.179
 6 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.810
 but outside 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.249
 the number of 100 cds 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.429
 so it's like this 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.470
 he left 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.009
 gs 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.009
 as a result 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.670
 the horn 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.670
 I wanted him to pass 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.310
 Luís 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 who knows 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.010
 Sara 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 She's entering the second half. 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.380
 it's essential 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.990
 and tomorrow there's more 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.540
 he came from six months 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.660
 accounting 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.290
 so he opened that country a little 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.990
 the Scots 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.740
 On that day I leave 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.740
 the president of the acronym making 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.550
 three days trip 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.730
 besides citing 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.200
 what's up 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.210
 the television 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.360
 this loss 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.360
 the risk of being accessed 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.730
 but if he has 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.730
 he knew 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.730
 and with these people 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.320
 and you he 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.780
 already in the cities 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.180
 when they 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.640
 yet our infirmities form superb merrill lynch 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.450
 and all versions 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.310
 all countries are firm 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 and it's no wonder 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.560
 we are doing 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 the dead Palmares 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.149
 I thank the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.489

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.559
 what should they play 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.559
 and who participates 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.149
 pedro ii 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.339
 and who scored 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.939
 on balance 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.609
 so besides the rest 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:29.629
 of goal 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.829
 for all countries 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.259
 our luck abroad 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.779
 and happier 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:39.779
 if you reach 16 million in the air 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.989
 You have nothing to lose 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.069
 the guerrillas placement 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.169
 also to be avoided 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.169
 if there really is 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.879
 which also require from other countries other states 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.849
 silas jean ping 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.950

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.709
 our work 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.709
 our municipality 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.909
 I also wanted to be a mother. 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.139
 einar daza 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.069
 a woman 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.739
 the 60's 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.739
 across the city 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.779
 I want to know if marcelo teixeira 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.359
 that's why I say 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.719
 who to look 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.719
 a little and we can bring 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.999
 one of the venues 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.999
 in which legislatures 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.869

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.249
 said sanguinetti 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.249
 the sr 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.049
 no one can evaluate more time 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:02.729
 by the way 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.489
 the wreckage 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.749
 and uncorrected 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.749
 but one thing is certain 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:12.480
 What I do not 6 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.480

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.109
 Juan Perón 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.210
