00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
actually kind of looked good I figured

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.729 
actually kind of looked good I figured
that<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.620> by<00:00:55.800> myself<00:00:56.149> um<00:00:58.489> by<00:00:59.489> winning<00:00:59.730> bat

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
that out by myself um by winning bat

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
that out by myself um by winning bat
well<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.949> walls<00:01:02.550> fall<00:01:02.910> that's<00:01:03.210> probably

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
well how the walls fall that's probably

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.149 
well how the walls fall that's probably
what<00:01:03.690> you're<00:01:03.809> wondering<00:01:04.080> how<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.619> they<00:01:04.860> fall

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
what you're wondering how do they fall

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.359 
what you're wondering how do they fall
I'm<00:01:06.030> probably<00:01:06.659> been<00:01:07.380> telling<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> before

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
I'm probably been telling you before

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.780 
I'm probably been telling you before
redstone<00:01:09.270> alternatives<00:01:10.110> yes<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.280> back<00:01:11.549> here

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
redstone alternatives yes it's back here

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.100 
redstone alternatives yes it's back here
again<00:01:13.250> redstone<00:01:14.250> alternatives<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.540> use<00:01:15.840> um

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
again redstone alternatives you use um

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.340 
again redstone alternatives you use um
you<00:01:16.710> break<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.220> block<00:01:17.580> right<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.110> when<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you break this block right here when it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.039 
you break this block right here when it
sends<00:01:19.950> off<00:01:20.159> old<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.759> right<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.049> then

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
sends off old this one right here then

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.140 
sends off old this one right here then
that<00:01:22.409> will<00:01:23.310> fall<00:01:23.670> down<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.530> will<00:01:26.150> well

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that will fall down here it will well

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.499 
that will fall down here it will well
break<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.290> block<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.460> all<00:01:29.759> falls<00:01:30.360> down

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
break this block that all falls down

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.499 
break this block that all falls down
when<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.590> sign<00:01:31.979> breaks<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.970> will<00:01:33.270> fall

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
when that sign breaks that will fall

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.780 
when that sign breaks that will fall
down<00:01:33.860> because<00:01:34.860> they're<00:01:35.130> usually<00:01:35.310> would<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
down because they're usually would be a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.060 
down because they're usually would be a
gap<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.900> redstone<00:01:37.380> alternatives

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
gap there because redstone alternatives

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.440 
gap there because redstone alternatives
don't<00:01:38.750> regularly<00:01:39.750> um<00:01:40.079> put<00:01:40.590> down<00:01:41.090> his<00:01:42.090> dirt

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
don't regularly um put down his dirt

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.660 
don't regularly um put down his dirt
doesn't<00:01:42.659> fall<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> couldn't<00:01:44.250> replace<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
doesn't fall so I couldn't replace it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
doesn't fall so I couldn't replace it
with<00:01:44.759> dirt<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> put<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.140> substance

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
with dirt so I put it with a substance

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
with dirt so I put it with a substance
that<00:01:46.890> was<00:01:47.189> made<00:01:47.460> out<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> wall<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.149> i<00:01:48.180> put

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that was made out of the wall so i put

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
that was made out of the wall so i put
stand<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.079> exactly<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.430> tall<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.000> um<00:01:51.890> this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
stand there exactly as tall as um this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.940 
stand there exactly as tall as um this
so<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.420> complete<00:01:54.810> gap<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.530> been

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
so it's a complete gap that's been

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.459 
so it's a complete gap that's been
filled<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.460> when<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.479> sign<00:01:57.780> breaks<00:01:58.140> that

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
filled up when that sign breaks that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.899 
filled up when that sign breaks that
will<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.829> fall<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:01.680> probably<00:02:02.280> might

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
will all fall and it probably might

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.999 
will all fall and it probably might
crash<00:02:03.329> piece<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.840> how<00:02:03.990> much<00:02:04.200> i<00:02:04.350> use<00:02:04.619> redstone

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
crash piece of how much i use redstone

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.670 
crash piece of how much i use redstone
alternatives<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.969> goes<00:02:06.119> completely

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
alternatives because it goes completely

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.740 
alternatives because it goes completely
under<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> wall<00:02:08.360> walls<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.629> then

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
under all the wall walls and then

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080 
under all the wall walls and then
there's<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.080> dis<00:02:10.319> giant<00:02:10.709> gap<00:02:10.979> where

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
there's a dis giant gap where

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.880 
there's a dis giant gap where
the<00:02:12.330> walls<00:02:12.569> are<00:02:14.480> but<00:02:15.480> objectives<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> grip

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the walls are but objectives of the grip

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.850 
the walls are but objectives of the grip
game<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.849> use<00:02:18.120> um<00:02:18.420> chests<00:02:19.290> which<00:02:19.590> i<00:02:19.800> will

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
game you can use um chests which i will

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.000 
game you can use um chests which i will

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
just ok what when i write something it

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:45.370 
just ok what when i write something it
will<00:02:37.950> say<00:02:38.190> something<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.980> three<00:02:42.049> love

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.970 

and<00:03:03.150> then<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.810> would<00:03:03.960> take<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:06.060> lava<00:03:06.360> bucket

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
and then you would take the lava bucket

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.540 
and then you would take the lava bucket
and<00:03:08.690> use<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.930> three<00:03:10.170> times<00:03:10.440> okay<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.370> that's

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
and use it three times okay so that's

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.240 
and use it three times okay so that's
kind<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.850> how<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.180> works<00:03:12.500> I'll<00:03:13.500> also<00:03:13.530> place

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
