floor<00:00:48.360> heat<00:00:48.600> we're<00:00:48.750> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.900> pour<00:00:49.110> concrete

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
on this this pan alone will we'll have

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.650 
on this this pan alone will we'll have
ten<00:00:53.250> yards<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> concrete<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.330> which

ten yards of concrete which which

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
ten yards of concrete which which
equates<00:00:55.290> into<00:00:55.770> thirty<00:00:56.280> thousand<00:00:56.850> pounds<00:00:57.150> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
equates into thirty thousand pounds of

equates into thirty thousand pounds of
weight<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> pretty<00:00:58.530> substantial<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:59.519> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
weight which is pretty substantial for a

weight which is pretty substantial for a
float<00:01:00.089> like<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.629> we're<00:01:01.559> putting<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:01.920> lot<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
float like this we're putting a lot of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.810 
float like this we're putting a lot of
foam<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.659> foam<00:01:04.470> blocks<00:01:04.860> which<00:01:05.250> support

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
foam which are foam blocks which support

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.470 
foam which are foam blocks which support
which<00:01:06.090> create<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.400> lift<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.730> our<00:01:08.850> floats<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
which create a lift for our floats and

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.020 
which create a lift for our floats and
they<00:01:09.600> keep<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.500> float<00:01:10.800> from<00:01:11.190> sinking

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
they keep the the float from sinking

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.930 
they keep the the float from sinking
down<00:01:12.270> into<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.720> water<00:01:12.930> we'll<00:01:13.740> probably<00:01:14.400> have

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
down into the water we'll probably have

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.210 
down into the water we'll probably have
actually<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.870> have<00:01:16.110> 50<00:01:16.590> blocks<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
actually right now we have 50 blocks of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.510 
actually right now we have 50 blocks of
foam<00:01:17.490> which<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:17.940> which<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.990> 2<00:01:19.470> by<00:01:19.740> 2<00:01:19.800> by<00:01:20.220> 4

will be adding foam as we go what we're
going<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.180> try<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.690> is<00:02:03.930> we're<00:02:04.080> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.229> try

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
going to try to do is we're going to try

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.250 
going to try to do is we're going to try
to<00:02:04.560> keep<00:02:05.400> it<00:02:05.550> as<00:02:05.670> flat<00:02:05.820> as<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.270> can

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.520 

if<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:12.830> do<00:02:13.040> things<00:02:13.310> out<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.180> order<00:02:14.569> we'll<00:02:15.319> get<00:02:15.500> a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
if we do things out of order we'll get a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.680 
if we do things out of order we'll get a
twist<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.159> float<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.670> what<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.000> does<00:02:17.239> is

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
twist in the float and what that does is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.809 
twist in the float and what that does is
that<00:02:17.930> will<00:02:18.500> continue<00:02:18.950> up<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:19.280> roof<00:02:19.580> which

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
that will continue up to the roof which

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.460 
that will continue up to the roof which
would<00:02:19.970> cause<00:02:20.180> some<00:02:20.360> real<00:02:20.540> building<00:02:20.959> problems

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
would cause some real building problems

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.039 
would cause some real building problems
so<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:22.099> one<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.519> our<00:02:22.670> big<00:02:23.239> concerns<00:02:23.269> in<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
so that's one of our big concerns in the

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.050 
so that's one of our big concerns in the
construction<00:02:24.680> side<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.159> this<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.760> want<00:02:25.970> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
construction side of this is we want to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.240 
construction side of this is we want to
be<00:02:26.150> real<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:27.049> want<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.349> real<00:02:27.590> leery<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.010> how

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
be real we want to be real leery of how

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.550 
be real we want to be real leery of how
the<00:02:28.310> floats<00:02:28.730> sitting<00:02:29.209> we<00:02:30.019> want<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.260> keep<00:02:30.379> our

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
the floats sitting we want to keep our

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.740 
the floats sitting we want to keep our
foam<00:02:30.830> or<00:02:31.040> coming<00:02:31.340> back<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:31.819> do<00:02:31.970> but<00:02:32.390> adding

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
foam or coming back and do but adding

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.410 
foam or coming back and do but adding
foam<00:02:32.959> were<00:02:33.230> needed<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.160> keep<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.970> float<00:02:35.209> nice

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
foam were needed to keep the float nice

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.600 
foam were needed to keep the float nice
and<00:02:35.660> flat

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610
