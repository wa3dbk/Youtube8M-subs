00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that the holding early on in the fight

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 
that the holding early on in the fight
maybe<00:01:58.259> took<00:01:58.530> away<00:01:58.830> from<00:01:58.860> Pacquiao<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.820> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
maybe took away from Pacquiao and the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.700 
maybe took away from Pacquiao and the
referee<00:02:00.630> should<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.869> been<00:02:01.020> more<00:02:01.170> stringent

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710

unless<00:03:06.380> Kell<00:03:06.710> Brook<00:03:06.740> can<00:03:07.100> definitely

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
unless Kell Brook can definitely

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.390 
unless Kell Brook can definitely
guarantee<00:03:08.120> me<00:03:08.540> over<00:03:08.780> at<00:03:08.930> Wembley<00:03:09.350> fight<00:03:09.770> maybe

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
guarantee me over at Wembley fight maybe

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.210 
guarantee me over at Wembley fight maybe
woodsy<00:03:11.290> may<00:03:12.290> over<00:03:12.500> fighting<00:03:12.740> Kell<00:03:12.980> Brook<00:03:13.010> at

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
woodsy may over fighting Kell Brook at

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.500 
woodsy may over fighting Kell Brook at
Wembley<00:03:13.490> but<00:03:13.640> given<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.030> it's<00:03:14.270> away<00:03:14.480> from

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
Wembley but given that it's away from

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.090 
Wembley but given that it's away from
home<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.530> other<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.770> doubt

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
home and this that and the other I doubt

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.040 
home and this that and the other I doubt
it<00:03:16.340> he<00:03:16.610> likes<00:03:16.880> being<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.270> Vegas<00:03:17.450> that's<00:03:17.900> his

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
it he likes being in Vegas that's his

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.800 
it he likes being in Vegas that's his
stomping<00:03:19.040> ground<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.060> think<00:03:20.300> it's<00:03:20.600> most

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
stomping ground so I think it's most

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.300 
stomping ground so I think it's most
likely<00:03:20.900> we're<00:03:21.320> gonna<00:03:21.380> see<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.800> Miguel<00:03:22.070> Cotto
