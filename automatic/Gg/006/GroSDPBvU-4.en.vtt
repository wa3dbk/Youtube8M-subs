00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.190
 hey people what goes and wants 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.599
 Constructions like mine and that 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:15.820
 is this a kind of video now 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.130
 which a number of mine 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.210
 Interestingly knotted link is natural 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.670
 our you can you in the description 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.089
 like to watch and war over the 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.419
 Comments you have relatively many questions 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:30.220
 and two of the questions are relative to me 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.360
 I would be set up here now 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.820
 times answer and that as the first ob 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.100
 because I change the color of the walls 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.420
 could and yes of course you can do that and 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.540
 Here I would like to show you how 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.620
 that works the body again 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.060
 a bit more startling is already started 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.410
 fit is now i'm doing now 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.410
 Of course not nice that is now 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.460
 Just a provisional one 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.770
 We now have here in the direction 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:12.450
 as already said it is not 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:16.170
 nice but not beautiful but rarely text 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 a little bit more 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.929
 my God 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.619
 Rosenberg in some so now 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.670
 beautiful 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.060
 she now has your text and which 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.939
 annoys now but the back here the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.340
 wall gray is yes and that can be 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:51.689
 It's easy on you and it opens you up 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.610
 a little play here is play then goes 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.649
 here says no to this throw 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.060
 properties goes on rotation at 99 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.060
 that was of course the wrong one 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:10.170
 at 96 and then you have this here and 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.959
 then you could just do it all 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.060
 just a little bigger here just 100 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.730
 it's okay 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.079
 then I have a beautiful wall here 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.780
 yes and the wall is currently behind the 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.310
 text and now you click here the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.920
 turn that on from now makes that look 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:32.160
 one here on this ball and could not 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.260
 just the color that means you 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.709
 for example, your band in the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.819
 make red background and evaluate the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.989
 text stands in front of a red wall so 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:48.540
 Of course, you can talk about this red 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:50.790
 still quarrels number 1 ThÃ¼ringer so goes 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.780
 The whole and you can of course 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.389
 yet the whole course yet 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:09.120
 Do the whole thing like this 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:11.730
 so sideways represents social and that 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.329
 Works because I have a winter today 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.829
 plans just as it makes quite simply a 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.810
 a little bit bigger so it fits and 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.310
 then you have here at the side too 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.260
 again a band we tackle with 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.120
 right click I have now already 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.439
 power is finally over 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.990
 oversized to the thing again with 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.580
 the colors green 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.060
 As you can see , here is one 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.810
 green yellow room in the home in the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.890
 middle text beach is good that was the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.370
 first question i hope i could give you 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.330
 to help a bit 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.330
 I want her husband to be her 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.220
 the second question was if you were not 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.900
 could the text fly in yes and 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.980
 Of course, that is also possible 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.550
 we need those down here again 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.680
 keyframes in the intro, he would have to 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.320
 the camera keyframes work that is 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.600
 Towns reacted made pine here 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.740
 made a key frame here and makes 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.150
 then the camera has moved 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.190
 but you can also do all this with the 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.040
 text that means she will be the text 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:20.150
 with right click cd for my sake here 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.920
 to ten cherries and created easily 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.990
 anti especially here on this key 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.840
 click or edit 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.420
 then always go a little to 35 and 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.740
 See the text as much as you used to 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:38.470
 then you go for my sake before m60 and 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:42.050
 then draws the text into the picture 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.480
 because of me here and if now through 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:51.260
 the camera we see that the 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.490
 text from there is now like 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.170
 already said I come nice and also 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.950
 I have something uncreative , I hope 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.650
 could still help you and do so 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.750
 you do that 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.310
 as I said I link that 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.310
 to find tutorial video
