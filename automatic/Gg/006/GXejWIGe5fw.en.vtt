00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.469
 he starts removing it 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.569
 This crime and failure to execute decide to 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.750
 he asked when it appears is this 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.980
 are files that at the moment you are using in some way something 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.969
 which is open but they are being used 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.969
 but it's for you to do the cleaning you come here 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.559
 you have to close that window and go back to the current window 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.039
