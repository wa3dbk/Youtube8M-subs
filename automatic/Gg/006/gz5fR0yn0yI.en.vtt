definitely<00:00:40.900> a<00:00:40.930> little<00:00:41.140> draw<00:00:41.470> I<00:00:41.830> can<00:00:42.129> get<00:00:42.309> it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
definitely a little draw I can get it

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.100 
definitely a little draw I can get it
down<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.610> about<00:00:42.850> 15<00:00:43.510> Millions

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.530 

so<00:04:14.340> basically<00:04:14.730> um<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:17.430> ratio<00:04:17.760> we<00:04:17.910> changed<00:04:18.450> the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
so basically um the ratio we changed the

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.440 
so basically um the ratio we changed the
ratio<00:04:18.870> when<00:04:19.020> we<00:04:19.140> go<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.910> outer<00:04:20.910> chap<00:04:21.239> with

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
ratio when we go to the outer chap with

ratio when we go to the outer chap with
an<00:04:21.570> old<00:04:21.690> town<00:04:25.790> that's<00:04:26.790> about<00:04:26.940> as<00:04:27.060> low<00:04:27.240> as<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.480> can

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
an old town that's about as low as I can

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.190 
an old town that's about as low as I can
get<00:04:27.840> it

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
get it

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.520 
get it
14<00:04:28.920> 15<00:04:29.130> milliamps<00:04:29.820> but<00:04:30.090> that's<00:04:31.050> pretty<00:04:31.290> neat

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
14 15 milliamps but that's pretty neat

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.610 
14 15 milliamps but that's pretty neat
because<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:32.100> bulb<00:04:33.000> requires<00:04:33.480> 48<00:04:34.050> milliamps

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
because that bulb requires 48 milliamps

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.370 
because that bulb requires 48 milliamps
at<00:04:34.740> 120<00:04:35.400> volts<00:04:36.110> here<00:04:37.110> we<00:04:37.260> are<00:04:37.380> running<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:37.890> on

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
at 120 volts here we are running it on

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.770 
at 120 volts here we are running it on
14<00:04:40.380> million<00:04:41.190> 12<00:04:41.850> volts<00:04:42.680> that's<00:04:43.680> pretty<00:04:43.890> cool

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
14 million 12 volts that's pretty cool

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.950 
14 million 12 volts that's pretty cool
so<00:04:45.780> all<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.080> need<00:04:46.200> is<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.730> transformer<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:48.810> may

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
so all you need is a transformer you may

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.370 
so all you need is a transformer you may
have<00:04:49.170> one<00:04:49.410> get<00:04:49.920> one<00:04:50.100> at<00:04:50.220> RadioShack<00:04:51.080> and<00:04:52.080> you

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
have one get one at RadioShack and you

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.070 
have one get one at RadioShack and you
need<00:04:52.590> a<00:04:52.830> non<00:04:53.280> dimmable<00:04:53.760> light<00:04:54.420> bulb<00:04:54.660> I'm<00:04:54.930> using

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
need a non dimmable light bulb I'm using

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.290 
need a non dimmable light bulb I'm using
the<00:04:55.350> 3<00:04:55.620> watt<00:04:55.770> Philips<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:57.630> 3<00:04:57.900> watt<00:04:58.080> GE

nuns<00:05:00.300> work<00:05:00.660> real<00:05:00.870> well<00:05:01.110> they<00:05:01.980> will<00:05:02.220> flash<00:05:02.550> when

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
nuns work real well they will flash when

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.770 
nuns work real well they will flash when
you<00:05:03.090> hook<00:05:03.270> them<00:05:03.360> up<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.590> straight<00:05:04.590> 12<00:05:04.920> volt<00:05:05.780> but

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
you hook them up to straight 12 volt but

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.300 
you hook them up to straight 12 volt but
they<00:05:06.870> won't<00:05:07.050> run<00:05:07.260> like<00:05:07.470> this<00:05:07.650> until<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:08.070> throw

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
they won't run like this until you throw

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.980 
they won't run like this until you throw
them<00:05:08.370> through<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.580> transformer<00:05:09.150> so<00:05:09.300> enjoy<00:05:09.750> I

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
them through a transformer so enjoy I

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.830 
them through a transformer so enjoy I
hope<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.470> have<00:05:10.590> fun<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.150> I'm<00:05:12.150> sure<00:05:12.420> many<00:05:12.660> of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
hope you have fun and I'm sure many of

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.330 
hope you have fun and I'm sure many of
you<00:05:12.960> can<00:05:12.990> come<00:05:13.290> up<00:05:13.410> with<00:05:13.440> some<00:05:13.740> better<00:05:13.890> ways<00:05:14.100> to

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
you can come up with some better ways to

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.520 
you can come up with some better ways to
do<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:14.640> and<00:05:14.700> get<00:05:15.420> the<00:05:15.540> amp<00:05:15.660> draw<00:05:15.870> down<00:05:16.140> or<00:05:16.410> the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
do this and get the amp draw down or the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.800 
do this and get the amp draw down or the
brightness<00:05:16.770> up<00:05:17.100> this<00:05:17.700> is<00:05:17.910> just<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.150> first<00:05:18.510> try

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
brightness up this is just a first try

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.050 
brightness up this is just a first try
so<00:05:18.840> hopefully<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.860> sparks<00:05:20.250> some<00:05:20.490> some

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
so hopefully it sparks some some

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.790 
so hopefully it sparks some some
interest<00:05:21.450> in<00:05:21.630> some<00:05:21.930> more<00:05:22.650> exploring<00:05:22.890> Thanks
