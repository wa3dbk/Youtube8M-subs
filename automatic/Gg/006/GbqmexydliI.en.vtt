00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
full coverage that could give you with

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
full coverage that could give you with

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
maybe adding an extra layer or applying

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770

it's<00:02:16.720> really<00:02:17.140> stayed<00:02:17.470> put<00:02:17.770> which<00:02:17.890> is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
it's really stayed put which is

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.010 
it's really stayed put which is
something<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.340> I've<00:02:18.580> never<00:02:18.819> had<00:02:19.240> with<00:02:19.900> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
something that I've never had with the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.320 
something that I've never had with the
foundation<00:02:20.530> before<00:02:20.709> I'm<00:02:21.130> not<00:02:21.280> 100%<00:02:21.730> sure<00:02:22.030> why

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
foundation before I'm not 100% sure why

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.510 
foundation before I'm not 100% sure why
but<00:02:22.600> most<00:02:22.870> foundations<00:02:23.380> tend<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.860> break<00:02:24.100> up<00:02:24.340> on

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
but most foundations tend to break up on

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.030 
but most foundations tend to break up on
me<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.720> kind<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.170> disappear<00:02:26.920> completely

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
me and just kind of disappear completely

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.470 
me and just kind of disappear completely
and<00:02:27.370> look<00:02:27.520> like<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.760> don't<00:02:27.819> have<00:02:28.030> anything<00:02:28.270> on

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
and look like I don't have anything on

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.640 
and look like I don't have anything on
but<00:02:29.080> this<00:02:29.260> lasts<00:02:30.190> all<00:02:30.400> day<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:31.060> swear<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.350> it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
but this lasts all day I swear to you it

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.220
