00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
is going to swing on top of this paper

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.070 
is going to swing on top of this paper
right<00:03:24.709> here<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:27.650> that

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.550 

so<00:03:31.080> one<00:03:31.200> more<00:03:31.379> time<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:32.760> thumb<00:03:33.560> middle

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
so one more time that thumb middle

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.259 
so one more time that thumb middle
finger<00:03:35.120> out<00:03:36.650> index<00:03:37.650> finger<00:03:38.099> and<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.940> bring<00:03:39.150> it

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
finger out index finger and you bring it

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.660 
finger out index finger and you bring it
back<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:40.159> that's<00:03:41.159> going<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.400> take<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.519> lot<00:03:41.610> of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
back in that's going to take a lot of

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.180 
back in that's going to take a lot of
practice<00:03:42.060> also<00:03:42.239> keeping<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.840> balance<00:03:43.190> keeping

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
practice also keeping a balance keeping

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.110 
practice also keeping a balance keeping
it<00:03:44.370> from<00:03:44.519> falling<00:03:44.790> off<00:03:46.129> once<00:03:47.129> you<00:03:47.220> get<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.549> it

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
it from falling off once you get it it

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.390 
it from falling off once you get it it
comes<00:03:48.390> pretty<00:03:48.599> easy<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:49.170> can<00:03:49.290> get<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.560> pretty

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
comes pretty easy you can get it pretty

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.880 
comes pretty easy you can get it pretty
quickly<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.799> that<00:03:54.319> so<00:03:55.319> now<00:03:55.470> once<00:03:55.739> again

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
quickly just like that so now once again

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.830 
quickly just like that so now once again
what<00:03:56.099> you've<00:03:56.250> done<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.640> you've<00:03:56.940> cycled<00:03:57.239> this

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
left so that

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.650 
left so that
packet<00:06:36.270> can<00:06:36.390> draw<00:06:36.690> from<00:06:36.900> this<00:06:37.050> packet<00:06:38.660> then

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
packet can draw from this packet then

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.420 
packet can draw from this packet then
you<00:06:39.780> get<00:06:39.960> moved<00:06:40.170> to<00:06:40.320> the<00:06:40.410> right<00:06:40.620> so<00:06:41.190> this

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
you get moved to the right so this

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.660 
you get moved to the right so this
packet<00:06:41.850> can<00:06:42.000> rotate<00:06:42.470> 180<00:06:43.470> degrees<00:06:43.680> on<00:06:44.190> top<00:06:44.520> of

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
packet can rotate 180 degrees on top of

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.980 
packet can rotate 180 degrees on top of
the<00:06:44.760> stack<00:06:45.320> just<00:06:46.320> like<00:06:46.590> that<00:06:47.720> and<00:06:48.720> then<00:06:48.870> you're

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
the stack just like that and then you're

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.520 
the stack just like that and then you're
done<00:06:49.580> so<00:06:50.580> once<00:06:50.730> again<00:06:50.850> you're<00:06:51.180> going<00:06:51.420> to<00:06:51.600> Sybil
