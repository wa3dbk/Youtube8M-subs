00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 I am that boy chosen to shine for 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.010
 propagate light in this time of 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.840
 darkness I have so many people hope 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.540
 from me, no matter how difficult it is in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.040
 I can not fail you very well 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.230
 people how are you I'm strong 96 and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.480
 welcome to a new opinion video 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 in a basically opinion video not 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.869
 let's touch the subject of reflections already 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.119
 you know that I only always reserve it for 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.859
 Sunday for the most successful section 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 of the channel that the truth last week 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.640
 had an incredible success and I hope that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.990
 this one is repeated with the new reflection 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.399
 I have prepared 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.630
 then as you see in the title I tell you 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.670
 I 'm sure many of you have come 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.489
 just to watch this video and it's 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.980
 reasons to buy a nintendo 2 from 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.370
 that's not because I think that people 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.879
 you should buy this console leaving 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.840
 one side as many of you know the aspect 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.579
 physical is not the bad image that has not 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 as for its shape since it does not attract 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.730
 much in sight and I go although it seems 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 that can not that nonsense in fact to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.150
 more than one back say if it is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.220
 horrible this console had not 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.320
 however, I have a couple of anecdotes 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.550
 that's why I decided to upload this 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.580
 video 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.080
 that can animate more than one vale is the 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.400
 The main reason is why I give you 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.050
 I recommend this console simply 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.120
 by the strategy with which it has been 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.360
 taken out nintendo not that it would be the 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.020
 affordable is not to this nintendo ds 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.930
 affordable nintendo 3ds compact and I have 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.450
 three ds xl the biggest screens something 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.910
 that's your motto, I do not think if it was like that, 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.160
 I think I'm almost sure not then 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.870
 good nintendo where sanitize with 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.380
 sound so criticized that it says to people 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.480
 but why is this console now not 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.550
 basically people should think about the 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.530
 Christmas time is not also in that 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.300
 we are in a time of crisis is not time 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.670
 of global crisis and the time is approaching 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.170
 of Christmas in addition this console also 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.470
 has left 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.170
 supposedly the same day as pokemon x 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.020
 and what would be the main cause of this 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 console not according to my opinion each one 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.740
 can have yours 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.030
 I say sure a few others I 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.950
 comes from fica let's go to the shit zone 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.230
 free and light simply for that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.170
 then good 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.580
 as I say one of the factors 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.620
 fundamental is the price and I'm going to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.720
 proceed to tell some anecdotes what 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.670
 they passed me the other day that seems to be going 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.040
 to spend a whole good game was in the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.989
 game no and it was about two euros and a few 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.629
 people I know of 20 years ago and 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.450
 then all of a sudden they are in the 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.239
 reyno and see a poster of the nintendo two 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.980
 fingers of that then do not say 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.620
 look at them I hear I turned around and I say 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.930
 and they get to talk to on the poster 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.610
 no and they say if it's new is very 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.910
 cheap for what usually cost the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.620
 console and clear holes and that's why 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.810
 so the console has come out not for 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.519
 be affordable to be cheap and it's because 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.040
 what these people after I heard them 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.810
 comments in the were going to get caught when 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.670
 come out on the 12th or later that is no longer 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 I know when they're going to get caught like that 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.630
 we will see again in my life but 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.070
 good 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.100
 that would be one of the anecdotes 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.950
 principals not like those people who do not 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.310
 has a high purchasing power thanks 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.930
 to the nintendo offer has gotten 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.150
 have enough money not for 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.540
 enjoy those games that many people 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.209
 he says is that it is a 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.950
 without two of and of course is that you say but 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.069
 let's say it's a lot more 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.670
 cheap 120 130 dollars it seems to me that 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.409
 they cost and 200 what is the xl not that is 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.739
 it is currently the most sold in japan 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.900
 the xl then is one of the reasons 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.980
 main other reason for example that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.439
 it has happened to me that I was 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.310
 thinking about buying this console I have 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:52.430
 here I find volume trains 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.520
 with the pokemon is not served is the pokemon 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.110
 and well recently this console is going 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.050
 fatal the joystick and since he fell the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.849
 my brother beaten these buttons are 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.459
 different breasts like you three times these 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.819
 they are more involved and to repair it 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.580
 cost 100 euros and the power button 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.530
 It is also very busy then I get 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.260
 and if I wanted to change the output housing 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.930
 because it seems that he told me more about the 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.500
 entire console that would be more than 150 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.120
 euros prepare it and then good 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.940
 basically that's why I 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.630
 I pose to buy this console 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.130
 I guess I'm not going to do it but 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.290
 imagined a kid in my situation 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.930
 because I'm not to buy our 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.080
 console neither joke and joke I do not have 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.900
 money to buy me another console 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.539
 so then I think it's a 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.889
 of the main causes leaving behind 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.990
 your thoughts not if you're 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.620
 thinking about buying this console let 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.830
 back those thoughts of is ugly is a 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.870
 3ds without three and in 3d because I 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.639
 frankly since he did not either 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.319
 I mean it is , I think the game 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.879
 mainly in which liu phage action 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.979
 typical luisa prism that was 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.509
 looking at the bookshelf criticize them 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.740
 prison and super mario 3d land that is 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:10.449
 where you really take advantage of that three of 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.889
 the games to monster hunter monster 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.569
 hunter study sessions and take it away 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.060
 because it was a bit annoying when it came to 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.550
 see the monsters but it comes then 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.160
 the 3d is and I hope it is the basis of 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.770
 the console I say yes very well 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.420
 but it is also dispensable and then 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.849
 another thing that people say says 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.770
 If that 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.889
 we'll see 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.759
 you take and do so the lever is like this 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.530
 of the 3 of the low and it is already and the axis 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.319
 if you do not want the 34 while 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.330
 I insist I insist that the price is worth 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.569
 or that gesture that you say is so 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:50.379
 easy you can assume about 70 euros for 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.669
 a person 70 euros that is not for nothing 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.039
 little is being what it costs you 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.930
 perfectly are not people at 5 not good 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.190
 I will not talk without knowing it but 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.789
 It can be more or less what it costs you 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.889
 the gta 5 or a game of 70 euros that already 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:06.009
 there are them as with the duty and me 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.419
 it cost 60 iago practically then 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.210
 well basically those are the reasons 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.669
 why you should buy good 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.340
 you should have and have to buy it if 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.509
 you have a lower purchasing power 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.060
 obviously if you have money to spare 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.740
 xl is the most suitable console for 200 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.719
 euros you have a course with better 3d 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.240
 with more battery with more size and more 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.710
 comfortable 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.620
 basically that's it 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.620
 Many will dismiss me as a fanboy and not for 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.230
 defend this nintendo console without 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.860
 But I think if you want it 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.810
 watch the video again 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.650
 because it's a console that seems to me 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.879
 very good very good not because 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.789
 technically not because it has the same 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:50.069
 battery that the nintendo 3ds is the same 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:54.449
 I think it was three hours of battery 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:55.800
 battery or two very little battery but that 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.500
 we could say that it is the low console 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.469
 low cost nintendo cost and it's for 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.120
 what I would recommend her to buy not 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:05.430
 tell me you're not console 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.110
 if it's crap for people who do not 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.569
 know that I'm sure you will not know 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.110
 is a single first crystal are not two 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:15.210
 as it is here one and here another touch only 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.490
 it is one flat and on the bottom 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.990
 It is touch and to save cost 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.990
 part of nintendo a pretty play 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.460
 intelligent not then basic that 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.009
 these are basically what I think what 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.819
 I think that the new console 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:32.759
 nintendo the nintendo ds sincerely no 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:35.340
 I think there's a need to say 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:37.560
 nothing more than just reviewing the 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.330
 low cost and for people with less 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.009
 purchasing level and the anecdotes that I 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.150
 have happened so you can see that this 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:45.280
 console I'm sure it would wipe out 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:48.640
 I dare not say that to overcome 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.810
 nintendo 3ds xl but surely surpass 

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.740
 aguayo 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:56.950
 something easy the ps vita to play 3 and xbox 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.050
 360 is what I think to overcome these 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.430
 consoles are all good guys I do not know 

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.800
 what do you think about this console 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:06.670
 you can leave it to me in the comments of 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:09.280
