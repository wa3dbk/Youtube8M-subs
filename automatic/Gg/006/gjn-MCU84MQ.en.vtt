farm without a spotter so we're gonna
start<00:00:06.540> by<00:00:06.720> doing<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:07.200> just<00:00:07.230> sticking<00:00:07.890> down<00:00:08.099> you

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
start by doing is just sticking down you

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.450 
start by doing is just sticking down you
don't<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.210> go<00:00:09.330> as<00:00:09.480> deep<00:00:09.690> as<00:00:09.900> I'm<00:00:10.050> going

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
don't have to go as deep as I'm going

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.539 
don't have to go as deep as I'm going
you<00:00:11.460> just<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.790> go<00:00:13.009> they<00:00:14.009> like<00:00:14.250> four

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
you just have to go they like four

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.960 
you just have to go they like four
blocks<00:00:14.730> deep<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:16.580> then<00:00:17.580> you're<00:00:17.820> going<00:00:17.910> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
blocks deep and then you're going to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.820 
blocks deep and then you're going to
start<00:00:18.920> digging<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.520> area<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.750> how<00:00:22.560> big

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
start digging out the area of how big

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.150 
start digging out the area of how big
your<00:00:23.250> mob<00:00:23.939> farm<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:25.160> doesn't

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
your mob farm is going to be doesn't

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.779 
your mob farm is going to be doesn't
have<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.519> any<00:00:26.699> certain<00:00:27.210> size<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.789> bigger

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
have to be any certain size just bigger

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.279 
have to be any certain size just bigger
probably<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> morning<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.109> going

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
probably the morning that you're going

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.760 
probably the morning that you're going
to<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.660> you're<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> place<00:00:34.200> torches

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
to get and you're going to place torches

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.139 
to get and you're going to place torches
too<00:00:35.899> so<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> mobs<00:00:37.320> don't<00:00:37.620> spawn<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.969> you're

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
too so the mobs don't spawn when you're

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.680 
too so the mobs don't spawn when you're
in<00:00:39.270> there<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.670> only<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.390> two

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
in there and it's only going to be two

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.100 
in there and it's only going to be two
blocks<00:00:46.500> high<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.600> start<00:00:51.899> by

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
blocks high and you can just start by

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.049 
blocks high and you can just start by
digging<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.559> outline<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.670> start

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
digging out the outline and then start

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
digging out the outline and then start
digging<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> middle<00:00:55.070> once<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
digging the middle once you got the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:10.190 
digging the middle once you got the
outline<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.880> press<00:01:09.150> f3<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.810> check

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
outline and you can press f3 to check

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.800 
outline and you can press f3 to check
your<00:01:10.890> coordinates<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.479> stuff

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
your coordinates at your at and stuff

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.730 
your coordinates at your at and stuff
and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.820> where<00:01:15.119> gravel<00:01:15.600> was<00:01:15.840> you're

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and then this is where gravel was you're

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.140 
and then this is where gravel was you're
probably<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.640> fill<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.880> back

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
probably going to want to fill it back

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.789 
probably going to want to fill it back
in<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:19.259> blocks<00:01:19.759> just<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.140> mobs<00:01:22.140> don't

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
in with some blocks just so mobs don't

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.090 
in with some blocks just so mobs don't
spawn<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.250> stuff<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
spawn in there and stuff like that and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
spawn in there and stuff like that and
then<00:01:29.100> you'll<00:01:29.280> lose<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.820> those<00:01:30.450> mobs<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
then you'll lose that those mobs that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.280 
then you'll lose that those mobs that
spawn<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.840> there<00:01:35.930> then<00:01:36.930> you're<00:01:37.170> going

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
spawn in the in there then you're going

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
spawn in the in there then you're going
to<00:01:37.350> count<00:01:37.710> towards<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> middle<00:01:38.820> once<00:01:39.180> your

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
to count towards the middle once your

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.620 
to count towards the middle once your
area<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.759> um<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:44.090> dug<00:01:45.090> through<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
area is all um you know dug through and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.010 
area is all um you know dug through and
stuff<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.000> you're<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
stuff and you're going to see what the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
stuff and you're going to see what the
middle<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.189> take<00:01:50.369> out<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.549> two

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
middle is and then just take out the two

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.660 
middle is and then just take out the two
blocks<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.920> you're<00:01:53.220> gonna<00:01:53.280> dig

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
blocks right there and you're gonna dig

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.170 
blocks right there and you're gonna dig
about<00:01:54.390> four<00:01:54.840> blocks<00:01:55.020> deep

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
about four blocks deep

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.540 
about four blocks deep
or<00:01:57.990> three<00:01:58.320> blocks<00:01:58.470> just<00:01:58.950> depends<00:01:59.250> how<00:01:59.310> big

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
or three blocks just depends how big

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.800 
or three blocks just depends how big
your<00:01:59.670> mob<00:01:59.820> farm<00:02:00.120> is<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:05.120> just<00:02:06.120> had<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.300> go<00:02:06.450> deeper

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
your mob farm is I just had to go deeper

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
your mob farm is I just had to go deeper
right<00:02:06.960> there<00:02:07.460> then<00:02:08.460> what<00:02:08.640> you're<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.940> do

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
right there then what you're going to do

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.880 
right there then what you're going to do
is<00:02:09.390> count<00:02:09.660> three<00:02:10.140> blocks<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:13.350> wall<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
is count three blocks from the wall and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.160 
is count three blocks from the wall and
a<00:02:14.700> two<00:02:15.570> blocks<00:02:16.580> all<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.610> way<00:02:17.970> down<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.990> like

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
a two blocks all the way down just like

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.340 
a two blocks all the way down just like
that<00:02:23.570> then<00:02:24.570> you're<00:02:24.870> going<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.020> play<00:02:25.290> some

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
that then you're going to play some

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.680 
that then you're going to play some
water<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.700> how<00:02:26.790> far<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.209> goes<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.540> then

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
water and see how far it goes and then

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.400 
water and see how far it goes and then
dig<00:02:28.020> one<00:02:28.320> block<00:02:28.560> deeper<00:02:29.750> with<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> water<00:02:31.050> keep

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
dig one block deeper with the water keep

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.160 
dig one block deeper with the water keep
going<00:02:32.180> if<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> stops<00:02:33.510> again<00:02:33.690> you're<00:02:33.989> going<00:02:34.080> to

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
going if it stops again you're going to

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:45.830 
going if it stops again you're going to
need<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.320> go<00:02:34.470> down<00:02:34.709> another<00:02:35.010> one<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:45.690> can

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
need to go down another one and you can

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.860 
need to go down another one and you can
put<00:02:46.080> some<00:02:46.320> signs<00:02:46.709> right<00:02:47.220> there<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
put some signs right there like the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.620 
put some signs right there like the
water<00:02:49.110> stopped<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:51.890> then<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.820> path<00:02:54.420> we're

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
water stopped and then that path we're

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.290 
water stopped and then that path we're
going<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.810> lead<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.200> central<00:02:56.300> water

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
going to lead to that central water

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.000 
going to lead to that central water
stream<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.709> you're<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> put<00:02:59.420> and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
stream and you're going to put and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.229 
stream and you're going to put and
you're<00:03:02.010> going<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.280> do<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.730> same<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> other

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
you're going to do the same to the other

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.910 
you're going to do the same to the other
side<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:06.049> you're<00:03:07.049> going<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.590> for<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
side and you're going to do that for the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.870 
side and you're going to do that for the
whole<00:03:07.950> thing<00:03:09.950> every<00:03:10.950> three<00:03:11.250> blocks<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:11.730> may

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
whole thing every three blocks you may

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.030 
whole thing every three blocks you may
have<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:14.120> decrease<00:03:15.120> your<00:03:15.180> farm<00:03:16.019> by<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> block<00:03:17.010> or

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
have to decrease your farm by a block or

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.850 
have to decrease your farm by a block or
two<00:03:17.280> depending<00:03:18.170> on<00:03:19.580> where<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.820> end<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:24.739> but<00:03:25.739> it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
two depending on where you end up but it

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.960 
two depending on where you end up but it
should<00:03:26.040> look<00:03:26.190> like<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:29.280> mid<00:03:29.489> middle

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
should look like that and the mid middle

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.960 
should look like that and the mid middle
part<00:03:30.209> you're<00:03:30.450> gonna<00:03:30.920> either<00:03:31.920> put<00:03:32.250> signs<00:03:32.580> or

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
part you're gonna either put signs or

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.570 
part you're gonna either put signs or
make<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.420> go<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:34.200> lower<00:03:36.920> like<00:03:37.920> dig<00:03:38.190> deeper

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
make it go like lower like dig deeper

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.280 
make it go like lower like dig deeper
every<00:03:38.970> time<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.390> water<00:03:39.600> stops<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.200> middle

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
every time the water stops in the middle

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.870 
every time the water stops in the middle
I<00:03:40.730> suggest<00:03:41.730> doing<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.840> digging<00:03:43.110> park<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
I suggest doing the digging park so the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.190 
I suggest doing the digging park so the
mobs<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.660> go<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.940> killing<00:03:48.600> machine

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
mobs can go to the killing machine

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.680 
mobs can go to the killing machine
faster<00:03:53.120> and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
faster and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.440 
faster and
instead<00:03:55.020> of<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.320> signs<00:03:55.620> because<00:03:56.070> they<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
instead of the signs because they the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.610 
instead of the signs because they the
signs<00:03:57.870> will<00:03:58.380> make<00:03:58.710> them<00:04:00.080> they'll<00:04:01.080> like<00:04:01.290> stop

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
signs will make them they'll like stop

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.210 
signs will make them they'll like stop
in<00:04:01.950> between<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.670> signs<00:04:03.380> for<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.770> don't<00:04:05.070> know

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
in between the signs for I don't know

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.310 
in between the signs for I don't know
how<00:04:05.280> long<00:04:05.610> but<00:04:05.940> they'll<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:06.870> take<00:04:06.990> longer

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
how long but they'll just take longer

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.800 
how long but they'll just take longer
for<00:04:07.500> them<00:04:07.770> to<00:04:07.980> get<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.430> where<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.670> want<00:04:08.940> then

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
for them to get to where you want then

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.840 
for them to get to where you want then
this<00:04:10.020> is<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.470> part<00:04:11.040> where<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.580> going<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.790> be

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
this is the part where it's going to be

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.350 
this is the part where it's going to be
like<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.240> killing<00:04:13.170> machine<00:04:13.440> here<00:04:13.710> if<00:04:14.670> there's

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
like the killing machine here if there's

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.600 
like the killing machine here if there's
a<00:04:15.480> way<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.720> can<00:04:16.019> wind<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.560> under<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.310> farm

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
a way you can wind it under the farm

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.880 
a way you can wind it under the farm
that<00:04:18.450> way<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.900> just<00:04:18.930> stand<00:04:19.350> under<00:04:19.799> the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
that way you can just stand under the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.880 
that way you can just stand under the
farm<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.280> your<00:04:20.370> collection<00:04:20.519> point<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.890> mobs

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
farm in your collection point and mobs

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.520 
farm in your collection point and mobs
can<00:04:23.220> spawn<00:04:23.520> easier<00:04:25.160> cuz<00:04:26.160> you're<00:04:26.640> just<00:04:27.530> under

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
can spawn easier cuz you're just under

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.890 
can spawn easier cuz you're just under
them<00:04:28.880> instead<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:29.910> being<00:04:30.150> far<00:04:30.450> away<00:04:30.540> because

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
them instead of being far away because

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.410 
them instead of being far away because
if<00:04:31.170> you're<00:04:31.320> far<00:04:31.530> enough<00:04:31.770> away<00:04:32.210> they<00:04:33.210> may<00:04:33.390> not

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
if you're far enough away they may not

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.610 
if you're far enough away they may not
spawn<00:04:35.030> like<00:04:36.030> at<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.330> end<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.630> your<00:04:36.780> farm<00:04:37.110> and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
spawn like at the end of your farm and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.200 
spawn like at the end of your farm and
you're<00:04:38.190> going<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.370> do<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.610> put<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.000> water

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
you're going to do that put the water

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.020 
you're going to do that put the water
right<00:04:39.450> there<00:04:40.040> that's<00:04:41.040> your<00:04:41.250> collection<00:04:41.820> room

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
right there that's your collection room

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.970 
right there that's your collection room
and<00:04:42.720> then<00:04:43.200> you're<00:04:43.320> going<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.470> count<00:04:43.740> eight

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
and then you're going to count eight

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.660 
and then you're going to count eight
blocks<00:04:45.230> and<00:04:47.090> put<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.210> sign<00:04:49.250> just<00:04:50.250> like<00:04:50.430> that

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
blocks and put the sign just like that

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.280 
blocks and put the sign just like that
that<00:04:51.390> way<00:04:51.690> when<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.110> add<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.590> last<00:04:53.420> water<00:04:54.420> the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
that way when you add the last water the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.090 
that way when you add the last water the
water<00:04:55.560> will<00:04:55.860> stop<00:04:56.280> right<00:04:57.030> before<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:58.740> goes

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
water will stop right before it goes

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.970 
water will stop right before it goes
down<00:04:59.460> into<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.330> other<00:05:00.540> water<00:05:00.950> you're<00:05:01.950> going

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
down into the other water you're going

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.180 
down into the other water you're going
to<00:05:02.130> put<00:05:02.280> place<00:05:02.610> two<00:05:02.850> signs<00:05:03.620> just<00:05:04.620> like<00:05:04.919> I<00:05:04.950> did

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
to put place two signs just like I did

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.980 
to put place two signs just like I did
on<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.950> sides<00:05:08.190> you're<00:05:09.120> gonna<00:05:09.210> put<00:05:09.390> lava<00:05:09.660> on

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
on the sides you're gonna put lava on

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:18.010 
on the sides you're gonna put lava on
them<00:05:12.080> that<00:05:13.080> way<00:05:13.440> just<00:05:13.860> like<00:05:13.980> that<00:05:14.190> eyes<00:05:14.430> and

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.790 

then<00:05:19.020> you're<00:05:19.169> going<00:05:19.260> to<00:05:19.320> take<00:05:19.500> all<00:05:19.680> the

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
then you're going to take all the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.030 
then you're going to take all the
porches<00:05:20.340> out<00:05:21.200> so<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.320> mobs<00:05:22.560> can<00:05:22.800> start

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
porches out so the mobs can start

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.720 
porches out so the mobs can start
spawning<00:05:23.840> it'll<00:05:24.840> look<00:05:24.900> like<00:05:25.080> that<00:05:25.730> and

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
spawning it'll look like that and

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.960 
spawning it'll look like that and
they'll<00:05:27.330> start<00:05:27.630> spawning<00:05:28.460> then<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.760> gonna

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
they'll start spawning then you gonna

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.990 
they'll start spawning then you gonna
want<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.450> actually<00:05:30.720> make<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.620> killing<00:05:32.520> part

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
want to actually make the killing part

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.440 
want to actually make the killing part
three<00:05:33.810> blocks<00:05:34.140> high<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.760> mobs<00:05:35.970> can<00:05:36.300> move

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
three blocks high so the mobs can move

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.430 
three blocks high so the mobs can move
in<00:05:36.660> there<00:05:37.280> through<00:05:38.280> there<00:05:38.490> faster<00:05:39.440> because

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
in there through there faster because

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.630 
in there through there faster because
they're<00:05:40.680> going<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.860> be<00:05:40.919> jumping<00:05:41.280> around<00:05:41.370> and

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
they're going to be jumping around and

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.180 
they're going to be jumping around and
stuff<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.900> then<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.169> a<00:05:43.200> lot<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.620> lava<00:05:43.890> part

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
stuff and then to a lot the lava part

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.080 
stuff and then to a lot the lava part
will<00:05:44.340> be<00:05:44.370> like<00:05:44.669> two<00:05:44.910> blocks<00:05:45.120> high<00:05:46.850> then<00:05:47.850> you're

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
will be like two blocks high then you're

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.400 
will be like two blocks high then you're
just<00:05:48.120> going<00:05:48.360> away<00:05:48.480> in<00:05:48.600> your<00:05:48.660> collection<00:05:48.870> point

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
just going away in your collection point

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.630 
just going away in your collection point
and<00:05:50.120> this<00:05:51.120> can<00:05:51.300> get<00:05:51.450> you<00:05:52.070> pretty<00:05:53.070> good<00:05:53.310> amount

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
and this can get you pretty good amount

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.500 
and this can get you pretty good amount
of<00:05:53.730> things

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
of things

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.660 
of things
sometimes<00:05:56.440> my<00:05:56.620> mobs<00:05:56.890> aren't<00:05:57.220> coming<00:05:57.490> as<00:05:57.640> fast

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
sometimes my mobs aren't coming as fast

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.350 
sometimes my mobs aren't coming as fast
because<00:05:58.420> I<00:05:59.010> uses<00:06:00.010> the<00:06:00.190> signs<00:06:00.460> in<00:06:00.910> the<00:06:01.000> middle

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
because I uses the signs in the middle

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.010 
because I uses the signs in the middle
part<00:06:01.720> of<00:06:01.930> the<00:06:02.260> water<00:06:02.920> stream<00:06:03.870> instead<00:06:04.870> of

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
part of the water stream instead of

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:12.830 
part of the water stream instead of
digging<00:06:05.230> deeper<00:06:06.570> and<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:08.560> wasn't<00:06:09.040> as<00:06:09.660> good<00:06:11.820> so

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
digging deeper and it wasn't as good so

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.700 
digging deeper and it wasn't as good so
