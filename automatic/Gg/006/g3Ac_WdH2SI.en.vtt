 app 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.220

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.140
 the right and left or both with 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:05.860
 these squares 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:08.860
 you can change the position with this with 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.740
 this button you show the keyboard 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.850
 so you can prevent the 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:20.170
 keyboard are in the same area of ​​operation 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.540
 application or disable how I use the 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.900
 left hand 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.730
 This way it's better for me here in 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.730
 preferences when you do not want to use 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.310
 the application you enter and disable the 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.970
 it without leaving the application here 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.830
 works most in the application here 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:48.430
 It is on the mark that had this 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:51.580
 box categorization manual what's this 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.200
 it may be that an application is in the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.400
 wrong category or simply you 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.430
 Do you want to change for this you hold the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.550
 application and changes the 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:12.670
