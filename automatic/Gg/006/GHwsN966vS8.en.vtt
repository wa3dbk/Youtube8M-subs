00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:15.410
 yes the tesla model s is breathtakingly beautiful 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.270
 and yes he would go from 0 to 4.4 in 4.4 seconds 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.650
 100 km per hour we have to be able to 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.350
 accelerate 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.190
 yes this is an abandoned runway of one 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.190
 former airport 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.590
 the tesla model s is a pop star out of four 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.440
 wheels with the international auto press 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.470
 like screaming girls to be 21 inches 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.090
 rims it is not hard to see 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.120
 why 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.190
 tesla is pip and young car brand while the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.600
 established order for years 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.340
 was experimenting with 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.380
 electric drive 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.820
 the spoon jenks the ordinary pile of laptop 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.230
 batteries in a lightweight 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.690
 sports car 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.390
 and that works 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.490
 Mercedes has been going fast in recent years 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.150
 has just taken an interest in tesla 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.150
 as toyota 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.720
 and then in 2013 there suddenly appears one 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.480
 desirable sports sedan in the show 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.220
 with a range of which the existing 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.030
 electric car manufacturers 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.460
 get the screen red on the jaws 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.299
 the average electric car is coming up 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.900
 a load stream 150 km far if you 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.369
 are lucky 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.880
 the model s has a radius of action 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.830
 You can go there for 500 kilometers in theory 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.080
 not only to work but also 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.770
 to grandma or a romantic weekend in 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.770
 Brussels 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.610
 but first this the tesla models 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.720
 not only has an impressive 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.130
 driving range 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.530
 He also jumps faster to the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.530
 100 km per hour but a Porsche 911 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.039
 the tesla performs well 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.990
 but is also thirsty 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.910
 fortunately the car is so developed that 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.400
 He has large amounts of electricity 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.690
 can take but the dutch 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.040
 charging stations 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.040
 don't always give it off 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.640
 if you hit the wrong charging station 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.200
 on the tesla only 12 kilometers per hour 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.240
 go inside 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.240
 there you are on your business appointment 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.630
 may i also sleep 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.580
 fast loading is also possible with the models s but 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.210
 then only quick charging points that go through 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.770
 tesla itself have been developed and then there is 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.170
 still the price 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:56.840
 the model s is only from 69,000 euros 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.310
 hey for real superstar 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.520
 you just have to go deep in the pouch 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.520
 to grope
