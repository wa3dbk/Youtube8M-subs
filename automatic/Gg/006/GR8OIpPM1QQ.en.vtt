00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.460 
might take your glasses off for this
part<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.180> do<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.660> top<00:02:17.870> half<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.500> side

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
part and I do the top half of the side

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.339 
part and I do the top half of the side
and<00:02:21.819> you'll<00:02:22.819> see<00:02:23.060> these<00:02:23.300> ones<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.750> did<00:02:23.959> towards

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
and you'll see these ones I did towards

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.000 
and you'll see these ones I did towards
the<00:02:24.500> back<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.069> these<00:02:25.700> ones<00:02:25.970> i'm<00:02:26.180> doing<00:02:26.480> down

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
the back and these ones i'm doing down

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.170 
the back and these ones i'm doing down
so<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.700> helps<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.780> way<00:02:29.959> they<00:02:30.349> end<00:02:30.819> by<00:02:31.819> doing

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
so it helps the way they end by doing

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.059 
so it helps the way they end by doing
them<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.629> direction<00:02:32.989> then<00:02:33.709> i<00:02:33.830> come<00:02:34.040> over

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
them in that direction then i come over

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.009 
them in that direction then i come over
here<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.610> at<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.819> top<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:35.330> one<00:02:35.569> now<00:02:35.989> i

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
here and at the top of this one now i

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.290
