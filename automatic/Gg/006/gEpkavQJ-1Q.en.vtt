00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.930 

I<00:00:04.590> have<00:00:05.590> once<00:00:05.770> again<00:00:05.980> this<00:00:06.100> is<00:00:06.279> Robert<00:00:06.670> with

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:06.940 
I have once again this is Robert with

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.830 
I have once again this is Robert with
clean<00:00:07.420> pull<00:00:07.750> and<00:00:07.899> spa<00:00:08.080> in<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.760> video<00:00:10.150> I<00:00:10.540> want

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
clean pull and spa in this video I want

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.920 
clean pull and spa in this video I want
to<00:00:10.900> talk<00:00:11.080> about<00:00:11.760> edge<00:00:12.760> of<00:00:12.969> the<00:00:13.030> question<00:00:13.389> why

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
to talk about edge of the question why

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.189 
to talk about edge of the question why
is<00:00:13.990> my<00:00:14.320> pole<00:00:14.680> cloudy<00:00:15.100> after<00:00:15.969> I<00:00:16.000> add<00:00:16.390> sodium

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
is my pole cloudy after I add sodium

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.310 
is my pole cloudy after I add sodium
bicarb<00:00:17.770> and<00:00:18.300> pretty<00:00:19.300> much<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.660> answer<00:00:20.020> is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
bicarb and pretty much the answer is

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.880 
bicarb and pretty much the answer is
fairly<00:00:20.560> simple<00:00:21.599> if<00:00:22.599> you<00:00:22.810> make<00:00:23.019> a<00:00:23.050> slurry<00:00:23.500> with

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
fairly simple if you make a slurry with

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.769 
fairly simple if you make a slurry with
sodium<00:00:24.250> bicarbonate<00:00:25.000> rying<00:00:25.269> to<00:00:25.300> raise<00:00:25.509> your

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
sodium bicarbonate rying to raise your

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.120 
sodium bicarbonate rying to raise your
pH<00:00:25.960> you<00:00:26.800> put<00:00:27.460> in<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.640> bucket<00:00:27.970> in<00:00:28.890> broadcast<00:00:29.890> it

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
pH you put in the bucket in broadcast it

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.640 
pH you put in the bucket in broadcast it
around<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.609> perimeter<00:00:30.820> of<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.179> pool<00:00:31.650> it's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
around the perimeter of the pool it's

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.510 
around the perimeter of the pool it's
probably<00:00:33.340> going<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:34.770> cloud<00:00:35.770> up<00:00:35.980> a<00:00:36.070> little<00:00:36.310> bit

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
probably going to cloud up a little bit

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.520 
probably going to cloud up a little bit
okay<00:00:37.180> so<00:00:37.210> it's<00:00:37.570> really<00:00:37.870> nothing<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:38.500> worry

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
okay so it's really nothing to worry

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.479 
okay so it's really nothing to worry
about

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
about

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.170 
about
it<00:00:39.789> will<00:00:40.239> go<00:00:40.480> away<00:00:40.649> through<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:42.180> filtering

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
it will go away through the filtering

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.349 
it will go away through the filtering
process<00:00:43.449> now<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:45.219> worst<00:00:45.520> thing<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:46.000> can<00:00:46.180> do

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
process now the worst thing you can do

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.840 
process now the worst thing you can do
is<00:00:47.460> run<00:00:48.460> out<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:48.969> buy<00:00:49.059> a<00:00:49.629> clarifier<00:00:50.350> or<00:00:50.859> flock

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
is run out and buy a clarifier or flock

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.450 
is run out and buy a clarifier or flock
your<00:00:52.090> pool<00:00:52.359> or<00:00:52.629> something<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:53.859> nature<00:00:53.920> if

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
your pool or something to that nature if

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.169 
your pool or something to that nature if
you<00:00:55.120> haven't<00:00:55.629> seen<00:00:55.809> my<00:00:55.989> video<00:00:56.140> on<00:00:57.179> clarifiers

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
you haven't seen my video on clarifiers

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.340 
you haven't seen my video on clarifiers
and<00:00:58.539> phlox<00:00:59.260> please<00:00:59.890> do<00:01:00.250> so<00:01:00.519> okay<00:01:01.390> so<00:01:01.600> don't

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
and phlox please do so okay so don't

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.610 
and phlox please do so okay so don't
worry<00:01:02.679> about<00:01:02.829> it<00:01:03.160> now<00:01:03.519> if<00:01:03.789> you<00:01:04.030> over<00:01:04.989> adjusted

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
worry about it now if you over adjusted

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.550 
worry about it now if you over adjusted
and<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:06.070> put<00:01:06.280> too<00:01:06.490> much<00:01:06.930> sodium<00:01:07.930> bicarb<00:01:08.410> in

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
and you put too much sodium bicarb in

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.370 
and you put too much sodium bicarb in
there<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.880> just<00:01:10.150> wait<00:01:10.330> for<00:01:10.360> one<00:01:10.630> full

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
there then just wait for one full

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.950 
there then just wait for one full
turnover<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.340> water<00:01:12.550> northern<00:01:13.150> about<00:01:13.330> 10

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
turnover of the water northern about 10

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.500 
turnover of the water northern about 10
to<00:01:14.080> 12<00:01:14.350> hours<00:01:14.500> go<00:01:15.070> ahead<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.340> retest<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.030> you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
to 12 hours go ahead and retest and you

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.480 
to 12 hours go ahead and retest and you
may<00:01:16.780> need<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.200> make<00:01:17.380> an<00:01:17.620> adjustment<00:01:17.740> using

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
may need to make an adjustment using

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.140 
may need to make an adjustment using
acid<00:01:19.270> okay<00:01:19.930> but<00:01:20.860> if<00:01:21.160> all<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.670> your<00:01:21.760> readings

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
acid okay but if all of your readings

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.120 
acid okay but if all of your readings
are<00:01:22.330> good<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:23.110> you're<00:01:23.230> just<00:01:23.320> trying<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.740> maybe

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
are good and you're just trying to maybe

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.130 
are good and you're just trying to maybe
increase<00:01:24.730> your<00:01:24.940> pH<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.450> little<00:01:25.720> bit<00:01:25.840> using

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
increase your pH a little bit using

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.380 
increase your pH a little bit using
sodium<00:01:26.680> bicarbonate<00:01:27.340> all<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:28.030> sudden<00:01:28.330> you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
sodium bicarbonate all the sudden you

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.150 
sodium bicarbonate all the sudden you
know<00:01:28.450> it's<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.900> bit<00:01:29.050> cloudy<00:01:29.260> don't<00:01:29.890> worry<00:01:30.040> about

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
know it's a bit cloudy don't worry about

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.000 
know it's a bit cloudy don't worry about
it<00:01:30.340> just<00:01:30.370> keep<00:01:30.550> filtering<00:01:31.320> again<00:01:32.320> allowed<00:01:32.590> for

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
it just keep filtering again allowed for

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.890 
it just keep filtering again allowed for
one<00:01:33.190> full<00:01:33.460> turn<00:01:33.670> over<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.060> water<00:01:34.270> about<00:01:34.570> 10

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
one full turn over the water about 10

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.100 
one full turn over the water about 10
hours<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.680> then<00:01:35.830> go<00:01:35.980> ahead<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.160> retest<00:01:36.610> and

hours and then go ahead and retest and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.350 
hours and then go ahead and retest and
make<00:01:38.110> another<00:01:38.950> adjustment<00:01:39.190> if<00:01:39.580> needed<00:01:40.060> and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
make another adjustment if needed and

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.350
