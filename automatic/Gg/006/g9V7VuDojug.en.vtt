00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.780
 I'm fraud biplane 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.330
 I am a gardener of exceptional culinary 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.559
 vegetables and forgotten vegetables and be 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.450
 here at our nursery 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.009
 located in best best in Brabant 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.020
 the poorest sandy soils 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.660
 from peter 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 every bowser say give me that ground 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 to fikkie but I say thank you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.080
 because on the sandy ground 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.180
 needs a little arugula that must be right 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 work harder and thereby developed in 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.200
 much more root system and you are more into it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.940
 stands for an element of vitamins 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.620
 antioxidants in the leaf 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 should have been working much harder for that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.879
 well my father as we follow arms 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.250
 potter and you went out of necessity which 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.440
 you only want to grow vegetables as a child 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.210
 you just want to give to breed 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.680
 watch television and play outside 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.180
 let go the way when the old law 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.520
 I discovered you with vegetables 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.410
 can make incredibly tasty things and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.510
 I make people happy with that is for 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.489
 all of a sudden I am driven by that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.020
 to develop vegetables for people 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 with that 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.729
 to experience new tastes what I do 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 doe is the long invented 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.740
 yes with machines and mechanized and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.780
 electronically with LED 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.080
 lights in factories might 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.530
 Head of lettuce grown but that's it here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.810
 to do 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.210
 vegetables from the real open ground with 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.550
 such a diversity of people so new 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.190
 to get to know tastes then you have to 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.380
 actually breaking a world you have 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.959
 if it is the consumer 's food you must 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.759
 to make it admissible 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.770
 shaping offers for a different kind 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.429
 arugula for 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.950
 and parsnip we grow with the brabant 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.719
 for bacteria in combination with a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.360
 Brabant sandy soil 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.899
 with many grandmothers and grandfather 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 grandfather's experience without fertilizer and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.619
 without pesticides only thing I do 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.390
 or use a biological remedy for 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:01.140
 those crushed caterpillars from the arugula 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.030
 get and tour bacteria from this profession 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.479
 I always get a farmer's bacteria 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.409
 with work to even look he loves 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.380
 delicious 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.590
 the or bacterium yes that is a finding 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.269
 from my father to my father that they already have 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.220
 those remedies that alternative 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.019
 remedies that are for sale that made 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.329
 my grandmother also made beer himself 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.329
 wine cheese 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.930
 cottage cheese yogurt all those in useful microbes 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.209
 already 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.160
 fungi ferment algae that just live 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.480
 live around us in the woods that 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.970
 life in the fens 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.349
 we have taken them from them 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.660
 brought together in culture and that 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.940
 culture that is called the brabant how 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.630
 bacteria that we use or start 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.630
 of soil life 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.020
 these products that we grow are 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.780
 Healthier 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.730
 The cell density of the product is greater 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.069
 and give less manure 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.530
 ok we let product work so hard 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.019
 u much more vitamins and antioxidants 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.580
 the plant the net is also not a factory like 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.670
 I don't give them much food then it goes 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.380
 plant itself seek food but then honorable 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.660
 there is a lot more vitamins in filming 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.970
 colorants odorants flavorings 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.970
 when that's in it the healthier it is 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.910
 we are is the top sport coach for the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.160
 plant vegetables 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.299
 try to train myself every day on my own 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.819
 to stand their own feet 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.840
 good breathing bottom you can breathe 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.190
 your plant is breathing good 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.540
 cell metabolism 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.970
 and I notice the difference if I don't 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.489
 I have to do with it for not 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.959
 takes care of which we get sick rather than one 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.959
 plant I've coached 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.040
 a quality mark is equivalent to me 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.049
 distrust 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.510
 the judges who come by that bowl 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.950
 You only check if you don't like something 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.230
 have done 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.079
 whether you do not use fertilizer or you 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.760
 no pesticides used 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.280
 but they could not see if your product 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.290
 well that's a very different story 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.239
 we are the hallmark me you can 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.969
 appeal to what we do 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.409
 how do some mistakes and what good ones 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.329
 to make something better 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.489
 I invite everyone to see what 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.299
 we do that is the quality mark 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.299
 I am the guarantor
