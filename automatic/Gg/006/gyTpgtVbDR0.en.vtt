00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.419
 only a little while ago as the 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.979
 baker about five or ten minutes and 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.780
 We leave white guys 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.880
 borrow up to double its volume and 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.000
 once you gave them the stretch 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.160
 one hundred percent easier the doubt is made with 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.650
 cutting if you wanted to make it 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.510
 You can do it with your hand but in 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.450
 are generally made with cutting as is 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.120
 the mass the leg does not stick forbidden 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.000
 in that end another but it is moist rich 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.980
 stretch up to one centimeter and cut well 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.550
 cut first with one more cutting 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.989
 big and ten centimeters and with a few 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.609
 you give them from the little hole 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.260
 the same is that the kids can learn 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.480
 in January that's why kids can 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.760
 appear the little ball the projects in the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.800
 Kneading can appear in this part 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.289
 the boys can appear three guys 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.769
 on the other side where this recipe is made 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.429
 but if they are little, ask moms 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.429
 it's cold 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.780
 and you're going to put it on a plate 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.600
 if it can be in nothing better so that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.720
 so that it comes back leavened what there was a 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.150
 once three grace john or there was once 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.690
 will go back to leaking how long a 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.770
 half an hour covered a film and then we go 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.270
 to extract what seems 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.520
 as well as the place they were at a 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.820
 centimeter and they grow more or less grow 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 the double 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.450
 twice its volume and as they are 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.370
 We are going to fry them to remember if you 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.290
 your house you do not want to fry because 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.150
 you want to use oil until the oil does not 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.979
 wants to loose extra money of pain 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.680
 you are going to cook at an average temperature 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.950
 for about 20 minutes on a plate in 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.780

 you will have to give 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.880
 turn attentively and the oil is not 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.730
 too hot because if the oil 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.130
 it's very hot what's going to happen they're going 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.590
