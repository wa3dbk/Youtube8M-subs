around I was shocked

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.280 
around I was shocked
not<00:02:47.670> surprised<00:02:48.150> because<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.660> her<00:02:48.750> level<00:02:49.140> but

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
not surprised because of her level but

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.569 
not surprised because of her level but
there<00:02:49.410> were<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> couple<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.799> other<00:02:49.920> girls<00:02:50.220> that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
were very skilled and were tough little

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.670 
were very skilled and were tough little
competitors<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:54.720> Sam<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.139> I<00:02:55.200> really<00:02:55.410> didn't

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
competitors for Sam and I really didn't

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.870 
competitors for Sam and I really didn't
know<00:02:55.769> which<00:02:55.950> way<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.220> was<00:02:56.310> gonna<00:02:56.459> go<00:02:56.670> between

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
know which way it was gonna go between

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.920 
know which way it was gonna go between
her<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.359> one<00:02:57.480> girl<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.840> particular<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:59.400> I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
her and one girl in particular and I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.209 
her and one girl in particular and I
I<00:02:59.989> really<00:03:00.349> thought<00:03:00.560> there<00:03:00.829> was<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> strong

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
I really thought there was a strong

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.729 
I really thought there was a strong
public<00:03:01.430> probability<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.659> that<00:03:03.290> ol<00:03:03.409> gal

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
public probability that that ol gal

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.860 
public probability that that ol gal
would<00:03:03.950> win<00:03:04.159> but<00:03:04.969> when<00:03:05.120> they<00:03:05.239> announced<00:03:05.689> her

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
would win but when they announced her

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.990 
would win but when they announced her
name<00:03:06.109> I<00:03:06.319> think<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> first<00:03:06.920> emotion<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.519> had<00:03:07.730> was

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
name I think the first emotion I had was

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.059 
name I think the first emotion I had was
just<00:03:09.790> belief<00:03:11.170> her<00:03:12.170> because<00:03:12.500> she<00:03:12.650> worked<00:03:12.890> so

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
just belief her because she worked so

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.479 
just belief her because she worked so
hard<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:14.769> excite<00:03:15.769> me<00:03:15.920> because<00:03:16.189> I<00:03:16.280> knew<00:03:16.430> it

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
hard and excite me because I knew it

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.670 
hard and excite me because I knew it
would<00:03:16.579> just<00:03:16.790> be<00:03:16.939> an<00:03:17.359> awesome<00:03:17.599> experience<00:03:18.590> for

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
would just be an awesome experience for

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.699 
would just be an awesome experience for
her<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:20.150> then<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.480> anxiety<00:03:20.659> setting<00:03:21.439> about

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
her and then the anxiety setting about

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.849 
her and then the anxiety setting about
30<00:03:22.099> seconds<00:03:22.579> after<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:23.030> about<00:03:23.599> perhaps<00:03:24.500> what

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
30 seconds after that about perhaps what

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.619 
30 seconds after that about perhaps what
we<00:03:24.980> had<00:03:25.099> gotten<00:03:25.400> herself<00:03:25.519> into<00:03:25.909> in<00:03:26.299> terms<00:03:26.480> of

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
we had gotten herself into in terms of

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:36.580 
we had gotten herself into in terms of
the<00:03:26.689> schedule<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.379> time<00:03:35.409> I'll<00:03:36.409> be

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the schedule in the time I'll be

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.520 
the schedule in the time I'll be
traveling<00:03:37.010> 15,000<00:03:37.849> miles<00:03:38.030> around<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.750> state

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
traveling 15,000 miles around the state

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.099 
traveling 15,000 miles around the state
that's<00:03:39.709> our<00:03:40.040> estimated<00:03:40.579> travel<00:03:41.000> amount<00:03:41.840> and

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
that's our estimated travel amount and

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.280 
that's our estimated travel amount and
so<00:03:42.680> we're<00:03:43.250> going<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:44.000> not<00:03:44.209> includes<00:03:44.659> 20<00:03:45.200> or

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290
