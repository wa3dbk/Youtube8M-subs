00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
cardboard boxes when I was a kid in the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.750 
cardboard boxes when I was a kid in the
most<00:00:16.289> dangerous<00:00:16.650> ways<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.220> used<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> pretend

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
most dangerous ways we used to pretend

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.179 
most dangerous ways we used to pretend
they<00:00:17.850> were<00:00:17.940> cars<00:00:18.180> or<00:00:18.690> sleds<00:00:19.590> there<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.010> one

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
they were cars or sleds there was one

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.590 
they were cars or sleds there was one
where<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.460> would<00:00:20.670> get<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> other<00:00:21.390> kids

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
where we would get in and the other kids

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.390 
where we would get in and the other kids
would<00:00:21.750> tape<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.230> into<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> clothes<00:00:22.859> box<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
would tape you into the clothes box and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.009 
would tape you into the clothes box and
rule<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.000> down<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> hill<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.630> would<00:00:24.779> call<00:00:24.900> it

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
rule it down a hill and we would call it

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.650 
rule it down a hill and we would call it
rocket<00:00:25.350> ship<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.830> sounds<00:00:26.340> completely<00:00:26.880> safe

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
rocket ship that sounds completely safe

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.689 
rocket ship that sounds completely safe
now<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.140> we're<00:00:28.230> adults<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.949> cardboard

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
now that we're adults can cardboard

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.990 
now that we're adults can cardboard
boxes<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.570> used<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.590> make<00:00:31.890> viable<00:00:32.550> vehicles

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
boxes be used to make viable vehicles

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510 
boxes be used to make viable vehicles
yes<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.930> by<00:00:34.170> us<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.680> by<00:00:34.920> smarter<00:00:35.399> people

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
yes not by us but by smarter people

yes not by us but by smarter people
people<00:00:35.940> who<00:00:36.000> build<00:00:36.239> things<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> time

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
people who build things all the time

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.910 
people who build things all the time
like<00:00:37.260> our<00:00:37.410> friends<00:00:37.739> Pat<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> Michael<00:00:42.739> one<00:00:43.739> end

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
like our friends Pat and Michael one end

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.049 
like our friends Pat and Michael one end
is<00:00:44.040> gonna<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.850> other<00:00:44.969> is

is gonna be like this and the other is

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
is gonna be like this and the other is
gonna<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.629> yeah<00:00:46.020> how<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.649> we

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
gonna be like this yeah how would we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.260 
gonna be like this yeah how would we
make<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.129> look<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> boat<00:00:47.910> are<00:00:48.149> you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
make it look more like a boat are you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.260 
make it look more like a boat are you
okay<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:49.020> layer<00:00:49.500> board<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:51.180> do

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
okay with a one layer board so what do

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.939 
okay with a one layer board so what do
you<00:00:51.329> lose<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:51.780> losing<00:00:52.170> half<00:00:52.350> -<00:00:52.530> half<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you lose by losing half - half the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
you lose by losing half - half the
cardboard<00:00:53.340> density<00:00:53.699> probably<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.300> half

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
cardboard density probably about half

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.340 
cardboard density probably about half
the<00:00:54.930> chance<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> sinking<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:57.930> build<00:00:58.109> two

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the chance of a sinking to build two

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.810 
the chance of a sinking to build two
cardboard<00:00:58.859> boats<00:00:59.039> we're<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> need<00:00:59.489> four

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
two cardboard tubes one of us could be

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.160 
two cardboard tubes one of us could be
in<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.420> other<00:01:09.510> person<00:01:09.840> could<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.080> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
in one and the other person could be in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.380 
in one and the other person could be in
the<00:01:10.260> other<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.650> call<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the other I call this one here so you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.969 
the other I call this one here so you
think<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.659> these<00:01:12.869> large<00:01:13.140> ships<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.830> have

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
think about these large ships that have

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
think about these large ships that have
metal<00:01:14.220> hulls<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.909> wondering<00:01:15.210> how<00:01:15.479> do

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
metal hulls and you're wondering how do

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.039 
metal hulls and you're wondering how do
these<00:01:16.080> metal<00:01:16.590> hulls<00:01:16.860> float<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.580> because

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
these metal hulls float it's because

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.039 
these metal hulls float it's because
inside<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.470> hull<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:20.009> filled<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:21.000> air<00:01:21.360> which

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
inside the hull is filled with air which

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.800 
inside the hull is filled with air which
is<00:01:22.380> lighter<00:01:22.979> than<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.820> water<00:01:24.060> outside<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
is lighter than the water outside of the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.240 
is lighter than the water outside of the
ship<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> were<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> fill<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> ship<00:01:26.009> with

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
ship if you were to fill the ship with

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.950 
ship if you were to fill the ship with
water<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> weight<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> ship<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
water then the weight of the ship and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.749 
water then the weight of the ship and
the<00:01:28.080> water<00:01:28.229> combined<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.640> than

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the water combined would be more than

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.649 
the water combined would be more than
the<00:01:29.820> weight<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> water<00:01:30.420> displaced

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
not really going to be our problem

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.980 
not really going to be our problem
though<00:01:48.119> our<00:01:48.210> problem<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
though our problem is going to be the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
though our problem is going to be the
pressure<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.530> water<00:01:49.680> itself<00:01:50.159> pushing<00:01:50.790> in

what<00:01:53.680> matters<00:01:54.040> is<00:01:54.250> whether<00:01:54.400> or<00:01:54.580> not<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.850> this

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
what matters is whether or not it this

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.060 
what matters is whether or not it this
is<00:01:55.450> like<00:01:55.600> very<00:01:55.840> precise<00:01:56.260> measurements<00:01:56.890> though

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
is like very precise measurements though

is like very precise measurements though
and<00:01:57.400> has<00:01:57.970> just<00:01:58.270> counting<00:01:58.600> one<00:01:59.440> cubic<00:01:59.830> foot

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860

hold<00:02:00.280> about<00:02:00.430> 62<00:02:01.120> pounds<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.810> water<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.350> we've

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
hold about 62 pounds of water and we've

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.560 
hold about 62 pounds of water and we've
measured<00:02:02.890> our<00:02:03.250> boats<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.700> have<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.850> volume<00:02:04.300> of<00:02:04.330> a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
measured our boats to have a volume of a

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.930 
measured our boats to have a volume of a
little<00:02:04.780> over<00:02:05.020> 15<00:02:05.590> cubic<00:02:06.160> feet<00:02:06.400> which<00:02:06.670> means

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
little over 15 cubic feet which means

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.730 
little over 15 cubic feet which means
that<00:02:07.210> they<00:02:07.330> can<00:02:07.540> hold<00:02:07.780> almost<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.320> thousand

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
that they can hold almost a thousand

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.250 
that they can hold almost a thousand
pounds<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.100> water<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.090> technically<00:02:10.900> as<00:02:11.080> long

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
pounds of water so technically as long

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.870 
pounds of water so technically as long
as<00:02:11.410> we<00:02:11.530> weigh<00:02:11.680> less<00:02:11.920> than<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.310> they<00:02:12.850> should

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
as we weigh less than that they should

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.700 
as we weigh less than that they should
float<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.600> had<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> big<00:02:14.200> breakfast<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.650> morning

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
float I had a big breakfast this morning

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.170 
float I had a big breakfast this morning
so<00:02:15.130> I'm<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.280> little<00:02:15.370> worried<00:02:15.730> I'm<00:02:15.850> not<00:02:15.880> going<00:02:16.090> to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
so I'm a little worried I'm not going to

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.150 
so I'm a little worried I'm not going to
lie<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.620> feel<00:02:17.620> like<00:02:17.710> if<00:02:17.770> we<00:02:17.860> can<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.070> across

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
lie I feel like if we can get across

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.540 
lie I feel like if we can get across
once<00:02:18.580> we<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.820> these<00:02:18.940> things<00:02:19.120> are<00:02:19.300> okay<00:02:19.570> right

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.059 
feel really wet so things we learned our
flat<00:03:34.209> bottom<00:03:34.629> boat<00:03:34.810> was<00:03:35.049> definitely<00:03:35.620> stable

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
flat bottom boat was definitely stable

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.319

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.869 
but I did notice with your wedge-shaped
boat<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.049> definitely<00:03:38.469> blyde<00:03:39.099> it<00:03:39.280> easier<00:03:39.700> to

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
boat is it definitely blyde it easier to

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.489 
boat is it definitely blyde it easier to
the<00:03:39.999> water<00:03:40.209> oh<00:03:40.450> no<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.840> think<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.200> very

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:41.499
