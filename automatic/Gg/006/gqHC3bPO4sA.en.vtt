00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
taking soundings of being 120 feet which

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.020 
taking soundings of being 120 feet which
is<00:02:06.840> mentioned<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.439> scripture<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.640> most<00:02:08.879> of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
is mentioned in scripture in most of

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.020 
is mentioned in scripture in most of
translations<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.840> being<00:02:10.289> fathoms<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.879> was

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
translations as being fathoms so it was

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.120 
translations as being fathoms so it was
120<00:02:12.810> fathom

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
120 fathom

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.510 
120 fathom
and<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.030> was<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.540> mean<00:02:15.780> 20<00:02:16.260> fathoms

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
and then it was I mean 20 fathoms

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.890 
and then it was I mean 20 fathoms
six-foot<00:02:17.520> bathroom<00:02:17.850> would<00:02:17.970> 120<00:02:18.510> feet<00:02:18.630> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
six-foot bathroom would 120 feet and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.220 
six-foot bathroom would 120 feet and
then<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.320> would<00:02:19.410> be<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.650> 90<00:02:20.330> foot<00:02:21.330> mark<00:02:21.660> which

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
then it would be a 90 foot mark which

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.830 
then it would be a 90 foot mark which
would<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.470> 15<00:02:22.620> fathoms<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.210> we<00:02:24.480> said<00:02:24.810> well

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
would be 15 fathoms and so we said well

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.690 
would be 15 fathoms and so we said well
let's<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.350> go<00:02:25.500> out<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.860> dive<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.520> water

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
let's just go out and dive in the water

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.420 
let's just go out and dive in the water
and<00:02:27.030> we'll<00:02:27.720> go<00:02:27.870> down<00:02:28.080> at<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.530> 90<00:02:28.860> foot<00:02:29.070> depth

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and we'll go down at the 90 foot depth

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.460 
and we'll go down at the 90 foot depth
and<00:02:29.670> we'll<00:02:30.510> go<00:02:30.630> out<00:02:30.780> from<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.080> bay<00:02:31.200> with<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and we'll go out from the bay with the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.380 
and we'll go out from the bay with the
beach<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.950> we'll<00:02:32.820> follow<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> drift

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
beach and we'll follow the drift

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.480 
beach and we'll follow the drift
patterns<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.020> we'll<00:02:34.650> say<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.100> where<00:02:35.250> the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
patterns and we'll say this is where the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.800 
patterns and we'll say this is where the
the<00:02:35.760> shipwreck<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.240> Paul<00:02:36.390> should<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.690> been

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
the shipwreck of Paul should have been

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.290 
the shipwreck of Paul should have been
and<00:02:37.170> what's<00:02:37.500> interesting<00:02:37.740> about<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.760> the
