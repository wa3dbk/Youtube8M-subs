00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

okay<00:00:00.719> I'm<00:00:00.840> going<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.020> teach<00:00:01.140> you<00:00:01.199> guys<00:00:01.439> how<00:00:01.500> to

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
okay I'm going to teach you guys how to

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.100 
okay I'm going to teach you guys how to
lay<00:00:02.040> up<00:00:02.210> first<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.389> all<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.659> reason<00:00:03.929> why<00:00:04.080> I

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
lay up first of all the reason why I

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.340 
lay up first of all the reason why I
chose<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.680> back<00:00:05.069> for<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.609> because<00:00:06.350> very

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
chose this back for it is because very

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.669 
chose this back for it is because very
bouncy<00:00:07.849> so<00:00:08.929> this<00:00:09.929> isn't<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.380> kind<00:00:10.559> of

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
bouncy so this isn't the kind of

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.020 
bouncy so this isn't the kind of
backboard<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.370> you're<00:00:11.610> going<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.910> just

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
backboard that you're going to just

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.030 
backboard that you're going to just
easily<00:00:12.690> throw<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.650> plop

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
easily throw and it's going to just plop

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.849 
easily throw and it's going to just plop
red<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.490> no<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.450> there's<00:00:16.049> actually<00:00:16.260> that's

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
red and no so there's actually that's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.849 
red and no so there's actually that's
why<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:17.310> called<00:00:17.539> lay<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.680> because<00:00:19.680> you're

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
why it's called lay up because you're

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.670 
why it's called lay up because you're
letting<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.250> you're<00:00:20.400> not<00:00:20.490> throwing<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.939> I

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
letting it up you're not throwing it I

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.840 
letting it up you're not throwing it I
must<00:00:22.680> start<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> right<00:00:23.160> side<00:00:23.519> because

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
must start out on the right side because

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.720 
must start out on the right side because
i<00:00:23.970> usually<00:00:24.150> go<00:00:24.449> right<00:00:24.660> most<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.960> time

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
i usually go right most of the time

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.830 
i usually go right most of the time
first<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.910> all<00:00:27.000> when<00:00:27.210> you're<00:00:27.330> doing<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.660> layup

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
first of all when you're doing a layup

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.529 
first of all when you're doing a layup
when<00:00:28.019> you're<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.260> toward<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> basket<00:00:29.539> make

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
when you're going toward the basket make

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.650 
when you're going toward the basket make
sure<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> stop<00:00:31.949> too<00:00:32.189> far<00:00:32.489> away<00:00:32.640> make<00:00:33.630> sure

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
sure not to stop too far away make sure

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
sure not to stop too far away make sure
not<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> stop<00:00:34.350> too<00:00:34.590> close<00:00:35.000> we're<00:00:36.000> telling<00:00:37.370> how

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
not to stop too close we're telling how

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.040 
not to stop too close we're telling how
usually<00:00:38.790> stop<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.270> about<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.540> when<00:00:39.960> I'm

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
usually stop right about here when I'm

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.670 
usually stop right about here when I'm
doing<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.320> layout<00:00:41.510> also<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.649> your

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
doing my layout also when your when your

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.160 
doing my layout also when your when your
lips<00:00:44.640> your<00:00:44.940> practicing<00:00:45.629> them<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> first

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
lips your practicing them for the first

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.380 
lips your practicing them for the first
time<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.160> slow<00:00:47.309> motion<00:00:47.610> because<00:00:48.270> if

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
time do it in slow motion because if

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
time do it in slow motion because if
you're<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> run<00:00:48.930> full<00:00:49.230> speed<00:00:49.550> it's

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
you're going to run full speed it's

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.540 
you're going to run full speed it's
going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.850> more<00:00:51.030> hard

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.770 

so<00:00:54.550> always<00:00:54.820> practice<00:00:55.420> out<00:00:55.539> a<00:00:55.570> slow<00:00:55.930> paced<00:00:56.260> show

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
so always practice out a slow paced show

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.279 
so always practice out a slow paced show
you<00:00:58.780> how<00:00:59.019> it<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.640> coming<00:01:00.640> toward<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:00.910> basket

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you how it is coming toward the basket

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.999 
you how it is coming toward the basket
read<00:01:02.289> it<00:01:02.379> out<00:01:02.469> here<00:01:02.710> lay<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.820> up<00:01:04.530> slow<00:01:05.530> smooth

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
read it out here lay it up slow smooth

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.890 
read it out here lay it up slow smooth
and<00:01:06.190> easy<00:01:06.280> just<00:01:07.060> make<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.360> easy<00:01:07.509> for<00:01:07.810> yourself

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
and easy just make it easy for yourself

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.050 
and easy just make it easy for yourself
you<00:01:08.229> don't<00:01:08.380> have<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.590> make<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:08.830> difficult<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
you don't have to make it difficult and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.510 
you don't have to make it difficult and
do<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.360> again<00:01:11.909> slow-paced<00:01:14.130> remember<00:01:15.130> also<00:01:15.310> to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
do it again slow-paced remember also to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.700 
do it again slow-paced remember also to
use<00:01:15.700> your<00:01:15.790> fingertips<00:01:16.090> your<00:01:16.570> hand<00:01:17.440> you're<00:01:17.590> not

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
use your fingertips your hand you're not

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.109 
use your fingertips your hand you're not
throwing<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.190> you're<00:01:18.430> just<00:01:18.580> laying<00:01:18.789> good<00:01:19.000> off

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
throwing it you're just laying good off

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.899 
throwing it you're just laying good off
very<00:01:19.810> easy<00:01:20.220> try<00:01:21.220> it<00:01:21.280> one<00:01:21.369> more<00:01:21.430> time<00:01:21.580> and<00:01:21.850> then

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
very easy try it one more time and then

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.510 
very easy try it one more time and then
I'm<00:01:22.030> going<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.180> do<00:01:22.299> it<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.539> regular

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.450 

ok

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
ok

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.520 
ok
I'm<00:01:31.060> actually<00:01:31.240> going<00:01:31.540> to<00:01:31.630> run<00:01:31.840> but<00:01:32.290> when<00:01:32.440> you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
I'm actually going to run but when you

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.390 
I'm actually going to run but when you
run<00:01:32.799> slow<00:01:33.729> down<00:01:34.030> when<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.390> get<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.750> back

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.690 

there<00:01:39.400> we<00:01:39.580> go<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:41.350> always<00:01:41.590> go<00:01:41.950> one<00:01:42.220> way<00:01:42.460> when

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
there we go don't always go one way when

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.730 
there we go don't always go one way when
you<00:01:42.790> lay<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:42.970> up<00:01:43.170> where<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.259> defender<00:01:44.650> is

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
you lay it up where the defender is

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.899 
you lay it up where the defender is
going<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.950> think<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.250> guys<00:01:45.460> going<00:01:45.670> one<00:01:45.880> way

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
going to think of you guys going one way

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.100 
going to think of you guys going one way
and<00:01:46.060> it's<00:01:46.299> going<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.479> be<00:01:46.540> easy<00:01:46.840> for<00:01:46.990> him<00:01:47.020> to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
and it's going to be easy for him to

00:01:47.110 --> 00:02:03.509 
and it's going to be easy for him to
block<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.570> try<00:01:49.570> going<00:01:49.750> left<00:02:00.360> your<00:02:01.360> left
