00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.029
 career 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.780
 and unfortunately it did not happen 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.239
 as expected simply because 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.360
 the audio has completely bugged so um 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.670
 no, I'm a little disappointed I'm even 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.699
 a little disgusted so because it had to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.789
 to be a very very big episode with two 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.670
 derbies of magisteres maybe a match 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.409
 face to arsenal but it's not perfect 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 go there was a european cup match 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.629
 by her dear she had a match against 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.719
 sunderland a match against arsenal that's 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.399

 redo face marseille while there 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.200
 had big matches and that makes me 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.520
 crave what plowing are actually it's 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.120
 a step that these cuts and it's just 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.970
 that she knows the six have pressed and the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.350
 I speak for example I make a game I 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.590
 shout a goal 18th before or so I'm leaving 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.680
 after an action that it's impossible 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.620
 to recover it and the time of two 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.070
 berries to start all over again
