00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.000
 game settings you press r1 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.199

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.010
 playability users the amma massage 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.170
 without acceleration feather and blood and gold 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.930
 in the frags tastes at 0.8 is in the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 keystrokes and in the pages me cup in 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.140
 injury frequency or tea zero 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.549
 mission severity 0 goalkeeper level 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.460
 peeled without touch not touch the opus the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.840
 race frequency in it depends if

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.600
 the word geneve to zero like that at least 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.500
 I am like the steps are fast enough 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.390
 you have to know how to control the ball 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.650
 then there against the cia so it's up to 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.170
 say against the console you play 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.000
 so fast and cda creation was actually 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.090
 all there to others at the time of 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.610
 claude 0 for both directions for error 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.430
 in strike in speed passes 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.700
 strikes and spas made 0 on the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.640
 injuries work little obliged even to jv 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.570
 keeper level home t0 is touch 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.790
 not because I do not know either 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.890
 and then bad control for me I get 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.830
 meaning to mas like that the bottom this 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.490
 rendezvous control here we are 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.959
 now you are playing match you 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.680
 wait a little ouhlala you 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.320
 made on the thing is that it is not 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.650
 do it we do not care we are not there 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.650
 for that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:37.350
 this price is there it is necessary that the match is 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.850
 on the way you end the match a 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.910
 animal that you left yes yes there you 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.910
 wait, go on ultimate team 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.290
 here 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.800
 and there you play normally as if 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.870
 you will buy the object even 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:06.260
 marois what does that give the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.260
 change 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.390
 homo played that a gold team here 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.000
 but with a brush I think it's okay 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.380
 operate the same and then I think 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.410
 that they would gain more credit at the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.900
 late also clowe and gérard went to the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.710
 meet that I can have the cloud 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.910
 against the juve in legends and stories 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:43.150
 of trapped children here it is we play 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:45.330
 mac that's where they old ogier 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.350
 but who cares it's because he does 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:55.420
 that's what we win against blacks 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.940
 here is the bach play locally waits 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:03.180
 the free kicks and free kick that follows 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.750
 not the shots and the possible 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.750
 yeah 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:24.430
 so be careful 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:31.150
 india hosts accelerates and rap or not has 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:35.409
 statement on the tariff order and 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.990
 live mostly 0 games 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.050
 it heats up and the ultimate goal 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.780
 since port on saône on this good faith 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.450

 the island of java 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.250
 and here it is because it is also the 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.000

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.280
 it's really easy to win for 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.870
 people and even the cozy vgc has 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.419
