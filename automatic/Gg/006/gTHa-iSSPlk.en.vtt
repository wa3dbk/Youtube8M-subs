00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
thinking after episode 2 of possibly

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.260 
thinking after episode 2 of possibly
dropping<00:00:28.200> the<00:00:28.290> show<00:00:28.910> because<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.090> don't<00:00:30.210> know

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
dropping the show because I don't know

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.670 
dropping the show because I don't know
how<00:00:30.360> I<00:00:30.419> feel<00:00:30.630> about<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.050> kind<00:00:31.259> of<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> lot<00:00:31.619> of

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
how I feel about it's kind of a lot of

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.620 
how I feel about it's kind of a lot of
things<00:00:31.860> I<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.579> didn't<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.850> too<00:00:33.030> much<00:00:33.210> there

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
things I just didn't like too much there

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.330 
things I just didn't like too much there
was<00:00:33.690> two<00:00:33.930> things<00:00:34.230> were<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.070> bit<00:00:35.219> too

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
was two things were a little bit too

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
was two things were a little bit too
clean<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.239> characters<00:00:36.629> with<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.020> makeup<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
clean the characters with the makeup and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.840 
clean the characters with the makeup and
all<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.950> kind<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> stuff<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.550> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> took

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
all that kind of stuff just kind of took

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.550 
all that kind of stuff just kind of took
me<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.720> I<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.260> didn't<00:00:40.440> really

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
me out of it and I just didn't really

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.440 
me out of it and I just didn't really
feel<00:00:40.830> like<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.220> was<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.790> good<00:00:42.030> representation

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
feel like it was a good representation

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.020 
feel like it was a good representation
of<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:42.990> a<00:00:43.200> post-apocalyptic<00:00:43.800> world

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
of what a post-apocalyptic world

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
of what a post-apocalyptic world
should<00:00:45.510> probably<00:00:45.810> be<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:47.040> episode<00:00:47.610> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
should probably be like this episode I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.460 
should probably be like this episode I
thought<00:00:47.910> was<00:00:48.060> a<00:00:48.090> huge<00:00:48.210> improvement<00:00:48.690> from<00:00:49.260> that

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
thought was a huge improvement from that

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.310 
thought was a huge improvement from that
episode<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:51.840> lot<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
episode that we got to see a lot of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350 
episode that we got to see a lot of
scenes<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.950> feel<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
scenes that feel more like a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.110 
scenes that feel more like a
post-apocalyptic<00:00:54.960> world<00:00:55.739> where<00:00:56.130> you<00:00:57.030> know

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
post-apocalyptic world where you know

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.780 
post-apocalyptic world where you know
Law<00:00:57.329> &amp;<00:00:57.480> Order<00:00:57.570> has<00:00:57.810> just<00:00:58.050> lost<00:00:58.590> people<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.610> do

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
Law &amp; Order has just lost people just do

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.850 
Law &amp; Order has just lost people just do
whatever<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> hell<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.450> want<00:01:00.680> evil<00:01:01.680> people

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
whatever the hell they want evil people

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.920 
whatever the hell they want evil people

start to you know attack others for food
this<00:01:04.649> kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> stuff<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.329> know<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.350> see

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
this kind of stuff and you know we see

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
this kind of stuff and you know we see
some<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> characters<00:01:08.549> sort<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> start<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
some of the characters sort of start to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.029 
some of the characters sort of start to
change<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.600> well<00:01:09.810> probably<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.889> most

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
change as well probably the most

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.529 
change as well probably the most
interesting<00:01:11.249> part<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.759> this<00:01:11.880> episode<00:01:12.329> is<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
interesting part of this episode is the

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.389 
interesting part of this episode is the
character<00:01:12.899> development<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.439> miles<00:01:13.950> who<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
character development for miles who is

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.609 
character development for miles who is
probably<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.569> coolest<00:01:15.929> character<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
probably the coolest character in the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.950 
probably the coolest character in the
show<00:01:16.649> in<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:17.069> opinion<00:01:17.429> the<00:01:18.299> flashbacks<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
show in my opinion the flashbacks in

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.399 
show in my opinion the flashbacks in
this<00:01:19.229> episode<00:01:20.159> sort<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.609> show<00:01:20.929> that<00:01:21.929> he<00:01:22.079> at<00:01:22.289> the

very<00:02:10.470> interesting<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.130> me<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.490> definitely

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
very interesting for me it definitely

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.449 
very interesting for me it definitely
makes<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> show<00:02:12.780> feel<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.470> lot<00:02:13.890> more<00:02:14.069> realistic

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
blocks everything out maybe if he turns

to use little things in the area it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.310 
to use little things in the area it
still<00:03:14.270> wouldn't<00:03:14.510> work<00:03:14.660> even<00:03:14.960> if<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.050> person

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
still wouldn't work even if a person

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.800 
still wouldn't work even if a person
could<00:03:15.440> build<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.740> computer<00:03:16.270> he<00:03:17.270> still<00:03:17.510> couldn't

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
could build a computer he still couldn't

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.930 
could build a computer he still couldn't
send<00:03:18.080> messages<00:03:18.530> over<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.280> internet<00:03:19.700> on<00:03:19.850> a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
send messages over the internet on a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.720 
send messages over the internet on a
computer<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.230> lady<00:03:21.620> who<00:03:21.890> before<00:03:22.610> it

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
computer so that lady who before it

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.250 
computer so that lady who before it
still<00:03:22.940> doesn't<00:03:23.120> make<00:03:23.360> sense<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:23.900> know<00:03:24.050> just

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
still doesn't make sense you know just

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.720 
still doesn't make sense you know just
because<00:03:24.380> their<00:03:24.590> computer<00:03:24.950> she's<00:03:25.130> got<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.340> CPU

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.400 
Internet's working and she could send
messages<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:32.000> know<00:03:32.120> across<00:03:32.300> distance<00:03:32.870> she

messages you know across distance she
can<00:03:33.620> it's<00:03:34.160> really<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.730> simple<00:03:35.350> we<00:03:36.350> probably

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
can it's really that simple we probably

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.890 
can it's really that simple we probably
won't<00:03:36.770> see<00:03:36.890> her<00:03:37.100> again<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:38.330> again<00:03:38.570> we<00:03:38.750> get

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
won't see her again so then again we get

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.240 
won't see her again so then again we get
to<00:03:39.020> meet<00:03:39.140> some<00:03:39.350> other<00:03:39.440> cool<00:03:39.680> characters<00:03:40.100> from

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
to meet some other cool characters from

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.570 
to meet some other cool characters from
the<00:03:41.740> resistance<00:03:42.740> and<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.160> little<00:03:43.340> bit<00:03:43.430> more

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
the resistance and a little bit more

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.820 
the resistance and a little bit more
time<00:03:43.790> with<00:03:43.820> general<00:03:44.300> Monroe<00:03:44.690> as<00:03:45.050> well<00:03:45.650> as

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
time with general Monroe as well as

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.010 
time with general Monroe as well as
miles<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:46.460> you<00:03:47.000> know<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.150> am<00:03:47.450> liking<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.870> show<00:03:47.990> a

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
miles so you know I am liking the show a

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.150 
miles so you know I am liking the show a
little<00:03:48.170> bit<00:03:48.290> more<00:03:48.470> now<00:03:48.620> I'm<00:03:48.770> going<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:48.980> stick

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
little bit more now I'm going to stick

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.920 
little bit more now I'm going to stick
with<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.340> little<00:03:49.580> bit<00:03:49.670> longer<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:50.390> lot<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.720> people

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
with a little bit longer a lot of people

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.510 
with a little bit longer a lot of people
say<00:03:51.080> trav<00:03:51.530> maybe<00:03:51.770> you're<00:03:51.980> judging<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.370> too

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
say trav maybe you're judging it too

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.400 
say trav maybe you're judging it too
quick<00:03:52.850> you<00:03:53.390> know<00:03:53.510> you're<00:03:53.720> not<00:03:53.900> given<00:03:54.200> enough

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
quick you know you're not given enough

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.590 
quick you know you're not given enough
time<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.740> yeah<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.459> probably<00:03:55.910> agree<00:03:56.360> with<00:03:56.390> that

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
time and yeah I probably agree with that

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.240 
time and yeah I probably agree with that
after<00:03:56.959> two<00:03:57.110> episodes<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.800> probably<00:03:58.130> not

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
after two episodes it's probably not

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.520 
after two episodes it's probably not
enough<00:03:58.550> and<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:59.720> think<00:03:59.930> you're<00:04:00.020> right<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.470> I'm

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
enough and I think you're right and I'm

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.560 
enough and I think you're right and I'm
probably<00:04:00.830> gonna<00:04:01.100> keep<00:04:01.550> doing<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.240> reviews

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
probably gonna keep doing the reviews

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.940 
probably gonna keep doing the reviews
stay<00:04:02.870> on<00:04:02.959> with<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.200> show<00:04:03.380> definitely<00:04:03.590> watch

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
stay on with the show definitely watch

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.190 
stay on with the show definitely watch
it<00:04:04.190> for<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.400> while<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.780> did<00:04:05.930> like<00:04:06.080> this

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
it for a while and I did like this

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.420 
it for a while and I did like this
episode<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> lot<00:04:06.650> better<00:04:06.920> so<00:04:07.070> I'm<00:04:07.130> gonna<00:04:07.250> give

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
episode a lot better so I'm gonna give

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.490 
episode a lot better so I'm gonna give
an<00:04:07.520> a<00:04:07.640> that<00:04:07.820> ten<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.330> think<00:04:09.110> it's<00:04:09.350> worth

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
an a that ten I think it's worth

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.770 
an a that ten I think it's worth
watching<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:10.730> series<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.180> far<00:04:11.360> is<00:04:11.600> pretty

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
watching the series so far is pretty

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.420 
watching the series so far is pretty
worth<00:04:12.020> watching<00:04:12.200> it's<00:04:12.440> not<00:04:12.530> perfect<00:04:13.010> by<00:04:13.400> any

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
worth watching it's not perfect by any

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.850 
worth watching it's not perfect by any
means<00:04:13.580> but<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.360> think<00:04:14.450> this<00:04:15.350> episode<00:04:15.530> was<00:04:15.830> a

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
means but I think this episode was a

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.530 
means but I think this episode was a
slight<00:04:16.100> improvement<00:04:16.250> over<00:04:16.820> last<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.359> miles

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
slight improvement over last and miles

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.160 
slight improvement over last and miles
is<00:04:17.660> really<00:04:17.840> cool

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
is really cool

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.560 
is really cool
anyway<00:04:18.709> that's<00:04:19.310> basically<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:20.180> have<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.420> say

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
anyway that's basically I have to say

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.030 
anyway that's basically I have to say
