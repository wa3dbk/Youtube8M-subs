00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
babies r us it was a while ago so i'm

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.300 
babies r us it was a while ago so i'm
not<00:02:06.630> sure<00:02:06.690> if<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.140> still<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> had

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
not sure if they still have it but I had

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.190 
not sure if they still have it but I had
those<00:02:08.459> parrots<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.840> wonder<00:02:10.110> if
