way I want it

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.660 
way I want it
when<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.580> have<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.030> all<00:02:20.239> chopped<00:02:20.959> inside<00:02:21.680> I've

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
when I have it all chopped inside I've

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.530 
when I have it all chopped inside I've
let<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.360> little<00:02:24.170> bit<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.500> basil<00:02:25.420> normally<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
let a little bit of basil normally the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.930 
let a little bit of basil normally the
recipe<00:02:27.050> calls<00:02:27.380> for<00:02:27.590> dry<00:02:27.980> basil<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.700> at<00:02:28.819> this

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
recipe calls for dry basil but at this

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.640 
recipe calls for dry basil but at this
time<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.480> year<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.780> summer<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.290> digital

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
time of the year the summer the digital

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.490 
time of the year the summer the digital
is<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:31.010> good<00:02:31.310> then<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.180> really<00:02:32.569> really<00:02:33.080> nice

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
is so good then it's really really nice

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.400 
is so good then it's really really nice
to<00:02:33.860> use<00:02:34.040> regular<00:02:34.640> fresh<00:02:35.000> basil<00:02:35.299> then<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.170> will

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
to use regular fresh basil then I will

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.900 
to use regular fresh basil then I will
make<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.739> lightly<00:02:37.190> saute<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.360> can<00:02:38.540> see<00:02:39.910> let

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
make it lightly saute as you can see let

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.150 
make it lightly saute as you can see let
it<00:02:41.060> reduce<00:02:41.360> about<00:02:41.780> three<00:02:42.590> or<00:02:42.769> four<00:02:43.010> minutes

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
it reduce about three or four minutes

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.490 
it reduce about three or four minutes
because<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.880> tomato<00:02:44.180> cooks<00:02:44.480> very<00:02:44.599> fast<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
because the tomato cooks very fast and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.759 
because the tomato cooks very fast and
then<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.730> will<00:02:47.150> add<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:47.510> little<00:02:47.870> bit<00:02:48.110> more<00:02:48.140> like<00:02:48.739> a

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
then I will add a little bit more like a

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.830 
then I will add a little bit more like a
net<00:02:48.980> oven<00:02:49.310> more<00:02:49.489> basil<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.120> almost<00:02:50.569> by<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
net oven more basil and almost by the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.270 
net oven more basil and almost by the
end<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.549> then<00:02:52.549> I<00:02:52.760> will<00:02:53.470> put<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.500> out<00:02:54.980> put<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
end and then I will put that out put a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.360 
end and then I will put that out put a
little<00:02:55.400> bit<00:02:55.700> more<00:02:55.760> fire<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:59.560> as<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.920> recipe
