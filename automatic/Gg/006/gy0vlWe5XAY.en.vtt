what<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.190> did<00:01:11.400> was<00:01:11.640> find<00:01:11.910> the<00:01:12.120> right

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
what we did was find the right

combinations of the in to fight that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.650 
combinations of the in to fight that
were<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.680> toxic<00:01:17.190> with<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> base<00:01:18.000> grass<00:01:18.300> and

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
were not toxic with the base grass and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.320 
were not toxic with the base grass and
that<00:01:18.930> combination<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.550> we've<00:01:20.730> developed

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that combination is what we've developed

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.620 
that combination is what we've developed
that<00:01:21.840> became<00:01:22.260> max-q<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.910> we<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.450> good

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
that became max-q so we got all the good

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.230 
that became max-q so we got all the good
things<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> grass<00:01:25.790> but<00:01:26.790> we've<00:01:26.970> removed

the<00:01:27.390> toxicity<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.200> when<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.500> did<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:29.250> we

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the toxicity and when we did what we

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.680 
the toxicity and when we did what we
