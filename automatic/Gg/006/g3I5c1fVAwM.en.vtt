 lead and why there is no distrust there and so 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.580
 further generally formed my 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 understanding the two main questions part 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.739

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 cars all very simple in the first place 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.920
 first moment they know nothing about 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.050
 tom cars they sell 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.370

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.680
 why you shouldn't take their cars from here 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.900

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.979
 as a carton you will doubt then you will accept and 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.870
 once again it will be easier to remove the same 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.240
 from the second strike machine she is no longer 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.370

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.199
 car and damn God forbid 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.370
 respectively the driver and passengers and

 cuts bits and and natasha and so on 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.330

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.220

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.700
