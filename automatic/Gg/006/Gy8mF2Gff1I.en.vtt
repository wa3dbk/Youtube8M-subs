been<00:01:30.490> dancing<00:01:30.670> my<00:01:30.909> whole<00:01:31.210> life

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.609 

I've<00:01:36.380> been<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:36.829> lucky<00:01:37.039> to<00:01:37.429> do<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:38.380> think<00:01:39.380> some<00:01:39.590> of

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
I've been so lucky to do I think some of

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.560 
I've been so lucky to do I think some of
the<00:01:39.799> best<00:01:40.039> roles<00:01:40.280> ever<00:01:40.520> written<00:01:40.789> for<00:01:41.149> women<00:01:41.450> in

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
the musical theatre and so I thought
