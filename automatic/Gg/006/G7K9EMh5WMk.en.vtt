00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.130
 hello everyone welcome to the second 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.690
 part of the tutorial in the course of 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.539
 video game programming dsd l 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.789
 in this second chapter of agreement 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.009
 we go good I said in the previous video 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.039
 that was going to explain how to do the 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.410
 facilities but good 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.210
 I have decided to use it as a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.360
 a kingdom where you can download 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.360
 well 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 the libraries and everything I said about 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.050
 agreement without looking at the previous video and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.300
 well the page is the fifa according 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.780
 here you see the link here above latifah the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.199
 tele tutorials in which good then 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.879
 they do as a course not also that of 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.339
 he is like a kind of book is in 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.220
 English that also explain how to do 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.700
 that how to program video games in that 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.470
 Hellene 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.720
 to make bases not for example good because 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.540
 here we have how to do the events of the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.960
 mouse clicks the events too 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.560
 of the keys to to move to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.290
 character colors play sounds 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.110
 of good terÃ¡n because more or less the course 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.430
 will be pretty oriented to this 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.110
 kind of tutorials and well for the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.180
 Installation of agreement is quite easy 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.630
 we just have to go into the setting up 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.400
 ok in the in the first lesson 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.690
 we went into setting up according to 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.670
 here 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.800
 and we'll see how it tells us in what 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.970
 operating system we're going to schedule by 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.730
 example I am now in linux of 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.990
 agreement but surely we will have many 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.170
 of you will also be in windows 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.130
 great web then imagine imagine 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.000
 I remember now is in 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:50.140
 windows and well then an enter here and I 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.690
 he says that he squeezes in on the limit 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.150
 new compiler to see the air is not the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.340
 text reader that we are going to use and 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.960
 well, a compiler 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.420
 I recommend that I'm starting 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.479
 Well for not to not have problems and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.090
 as I already said code blogs or divisibles 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.739
 plast or that is very outdated bolt and 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.830
 good if you are already one of those edited jce 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.349
 by a text editor that we already saw by 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.780
 I do not know then if you use it 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.310
 directly the je plus plus for example 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.340
 the direct compiler 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.750
 no problem we oppose and are 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.310
 let's imagine that I want four blogs worth 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.670
 well here it says that we have to 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.190
 download this from here that once 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.569
 we enter the editor we press here and 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.250
 Well, he is already telling us the steps of 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.810
 follow without any problem and you can 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.849
 help in agreement there is no problem in 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.410
 this but I guess it will be pretty 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.050
 clear if not good then google translator 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.120
 fast and for those who do not know a bit 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.709
 of English and good 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.019
 also the same if you are in linux 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.400
 linux or good my opinion then it is more 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.530
 easy alone since you only have to 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.680
 execute a command depends on the system 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.859
 operative in which you are 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.780
 and well that's why I decided to do 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.460
 here the tutorial judgments and good if 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.380
 you are on the map is more of the same 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.280
 surely there is more useful and more 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.050
 Useful use the ix code to program and 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.450
 Well, here you say what you've done 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.310
 to do and well all this I think that 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.290
 it's pretty easy you can understand if 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.290
 there is a problem, nothing happens, it's worth 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.060
 you leave it in the comments and the three 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.680
