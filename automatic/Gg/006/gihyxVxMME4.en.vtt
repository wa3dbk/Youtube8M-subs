00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
of all the drag is still wide open i

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.880 
of all the drag is still wide open i
could<00:02:21.370> easily<00:02:21.550> hit<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.880> drag<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:22.960> as<00:02:23.260> soon<00:02:23.770> as

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
could easily hit the drag but as soon as

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.460 
could easily hit the drag but as soon as
i<00:02:24.010> saw<00:02:24.310> Sherman<00:02:25.120> running<00:02:25.570> with<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.870> scene<00:02:26.200> I

i saw Sherman running with that scene I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.710 
i saw Sherman running with that scene I
knew<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.340> could<00:02:27.460> just<00:02:27.850> do<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> bullet<00:02:28.360> passed<00:02:28.540> it

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
knew I could just do a bullet passed it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.940 
knew I could just do a bullet passed it
up<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.110> would<00:02:29.230> go<00:02:29.380> right<00:02:29.560> over<00:02:29.620> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
up and it would go right over the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.980 
up and it would go right over the
defender<00:02:30.400> said<00:02:30.610> if<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.330> turn<00:02:31.570> that<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.720> field

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
defender said if I turn that a field

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.050 
defender said if I turn that a field
that's<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.290> touchdown<00:02:32.770> but<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.250> know<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.400> guess

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
that's a touchdown but you know I guess

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.970 
that's a touchdown but you know I guess
the<00:02:34.210> tight<00:02:34.390> end<00:02:34.570> early<00:02:34.840> Thomas<00:02:35.260> didn't<00:02:35.890> have

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
the tight end early Thomas didn't have

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.650 
the tight end early Thomas didn't have
enough<00:02:36.160> room<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.520> now<00:02:36.730> if<00:02:36.910> Sherman<00:02:37.180> does<00:02:37.510> not

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
enough room to now if Sherman does not

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.810 
enough room to now if Sherman does not
do<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.290> he<00:02:38.380> stays<00:02:38.680> with<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:39.070> guy<00:02:39.280> well

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.280 

that<00:04:51.760> time<00:04:52.060> we<00:04:52.180> hit<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.360> one<00:04:52.750> you<00:04:53.560> know<00:04:53.710> so

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
that time we hit that one you know so

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.440 
that time we hit that one you know so
seems<00:04:56.290> a<00:04:56.410> big<00:04:56.590> obviously<00:04:57.100> I<00:04:57.430> mean<00:04:58.120> y'all<00:04:58.300> could

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
seems a big obviously I mean y'all could

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.360 
seems a big obviously I mean y'all could
tell<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.840> doesn't<00:04:59.710> take<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.830> genius<00:04:59.920> to

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
tell that doesn't take a genius to

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.250 
tell that doesn't take a genius to
figure<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.700> out<00:05:00.850> but<00:05:01.150> then<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:02.050> know<00:05:02.140> they

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
figure that out but then you know they

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.750 
figure that out but then you know they
start<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.560> drop<00:05:02.770> back<00:05:02.980> on<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.280> scene<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:03.640> they

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
start to drop back on the scene so they

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.660 
start to drop back on the scene so they
stop<00:05:03.970> listen<00:05:04.420> or<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.780> know<00:05:04.870> whatever<00:05:05.670> the

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
stop listen or you know whatever the

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.370 
stop listen or you know whatever the
drag<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:07.090> coming<00:05:07.390> right<00:05:07.540> underneath<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.350> then

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
drag is coming right underneath and then

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.710 
drag is coming right underneath and then
whilst<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.310> drag<00:05:09.550> you<00:05:09.760> know<00:05:09.790> gets<00:05:10.180> past<00:05:10.480> the

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
whilst a drag you know gets past the

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.330 
whilst a drag you know gets past the
middle<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.020> field<00:05:11.260> you<00:05:11.560> know<00:05:11.590> on<00:05:11.860> towards<00:05:12.280> the

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
middle the field you know on towards the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.730 
middle the field you know on towards the
right<00:05:12.580> hash<00:05:12.970> then<00:05:13.960> that's<00:05:14.170> going<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.440> affect

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
right hash then that's going to affect

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.740 
right hash then that's going to affect
Sherman<00:05:15.190> eventually<00:05:15.670> caused<00:05:16.030> him<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.300> come<00:05:16.600> up

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
this route wide open so I mean this play

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.370 
this route wide open so I mean this play
is<00:05:22.750> absolutely<00:05:23.560> crazy<00:05:24.570> literally<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:26.230> don't

can<00:05:34.060> learn<00:05:34.210> just<00:05:34.390> gum<00:05:34.630> by<00:05:34.780> block<00:05:35.020> you<00:05:35.350> know

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
can learn just gum by block you know

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.380 
can learn just gum by block you know
block<00:05:35.620> running<00:05:36.040> back<00:05:36.190> boom<00:05:36.850> you<00:05:37.150> know<00:05:37.240> and

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
block running back boom you know and

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.490 
block running back boom you know and
you'd<00:05:37.570> only<00:05:37.690> have<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:37.930> block<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.320> running

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
you'd only have to block the running

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.260 
you'd only have to block the running
back<00:05:38.650> if<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:38.890> don't<00:05:39.040> want<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.370> but<00:05:39.640> you<00:05:40.240> know

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
it's pretty easy to do I mean you can

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.780 
it's pretty easy to do I mean you can
actually<00:05:41.560> just<00:05:41.740> go<00:05:41.860> max<00:05:42.130> protect<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:42.700> that

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
actually just go max protect and that

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.980 
actually just go max protect and that
blocks<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.180> running<00:05:43.480> back<00:05:43.600> and<00:05:43.780> you<00:05:43.840> can

blocks the running back and you can

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.270 
blocks the running back and you can
still<00:05:44.230> just<00:05:44.350> do<00:05:44.470> one<00:05:44.620> hot<00:05:44.830> route<00:05:45.100> without

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
still just do one hot route without

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
having to wait in case you guys didn't

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.930 
having to wait in case you guys didn't
realize<00:05:47.260> that<00:05:47.290> max<00:05:48.070> with<00:05:48.280> tech<00:05:48.460> doesn't<00:05:48.669> count

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
realize that max with tech doesn't count

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.700 
realize that max with tech doesn't count
as<00:05:49.090> a<00:05:49.210> hot<00:05:49.390> route<00:05:49.600> so<00:05:49.870> all<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.290> want<00:05:50.530> to<00:05:50.590> do<00:05:50.650> is

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
as a hot route so all you want to do is

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.840 
as a hot route so all you want to do is
block<00:05:50.919> the<00:05:51.040> running<00:05:51.220> back<00:05:51.340> just<00:05:51.490> hit<00:05:51.610> max

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
block the running back just hit max

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.250 
block the running back just hit max
protect<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.419> then<00:05:52.510> you<00:05:52.600> sell<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:52.900> one<00:05:53.080> hot

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
protect and then you sell you one hot

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.630 
protect and then you sell you one hot
right<00:05:53.440> available<00:05:53.860> without<00:05:54.010> having<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:54.490> you

right available without having to you
know<00:05:54.700> be<00:05:54.970> delayed<00:05:55.240> or<00:05:55.270> anything<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:55.930> that's

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
know be delayed or anything so that's

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.890 
know be delayed or anything so that's
another<00:05:56.320> quick<00:05:56.770> tip<00:05:56.800> for<00:05:56.980> y'all<00:05:57.280> but<00:05:57.940> um<00:05:58.150> and

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
another quick tip for y'all but um and

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.900 
another quick tip for y'all but um and
what<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.470> mean<00:05:59.650> blade<00:05:59.980> in<00:06:00.160> between<00:06:00.460> the<00:06:00.550> hot<00:06:00.700> rod

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
what I mean blade in between the hot rod

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.340 
what I mean blade in between the hot rod
so<00:06:01.120> it<00:06:01.270> takes<00:06:01.480> longer<00:06:01.570> to<00:06:01.870> snap<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.230> ball

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
so it takes longer to snap the ball

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.230 
so it takes longer to snap the ball
which<00:06:02.650> I'm<00:06:03.190> always<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.550> big<00:06:03.760> you<00:06:04.090> know

so they don't have forever to set up you

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.860 
so they don't have forever to set up you
know<00:06:09.610> don't<00:06:09.940> give<00:06:10.150> them<00:06:10.270> a<00:06:10.300> chance<00:06:10.450> to<00:06:10.600> advance
