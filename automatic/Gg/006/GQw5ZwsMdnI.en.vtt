the<00:01:42.869> fly<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:44.130> let's<00:01:44.310> take<00:01:44.490> off<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> section<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the fly so let's take off a section of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.780 
the fly so let's take off a section of
that<00:01:45.630> off<00:01:45.899> your<00:01:46.259> school<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:49.280> just<00:01:50.280> tied<00:01:50.549> those

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that off your school I just tied those

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.520 
that off your school I just tied those
in<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.329> don't<00:01:51.540> need<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.840> split<00:01:52.170> them<00:01:52.320> Mary

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
in you don't need to split them Mary

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.870 
in you don't need to split them Mary
thin<00:01:53.840> chart<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.200> can't<00:01:55.439> count<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.340> think

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
thin chart really can't count so I think

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.179 
thin chart really can't count so I think
it's<00:01:57.060> fine<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.840> tough<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.200> tie<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
it's fine so it's tough to tie that and

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.539 
it's fine so it's tough to tie that and
on<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.149> way<00:02:00.329> back<00:02:01.130> when<00:02:02.130> your<00:02:02.280> thread
