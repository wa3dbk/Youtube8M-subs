00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.470
 hello there was a gamer playing with you 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.389
 races 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.389
 sonic &amp; all-stars racing transformed 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.100
 interesting arcade race about Sonic 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.770
 there are several game modes 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.560
 multiplayer is not yet available 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.539
 daily tests that we can 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.640
 fight for free and then pay 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.940
 currency there are single modes 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.859
 like a grand prix world tournament let's 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.429
 let's run a world tour in principle these 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.690
 modes do not differ much permissible 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:45.190
 let's check 2 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:52.489
 I drove here a feature of the game is 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:54.889
 the fact that here we can well 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.530
 be transported by our facility in 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:01:00.739
 any flying like a transformer 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.659
 some kind of floating 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.259
 heroes of the complaint choose on different 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.259
 cars and probably play for sonika and 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:17.179
 let's go toy is pretty good 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.920
 arcade ordinary won points something to me 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:26.420
 reminded Angry Birds Go very similar 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.469
 so have your chips here of course but I 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.659
 I think angry birds 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.149
 the floor will be cooler because everything is there 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.259
 everything is a little crooked 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.719
 done at launch when the toy 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.749
 just went to google play 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:46.100
 just poured and wrote many that she 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:50.060
 poorly optimized i basically well 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.819
 such nuances 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.219
 bad optimization is not very much and 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.479
 noticed but they are that is when 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:01.759
 the application itself closes with 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.600
 mistake connected joystick for wanted 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.090
 so that there is more convenient control 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.890
 so how is the driver or accelerometer 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.950
 can you drive a car or here 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.800
 so here we have a joystick that we 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.600
 not very convenient but you can get used to it 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.989
 generally turned off the joystick and not 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.690
 kicked out of the game here picked up a bonus 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.010
 we can throw him both forward and back 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:31.350
 it's all there snowballs come across a tornado 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:36.239
 there are such bombs well in general 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:39.100
 our opponent will not let us overtake 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.239
 so look you went water and we 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.330
 turn into a boat 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:50.700
 we will throw snowballs back 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.700
 turn around here from a skid button 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.780
 also here you can for the stars here in 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.310
 the game you see I have a basket of 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.540
 an asterisk is lit above the buttons 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.329
 click buy this bonus for a star and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.930
 do it like this is a bonus 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.299
 such an acceleration mode and we turned 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.959
 in a flying ship and fast 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.030
 move pretty well pretty 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.579
 according to the schedule the toy is not perfect 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.980
 optimization here judging by the reviews is lame 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.870
 that is, for different devices different 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.829
 graphics are on some devices 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.200
 general speak graphics well, not what is 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.690
 me on niks so more or less see this 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.750
 and the car has a reflection 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:49.239
 and there sonica hair so here 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:55.420
 fluttering but here the water does not look like 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:56.799
 very much like I was swimming in essence i think 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.680
 the toy will appeal to all lovers 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:04.470
 arcade racing well and all lovers 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:08.769
 Naturally Sonic so who 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.560
 I liked to download the toy 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.860
 I do not know 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.940
 not a fan of these races here now except 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.100
 what is engri birds 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:23.639
 I sympathize with me I have not played enough 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.580
 long deleted truth is it well, I think 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.180
 maybe even put it again very 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.500
 she is so interesting 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.950
 As for the arcade race and it's not 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.200
 I know even some real crooked 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.750
 a little game you see here we have 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.500
 highway appears nowhere such here 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.889
 bees 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.990
 who don't let us drive if you 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.479
 bump you spins car 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.960
 I immediately thought that so how would 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:58.380
 opponents make these bees according to which 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:02.700
 such a nuance does not give us a normal ride 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.520
 but this is a complication of some kind on the tracks 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.740
 track by the way quite well, I 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.780
 colorful I liked the original 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:15.440
 everything 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:17.340
 that's interesting to go all sorts of constantly 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.080
 changing landscapes 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.080
 any kind of huge animals 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.160
 skip around then whether there dragons 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.479
 are there any other fish 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.460
 huge worms there 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:34.500
 very interesting so done on the floor 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.110
 liked the game swing the guys 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.990
 also subscribe to the channel see 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.030
 review on my channel hail only 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.570
