fat<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:15.840> use<00:01:16.080> insulin<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
fat but you can actually use insulin to

fat but you can actually use insulin to
your<00:01:16.740> event<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.490> building

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
your event is when you're building

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.219 
your event is when you're building
muscle<00:01:17.850> because<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> does<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> same<00:01:18.900> thing<00:01:19.200> so

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
muscle because it does the same thing so

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.429 
muscle because it does the same thing so
it<00:01:19.439> opens<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> cells<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.549> relieve<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.439> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it opens up the cells to relieve to to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.950 
it opens up the cells to relieve to to
receive<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> nutrients<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.780> want

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
receive the nutrients so what you want

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.810 
receive the nutrients so what you want
to<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.799> influence<00:01:26.070> bike<00:01:26.460> actually

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
to do is have an influence bike actually

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
realized if I'm putting two two scoops

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.370 
realized if I'm putting two two scoops
of<00:02:17.040> protein<00:02:17.130> powder<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.600> I'm<00:02:18.900> getting<00:02:19.080> 10

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380

grams<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.740> BCAAs<00:02:20.220> which<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.610> plenty<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.180> know

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
grams of BCAAs which is plenty you know

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.949 
grams of BCAAs which is plenty you know
to<00:02:22.020> get<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.230> protein<00:02:22.380> synthesis<00:02:22.980> going<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.930> I

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
to get that protein synthesis going so I

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.350 
to get that protein synthesis going so I
got<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.680> one<00:02:25.920> cup<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.400> almond<00:02:27.060> milk<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.300> I

got the one cup of almond milk and I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.770 
got the one cup of almond milk and I
what<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.540> want<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.870> put<00:02:28.050> one<00:02:29.000> cup<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.150> water<00:02:30.390> in

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
what you want to put one cup of water in

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.560 
what you want to put one cup of water in
there<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.380> order<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.860> kind<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.030> loosen<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
there in order to kind of like loosen it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.560 
there in order to kind of like loosen it
up<00:02:33.890> make<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.040> little<00:02:35.160> bit<00:02:35.310> more<00:02:35.640> digestible

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
up make it a little bit more digestible

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.280 
up make it a little bit more digestible
or<00:02:37.020> drinkable<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.959> then<00:02:39.959> I'm<00:02:40.080> gonna<00:02:40.170> start

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
or drinkable and then I'm gonna start

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.460 
or drinkable and then I'm gonna start
blending<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.709> up<00:02:41.750> start<00:02:42.750> off<00:02:42.900> slow<00:02:43.200> because<00:02:43.350> I

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
blending it up start off slow because I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.590 
blending it up start off slow because I
don't<00:02:43.620> want<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.980> aerate<00:02:44.220> too<00:02:44.610> much<00:02:44.819> if<00:02:45.480> you

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
don't want it to aerate too much if you

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.750 
don't want it to aerate too much if you
put<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> blender<00:02:46.320> on<00:02:46.620> too<00:02:46.890> fast<00:02:47.190> too<00:02:47.459> strong

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
put the blender on too fast too strong

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.820 
put the blender on too fast too strong
it<00:02:48.450> bubbles<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.260> then<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.590> makes<00:02:49.709> it

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
it bubbles up and then it makes it

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.110 
it bubbles up and then it makes it
really<00:02:50.010> hard<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.400> drink<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.850> then<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.000> get

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
really hard to drink and then you get

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.640 
really hard to drink and then you get
really<00:02:51.420> really<00:02:51.750> full<00:02:51.959> consideration<00:02:52.620> just

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
really really full consideration just

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.470 
really really full consideration just
drinking<00:02:53.070> air<00:02:53.250> bubbles<00:02:53.610> so
