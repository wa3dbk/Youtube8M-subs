fly line to where I cut it off so this

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.380 
fly line to where I cut it off so this
is<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.980> good<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.279> recycle<00:00:29.880> your<00:00:29.910> leaders

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
I'm gonna put an overhand knot in the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.240 
I'm gonna put an overhand knot in the
line<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.129> going

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
line just like that and then I'm going

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.990 
line just like that and then I'm going
to<00:00:38.280> take<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.090> tag<00:00:39.420> end<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.790> thread<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
to take this tag end and thread it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.810 
to take this tag end and thread it
through<00:00:42.680> my<00:00:43.680> finger<00:00:44.010> my<00:00:44.129> bobber<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
through my finger my bobber and I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.670 
through my finger my bobber and I
usually<00:00:45.120> use<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> medium<00:00:45.780> sized<00:00:46.020> thingamabob

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
usually use a medium sized thingamabob

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.490 
usually use a medium sized thingamabob
or<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:49.079> once<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
overhand loop in there I'm gonna hold

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.040 
overhand loop in there I'm gonna hold
that<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:53.640> gonna<00:00:53.760> put<00:00:54.980> four<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.489> five

that and I'm gonna put four or five
twists<00:00:58.050> however<00:00:58.590> many<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:59.100> above<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
twists however many right above that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
twists however many right above that
okay<00:01:00.660> now<00:01:00.989> I'm<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> take<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> tag<00:01:01.859> end

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
okay now I'm going to take the tag end

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.969 
okay now I'm going to take the tag end
through<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.870> loop<00:01:05.240> and<00:01:06.740> then<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
through the loop and then I'm going to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:17.170 
through the loop and then I'm going to
cinch<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:10.280> okay<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.729> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.540 
section
it<00:01:41.090> creates<00:01:41.840> micro<00:01:42.260> drag<00:01:42.620> and<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.250> just<00:01:43.430> not

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
it creates micro drag and it's just not

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.630 
it creates micro drag and it's just not
as<00:01:43.730> sensitive<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.450> if<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.840> were<00:01:45.310> attached<00:01:46.310> free

as sensitive as if it were attached free

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.800 
as sensitive as if it were attached free
freely<00:01:47.330> like<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.660> is<00:01:47.780> on<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.080> rig<00:01:48.460> now<00:01:49.780> why<00:01:50.780> I

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
freely like it is on this rig now why I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.910 
freely like it is on this rig now why I
use<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.770> because<00:01:52.030> by<00:01:53.030> adding<00:01:53.920> tippet

use this is because by adding tippet

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.000 
use this is because by adding tippet
below<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.670> okay<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:56.330> right<00:01:56.540> now<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:56.750> have<00:01:56.960> 3x<00:01:57.619> so

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
below it okay so right now I have 3x so

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.790 
below it okay so right now I have 3x so
that's<00:01:58.220> generally<00:01:58.460> what<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:58.880> run<00:01:59.180> off<00:01:59.450> this<00:01:59.800> 3x

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
that's generally what I run off this 3x

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.160 
that's generally what I run off this 3x
is<00:02:01.040> gonna<00:02:01.280> sink<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.970> heck<00:02:02.300> of<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.510> lot<00:02:02.690> quicker

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
is gonna sink a heck of a lot quicker

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.560 
is gonna sink a heck of a lot quicker
because<00:02:03.440> it's<00:02:03.740> thinner<00:02:03.979> diameter<00:02:04.570> than

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
because it's thinner diameter than

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.830 
because it's thinner diameter than
having<00:02:06.110> oh<00:02:06.410> say<00:02:07.310> three<00:02:07.910> feet<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.300> butt<00:02:08.510> section

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
still hanging below fing mode water so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.430 
still hanging below fing mode water so
now<00:02:11.660> what<00:02:11.810> I'm<00:02:11.900> gonna<00:02:11.990> do<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:17.050> I'm<00:02:18.050> going<00:02:18.350> to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:26.920 
now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
take<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:23.000> end<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.600> 3x<00:02:24.140> tip<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:25.930> I'm

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
take the end of that 3x tip and I'm

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.199 
take the end of that 3x tip and I'm
gonna<00:02:27.080> put<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.070> around<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.459> loop<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:29.060> like

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
gonna put it around that loop just like

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.850 
gonna put it around that loop just like
that<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.650> I'm<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.430> gonna<00:02:31.580> do<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.880> regular

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
that and I'm just gonna do a regular

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:42.420 
that and I'm just gonna do a regular
clinch<00:02:33.860> knot<00:02:34.300> onto<00:02:35.300> that

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:51.539 

just<00:02:43.090> like<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:46.079> and<00:02:47.079> that's<00:02:48.069> all<00:02:48.250> what<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.400> it's

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
just like so and that's all what so it's

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.259 
just like so and that's all what so it's
not<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.730> true<00:02:52.650> 90<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:54.280> very<00:02:54.519> close<00:02:54.939> and<00:02:55.150> it

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
not a true 90 but very close and it

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.750 
not a true 90 but very close and it
achieves<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.780> same<00:02:55.810> effect<00:02:56.469> because<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.519> have

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
achieves the same effect because we have

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.910 
achieves the same effect because we have
that<00:02:58.030> stiff<00:02:58.540> buff<00:02:58.810> section<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.500> turn<00:02:59.739> over

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
that stiff buff section to turn over

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.539 
that stiff buff section to turn over
indicator<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.030> then<00:03:01.599> about<00:03:02.139> four<00:03:02.620> feet<00:03:02.950> or<00:03:03.280> 3

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
indicator and then about four feet or 3

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.300 
indicator and then about four feet or 3
feet<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:04.060> level<00:03:05.049> three<00:03:05.349> X<00:03:05.560> coming<00:03:05.859> straight

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
feet of level three X coming straight

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.110 
feet of level three X coming straight
off<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:07.019> thingamabob<00:03:08.019> or<00:03:08.200> your<00:03:08.500> indicator

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
off of the thingamabob or your indicator

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.229 
off of the thingamabob or your indicator
to<00:03:10.120> sink<00:03:11.049> quickly<00:03:11.310> now<00:03:12.310> if<00:03:12.639> I'm<00:03:12.819> using<00:03:13.030> a

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
to sink quickly now if I'm using a

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.390 
to sink quickly now if I'm using a
really<00:03:13.420> heavily<00:03:14.019> weighted<00:03:14.290> fly<00:03:14.739> such<00:03:15.220> as

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
really heavily weighted fly such as

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.580 
really heavily weighted fly such as
Pat's<00:03:15.819> rubber<00:03:16.150> legs<00:03:16.480> or<00:03:16.870> something<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.319> that

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
Pat's rubber legs or something like that

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.030 
Pat's rubber legs or something like that
I<00:03:18.450> would<00:03:19.450> maybe<00:03:19.659> just<00:03:20.019> tie<00:03:20.169> it<00:03:20.230> on<00:03:20.470> straight<00:03:20.859> to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
I would maybe just tie it on straight to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.080 
I would maybe just tie it on straight to
here<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:22.299> on<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.629> hinge<00:03:22.840> leader<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:24.370> fly<00:03:24.909> in

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
here in on this hinge leader that fly in

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.420 
here in on this hinge leader that fly in
itself<00:03:25.389> is<00:03:25.659> heavy<00:03:25.840> enough<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.530> just<00:03:27.069> get<00:03:27.189> down

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
itself is heavy enough to just get down

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.250 
itself is heavy enough to just get down
and<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.909> keep<00:03:28.120> your<00:03:28.239> other<00:03:28.389> fly's<00:03:28.689> down<00:03:28.719> much

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
and I keep your other fly's down much

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.589 
and I keep your other fly's down much
like<00:03:29.409> you<00:03:29.620> would<00:03:29.769> use<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:29.919> split<00:03:30.340> shot<00:03:30.599> not

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
like you would use a split shot not

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.240 
like you would use a split shot not
using<00:03:32.049> split<00:03:32.379> shot<00:03:32.760> will<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.989> will<00:03:35.799> save<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.040> lot

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
using split shot will I will save a lot

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.129 
using split shot will I will save a lot
of<00:03:36.310> flies<00:03:36.579> for<00:03:36.909> you<00:03:37.000> because<00:03:37.150> split<00:03:37.540> shot<00:03:37.780> has

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
of flies for you because split shot has

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.720 
of flies for you because split shot has
a<00:03:38.169> way<00:03:38.409> of<00:03:38.439> really<00:03:38.799> digging<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.549> finding

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
a way of really digging in and finding

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.610 
a way of really digging in and finding
the<00:03:40.090> narrow<00:03:40.329> grooves<00:03:40.719> and<00:03:40.930> rocks<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.530> you're

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the narrow grooves and rocks and you're

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.140 
the narrow grooves and rocks and you're
gonna<00:03:41.739> lose<00:03:41.980> more<00:03:42.189> flies<00:03:42.519> as<00:03:42.819> opposed<00:03:43.090> to

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
gonna lose more flies as opposed to

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.229 
gonna lose more flies as opposed to
using<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:45.040> know<00:03:45.129> just<00:03:45.310> regular<00:03:45.459> fly<00:03:45.909> as<00:03:45.969> your

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
using you know just regular fly as your

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.920 
using you know just regular fly as your
way<00:03:46.389> however<00:03:47.199> if<00:03:47.979> you<00:03:48.519> do<00:03:48.699> need<00:03:48.909> to<00:03:49.209> use<00:03:49.419> split

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
way however if you do need to use split

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.280 
way however if you do need to use split
shot<00:03:51.209> what<00:03:52.209> I'll<00:03:52.329> do<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.659> I'll<00:03:52.810> drop<00:03:53.049> down<00:03:53.229> a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
shot what I'll do is I'll drop down a

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.839 
shot what I'll do is I'll drop down a
tippet<00:03:53.769> size<00:03:53.979> so<00:03:54.250> here<00:03:54.430> I'm<00:03:54.489> going<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.669> go<00:03:54.790> to

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
tippet size so here I'm going to go to

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.449 
tippet size so here I'm going to go to
4x<00:03:55.389> and<00:03:57.090> just<00:03:58.090> like<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.389> would<00:03:58.540> normally<00:03:58.930> a

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
4x and just like you would normally a

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.899 
4x and just like you would normally a

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.000 
I can put my split chop right above here
and<00:04:50.250> then<00:04:51.240> go<00:04:51.450> 12<00:04:51.930> or<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.260> inches<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.890> your

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
and then go 12 or so inches to your

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.520 
and then go 12 or so inches to your
first<00:04:53.340> fly<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:53.970> then<00:04:54.630> drop<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.080> another<00:04:55.320> fly

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
first fly and then drop it another fly

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.640 
first fly and then drop it another fly
off<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.890> that<00:04:56.120> again<00:04:57.120> this<00:04:57.300> works<00:04:57.540> great<00:04:57.780> out

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
off of that again this works great out

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.240 
off of that again this works great out
of<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.890> drift<00:04:59.160> boat<00:04:59.930> in<00:05:00.930> fast<00:05:01.260> water<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:02.070> also

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
of a drift boat in fast water it also

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.180 
of a drift boat in fast water it also
works<00:05:02.580> well<00:05:02.960> when<00:05:03.960> you're<00:05:04.140> sight<00:05:04.410> fishing<00:05:04.440> and

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
works well when you're sight fishing and

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.890 
works well when you're sight fishing and
you<00:05:05.430> just<00:05:05.580> need<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:05.760> fly<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.090> get<00:05:06.330> right<00:05:06.720> down

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
you just need the fly to get right down

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.440 
you just need the fly to get right down
in<00:05:07.080> front<00:05:07.260> of<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.500> fish<00:05:07.880> where<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.060> rig<00:05:09.240> does

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
in front of the fish where this rig does

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.260 
in front of the fish where this rig does
not<00:05:09.750> work<00:05:10.050> well<00:05:10.320> is<00:05:10.560> in<00:05:10.740> deep<00:05:10.980> water<00:05:11.310> if<00:05:11.910> I<00:05:12.060> had

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
not work well is in deep water if I had

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.650 
not work well is in deep water if I had
to<00:05:12.450> get<00:05:12.630> more<00:05:12.990> than<00:05:13.430> say<00:05:14.430> 4<00:05:14.880> feet<00:05:15.180> below<00:05:15.510> the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
to get more than say 4 feet below the

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.710 
to get more than say 4 feet below the
thingamabob<00:05:16.580> there's<00:05:17.580> too<00:05:17.760> much<00:05:17.880> play<00:05:18.360> in

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
thingamabob there's too much play in

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.780 
thingamabob there's too much play in
this<00:05:19.110> thin<00:05:19.440> line<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.040> you<00:05:20.190> get<00:05:20.310> a<00:05:20.340> lot<00:05:20.520> of<00:05:20.610> bow

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
this thin line and you get a lot of bow

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.170 
this thin line and you get a lot of bow
in<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.060> line<00:05:21.270> which<00:05:22.110> doesn't<00:05:22.530> work<00:05:22.710> well

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
in the line which doesn't work well

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.780 
in the line which doesn't work well
again<00:05:24.180> in<00:05:24.360> deeper<00:05:24.690> holes<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.380> other<00:05:26.340> than<00:05:26.550> that

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
again in deeper holes so other than that

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.450 
again in deeper holes so other than that
it's<00:05:27.660> a<00:05:27.780> great<00:05:27.810> rig<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:28.650> people<00:05:29.310> often

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
it's a great rig and people often

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.190 
it's a great rig and people often
question<00:05:29.790> you<00:05:30.360> know<00:05:30.480> well<00:05:30.690> how<00:05:30.870> do<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.020> adjust

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
question you know well how do I adjust

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.890 
question you know well how do I adjust
well<00:05:31.830> more<00:05:32.520> often<00:05:32.760> than<00:05:33.000> not<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.420> really<00:05:33.720> don't

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
well more often than not I really don't

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.720 
well more often than not I really don't
ever<00:05:33.990> have<00:05:34.230> to<00:05:34.380> make<00:05:34.500> adjustments<00:05:35.160> in<00:05:35.310> places

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
ever have to make adjustments in places

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.220 
ever have to make adjustments in places
where<00:05:35.880> I'm<00:05:35.970> using<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.420> I've<00:05:36.900> you<00:05:37.020> know<00:05:37.050> I'm

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
where I'm using this I've you know I'm

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.570 
where I'm using this I've you know I'm
just<00:05:37.380> kind<00:05:37.500> of<00:05:37.590> using<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.950> general<00:05:38.340> rule<00:05:38.520> of

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
just kind of using a general rule of

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.290 
just kind of using a general rule of
thumb<00:05:38.700> maybe<00:05:39.210> 4<00:05:39.540> feet<00:05:39.840> from<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:41.090> indicator<00:05:42.090> to

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
thumb maybe 4 feet from the indicator to

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.080 
thumb maybe 4 feet from the indicator to
the<00:05:42.420> fly<00:05:42.660> now<00:05:43.410> if<00:05:43.530> you<00:05:43.650> do<00:05:43.830> need<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.310> get<00:05:44.730> longer

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
the fly now if you do need to get longer

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.450 
the fly now if you do need to get longer
or<00:05:45.300> shorter<00:05:45.560> what<00:05:46.560> you'll<00:05:46.740> do<00:05:46.950> is<00:05:47.190> simply<00:05:49.460> trim

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
or shorter what you'll do is simply trim

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.630 
or shorter what you'll do is simply trim
off<00:05:50.640> that<00:05:51.380> end<00:05:52.380> that's<00:05:53.340> attached<00:05:55.400> let's<00:05:56.400> say<00:05:56.580> I

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
off that end that's attached let's say I

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.200 
off that end that's attached let's say I
needed<00:05:56.880> to<00:05:57.000> add<00:05:57.210> another<00:05:57.540> foot<00:05:57.990> or<00:05:58.020> so

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:22.309 

do<00:06:03.210> another<00:06:03.420> surgeon's<00:06:04.020> knot

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:36.629 

and<00:06:22.860> now<00:06:23.099> I'm<00:06:23.610> going<00:06:23.759> to<00:06:23.849> attach<00:06:24.029> it<00:06:24.270> again

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.580 

and<00:06:36.759> that's<00:06:37.360> how<00:06:37.509> it's<00:06:37.659> done<00:06:37.719> now<00:06:38.199> if<00:06:38.319> I<00:06:38.409> need

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
and that's how it's done now if I need

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.230 
and that's how it's done now if I need
to<00:06:38.680> get<00:06:38.800> shorter<00:06:39.219> obviously<00:06:39.819> I<00:06:39.849> would<00:06:40.030> do<00:06:40.120> the

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
to get shorter obviously I would do the

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.839 
to get shorter obviously I would do the
opposite<00:06:40.629> and<00:06:40.689> just<00:06:40.990> trim<00:06:41.169> some<00:06:41.409> on<00:06:41.590> or<00:06:42.069> trim

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
opposite and just trim some on or trim

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:44.850 
opposite and just trim some on or trim
some<00:06:43.030> off<00:06:43.180> and<00:06:43.419> then<00:06:43.539> tie<00:06:43.719> it<00:06:43.780> back<00:06:43.990> on<00:06:44.229> so

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
some off and then tie it back on so

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.399 
some off and then tie it back on so
there<00:06:45.580> you<00:06:45.669> have<00:06:45.729> it<00:06:46.030> that's<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.199> hinge

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.409 
there you have it that's the hinge

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:50.070 
there you have it that's the hinge
thingamabob<00:06:48.039> you<00:06:48.189> rigged<00:06:48.900> one<00:06:49.900> of<00:06:49.990> my

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
thingamabob you rigged one of my

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.369 
thingamabob you rigged one of my
favourites<00:06:51.060> almost<00:06:52.060> used<00:06:52.330> entirely<00:06:52.750> out<00:06:53.349> of

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:53.379 
favourites almost used entirely out of

favourites almost used entirely out of
the<00:06:53.530> boat<00:06:53.740> on<00:06:54.039> say<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.460> Colorado<00:06:54.909> River<00:06:55.270> the

Eagle River or the Roaring Fork where it

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.159 
Eagle River or the Roaring Fork where it
was<00:06:57.879> originally<00:06:58.780> developed<00:07:00.150> in<00:07:01.150> that<00:07:01.360> area<00:07:01.750> so

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
was originally developed in that area so

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:04.050 
was originally developed in that area so
give<00:07:02.469> it<00:07:02.500> a<00:07:02.620> shot<00:07:02.650> and<00:07:03.159> I'm<00:07:03.550> pretty<00:07:03.819> positive

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
give it a shot and I'm pretty positive

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.659 
give it a shot and I'm pretty positive
you'll<00:07:04.419> like<00:07:04.629> it
