00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.950
 I of return share a few points 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.870
 important with you then first of all 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.790
 no matter what sport you go 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.010
 to think about warming up before 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.689
 session is your stretching after the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.640
 assignment it will save you from having 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.170
 huge aches man will 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 not lie to you at the beginning when you 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.350
 go back to the sport you have 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.610
 definitely have aches and pains 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.520
 it's not always very pleasant am 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.140
 agree with you but especially think 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.160
 to the fact that it's going to happen quickly so it's 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.120
 really that the first times you 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.739
 go see your body will get used 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.780
 so the covers will be less and 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.769
 less painful see virtually 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.390
 inexistent 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.559
 the second point is thought to have 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.910
 water during your session it takes 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.130
 know that a lack of water 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.600
 can even a very small percentage can 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.280
 really make a difference at the level 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.079
 of your performance besides I was 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.489
 a video about water I put you 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.350
 the link below if you want to have 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.030
 more information and also made 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.920
 watch out for drinks that are sold 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.960
 for sport because in large 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.829
 surface because often 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.239
 unfortunately they do not contain 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.800
 bullshit sometimes so much of 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.390
 calories that you will burn or even 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.920
 more so in fact you will reignite 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.270
 your session for this kind of drink 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.860
 world is paying attention to what you 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.960
 buy that she will however only know that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.789
 you will choose to start 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.080
 gradually as we have seen in the 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.670
 previous videos they stop 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.619
 want to do too much from the beginning to 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.209
 you discourage and not continue so 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.520
 the goal is to do it in the long run 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:24.679
 regularly go there gradually 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.509
 with the most important ones choose a 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.530
 sport that you like it must be 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.080
 something you do with 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.580
 pleasure you feel good all 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.140
 simply because it's to be done on 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.119
 the long run if you do anything 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.510
 thing you do not like it the dir is 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.400
 what a week of 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.320
 osman you will give up so 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.090
 especially take the time to find 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.800
 something you like do not hesitate 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.180
 not to try different courses if you 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.320
 want to go to gym to see 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.120
 really what suits you 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.680
 if you do not dare the gyms to 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.640
 because of the eyes of others that difficult 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.920
 so I can totally 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.570
 understand but mostly think of that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.830
 I mean now all the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.600
 people who are the gym or 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.340
 in order to improve their physique they 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.990
 are there for something even the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.510
 people all thin or will tell you a 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.680
 Bunny sport need went well 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.940
 time at the gym is because 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.410
 that she wants to improve something 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.970
 in his physique that does not please him 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.990
 So from the moment you know 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.950
 that everyone is here to improve 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.870
 his physic 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.010
 you can skip this at the beginning 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.510
 it 'll ask you a little bit of 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.950
 courage but you'll see that once 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.210
 that you go in your rhythm that 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.950
 you do your exercises you go 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.140
 quickly forgot all this for you boost 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.120
 especially do not hesitate to ask a 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.100
 friend a member of your family to a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.080
 colleague to accompany you for your 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.280
 olÃ© sport training I know 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.600
 a lot more fun because you're not 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.250
 not all alone but it can really 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.420
 serve as motivation simply 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.100
 because days when we are less 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.420
 motivated than others but when we know 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.860
 that someone waiting for us to go 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.990
 to train with us that gives us the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.940
 little taste what we need to 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.680
 go and train that you do not have to 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.020
 forget that you have to have a minimum 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.489
 of physical activity the days you do not 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.170
 do not do your workout 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.520
 so the cost is to have about 20 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.680
 30 minutes of physical activity 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.470
 day but that can just pass 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.090
 by walking but I already have 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.830
 spoken in a previous video 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.720
 the next month is an object that me 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.670
 motivates a lot during my session 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.170
 sport is my cardio watch that me 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.250
 actually allows to see the number of 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.650
 calories that I wanted for my 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.940
 accession or that frankly for me 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.530
 it is the essential not in fact 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.970
 of hope regularly it's a 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.190
 motivation on its own 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.600
 it allows us to see where we are 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.340
 at the level of his career life 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.960
 German is me for the big cup 7 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.420
 see that after each session here I have 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.010
 proved the 300 400 500 calories this is 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.090
 really great and that will motivate you 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.260
 on the long term 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.400
 I will not dwell teachings 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.660
 of what you have already done 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.940
 video I'm explaining exactly 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.230
 how does it work and the post 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.970
 so motivating so I put you 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.890
 also the links under this video is 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.600
 as a reminder do not forget that just the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.890
 sport will not make you lose weight 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.720
 if you do not change your habits 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.760
 food therefore in a loss of 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.160
 20% weight comes from physical activity 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.100
 80% to one of your diet so 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.530
 one without the other it does not go so gone 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.240
 see everything but it's on my channel for 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.680
 rebalance your diet 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.510
 I give you an appointment in the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.220
 next video and from here forget 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.290
 not to do what is good for you 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.000
 for your body your health for you 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.450
 feeling in shape I kiss you 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.450
