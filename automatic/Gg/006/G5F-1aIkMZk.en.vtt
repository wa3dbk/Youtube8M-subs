00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.020
 good friends of youtube like 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.410
 we are also changing the pump 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.389
 water from a Honda Civic year 1996 so 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.779
 There are two ways to get this 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.540
 pulleys and takes them a long time 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.320
 first way is getting this key 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:31.610
 large two way average ones 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.640
 ok and a key 17 that would be the first 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.989
 form the second way to get that 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.989
 volley is 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.090
 with an average impact wrench if 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.989
 using a cup 17 this would be the first 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.790
 way that does not need the wedge not 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.120
 you need this key 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.320
 then let's put the face the dance 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.010
 to play it by always putting it with the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.710
 hose 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.380
 does not need any wedge at all and can 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.200
 leave alone so that's one of the two 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.980
 forms and the most common the primitive that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.960
 it is known to date that it is with the 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.549
 rangers is placed 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.549
 on this side 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.100
 in this way it is introduced 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.840
 the way then 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.620
 how are you here 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.080
 as you are going to see there are some things that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.570
 sometimes you do not get married you're going to have to 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.600
 use the 17 key that with the way that 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:44.440
 you are going to give an account 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.440
 a little humanity 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:04.330
 the cup in this way also here already 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.330
 we went to 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.910
 because I was already the key is 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:00.910
 okay 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:06.480
 here in this way how can you see if 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.980
 come and place the 17 key in the middle 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.730
 why 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.640
 and later 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.930
 they put this touch 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.810
 and it does not need much force if they can 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.570
 you can listen to it with your foot 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.660
 we just finished changing it and now 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.590
 we have finished this is the water pump 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.500
 old as you can see we use a hammer 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.510
 to extract the pulley hopefully and how to 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.390
 I say second method if it does not come out can 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.880
 use the air gun that is easier 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.880
 yes it's fine thanks
