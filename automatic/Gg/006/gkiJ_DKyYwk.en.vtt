compatible and and such as a video
recording<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> take<00:01:13.049> video<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
recording because when you take video it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.600 
recording because when you take video it
just<00:01:13.979> takes<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.430> lot<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> battery<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:17.040> have

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
just takes a lot of battery so I have

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.859 
just takes a lot of battery so I have
ordered<00:01:18.060> an<00:01:18.299> extra<00:01:18.960> battery<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.680> Amazon<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
ordered an extra battery from Amazon and

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.020 
ordered an extra battery from Amazon and
in<00:01:21.869> my<00:01:22.650> testing<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.189> battery<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.610> actually

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
in my testing this battery is actually

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.490 
in my testing this battery is actually
better<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.780> fourteen<00:01:28.200> hundred

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
better because it is a fourteen hundred

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.690 
better because it is a fourteen hundred
million<00:01:28.829> power<00:01:29.009> compared<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> original

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
million power compared to the original

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.230 
million power compared to the original
1030<00:01:32.700> milliamp<00:01:33.090> hour<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
1030 milliamp hour and so this is it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
1030 milliamp hour and so this is it
that<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> ordered<00:01:36.840> from<00:01:36.990> Amazon<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:40.740> battery

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.590

in total for this battery anyways it is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.940 
in total for this battery anyways it is
a<00:02:12.510> 1400<00:02:13.349> milliamp

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
a 1400 milliamp

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.290 
a 1400 milliamp
battery<00:02:14.340> three<00:02:14.580> point<00:02:14.790> seven<00:02:14.910> volt<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:17.300> 5.18

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
battery three point seven volt and 5.18

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.949 
battery three point seven volt and 5.18
watt<00:02:18.629> hours<00:02:19.340> which<00:02:20.340> actually<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.180> more<00:02:21.810> than

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
watt hours which actually is more than

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.400 
watt hours which actually is more than
the<00:02:22.110> original<00:02:22.530> if<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.980> couldn't<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.400> its

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
the original if you couldn't see its

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.809 
the original if you couldn't see its
3.81<00:02:25.410> watt<00:02:25.769> hours<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:28.069> yeah<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.370> performance

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
3.81 watt hours and yeah so performance

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.020 
3.81 watt hours and yeah so performance
on<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.120> was<00:02:30.390> way<00:02:30.569> better<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.370> 14<00:02:32.849> hundred

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
on this was way better so the 14 hundred

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.970 
on this was way better so the 14 hundred
million<00:02:33.450> power<00:02:33.630> compared<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.260> ten<00:02:34.769> thirty

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
million power compared to the ten thirty

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.620 
million power compared to the ten thirty
million<00:02:35.310> power<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.970> actually<00:02:39.330> this

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
million power and this actually this

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.120 
million power and this actually this
better<00:02:39.870> actually<00:02:40.080> gave<00:02:40.349> me<00:02:40.380> around<00:02:40.830> an<00:02:41.010> extra

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
better actually gave me around an extra

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.020 
better actually gave me around an extra
15<00:02:41.940> minutes<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.510> gotta<00:02:43.080> say<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.099> know<00:02:44.160> it's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
15 minutes I gotta say and I know it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.170 
15 minutes I gotta say and I know it's
an<00:02:45.209> F<00:02:45.390> cell<00:02:45.569> b10<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.830> on<00:02:46.920> here<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.250> says<00:02:47.430> SS

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
an F cell b10 a but on here it says SS

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.380 
an F cell b10 a but on here it says SS
SLB<00:02:48.959> today<00:02:49.220> don't<00:02:50.220> worry<00:02:50.400> if<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:50.970> happen

to get the same one that I'm holding
here<00:02:53.010> right<00:02:53.220> now<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:54.480> will<00:02:54.690> work<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.319> guess<00:02:55.829> it's

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
here right now it will work I guess it's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.370 
here right now it will work I guess it's
just<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.670> SS<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> extra<00:02:57.840> milliamp<00:02:58.140> hours

just as SS for the extra milliamp hours

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.930 
just as SS for the extra milliamp hours
or<00:02:58.500> something<00:02:58.769> but<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.489> won't<00:02:59.640> break<00:02:59.790> your

fine take that out so that's the
original<00:03:23.040> one<00:03:23.459> d-10<00:03:24.450> 30<00:03:24.690> million<00:03:25.019> power<00:03:25.200> and

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
original one d-10 30 million power and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.509 
original one d-10 30 million power and
here's<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:26.209> one<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.359> I<00:03:27.420> ordered<00:03:28.519> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
here's the one that I ordered the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.800 
here's the one that I ordered the
fourteen<00:03:29.940> hundred<00:03:30.239> million<00:03:30.540> power<00:03:30.690> battery

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
fourteen hundred million power battery

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.449 
fourteen hundred million power battery
and<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.560> same<00:03:31.829> size<00:03:33.980> for<00:03:34.980> me<00:03:35.160> actually

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
and it's the same size for me actually

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.080 
and it's the same size for me actually
though<00:03:36.410> when<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.500> came<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.829> mail<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
though when it came in the mail the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.849 
though when it came in the mail the
plastic<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.870> little<00:03:40.109> bit<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.410> plastic<00:03:40.739> on

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
plastic a little bit of the plastic on

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.780 
plastic a little bit of the plastic on
top<00:03:41.100> was<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:41.850> bit<00:03:42.239> raised<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:44.190> that's<00:03:44.549> why

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
top was a bit raised so I so that's why

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.910 
top was a bit raised so I so that's why
this<00:03:44.850> thing<00:03:45.329> couldn't<00:03:45.569> snappin<00:03:46.139> so<00:03:46.739> what<00:03:46.889> I

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
this thing couldn't snappin so what I

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.250 
this thing couldn't snappin so what I
did<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.519> actually<00:03:47.850> pushed<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.600> plastic

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
did is I actually pushed the plastic

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.229 
did is I actually pushed the plastic
down<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.739> used<00:03:50.280> some<00:03:50.430> scotch<00:03:50.760> tape<00:03:50.850> to

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
down and used some scotch tape to

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.319 
down and used some scotch tape to
actually<00:03:51.540> tape<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.900> down<00:03:52.160> very<00:03:53.160> tightly<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.790> I

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
actually tape it down very tightly and I

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.819 
actually tape it down very tightly and I
actually<00:03:54.480> solved<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.959> problem<00:03:55.319> so<00:03:55.530> if<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.739> do

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
actually solved the problem so if you do

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.069 
actually solved the problem so if you do
get<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> problem<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:57.030> push<00:03:57.959> it

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
get a problem like that just push it

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.960 
get a problem like that just push it
down<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.380> scotch<00:03:58.709> tape<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.160> up<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.790> should

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
down and scotch tape it up and it should

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.420 
down and scotch tape it up and it should
work<00:04:00.030> fine<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:01.590> works<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.859> same<00:04:02.040> as<00:04:02.099> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
work fine so it works the same as the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.229 
work fine so it works the same as the
original<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.109> put<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.880> it's

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
original you just put that in and it's

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.309 
original you just put that in and it's
just<00:04:07.340> put<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.549> wrong<00:04:08.700> way<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.989> goes

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
just put it in the wrong way it goes

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.220 
just put it in the wrong way it goes
into<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.680> other<00:04:10.919> way<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.269> put<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.019> and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
into the other way and you put it in and

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.879 
into the other way and you put it in and
it<00:04:14.010> snaps<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:16.609> alright

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.570 

it's<00:04:20.310> not<00:04:20.579> working<00:04:21.389> oh<00:04:21.830> they<00:04:22.830> gotta<00:04:23.039> see<00:04:23.460> it
