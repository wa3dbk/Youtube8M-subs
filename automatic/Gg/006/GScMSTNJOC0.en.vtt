00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.890 
first perk I said use quick draw I say
that<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:40.820> quick-draw<00:02:41.820> allows<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.870> a

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
every single time I mean unless they are

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.499 
every single time I mean unless they are
doing<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.460> on<00:04:46.550> purpose<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:49.509> eventually

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
doing it on purpose and eventually

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.550 
doing it on purpose and eventually
somebody's<00:04:50.810> going<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:50.990> catch<00:04:51.199> up<00:04:51.379> and

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
somebody's going to catch up and

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.350 
somebody's going to catch up and
