00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.160
 very good kids we are here in the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 Clash of class channel my business and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 guys as you see I'm going to make an attack 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.850
 with pigs to the maximum level since 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.560
 many of you the most veterans of the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.590
 channel you will remember that before I made a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.140
 series every time he reached with a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.970
 tropa the maximum level I did not already with 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.440
 the giants with the healers good with 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.210
 a lot of troops in this case 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.040
 I wanted to do it with the pigs 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 level 5 and the healing sciences at 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.090
 level 5 if I remember correctly that what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.340
 are at level 5 do not forgive level 6 like this 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.190
 how good are we going to see how it goes before 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.079
 I wanted to show you a good 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.700
 here made a real happy are all 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.350
 stars I have not taken the loot 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.230
 because you already know that if I do not do the hundred 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.579
 percent in an attack did not destroy all 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 the defenses I can not take the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.300
 other resources so well then it's a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 happy little I wanted to teach the repetition 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.200
 is a bit above so that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 you can see that 2200 of the ejido have been stolen 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.640
 dark the army is worth think 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.250
 2000 so good then 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.320
 since I can not improve practically in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 nothing dark connection before the others no 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.010
 I want to improve them, because if I do not 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.750
 they are going to touch more complicated villages in 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000
 war but good this happened already to 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.880
 fast camera guys because this one either 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.259
 it is very important that keychains that 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.670
 teach you rather to say that having the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.170
 two crossbows here to level 2 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 improving themselves, obviously they are not 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.930
 defending how they would have to do it and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.420
 they are two buildings that do not 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.640
 practically nothing and well then guys 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.200
 they get me to clean up all that area with 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.570
 ride because if the queen arches 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.310
 takes the store of the dark being 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.110
 good guys since I have here the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.880
 prepared troops look for a village 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.830
 quite good with enough resources and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.140
 right away we go back good kids 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.670
 let's play the attack against this 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.440
 village although it has hell towers by 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.600
 here low but good let's attack him 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.340
 in the area above I will release the mountains 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.050
 pigs out there in pretty fat row 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.330
 because surely there are no sets 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.850
 of the next one it is hoped that they do not 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.259
 but well let's see the case of the clan 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.509
 first that takes out almost the clan very 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.899
 important here because there is no castle 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.250
 the clan much better and good we're going to 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.130
 think how are we going to make the attack 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.560
 we can make a surge of 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.840
 for each side it's worth in this case I'm going to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.760
 check for example that there is no 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.490
 here is worth a test the sets of 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.350
 explosives are not in that area here 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.840
 it's not worth anything then I can 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.550
 start to drop side of to the surge by 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.280
 here is worth riding pigs that go 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.290
 cleaning all that area and go using 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.210
 The healing success is worth a spell 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.370
 of healing out there and then about 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.100
 damn it is worth going through that area of 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.270
 there and I get it cleaned good sounds 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.010
 a little bad but good to go 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.170
 cleaning that area that would be fine 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.700
 that they did it like that, Monte is worth to ports 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.590
 around here the healing team over here 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.840
 and notice that we are cleaning all the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.190
 area that the important thing is to cure well 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.130
 ride pigs because if we do not take care of them 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.950
 okay fuck in any tower hell or 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.840
 anything and they burst us 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.730
 do not see, it's worth having, I'm not waiting 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.500
 use is the healing guy because 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.990
 I do not know whether to cure those pigs for 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.380
 only that's worth it does not need me 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.970
 I will save for those few amount to pigs 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.620
 I do not know if they're worth it, I'm going to use it 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.300
 healing guy out there who put up 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.370
 a little bit that they take off that cannon and if 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.930
 can the crossbow and the heroes the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.870
 I can drop here they go 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.480
 cleaning that good area I 'm going 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.610
 with the sleeves so you do not 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.730
 start to divert the heroes to see if 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.099
 we are lucky it seems that they are not going 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.200
 they 're going to go for all that, you're going to see 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.120
 barbarito fast fast good good 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.250
 good what services do they do 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.900
 Heroes I'm freaking out 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.120
 flipping a little the truth I'm going to let go 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.590
 over here is the witches and everything 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.659
 I was here to see if at least 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.040
 does the king do something decent 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.930
 barbarian I will use the skill 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.610
 nothing because not the queen archer and everything 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.440
 they have to make the return when the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.420
 cleaned the whole area but good less 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.489
 bad that we have all these barbarians the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.200
 witches and such that at least they are going to 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.790
 get something done leads to 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.900
 finish the queen's skill nor do I 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.329
 I've realized why they were doing 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.010
 here a little the fool but good so 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.959
 less the magicians these of good level go 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.700
 to knock me down the city hall I think the 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.250
 witches are also going to be giving a little 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.409
 by sac the true but good tomb worth 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.299
 in the town hall the magicians thought I 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.400
 which would be higher level but good 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.130
 no no problem I thought they were from 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.010
 maximum level is worth here they get me 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.359
 knock down not the warehouse is worth it here good 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.090
 I believe 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.759
 and the magicians I've seen them before, guys 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.879
 that I had the maximum level I do not know why 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.620
 what were there at level 5 the truth I think 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.689
 who is a lawyer or something because I think that 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.129
 they were at the maximum level although good one 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.789
 witch I've seen around here that has also 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.560
 dead 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.330
 They have to kill me before they 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.060
 those skeletons but good is it worth 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.530
 we take most of the loot the 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.449
 spell this poison I can not 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.639
 use do not know why we had the 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.710
 attack here has finished tasting 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.539
 pay 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.520
 is worth the magician who was of maximum level 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.560
 I thought I knew bogado but bueno 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.150
 At least we got a good booty 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.189
 that is pretty good what I now 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.560
 same I'm looking for is just to finish 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.180
 to improve defenses like the towers 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.129
 of archers and get me and improve the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.659
 walls at maximum level so guys 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.090
