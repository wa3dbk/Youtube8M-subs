00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 all beaver dear friends and me 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.310
 there is a new assumption on the topic 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.170
 reflections on the last teaser 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.790
 and today I have just crazy 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 theory can this be 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.620
 what is it sending a dreadful sprig trail i 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 I will not say anything but it 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.300
 interesting theory that I was offered 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.949
 my subscribers I want to share with you 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.720
 now we have two main theories on 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.760
 the theme of this reflection is the first 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 some kind of shadow animatronic everything is possible 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.920
 Freddy's brush is gone 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.199
 enough and of course a hat that yes it is 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.309
 maybe Freddie or not but there is 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.260
 and the second option 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.450
 mongol because we never saw 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 so that the shadows of animatronics were specifically 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.040
 invisible darkness and also get to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 reflection of the type of such an object 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.059
 lay well or hung high we know 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.350
 only one animatronic which is all 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.800
 mangle can do it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.520
 but what if both of these theories are wrong and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.949
 here someone else someone who was hiding in 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 the darkness is this we know that scott 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.170
 many teasers does in the style of previous 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.329
 teasers look at this at this or at 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.670
 This is what u tried to create. 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.010
 connection between previous teasers and old 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.960
 animatronics and new teasers that is 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.430
 knows about animatronics so can 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.530
 it is to be that he is on this teaser 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.110
 used the same trick 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 I personally immediately come to mind 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.729
 teaser with animatronic in the shade 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.810
 here this one and try to guess who 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.759
 us shadows of course springtrap but between 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.189
 these pictures make a big difference 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.560
 if you light the picture with prik paths 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.720
 then you will see springtrap obviously 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.140
 and here if you will brightens the present 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.479
 picture then you will not see anything but 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909
 maybe not our favorite springtrap here 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.840
 ordinary and springtrap nightmarish which 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.659
 for some reason 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.299
 became invisible in the dark maybe this is it 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.979
 ability 4 parts and see you now 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.570
 possible only in reflection 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.180
 by the way just now thought remember 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.619
 the theory is that the shadow of bonny is a spirit 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.899
 the man who died in costume 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.159
 springtrap so can it be that 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:05.100
 shadow pony is really nobody else 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.070
 like a nightmare springtrap and he 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.930
 depicted 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.060
 on this teaser but it's just 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.100
 assumption in this case I'm nothing 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.620
 I do not claim at least for now but 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.480
 there is another option here that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.820
 in fact there is depicted at all who 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.200
 but the fact that this animatronic 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.620
 hiding in the shadows 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.900
 is a hint that the following 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.880
 the nightmarish animatronic will be none other 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.040
 like a nightmare springtrap 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.170
 well, or the usual springtrap because teasers 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.450
 fnaf 3 so he was first in the shadows 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.700
 then he got out of it don't forget 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.620
 what if we look at stage 3 and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.930
 light and and by the way note springtrap 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.489
 hiding in the dark again every time 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.700
 when we see him on teasers on 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.980
 pictures he hides in the dark not 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.050
 weak coincidence is n't it we gonna see 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.700
 springtrap face and at least i like 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.290
 we can see he had no 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.080
 fire damage 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.450
 so I believe it means that his 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.320
 history springtrap history not yet 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.630
 is over 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.610
 I mean, what kind of current is Scott 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.769
 show us intact spa 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.540
 Rector on how Easter a newspaper 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.519
 if he was dead then scott was 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.410
 It would be logical to show what the Dead 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.570
 showing on his face some 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.000
 Damage was rift Gtra will be in 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.920
 the game that in theory should be his teaser I 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.049
 not saying something spectra in reflection on 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.600
 one hundred percent but that's enough 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.390
 interesting remark is that teaser 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.519
 this one again looks like a teaser 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.980
 previous possible to hint at 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.380
 write the next teaser in the comments 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.299
 What do you think about this red or 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.370
 it may be true that it is all expensive 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.370
 goodbye for now
