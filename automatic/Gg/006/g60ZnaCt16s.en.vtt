00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 this video I would like you to see it and 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.650
 whole had started to see this 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.899
 video if I could hold four minutes and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.490
 half listening to me I like to stay and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.920
 if not then directly and what to take for 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.059
 I sack in jest but I do believe that the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.380
 evident not percent if of some 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.809
 I assure you that you know that the neighborhood is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
 rescued from the cinema mode the I to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.789
 video will be 15 days 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.710
 also plan what happens with 15 days 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.740
 is left to do in 15 let's say 15 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.010
 days to do many things 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.369
 but on August 15 I will go up to the 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.500
 channel one of the videos that maybe for 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.170
 me are more important than everything 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.879
 I have on YouTube you do not have 1,700 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.080
 videos or something like this uploaded on youtube it 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.030
 they set the amount of videos 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.129
 important that I can have but the 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 video of day 15 is one of the videos 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.739
 what 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.350
 more effort more wins and more illusion I've 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.870
 since I've been on youtube since day 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.420
 15 goes up affinity montage of black ops 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 2 of neox and mine 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.360
 edited by brave the montage not what 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.149
 it means anybody and by the way 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.129
 the assembly wants to say it because it's not going 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.979
 to be the best assembly you are going to see 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.049
 in your life what I just want to say 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.350
 already at the entrance, that is, do not do not do 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.640
 expectation that you're going to see I do not know about 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.679
 catalysis 3 or examples 27 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.649
 I do not want you to go with that one with that 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.750
 expectation to assemble if it is true that 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.550
 we've spent a lot of time I think 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.970
 explains why affinity has taken 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.740
 so much in climbing 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.810
 to youtube and why it took so long in 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.940
 finishing first was because what 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.980
 We were going to take out in February but in January 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.810
 I got the fiber optic and 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.420
 I started to play and start falling more 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.460
 clips then we said hey this 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.140
 can this go well because now with the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.520
 with the new connection gives me better 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.110
 call of duty we are not even going to wait 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.780
 a little bit, let's go and see if I can 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.160
 take off on something else for we use affinity 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.720
 then when we were going to finish that 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.340
 they were worth I wanted to avoid his wanted 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.410
 I want it to be valid when editing your montage 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.479
 of monster of the list then I 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.150
 they ask me hey you care delayed 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.950
 physio I said no problem editing the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.429
 first action and then we finish 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.990
 affinity and that's what happened 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.360
 that's why there have been so many stoppages in the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.910
 assembly that's why we took a bit 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.830
 more than expected to upload it and in 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.440
 finish it the truth that I am very 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.270
 happy with him with the final work of 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.209
 the fair that right now when I'm 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.140
 recording this video on August 1 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.510
 100% of the sound is finished like this 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.400
 I want to touch up small children 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.270
 nuances some shot a bolt things 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.420
 A) Yes 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.860
 put it perfect and what I said is not going 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.330
 to be the best assembly that will take 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.890
 in your life talking, far from it 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.640
 health and goya of entrance so that you go 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.560
 with that expectation to 0 the assembly and not 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.170
 I want to put a hype that does not deserve 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.430
 a video yes I tell you that it is a video 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.860
 that I have put a lot of love 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.290
 time you tried to reach the limit 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.450
 of my possibilities and my ability 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.110
 playing with him with the sniper and 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.150
 that for I suppose for some people 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.390
 will not have what is the standard enough 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.280
 of the assembly by the way I have the reaction 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.780
 of the closer I have recorded or the rise 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.140
 loose after the assembly you are going to flip 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.560
 I do not say anything else with that but I have 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.860
 a satisfied with the work and with the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.810
 final result of affinity has been a 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.640
 lots of time editing because it takes 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.380
 enough 3d models all that what 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.630
 we have been editing valjean taught me 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.430
 the model I would then get into the mode 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.470
 cinema recreating the movement that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.930
 that the camera was doing since it has not been 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.670
 only the work of playing caudi out 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.190
 the plays but then also has 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.310
 been the fact of doing all the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.310
 cinematic and that everything is perfect 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.010
 so follow a video that I want you to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.630
 you see and that a video that we made 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.209
 block in the comments but yes that 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.760
 I would like with the hashtag pads 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.880
 and try to do it trending topic the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.380
 Day 15 I do obviously the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.620
 expectations that I have is that the video 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.300
 Get over 6000 likes and that 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.840
 I did trending topics 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.800
 would be would we go super happy at one hundred 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.630
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.380
 and that's all I have to comment 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.410
 on the 15th you will have it, I do not know at what time 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.090
 already 15 days but yes I am very 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.440
 happy with how the assembly has been 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.160
 and I hope that you after so much 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.050
 you like it, I hope you do not 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.280
 Many of you have been disappointed 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.020
 I told him not to go with the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.530
 expectation of finding a catalyst 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.260
 3 or anything like that but we 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.100
 would like the day on the 15th to be 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.990
 that video - suddenly jsa my brother 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.510
 visits and not resale me and love me 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.600
 for all the work that has taken 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.810
 behind this video because there are many 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.600
 months preparing a single video and 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.090
 final everything is channeled into that in the 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.040
 feedback that I get for you 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.470

 secondary channel in case I have not 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.920

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.670

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.250
