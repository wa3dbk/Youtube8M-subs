00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello and welcome to vector 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 The google nexus 10 comes with course 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.650
 an absolutely ingenious cpu 2 gb 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.350
 RAM et cetera pp 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 but the best hardware component and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.430
 Of course the highlight is definitely 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.619
 the display and that's why we want it in 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 this video with the rentner display 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.390
 of the apple ipad 3 that in my opinion 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.309
 so far the best in the tablet sector 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.899
 display has shown compare 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.260
 Now you might ask why 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.149
 is in the title ipad 3 6 line ipad 4 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.399
 because in the new ipad the fourth 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.149
 generation one- to- one the same panel 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.550
 was built 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.530
 ie it does not matter whether you as the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.350
 nexus target with ipad 4 or ipad 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.559
 the first thing said the camera can 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.270
 unfortunately not always 100 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.039
 percent accurate and true to reality 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 catch and it depends of course 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.840
 from the angle of the display to the camera 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.000
 but I tried that as possible 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.559
 equal and chances to be the same and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.140
 besides, I am also there for that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 to comment on whole 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.890
 in advance, it should also be said that we 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.260
 of course with both tablets the display 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 provided the display brightness to 100% 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.850
 have once here at nexus 10 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.439
 and of course the ipad of the third 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.430
 generation you see the conditions here 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.310
 So they are absolutely identical 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.979
 We want equal time in the browser what is 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.590
 immediately noticeable here at mirror online 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.900
 that will be very sharp in both 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 The text will be at both you 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.369
 printed so it really looks like 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.150
 I would have a newspaper in front of me yes that 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.759
 alpl the nexus 10 now have one 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.250
 2,560 x 1,600 pixels at one 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.560
 pixel density of 300 pixels per inch yes 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.950
 a higher pixel density than the ipad 3 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.180
 an even higher which dissolves at 2048 x 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 1536 pixels at 264 pixels per inch 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.369
 means in theory is the display of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.259
 nexus 10 sharper in practice i can 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.360
 but personally just say that 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.069
 human eye in principle not 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.649
 more difference will be seen 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.090
 such an internet site so the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.720
 really do not take that much 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.210
 affects 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.950
 such a great shaaf is easy 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.510
 absolutely ingenious from that one can now in 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.310
 video probably not recognizable 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.870
 you have to have seen that in front of you 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.260
 but that is already at the very highest 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.660
 level 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.820
 yes that's it in my opinion 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.010
 what android has always lacked, I my 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.780
 man had full hd displays everything nice 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.890
 and nice but that can not at this 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.480
 wow effect 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.270
 that can not be due to this pixeldichte 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.190
 just absolutely awesome on both 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.840
 displays 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.300
 we are now at both 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.130
 equipment in the gallery and we see 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.320
 Of course, we also have the two 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.360
 absolutely identical test pictures on it 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.740
 have and want the whole thing easy now 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.740
 let's compare open 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.330
 first of all this picture and what immediately 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.750
 Of course, that is striking 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.180
 different ratio in the display 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.340
 that was already right in the browser 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.890
 are noticeable here at the ipad namely 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.709
 a display in 4 3 format here once in the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.990
 16 10 format yes, of course, the same 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.570
 on here too on the black edges 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.690
 the first at the ipad larger than the nexus 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.850
 10 since that is a picture in 16 9 format 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.760
 We also have nexus 10 here 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.110
 a pls display at ipad an ips 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.730
 display pls is samsung answer from ips 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.220
 displays should be something again 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.680
 better view should have something 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.690
 less power need to be a little brighter 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.310
 yes in principle, that's all again 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.519
 marketing terms it is in principle 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.560
 the same technology we are now 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.690
 to the different or come to me 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.080
 now directly to the contrast 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.320
 What I notice because the ipad has one 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.269
 something colder color temperature I would 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.030
 let's say the colors look a bit different 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.040
 colder it has the more pleasant 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.870
 Contrast values ​​for me personally that 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.090
 but of course it remains a matter of taste 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.730
 one or the other will be on the nexus 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.430
 10 better liked the nexus 10 but has 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.810
 definitely the slightly better black 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.790
 I'll just see that you can not 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.650
 so well recognize here by the camera 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.690
 but I can tell you that he is 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.970
 Of course, something better is also at the 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.769
 calibration as already mentioned by 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.479
 Both do not take value like that 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.370
 many though that the ipad is something 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.160
 I like the colder one 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.500
 turn on the ipad 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.180
 the better regarding brightness i 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.420
 find the displays both really in 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.430
 about the same bright measurements of the verge 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.590
 For example, so have the result 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.440
 The displays are about the same size 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.230
 I would really say that's both 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.940
 very excellent panels and that is 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.220
 really like at a level 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.260
 The contrasts are something 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.700
 calibrated differently or the 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.080
 but actually that is 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.390
 of course a matter of taste 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.980
 general are like mine here 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.990
 the two best panels in the 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.940
 Tablet area they differ 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.060
 really only minimal and at the end 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.890
 Of course, it remains a matter of taste 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.600
 Definitely can say is that the ipad 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.450
 no longer the best display in the world 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.190
 tablet has got to do with the nexus 10 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.570
 android since finally caught up and 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.030
 we see here as I said the two 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.010
 best displays in this sense hope 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.200
 As always, this video is yours 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.100
 Please thank me for watching and 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.240
 says yes 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.240
 until next time
