00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
many of you know that that we had a

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.770 
many of you know that that we had a
power<00:00:08.099> we've<00:00:08.519> got<00:00:08.550> here<00:00:08.940> on<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> seventeenth

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.760 
and I think we lost our power on the
18th<00:00:13.469> or<00:00:13.679> 19th<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:15.049> it<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.199> down<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:16.619> like
