00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.230
 People have really been part of this week. 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:10.490
 the week in Japanese 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.799
 a week or of course marked by the sun 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.819
 the psychological recovery of makes the team of 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.730
 of the coming team 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.600
 let's say in rome with this week after a coach change anyway 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.300
 determines something 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.489
 she came 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.550
 after z 0 than on a psychological level 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.390
 you know one says we lost anyway though 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.000
 inevitably disc releases 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.620
 and so we worked the voice in the heat of working above all 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.810
 this point of view as well as mail tactics 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.540
 and we didn't want to start the game in that way my fear was that 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.070
 that of entering the field still cornaro with which seven necks on the brain 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.160
 let's say empathy I get up I have to say that the first minutes the feeling was 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.940
 that 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.740
 and after the second which I must be honest the team twice to play 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.330
 to play I repeat not doing an extraordinary class kick with concepts 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.050
 logical 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.050
 we also arrived quite dangerously 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.770
 it would give some of this moment beyond defensive fragility 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.590
 we say that we have shown in the first 2 goals 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.020
 lymph torture we struggle we don't stick the door with rage 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.570
 right horns with the players 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.670
 the number of the right players then 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.050
 so nothing was working exactly as it was I knew I was thinking 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.170
 in the approach it opens more your experience than I like center defense 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.320
 massÃ¬ because you know 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.000
 when you lose 2 untidy lecce of a collapse that what we could not 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.160
 not allowing ourselves is that we are satisfied to have lost 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.830
 only two to zero though 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.610
 you say you want the player who has sam to take responsibility 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.560
 and techniques and tactics 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.030
 player like liverani although obviously not in the best shape if not 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.229
 other from 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.969
 by giometria is a little bit of experience 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.859
 the same puddle reported in defense of the judgment at this time 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.039
 guarantees it is an absurd river
