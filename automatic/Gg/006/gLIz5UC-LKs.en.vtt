00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
off with juggernaut which is a very very

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490 
off with juggernaut which is a very very
important<00:01:06.360> thing<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.869> strategy<00:01:07.290> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
important thing for this strategy in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
important thing for this strategy in
this<00:01:08.310> map<00:01:08.610> when<00:01:08.850> you're<00:01:08.970> floating<00:01:09.180> around

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
this map when you're floating around

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
this map when you're floating around
because<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> no<00:01:10.110> gravity<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.250> easy<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
because of no gravity it is very easy to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.130 
because of no gravity it is very easy to
get<00:01:11.880> double<00:01:12.180> hit<00:01:12.360> even<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:12.840> you're<00:01:12.960> raped

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
get double hit even when you're raped

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.450 
get double hit even when you're raped
raining<00:01:13.470> even<00:01:13.680> though<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> rape<00:01:14.010> scene<00:01:14.159> areas

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
raining even though the rape scene areas

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
raining even though the rape scene areas
are<00:01:14.610> pretty<00:01:14.790> easy<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.810> map<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.380> easily

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
are pretty easy in this map very easily

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.899 
are pretty easy in this map very easily
this<00:01:16.740> map<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.130> there's<00:01:17.310> such<00:01:17.430> wide<00:01:17.610> open

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
this map because there's such wide open

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
this map because there's such wide open
areas<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:19.049> very<00:01:19.229> easy<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.830> double<00:01:20.100> hit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
areas it's very easy to get double hit

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850 
areas it's very easy to get double hit
because<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:22.140> gravity<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.650> end<00:01:22.770> up

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
because of you know gravity you end up

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.230 
because of you know gravity you end up
floating<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> can't<00:01:23.729> control<00:01:23.820> where<00:01:24.180> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
floating and you can't control where you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030 
floating and you can't control where you
want<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.350> once<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.009> here
