00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.029
 It is not only the return of dragon 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.680
 good ball of the saga dragon ball but 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.440
 for the first time to the big screen and 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.350
 with a movie of this caliber how do you 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.029
 you feel after 13 years I guess that 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.240
 having doubled for the last time 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.840
 character and now then come back then look 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.730
 very happy very happy this one that 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.610
 they will combine so many things that diamond 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.950
 You feel very kindly because you agreed to 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.280
 talk with us to take us in 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.350
 account what was important I think that 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.930
 they heard the fans and I think that the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.149
 fans are going to thank you for life not 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.570
 that is, is this movie created such 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.840
 expectation 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.820
 I believe that it will be a success is a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.830
 success I think then yes I think I think that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.660
 everything came together today I'm very happy 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.660
 the truth very very grateful 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.680
 then he wants to destroy the earth 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.630
 the powerful one who was what you 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.729
 took to say yes if I want to do what 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.700
 As for the process, look, I never said 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.259
 no not at the beginning when people told me 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 is that the movie is coming 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.970
 well first I do not know because it would have 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 that least wanted that study arrives if 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.590
 we are going to fix ourselves economically 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.990
 because there is also a part that has to be 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.670
 understand also in this phenomenon that is 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 this part of remuneration is 8 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.330
 100 50 thousand dollars that I asked for the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.520
 movie I think it 's okay it's not 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.220
 a lot but there has to be that part not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.040
 then this one 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.450
 I'm really happy because you 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.340
 I say let's go 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.250
 he heard us was also open 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.530
 listen to us to say hear good we go to 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.230
 sit down to talk to negotiate that no 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.900
 it was what happened unfortunately 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.570
 with the saga of kai where they did not take us 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.700
 account for nothing this where also 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.860
 We wanted to arrive as a negotiation 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.840
 and neither did the fans take into account 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.720
 then they all joined together 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.360
 for to get to this moment and now 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.290
 yes there is your wish fulfilled 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.290
 and what are you waiting for? 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.360
 this is the end of the earth 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.760
 It's the end of the galaxy 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.410
 be willing to return in a new 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.110
 saga animals of course of course 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.180
 I mean, I really, I want to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.850
 much to vegueta because he has accompanied me 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.620
 all of life not only when that's over 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.170
 we continue to make conventions 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.500
 all hand in Mexico say not in 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.810
 Latin America has been several times in 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.760
 Latin American places people follow 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.720
 still very much like this is endearing 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.550
 it became a classic not then by 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.470
 Of course it would accept 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.000
 obviously we will have to wait where 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.030
 arrives and we would have to talk so that 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.930
 if all these things are combined 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.930
 forward I love life 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.310
 Hello, you would like to fight a little with me 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.640
 hollow head how do you think to challenge 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.819
 a god what has been your scene more 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.519
 emotive characterizing a vegueta 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.590
 character that is so cold so bad 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.790
 and that little by little it is transforming 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.620
 throughout the series even though 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.629
 want you call him he did not make characters 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.700
 sentimental as he himself said 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.439
 you have given them characterization 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.030
 what would be your most emotional moment because 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.519
 I think the part is Latin that 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.329
 we finally have to beat 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.329
 to the melodrama 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.579
 but I think the most emotional part is 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.379
 this is not when he dies he is about to 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.349
 die has already finished on the floor and 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:51.760
 recognizes and gives it up as this part is 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:56.799
 take away the pride this has and says 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.900
 kakaroto see this not you go I'm already 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.700
 He already speaks to you in a little bit but 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.959
 what a carlotto 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.780
 I'm with you I give you my power and 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.440
 recognizes further that kakaroto is that the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.440
 his person 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.700
 dragonball z the battle of the gods
