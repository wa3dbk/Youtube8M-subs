00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:04.170 
the center console again the reason
we're<00:04:03.940> taking

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
we're taking

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.520 
we're taking
all<00:04:04.269> this<00:04:04.420> out<00:04:04.599> is<00:04:04.840> if<00:04:04.959> we're<00:04:05.109> using<00:04:05.260> the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
all this out is if we're using the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.319 
all this out is if we're using the
connections<00:04:06.010> for<00:04:06.280> our<00:04:06.430> satellite<00:04:06.969> radio

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
connections for our satellite radio

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.380 
connections for our satellite radio
pre-wired<00:04:07.840> x3s<00:04:08.590> in<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.890> hatch<00:04:09.099> very<00:04:10.000> simple

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
pre-wired x3s in the hatch very simple

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.270 
pre-wired x3s in the hatch very simple
you<00:04:10.480> see<00:04:10.629> back<00:04:10.810> here<00:04:11.019> on<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.170> harness<00:04:11.319> there's

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
you see back here on the harness there's

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.229 
you see back here on the harness there's
an<00:04:12.430> extra<00:04:12.760> little<00:04:12.969> plug<00:04:13.180> tied<00:04:13.420> in

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
an extra little plug tied in

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.979 
an extra little plug tied in
look<00:04:16.239> at<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:17.489> says<00:04:18.489> SD<00:04:18.910> ARS<00:04:19.359> that's<00:04:19.810> a

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
look at that says SD ARS that's a

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.230 
look at that says SD ARS that's a
satellite<00:04:20.229> so<00:04:20.889> that's<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.759> this<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.120> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
satellite so that's the that this is the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.570 
satellite so that's the that this is the
six<00:04:22.690> pin<00:04:22.870> connector<00:04:23.229> in<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.380> hatch<00:04:23.590> this<00:04:24.400> is

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
six pin connector in the hatch this is

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.800 
six pin connector in the hatch this is
the<00:04:24.669> six<00:04:24.880> pin<00:04:25.060> connector<00:04:25.389> in<00:04:25.509> the<00:04:25.539> center

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
the six pin connector in the center

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.640 
the six pin connector in the center
console<00:04:26.199> so<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:27.070> simply<00:04:27.250> unplug<00:04:27.789> this<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:31.650> we

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
console so you simply unplug this and we

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.140 
console so you simply unplug this and we
would<00:04:32.770> plug<00:04:32.949> this<00:04:33.460> one<00:04:33.639> in<00:04:35.699> done<00:04:36.699> and<00:04:36.849> done

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
would plug this one in done and done

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.420 
would plug this one in done and done
slide<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.449> radio<00:04:37.660> back<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.289> we<00:04:39.130> can<00:04:39.280> now

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
slide the radio back in and we can now

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.400 
slide the radio back in and we can now
use<00:04:39.729> the<00:04:40.000> input<00:04:40.150> plugs<00:04:40.570> back<00:04:40.990> in<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.259> hatch

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
use the input plugs back in the hatch

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.439 
use the input plugs back in the hatch
area<00:04:41.650> again<00:04:42.400> most<00:04:42.699> of<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.940> will<00:04:43.060> be<00:04:43.180> doing

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
area again most of you will be doing

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.930 
area again most of you will be doing
that<00:04:43.570> but<00:04:43.900> sometimes<00:04:44.470> it's<00:04:44.889> called<00:04:45.250> for<00:04:45.610> and

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
that but sometimes it's called for and

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.249 
that but sometimes it's called for and
we<00:04:46.360> wanted<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.690> make<00:04:46.810> sure<00:04:46.840> we<00:04:47.110> had<00:04:47.229> that

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
we wanted to make sure we had that

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.339 
we wanted to make sure we had that
covered<00:04:47.680> for<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:47.979> in<00:04:48.130> HD<00:04:48.520> video<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:49.570> that's

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
covered for you in HD video so that's

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.330 
covered for you in HD video so that's
going<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.560> really<00:04:50.680> cover<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:51.009> so<00:04:51.130> we're<00:04:51.250> going

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
going to really cover it so we're going

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.680 
going to really cover it so we're going
to<00:04:51.400> actually<00:04:51.520> put<00:04:51.699> this<00:04:51.910> back<00:04:52.180> because<00:04:52.539> we<00:04:52.660> are

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
to actually put this back because we are

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.240 
to actually put this back because we are
not<00:04:52.960> we're<00:04:53.560> going<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.770> use<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:54.039> center

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
not we're going to use the center

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.540 
not we're going to use the center
console<00:04:54.610> cables<00:04:54.970> because<00:04:56.310> that's<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.430> way<00:04:57.520> I

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
console cables because that's the way I

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.249 
console cables because that's the way I
roll<00:04:57.849> so<00:04:58.389> we'll<00:04:58.509> put<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.660> back<00:04:58.930> in<00:04:59.080> there

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
roll so we'll put that back in there

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.550 
roll so we'll put that back in there
I'll<00:04:59.620> tape<00:04:59.830> it<00:04:59.919> back<00:04:59.979> up<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:01.229> we'll<00:05:02.229> slide<00:05:02.410> the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
I'll tape it back up and we'll slide the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.200 
I'll tape it back up and we'll slide the
radio<00:05:02.800> back<00:05:03.070> into<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.460> dash<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:03.970> again<00:05:04.120> if

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
radio back into the dash and again if

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.300 
radio back into the dash and again if
you<00:05:04.300> put<00:05:04.330> an<00:05:04.509> aftermarket<00:05:04.840> radio<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:05.380> be

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
you put an aftermarket radio and be

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.210 
you put an aftermarket radio and be
putting<00:05:06.550> something<00:05:06.729> else<00:05:06.940> in<00:05:07.090> here<00:05:08.220> again

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
putting something else in here again

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.399 
putting something else in here again
it's<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:09.909> straightforward<00:05:10.479> they<00:05:10.900> did<00:05:11.050> such<00:05:11.380> a

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
it's so straightforward they did such a

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.310 
it's so straightforward they did such a
nice<00:05:11.620> job<00:05:11.680> with<00:05:12.099> designing<00:05:12.400> this<00:05:12.610> radio<00:05:13.229> so<00:05:14.229> we

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
nice job with designing this radio so we

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.629 
nice job with designing this radio so we
get<00:05:14.440> everything<00:05:14.620> put<00:05:14.919> back<00:05:14.979> together<00:05:15.280> and

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
get everything put back together and

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.010 
get everything put back together and
it's<00:05:15.760> just<00:05:15.940> kind<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.210> reverse<00:05:16.570> of<00:05:16.810> what<00:05:16.870> we

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
it's just kind of reverse of what we
