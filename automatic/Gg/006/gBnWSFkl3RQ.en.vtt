00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.220
 take them all very expensive 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.130
 sold here somewhere somewhere dollars 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.400
 18th auction but I usually waited 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.340
 when they drop the price a little when 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.280
 take it here for the top ten probably 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.740
 and then I start nursing it 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.190
 if you look here in the pots 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:38.340
 it is not difficult to show such red sticks 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:41.670
 fertilizer to them and still below that cop 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.860

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.970
 Do Cossack this dragonfruit and such 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.380

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.800
 rarely water 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:26.130

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.989

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.790
