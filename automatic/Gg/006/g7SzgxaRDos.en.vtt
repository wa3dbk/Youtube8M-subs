hello<00:00:00.690> there<00:00:01.050> welcome<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.820> fruit<00:00:02.990> world<00:00:03.990> at

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hello there welcome to fruit world at

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.829 
hello there welcome to fruit world at
war<00:00:04.350> different<00:00:05.240> strategy<00:00:06.240> than<00:00:06.270> normal

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
war different strategy than normal

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.620 
war different strategy than normal
because<00:00:07.109> uh<00:00:07.820> the<00:00:08.820> strategy<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.450> normally

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
because uh the strategy that I normally

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.410 
because uh the strategy that I normally
use<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.139> quite<00:00:10.860> hard<00:00:11.519> if<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.030> don't<00:00:12.240> know<00:00:12.360> what

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
use is quite hard if you don't know what

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.010 
use is quite hard if you don't know what
you're<00:00:12.570> doing<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:14.219> those<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.490> don't

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
you're doing so for those that don't

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.500 
you're doing so for those that don't
this<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.320> guess<00:00:16.890> would<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.279> ideal<00:00:17.510> strategy

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this I guess would be the ideal strategy

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.470 
this I guess would be the ideal strategy
for<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.890> start<00:00:19.949> out<00:00:20.220> over<00:00:20.490> here<00:00:20.640> with

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
for you so you start out over here with

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.090 
for you so you start out over here with
whatever<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.109> want<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.500> don't<00:00:22.560> care<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> you

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
whatever you want I don't care and you

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.560 
whatever you want I don't care and you
have<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.519> flame<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.000> report<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.390> by

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
have to have the flame to report this by

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.689 
have to have the flame to report this by
the<00:00:24.630> way<00:00:24.720> because<00:00:25.650> flamethrowers<00:00:26.279> only<00:00:26.550> gun

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the way because flamethrowers only gun

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.490 
the way because flamethrowers only gun
that<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:26.970> actually<00:00:27.090> kill<00:00:27.449> things<00:00:27.689> except

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that can actually kill things except

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.970 
that can actually kill things except
power<00:00:29.039> weapon<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.670> knocked<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.869> proved<00:00:31.260> it's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
power weapon up knocked and proved it's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.090 
power weapon up knocked and proved it's
the<00:00:32.910> best<00:00:33.450> thing<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> kragen<00:00:34.770> that's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the best thing there is a kragen that's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.790 
the best thing there is a kragen that's
it<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.610> can't<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.969> anything<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:37.200> yeah<00:00:37.620> what

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it that can't do anything so yeah what

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.049 
it that can't do anything so yeah what
you<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.250> turn<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> trap<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
you do is you just turn on the trap and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.450 
you do is you just turn on the trap and
flame<00:00:39.719> all<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.850> that's<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> uh<00:00:43.460> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
flame all of them that's it and uh the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.619 
flame all of them that's it and uh the
only<00:00:44.640> part<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> worry<00:00:45.239> about<00:00:45.390> his

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
only part you have to worry about his

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.900 
only part you have to worry about his
window<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> trap<00:00:46.379> turns<00:00:46.649> off<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.670> when

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
window the trap turns off because when

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.900 
window the trap turns off because when
that<00:00:48.059> happens<00:00:48.480> some<00:00:48.780> life<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.649> now<00:00:49.910> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
that happens some life right now you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
that happens some life right now you
should<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.149> looking<00:00:51.510> towards<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> at

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
should be looking towards there and at

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.500 
should be looking towards there and at
this<00:00:53.399> point<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
this point on what you have to do is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.630 
this point on what you have to do is
just<00:00:54.539> run<00:00:55.530> downstairs<00:00:55.710> because<00:00:56.190> there's<00:00:56.520> not

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
just run downstairs because there's not

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.610 
just run downstairs because there's not
gonna<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.879> any<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.149> spawning<00:00:57.480> obviously<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
gonna be any more spawning obviously and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240 
gonna be any more spawning obviously and
then<00:00:59.270> yeah<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:01.079> blame<00:01:01.500> them<00:01:01.710> until<00:01:02.129> they're

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
then yeah just blame them until they're

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.980 
then yeah just blame them until they're
dead<00:01:02.539> which<00:01:03.949> sometimes<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:06.390> strategy<00:01:06.869> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
dead which sometimes this strategy is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.070 
dead which sometimes this strategy is
easier<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.240> some<00:01:09.479> things<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
easier but there's some things like that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
easier but there's some things like that
which<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.740> annoying<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.520> guess<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
which can be annoying so I guess you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.320 
which can be annoying so I guess you
have<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.720> patient<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
have to be more patient just have to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.120 
have to be more patient just have to
maybe<00:01:15.330> run<00:01:15.720> around<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> circle<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.799> here

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
maybe run around in a circle down here

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.880 
maybe run around in a circle down here
with<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.180> last<00:01:18.479> 10<00:01:18.960> zombies<00:01:19.409> yourself<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
with like last 10 zombies yourself and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.109 
with like last 10 zombies yourself and
then<00:01:20.570> yeah<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> would<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:21.960> safest<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.280> guess<00:01:23.790> I

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
then yeah that would be safest I guess I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.530 
then yeah that would be safest I guess I
made<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> 69<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:27.240> number

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
made it up to 69 because that's number

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.800 
made it up to 69 because that's number
to<00:01:27.600> stop<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:28.049> after<00:01:29.509> messing<00:01:30.509> around<00:01:30.600> with

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to stop out after messing around with

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.740 
to stop out after messing around with
this<00:01:30.930> different<00:01:31.290> strategy<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:32.750> this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this different strategy because this

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.090 
this different strategy because this
strategy<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:35.450> not<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> huge<00:01:36.900> fan<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.680> not

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
strategy I not a huge fan of it's not

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
strategy I not a huge fan of it's not
quite<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.670> fun<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> other<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.900> look

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
quite as fun as the other one and look

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.030 
quite as fun as the other one and look
around<00:01:40.350> sober<00:01:40.799> yay<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.200> yeah<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.890> always

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
around sober yay and so yeah you always

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
around sober yay and so yeah you always
want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.490> window<00:01:44.790> prepared<00:01:45.600> by<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
want to have this window prepared by the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
want to have this window prepared by the
way<00:01:45.960> cuz<00:01:46.170> zombie<00:01:46.500> sometime<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.310> glitch

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
way cuz zombie sometime just can glitch

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.330 
way cuz zombie sometime just can glitch
through<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.810> repaired<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.920> by<00:01:50.100> one

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
through if it's not repaired like by one

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.149 
through if it's not repaired like by one
board<00:01:50.670> somehow<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:52.350> why<00:01:52.590> it's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
board somehow I don't know why it's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.630 
board somehow I don't know why it's
wrong<00:01:53.970> world<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.390> war<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:56.100> thing<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
wrong world at war and one thing you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.109 
wrong world at war and one thing you
have<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> worry<00:01:57.149> about<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.659> lot<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.380> is

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
have to worry about a lot with this is

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.030 
have to worry about a lot with this is
say<00:02:00.119> all<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> zombies<00:02:01.079> are<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> window<00:02:01.680> are

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
say all the zombies are the window are

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.359 
say all the zombies are the window are
dead<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.909> these<00:02:03.119> guys<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.950> last<00:02:05.159> zombie

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
dead like these guys and the last zombie

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.590 
dead like these guys and the last zombie
ends<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.119> through<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> trap

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
ends up going through the trap

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.280 
ends up going through the trap
and<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:08.050> that<00:02:08.110> case<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.740> trap<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:09.069> not

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
and in that case the trap is not

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.140 
and in that case the trap is not
recharged<00:02:11.290> or<00:02:11.530> whatever<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.970> that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
recharged or whatever so in that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.910 
recharged or whatever so in that
situation<00:02:13.510> what<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.319> have<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.560> do<00:02:14.680> is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
situation what you have to do is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.250 
situation what you have to do is
actually<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:16.980> run<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.190> old<00:02:18.370> train<00:02:19.080> like<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
actually just run the old train like the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.110 
actually just run the old train like the
one<00:02:20.410> by<00:02:20.590> speed<00:02:21.100> Cola<00:02:21.370> in<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.640> kitchen<00:02:21.970> area

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
one by speed Cola in the kitchen area

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.440 
one by speed Cola in the kitchen area
cuz<00:02:22.739> well<00:02:23.739> while<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> was<00:02:24.550> playing<00:02:24.819> this<00:02:24.970> game<00:02:25.180> I

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
cuz well while I was playing this game I

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.620 
cuz well while I was playing this game I
didn't<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:27.280> door<00:02:27.670> closed<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.540> you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
didn't have that door closed that you

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.150 
didn't have that door closed that you
need<00:02:28.780> clothes<00:02:29.020> for<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.380> but<00:02:29.650> I'd<00:02:29.770> suggest

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
need clothes for that but I'd suggest

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.910 
need clothes for that but I'd suggest
leaving<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.610> closed<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.209> doing<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.920> they

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
leaving that closed and doing and they

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.270 
leaving that closed and doing and they
do<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.310> strategy<00:02:33.730> till<00:02:34.200> 40<00:02:35.200> or<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.880> for

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
do that strategy till 40 or so just for

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.680 
do that strategy till 40 or so just for
swabbing<00:02:39.280> purposes<00:02:40.000> because<00:02:40.150> they<00:02:40.480> spawn

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
swabbing purposes because they spawn

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.979 
swabbing purposes because they spawn
really<00:02:40.989> slow<00:02:41.340> about<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.550> first<00:02:42.810> 40<00:02:43.810> rounds

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
really slow about the first 40 rounds

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.660 
really slow about the first 40 rounds
and<00:02:44.500> uh<00:02:45.310> yeah<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:46.170> also<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.440> can<00:02:47.709> tell<00:02:47.890> i<00:02:48.400> was

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
and uh yeah this also you can tell i was

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.180 
and uh yeah this also you can tell i was
watching<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.390> trap<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:49.840> time<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.319> think<00:02:50.830> that

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
watching the trap this time I think that

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.530 
watching the trap this time I think that
was<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> minute<00:02:51.790> ago<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.239> doesn't

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
was like a minute ago so it doesn't

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.290 
was like a minute ago so it doesn't
matter<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.860> yeah<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.269> to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
matter to you and yeah you just have to

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.410 
matter to you and yeah you just have to
flame<00:02:55.600> them<00:02:55.840> forever<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.280> ever<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.819> ever<00:02:58.090> and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
flame them forever and ever and ever and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.280 
flame them forever and ever and ever and
it<00:02:58.720> works<00:02:59.220> eventually<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.470> yeah<00:03:03.370> round<00:03:03.730> 7<00:03:04.290> 170

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
it works eventually so yeah round 7 170

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.140 
it works eventually so yeah round 7 170
what<00:03:05.590> round<00:03:06.100> 67<00:03:07.140> complete<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.940> i'm<00:03:09.940> going<00:03:10.060> to

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
you're gonna get trapped in areas like

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.250

the<00:04:06.579> stairs<00:04:06.880> when<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.840> go<00:04:07.930> down<00:04:08.109> there

the stairs when you go down there

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.039 
the stairs when you go down there
because<00:04:08.530> it's<00:04:09.239> safer<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.450> go<00:04:10.540> there<00:04:10.810> then

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
because it's safer to go there then

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.930 
because it's safer to go there then
towards<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.530> power<00:04:11.890> because<00:04:12.310> that's<00:04:12.549> wait

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
towards the power because that's wait

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.300 
towards the power because that's wait
tighter<00:04:13.359> over<00:04:13.780> there<00:04:13.930> that's<00:04:14.829> what<00:04:15.010> she<00:04:15.040> said

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
tighter over there that's what she said

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
it's obvious glitch on walls which is

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.960 
it's obvious glitch on walls which is
fun<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.100> you<00:04:40.490> can<00:04:41.170> logic<00:04:42.170> on<00:04:42.320> route<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:42.970> really

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
fun and you can logic on route is really

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.550 
fun and you can logic on route is really
weird<00:04:44.150> because<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.600> can<00:04:44.750> get<00:04:44.870> hit<00:04:45.050> like<00:04:45.200> eight

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
weird because you can get hit like eight
