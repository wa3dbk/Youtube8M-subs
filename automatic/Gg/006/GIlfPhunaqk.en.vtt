00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.869
 hi today we are going to talk about this jacket 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.189
 so beautiful skin that is called dainese 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:27.810
 from abro pl the herb is made with skin 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.700
 bovine and elastic parts throughout 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.480
 arm 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.790
 in the neck and also in the shoulder blades 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 to falsify your position on top of the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.530
 sample is a jacket that respect 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.110
 other cards in the same segment 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.240
 we already see that the elastic reaches a 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.309
 little bit more up and let's say that already 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.970
 is positioned on a type of motorcycle a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.790
 little sporty still does not take her 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.610
 hump that that's fine because 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.610
 We can mix with various bikes but 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 it has a fairly fast width 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.000
 its adjustable adjustable neck with two 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.720
 clips 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.850
 to put also in this position then 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.980
 simply for different types of 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.980
 neck in case you wear a pant 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.030
 in a central way if we open we can see 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.020
 wearing a removable thermal liner and 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.540
 under an antiallergic form this is very 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.920
 interesting because also the difference 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.520
 enough of its competitors in it 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.030
 segment 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.740
 maybe it's not as big as other 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.710
 of their companies precisely because of this 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.659
 because when wearing the lining it is already 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.340
 a little bit we do not have to 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.770
 forget that later in summer when you 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.450
 we remove the lining we will also win 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.420
 enough space inside therefore 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 It has to be a size enough 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.170
 adjusted and although if we wear it we 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.360
 we see quite tight it does not pass 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.840
 absolutely nothing nothing happens the skin 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.840
 yield 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.799
 It is also a jacket with its 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:12.300
 pockets outside pockets in each 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.300
 side there is one and another one inside pocket 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.330
 and the zipper to hook to a 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.480
 dainese social or culture pants with 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.460
 what we would get then basically 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.030
 perform a two-piece suit in fact 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.280
 this model called abro exists 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.920
 also in two-piece suit and even 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.140
 in the one piece suit is not good either 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.270
 exactly the same way of doing it 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.990
 but at the design level yes that is respected 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.990
 quite 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 find the color 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.130
 I forgot here we have a pocket 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.200
 big enough to receive the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.930
 chest protection 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.140
 Valera a chest protection that 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.290
 also puts on suits of a skin 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.020
 in the back and inside 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.920
 take the pocket to receive a 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.900
 back protection g1 g2 out 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.550
 we can appreciate the dainese logo with 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.020
 reflective and here the cursive letters 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.780
 in the back and in the neck 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.140
 it's definitely a jacket what 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.700
 we say for sports bikes and naked 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.620
 it could also be used in the segments 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.020
 but let's say it's considered a 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.390
 Well high-end jacket with a lot 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.560
 protection and that you have to catch a 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.560
 little adjusted 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:47.680
