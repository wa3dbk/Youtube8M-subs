00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.800
 I make an effort I got into this I was 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.140
 I dominated the evil and entered with these 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.530
 types and check be it says and xbox live 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.120
 parity and what proust says I saw it and 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.879
 Well, if I said then this has to be 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.710
 a former pilot and what I got is giving 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.200
 because we are in the lobby all 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.970
 normal and in the first villeguense not 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.540
 they give me no exaggerated experience 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.840
 100154 all is well same as 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.730
 second nothing given yet but this one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.520
 You will see couple of things already and I am 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.320
 playing from bad george I did not notice anything 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
 weird and I do not know if you're not so agreed 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.480
 here from the beginning but this one me 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460
 I keep playing evil as if nothing and this one 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.710
 and then we started like I think it 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.180
 died somebody died two people and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.009
 there moved a couple of people like that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.170
 the same vision that everyone is 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.579
 is suicide because fuck and this is 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.159
 like it's good if you want to take the 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.159
 flag you do not want like they can 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.009
 and then if I'm here it's like I start 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.960
 to notice what the hell I think 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.000
 these bastards are flying and there I see 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.399
 the proof that if an uncle of mine was 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.950
 flying and it's already myth you'll see for the 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.079
 person in air this stand have as 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 that the top time they can jump and 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.439
 can jump high if you do not have 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.200
 this I do not know how to be able because you need 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.060
 so that you do not do falling davis then 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.469
 if there is this guy there is a sky verbier 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.959
 that I am going to shut up smith is a good 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.959
 sign this and checks my bullets now 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.989
 I do not know if they saw it but I have a drawer 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.429
 of bullets now this and it does not come to you no 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.619
 can not even these guys because there are 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.750
 jumping cartons and well yes I know that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.719
 pay me the classes are max that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.399
 I have there I have to like 1200 bullets 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.890
 and now they do not know that when we expose 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.829
 times and is that you feel a certain amount 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.810
 of kits I do not know if they will see here that we have 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.159
 as they put with normal and then 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.770
 when he does it is for you 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.679
 are max I do not know why the fuck and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.629
 has and can continue to shoot bullets 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.000
 limited there is no such thing as telling us that 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.799
 for him or nothing and there they see that the guy 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.790
 did as a color correction and I 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.129
 jumping 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.959
 I do not know how the fuck is doing it 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.269
 I had seen better than I could do well 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.219
 what could you do with that super 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.590
 jump I know they have that is the host the 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.870
 that to be able to do this without that after 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.939
 it fucked up and the walkies software after 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.829
 of everything removed from adjustments is not 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.379
 he could do nothing but if they will see me here 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.390
 jumping all over this map still not 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.489
 I have the project I have to have 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.109
 why random I do not know here we have 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.139
 mounted is that there is see saw because he wanted 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.180
 see how each was and is quite ready 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.459
 and I had fun in this game even though I was 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.430
 that there was that truth I do not know to me I do not 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.220
 annoyed while I do not know if a 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.650
 game of every 100 does not bother me but if 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.840
 it's half the games and how I imagine 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.730
 that now in call of duty 4 equal to wall 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.139
 and maybe with golf the sad 2 made a 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.370
 team gives more immediate to the bullets like this 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.500
 that does not get more because he liked it 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.260
 this video has entertained them 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.909
 this lady what happens this time in 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.220
 when in the first month nothing but 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.689
 entertains me entertained me and I hope 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.000
