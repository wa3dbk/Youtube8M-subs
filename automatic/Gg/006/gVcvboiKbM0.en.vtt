pretty<00:00:24.359> sure<00:00:24.510> that's<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.650> motors<00:00:26.130> they're

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
pretty sure that's the motors they're

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.279

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:24.130 

there's<00:02:05.439> your<00:02:05.619> LEDs

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.020 

that's<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.440> I'll<00:02:25.710> see<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.430> close<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.730> of

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
that's it I'll see if I can close up of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:39.650 
that's it I'll see if I can close up of
a<00:02:27.150> motor<00:02:35.900> using<00:02:36.900> for<00:02:37.320> brushed<00:02:37.650> motors<00:02:38.660> that

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
a motor using for brushed motors that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:03:13.940 
a motor using for brushed motors that
adhered<00:03:10.370> gears<00:03:11.370> hard<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.820> see<00:03:12.060> cuz<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.950> but

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
adhered gears hard to see cuz it but

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.490 
adhered gears hard to see cuz it but
it's<00:03:14.100> geared<00:03:14.400> down<00:03:14.580> here<00:03:15.000> from<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.420> motor<00:03:15.660> to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
it's geared down here from the motor to

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.800 
it's geared down here from the motor to
a<00:03:16.530> big<00:03:16.830> ear<00:03:19.700> let's<00:03:20.700> see<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.660> get

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
a big ear let's see if like to get

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.370 
a big ear let's see if like to get
better<00:03:22.020> light<00:03:22.410> here<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.600> still<00:03:24.840> can't<00:03:25.110> see

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
better light here and it still can't see

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:35.630 
better light here and it still can't see
them

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.170 

that's<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.480> Deevil<00:03:40.990> f7

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
that's it and this is the Deevil f7

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.910 
that's it and this is the Deevil f7
radial<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:46.450> could<00:03:46.630> see<00:03:46.840> how<00:03:47.020> more<00:03:47.260> details<00:03:47.710> in

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
radial you could see how more details in

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.950 
radial you could see how more details in
my<00:03:48.010> other<00:03:48.190> video<00:03:49.680> that's<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.860> combo<00:03:51.280> here<00:03:54.960> the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
my other video that's the combo here the

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.430 
my other video that's the combo here the
hot<00:03:56.230> tunics<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.160> diva<00:03:57.490> left<00:03:57.730> seven<00:03:58.440> they

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
hot tunics and the diva left seven they

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.880 
hot tunics and the diva left seven they
also<00:03:59.650> make<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.100> ladybird<00:04:00.820> version<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.770> what<00:04:02.770> the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
also make a ladybird version to what the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.380 
also make a ladybird version to what the
camera<00:04:03.250> built-in<00:04:03.700> but<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.030> looks<00:04:04.180> ultra

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
camera built-in but it looks ultra

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.230 
camera built-in but it looks ultra
lightweight<00:04:05.460> i'll<00:04:06.460> see<00:04:06.760> if<00:04:06.850> i<00:04:06.940> can<00:04:07.090> get<00:04:07.180> a

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
lightweight i'll see if i can get a

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.800 
lightweight i'll see if i can get a
sample<00:04:07.720> that's<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.140> review<00:04:08.590> also
