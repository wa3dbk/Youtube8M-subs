00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.990
 in this video we will see 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.519
 how to isolate an element to put it 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.879
 in color or just change its 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.620
 color 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.799
 so for that we will open our photo 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.629
 shock we will go to the window menu 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:16.310
 extension unit bridge we will see 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:19.170
 appear on the screen the retouched photo 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.920
 So here we come to open our photo 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 initial in black and white to be able to 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.509
 the editing is there so we will zoom and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.830
 we will define a selection so the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.990
 contrast between the fuel pump 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.390
 the element to divert the bottom not being 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.730
 it is important we are obliged to detour 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 with the pen we can not tricks and with 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.110
 the layers of colors so here is finally 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.300
 feathering for the needs of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.710
 the video the clipping I already did 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.700
 found in the drawn menu it is 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.559
 also recorded 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.260
 so we will come once our 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.030
 clipping and feather on our route 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.430
 so we can see that it is well closed 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.170
 all is well so we will define a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.039
 selection from this plot for that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.629
 we will press the apple key and we will 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.010
 going inside but for the moment 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.899
 what interests us is not the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.550
 selection of which condÃ© selects is 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.380
 to come create a new layer 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.260
 ask our color so for the video 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.420
 it will be hard to do so here we fill 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 our layer of pink we come back in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.720
 our pallet calq to fill menu 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.370
 edition fill colors foreground or 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.530
 so stop off or apple sup 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.420
 it depends what color where we choose 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.280
 the one below the one below, so 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.410
 then we return to our route pallet 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 we define a selection so we go in 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.980
 the small drop-down menu 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.050
 we are sure our layer 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.700
 finally our layout and we ask 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.090
 hold a selection in relation to this 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 trace 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.650
 we come back in the palette calq and with 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.810
 our selection always always in 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.640
 hand we will create a fusion mask and 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.480
 then we will come and put our layer 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.310
 in subdued light 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.200
 we can also reduce the opacity for 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.880
 moment it seems rather not too bad 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.940
 to happen so we'll leave it at 100% 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.480
 we will reiterate the operation for the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.220
 tie 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.840
 so we come back to our palette 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 retrace we click next to be able to 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.230
 to go on another route 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.690
 and with the feather have many turns and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.860
 our tie the interest of the masks 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.570
 is that we will be able to modify our 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.670
 photo left to show the elements 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.150
 which can be on the layer to which 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.530
 he is attached without coming 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.190
 damaged another photo ours 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.750
 layer so the white is transparent 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.190
 so he's going to let the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.260
 elements of the underside and the black goes the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.380
 masks and so the interest is we're going 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.850
 can then come back on it with the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.620
 brush and the black color or the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.260
 white color to be able to modify 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.590
 possibly areas that do not 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.420
 would not be who would not be in color 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.550
 or who should not be 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.710
 so here we start again with the craba so 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.080
 we created a new layer that we have 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.630
 filled with pink we recreated a mask of 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.730
 fusion using the selection of our 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.090
 tie and we just put one more 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.750
 once in dim light our calq for 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.020
 that it fits well in the photo so there 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.370
 I see that at the level of the tie 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.860
 iliad a little developed on the color 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:26.370
 so with the brush and in white we go 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.650
 come back and put some color 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.030
 where it was missing 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.360
 that's all the interest of masks 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.360
 fusion 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.390
 so once all your items are 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.430
 properly colored so we see that the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.549
 that the color is nice but it's 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.530
 maybe not quite intense enough yet 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.769
 at the level of colors so we will 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.090
 duplicate our calq to be able to have 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.829
 a little more sustained color 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.680
 so on the other hand as it may be 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.329
 a little too much we will come in the opacity 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.799
 and we will reduce opacity a little bit 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:13.889
 to have something a little more 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:16.530
 in quotation marks so these natural 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:21.510
 a few there we see that in fact we can 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.520
 very well with on our color layer 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.590
 pink one can very well come and affix a 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.340
 other color and hide it 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.630
 automatically will finally be always will 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.330
 the same effect we can change the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.340
 color very easily without having his 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.590
 damaged anything we can 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.990
 also and I think it's a it's 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.610
 maybe better to do is to name 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.440
 do not layer because there maybe he 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.720
 not a lot but as we go 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.740
 work with a dozen cases the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.449
 it does not get faster 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.110
 quickly the bazaar so I hit you 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.289
 well- named vocal advice for you 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.289
 find there
