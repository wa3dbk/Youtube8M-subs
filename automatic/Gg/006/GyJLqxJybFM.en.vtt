of the four corners of the areas you're

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.630 
of the four corners of the areas you're
going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.180> cutting<00:00:39.420> using<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.379> square<00:00:40.710> we

you're using a pencil you can easily
make<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> marks<00:00:48.329> too<00:00:48.539> thick<00:00:49.160> once<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.309> have

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
make the marks too thick once you have

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.029 
make the marks too thick once you have
all<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.000> monocles<00:00:51.660> done<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.260> taken<00:00:52.680> care<00:00:53.010> of

all that monocles done and taken care of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.410 
all that monocles done and taken care of
you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.210> start<00:00:54.570> using<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.410> saw<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you can start using your saw with a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.319 
you can start using your saw with a
seven<00:00:57.719> inch<00:00:57.840> blade<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:59.030> start<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.120> making

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
seven inch blade and start up making

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:32.030 
seven inch blade and start up making
your<00:01:00.539> cuts

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.740 

once<00:01:33.040> you<00:01:33.190> have<00:01:33.370> all<00:01:33.550> these<00:01:33.700> cuts<00:01:34.030> taken<00:01:34.510> care

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
once you have all these cuts taken care

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.840 
once you have all these cuts taken care
of<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:35.650> can<00:01:35.800> start<00:01:36.040> working<00:01:36.280> on<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.670> next

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
of you can start working on the next

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
of you can start working on the next
phase<00:01:37.210> which<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.920> have<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.520> bigger<00:01:39.820> blade

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
phase which if you have a bigger blade

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.840 
phase which if you have a bigger blade
like<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:41.680> have<00:01:41.860> here<00:01:42.070> we<00:01:42.220> have<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.370> big<00:01:42.640> foot

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
like we have here we have a big foot

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.960 
like we have here we have a big foot
which<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.120> a<00:01:43.150> pain<00:01:43.450> enter<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:44.530> can<00:01:44.820> make<00:01:45.820> the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
which is a pain enter we can make the

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.030 
which is a pain enter we can make the
cuts<00:01:46.210> again<00:01:46.690> this<00:01:47.290> time<00:01:47.530> there<00:01:47.740> will<00:01:47.860> be

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
cuts again this time there will be

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.160 
cuts again this time there will be
deeper<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.730> what<00:01:49.150> that'll<00:01:49.450> do<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.660> it'll<00:01:49.900> make

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
deeper and what that'll do is it'll make

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.220 
deeper and what that'll do is it'll make
you<00:01:50.350> a<00:01:50.380> really<00:01:50.740> smooth<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.280> smooth<00:01:51.580> cut<00:01:52.000> if<00:01:52.600> you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
you a really smooth a smooth cut if you

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.960 
you a really smooth a smooth cut if you
don't<00:01:53.500> you<00:01:53.680> can<00:01:53.800> use<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> salsa<00:01:54.550> which<00:01:54.790> we're

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
don't you can use a salsa which we're

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.000 
don't you can use a salsa which we're
going<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.180> use<00:01:55.330> up<00:01:55.510> here<00:01:55.690> instance<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.980> a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
going to use up here instance this is a

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:35.130 
going to use up here instance this is a
fairly<00:02:32.430> okay<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.239> next<00:02:34.510> step<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.110> use

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
fairly okay the next step is to use

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
fairly okay the next step is to use
yours<00:02:35.530> also<00:02:36.209> preferably<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.360> want<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.630> use<00:02:37.780> a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
yours also preferably you want to use a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.949 
yours also preferably you want to use a
brand<00:02:38.560> new<00:02:38.709> blade<00:02:39.010> or<00:02:39.430> for<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.120> fairly<00:02:40.630> new

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
brand new blade or for a fairly new

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.199 
brand new blade or for a fairly new
blade<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.739> make<00:02:41.890> your<00:02:42.040> cut<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.880> then

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
blade so you can make your cut and then

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.199 
blade so you can make your cut and then
you<00:02:43.239> can<00:02:43.420> cut<00:02:43.630> through<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.959> middle<00:02:44.170> portion

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
you can cut through the middle portion

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.229 
you can cut through the middle portion
once<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.330> already<00:02:46.450> made<00:02:46.750> your<00:02:46.780> cuts<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:48.239> pull

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
once you already made your cuts and pull

00:02:49.239 --> 00:03:20.539 
once you already made your cuts and pull
it<00:02:49.390> out

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.180 

okay<00:03:21.549> once<00:03:21.819> this<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.180> taken<00:03:22.540> care<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.080> can

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
okay once this is taken care of you can

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.089 
okay once this is taken care of you can
move<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.489> last<00:03:24.700> step<00:03:25.150> which<00:03:25.360> is<00:03:25.950> sand<00:03:26.950> it

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
move to the last step which is sand it

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.759 
move to the last step which is sand it
down<00:03:27.129> if<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.980> end<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.700> going<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.769> exposed

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
down if this end is going to be exposed

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.720 
down if this end is going to be exposed
or<00:03:33.099> if<00:03:33.549> it's<00:03:33.819> going<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.239> be<00:03:34.420> close<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.900> an<00:03:35.829> area

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
or if it's going to be close to an area

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.970 
or if it's going to be close to an area
we<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.209> replace<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.780> solution<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.829> this

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
we have to replace a solution in this

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.069 
we have to replace a solution in this
case<00:03:39.040> we're<00:03:39.519> going<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.700> put<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.030> on<00:03:40.360> an<00:03:40.629> exposed

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
case we're going to put it on an exposed

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.470 
case we're going to put it on an exposed
for<00:03:41.739> us<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.579> we<00:03:42.670> want<00:03:42.849> to<00:03:42.909> make<00:03:43.030> sure<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.299> it's

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
for us so we want to make sure that it's

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.240
