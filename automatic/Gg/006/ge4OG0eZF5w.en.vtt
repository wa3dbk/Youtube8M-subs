hi everyone this is funny I'll be doing

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.019 
hi everyone this is funny I'll be doing
another<00:00:03.210> Pokemon<00:00:03.720> X&amp;Y<00:00:04.049> video<00:00:04.740> if<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.190> have<00:00:05.910> it

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
another Pokemon X&amp;Y video if you have it

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.179 
another Pokemon X&amp;Y video if you have it
known<00:00:06.270> there<00:00:06.600> are<00:00:06.839> such<00:00:07.259> things<00:00:07.290> as<00:00:07.830> berry

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
known there are such things as berry

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.680 
known there are such things as berry
mutations<00:00:08.940> so<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.540> accidentally<00:00:10.349> planted<00:00:10.860> two

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
mutations so I accidentally planted two

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.900 
mutations so I accidentally planted two
berries<00:00:12.690> together<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.650> was<00:00:14.070> accidental

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
berries together and it was accidental

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.960 
berries together and it was accidental
because<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.690> meant<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.230> put<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.550> berries<00:00:17.850> on

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
because I meant to put the berries on

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.640 
because I meant to put the berries on
the<00:00:18.000> same<00:00:18.270> lot<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.660> know<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.900> lot<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.170> people<00:00:19.500> do

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the same lot I know a lot of people do

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
the same lot I know a lot of people do
that<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.369> when<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.150> plant<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> two<00:00:21.960> different

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
that but when I plant the two different

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.840 
that but when I plant the two different
berries<00:00:22.590> together<00:00:22.800> all<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> sudden<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> got<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
berries together all of a sudden I got a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.080 
berries together all of a sudden I got a
mutation<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.380> did<00:00:25.859> some<00:00:26.010> research<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
mutation so I did some research and the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.870 
mutation so I did some research and the
easiest<00:00:27.449> way<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.750> get<00:00:28.199> annotation<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
easiest way to get annotation is to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820 
easiest way to get annotation is to
create<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.570> surprise<00:00:31.170> bulge

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
create a surprise bulge

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.160 
create a surprise bulge
to<00:00:32.160> create<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.610> surprise<00:00:33.059> box<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.660> ahead<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.050> go

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
to create a surprise box go ahead and go

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.459 
to create a surprise box go ahead and go
to<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> composers<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.780> put<00:00:36.780> three

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to one of the composers and put three

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.580 
to one of the composers and put three
pairs<00:00:38.040> has<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.510> alike<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.379> I'm

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
pairs has to be all alike so here I'm

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.709 
pairs has to be all alike so here I'm
using<00:00:40.800> three<00:00:41.370> peach<00:00:42.120> berry

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
using three peach berry

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.529 
using three peach berry
Pecha<00:00:43.230> berries<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.820> comes<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.300> as

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
Pecha berries and it comes out as

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.700 
Pecha berries and it comes out as
through<00:00:46.350> surprise<00:00:46.800> mode<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
through surprise mode so what the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.229 
through surprise mode so what the
surprise<00:00:53.010> motor<00:00:53.370> says<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
surprise motor says some of the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.990 
surprise motor says some of the
mutations<00:00:54.449> will<00:00:55.110> come<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.820> I'm

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
mutations will come out more so here I'm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
mutations will come out more so here I'm
just<00:00:57.030> gonna<00:00:57.360> put<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> surprise<00:00:58.680> mulches

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
just gonna put all the surprise mulches

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.479 
just gonna put all the surprise mulches
under<00:01:00.000> dirt<00:01:00.420> first<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.620> doing<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.039> versus

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
under dirt first I like doing it versus

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.969 
under dirt first I like doing it versus
because<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> always<00:01:03.210> mix<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
because I always mix it up like if I

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.940 
because I always mix it up like if I
took<00:01:05.220> those<00:01:05.400> mulch<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:07.619> I'll<00:01:07.770> put

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
took those mulch in and then I'll put

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
took those mulch in and then I'll put
the<00:01:07.979> berry<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> I'll<00:01:09.000> forget<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.390> berry

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the berry in and I'll forget what berry

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
the berry in and I'll forget what berry
I<00:01:10.049> put<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.680> soil<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
I put in the soil so I think this way is

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.149 
I put in the soil so I think this way is
much<00:01:12.240> easier<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.439> put<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
much easier if you just put all the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
much easier if you just put all the
mulches<00:01:14.610> down<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.840> putting<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.259> all

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
mulches down so I'm just putting it all

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.620 
mulches down so I'm just putting it all
in<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.890> block

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.050 

so<00:01:22.630> after<00:01:23.110> all<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.500> supplies<00:01:23.890> mulches<00:01:24.460> in<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
so after all the supplies mulches in the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.940 
so after all the supplies mulches in the
dirt<00:01:25.360> I'm<00:01:25.750> just<00:01:26.289> gonna<00:01:26.409> be<00:01:26.590> putting<00:01:26.829> the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
dirt I'm just gonna be putting the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.830 
dirt I'm just gonna be putting the
berries<00:01:27.280> in<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.820> ORD<00:01:28.000> I'm<00:01:28.210> gonna<00:01:28.450> be<00:01:28.570> putting

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
berries in the ORD I'm gonna be putting

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.709 
berries in the ORD I'm gonna be putting
it<00:01:29.049> in<00:01:29.229> is<00:01:29.590> Petra<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.460> orange<00:01:31.000> tester<00:01:31.600> and

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
it in is Petra and orange tester and

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.529 
it in is Petra and orange tester and
Oran<00:01:32.140> will<00:01:32.289> create<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.619> polyp<00:01:33.130> fairy<00:01:33.429> a<00:01:33.759> spare

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
Oran will create a polyp fairy a spare

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.679 
Oran will create a polyp fairy a spare
Aleppo<00:01:35.049> or<00:01:35.289> create<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.799> fondue<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:37.360> thought

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
Aleppo or create a fondue and I thought

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.050 
Aleppo or create a fondue and I thought
very<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.289> mango<00:01:38.770> berry<00:01:39.189> will<00:01:39.340> create<00:01:39.850> of

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
very and a mango berry will create of

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.300 
very and a mango berry will create of
pollen<00:01:40.630> berry<00:01:40.840> I'll<00:01:41.500> be<00:01:41.829> putting<00:01:42.069> more

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
pollen berry I'll be putting more

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.520 
pollen berry I'll be putting more
information<00:01:42.909> in<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.509> description<00:01:43.689> below<00:01:44.079> so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
information in the description below so

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.740 
information in the description below so
please<00:01:44.560> check<00:01:44.860> that<00:01:45.219> out<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.969> when<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:46.479> plan

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
please check that out and when we plan

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.590 
please check that out and when we plan
to<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.170> small<00:01:47.530> fraction<00:01:47.829> of<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.939> berry<00:01:49.149> since

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
to a small fraction of the berry since

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.870 
to a small fraction of the berry since
there's<00:01:49.929> a<00:01:50.049> lot<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.799> mutations<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.490> haven't

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
there's a lot of mutations that haven't

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.899 
there's a lot of mutations that haven't
got<00:01:52.030> yet<00:01:52.299> for<00:01:52.929> the<00:01:53.830> mutations<00:01:54.369> there's<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.729> lot

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
got yet for the mutations there's a lot

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.389 
got yet for the mutations there's a lot
that<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.209> need<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.539> mutate<00:01:56.049> other<00:01:56.500> berries

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
that you need to mutate other berries

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.760 
that you need to mutate other berries
first<00:01:57.700> in<00:01:57.849> order<00:01:58.179> to<00:01:58.329> even<00:01:58.479> advance<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.590> that

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
first in order to even advance to that

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.830 
first in order to even advance to that
level<00:01:59.979> like<00:02:01.289> there's<00:02:02.289> a<00:02:02.789> Kelsie<00:02:03.789> berry<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.420> a
