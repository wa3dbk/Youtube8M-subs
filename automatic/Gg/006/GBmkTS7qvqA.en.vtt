all<00:00:01.260> right<00:00:01.550> today<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:02.790> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.090> be<00:00:03.179> doing<00:00:03.449> a

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
all right today I'm going to be doing a

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.049 
all right today I'm going to be doing a
video<00:00:03.899> review<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.859> pure<00:00:05.790> energy<00:00:06.799> 72<00:00:08.059> cubic

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
video review of the pure energy 72 cubic

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.320 
video review of the pure energy 72 cubic

paintball<00:00:12.929> tank<00:00:13.670> this<00:00:14.670> tank<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.299> would<00:00:15.839> be

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
paintball tank this tank it would be

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.849 
paintball tank this tank it would be
used<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.220> mostly<00:00:17.670> woodsball<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:19.230> would<00:00:19.590> i

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
used for mostly woodsball it would i

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.620 
used for mostly woodsball it would i
would<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.310> recommend<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:21.029> force<00:00:21.300> we've<00:00:21.449> all

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
would not recommend this force we've all

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
would not recommend this force we've all
tried<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.289> never<00:00:23.039> works<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:25.369> this<00:00:26.369> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
tried it never works and this is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.890 
tried it never works and this is
probably<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.050> best<00:00:28.590> option<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:29.189> woodsball

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
probably the best option for woodsball

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.540 
probably the best option for woodsball
because<00:00:30.920> even<00:00:31.920> though<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> weighs<00:00:32.340> around

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
because even though it weighs around

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
because even though it weighs around
five<00:00:33.059> pounds<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.260> still<00:00:34.590> put<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
five pounds you can still put it in a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.970 
five pounds you can still put it in a
pod<00:00:35.340> pack<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.899> use<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> remote<00:00:37.140> coil<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.739> put<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
pod pack and use a remote coil to put it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.510 
pod pack and use a remote coil to put it
to<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.190> gun<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.110> it<00:00:40.110> shoots<00:00:40.620> around<00:00:40.829> eight

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
to your gun and it shoots around eight

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.330 
to your gun and it shoots around eight
hundred<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> thousand<00:00:43.020> shots<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
hundred to a thousand shots out of a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.389 
hundred to a thousand shots out of a
tank<00:00:44.640> full<00:00:45.510> tanks<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.730> very<00:00:48.090> reliable<00:00:48.840> on

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
tank full tanks so it's very reliable on

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.979 
tank full tanks so it's very reliable on
using<00:00:50.399> paint<00:00:51.230> alright<00:00:52.230> next<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.690> want<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> point

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
using paint alright next I want to point

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.290 
using paint alright next I want to point
out<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.360> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.570> big<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:58.949> like

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
out that it is kind of big and I'm like

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.870 
out that it is kind of big and I'm like
15<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.890> puts<00:01:02.359> my<00:01:03.359> two<00:01:03.420> hands<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
15 so it puts my two hands right on the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.120 
15 so it puts my two hands right on the
like<00:01:05.880> body<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.470> there's<00:01:07.650> still

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
like body of it and then there's still

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
like body of it and then there's still
the<00:01:08.310> top<00:01:08.549> where<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.030> fill<00:01:09.510> nipple<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.140> located

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the top where the fill nipple is located

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.880 
the top where the fill nipple is located
and<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> pressure<00:01:12.360> gauge<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:15.869> has<00:01:15.900> three

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and the pressure gauge so it has three

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.219 
and the pressure gauge so it has three
logos<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:17.939> pure<00:01:18.330> energy<00:01:18.950> they're<00:01:20.030> in

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
logos on it from pure energy they're in

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
logos on it from pure energy they're in
there<00:01:22.229> they're<00:01:24.350> okay<00:01:25.350> pure<00:01:26.220> energy<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
there they're okay pure energy is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.359 
there they're okay pure energy is
probably<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.259> best<00:01:28.530> woodsball<00:01:30.200> tank

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
probably one of the best woodsball tank

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.880 
probably one of the best woodsball tank
makers<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:33.270> they're<00:01:33.869> very<00:01:34.110> reliable<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
