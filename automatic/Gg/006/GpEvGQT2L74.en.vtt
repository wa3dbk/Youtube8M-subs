well<00:00:05.629> here<00:00:05.749> at<00:00:05.839> scitech<00:00:06.200> we<00:00:06.349> get<00:00:06.470> involved<00:00:06.680> in

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
well here at scitech we get involved in

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.770 
well here at scitech we get involved in
automotive<00:00:07.160> control<00:00:07.790> systems<00:00:08.480> which<00:00:08.750> have

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
automotive control systems which have

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.509 
automotive control systems which have
led<00:00:08.990> us<00:00:09.049> into<00:00:09.320> electric<00:00:10.010> drivetrain

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
led us into electric drivetrain

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.609 
led us into electric drivetrain
technology<00:00:11.150> but<00:00:11.690> that's<00:00:11.869> caused<00:00:12.200> us<00:00:12.379> to<00:00:12.530> be

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:12.619 
technology but that's caused us to be

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.170 
technology but that's caused us to be
involved<00:00:12.980> in<00:00:13.250> the<00:00:13.369> actual<00:00:13.520> conversion<00:00:13.820> of

vehicles<00:00:14.660> to<00:00:14.779> take<00:00:14.930> that<00:00:15.170> technology<00:00:15.740> forward

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
vehicles to take that technology forward

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.640

powertrains<00:00:41.300> today<00:00:42.109> we<00:00:42.170> had<00:00:42.260> a<00:00:42.289> visit<00:00:42.409> from

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
powertrains today we had a visit from

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.319 
powertrains today we had a visit from
their<00:00:42.949> Minister<00:00:43.429> for<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.609> West<00:00:43.789> Midlands<00:00:44.089> and

their Minister for the West Midlands and
ian<00:00:44.600> austin<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.159> the<00:00:46.159> pub<00:00:46.339> was<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.550> visit<00:00:46.789> was

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
ian austin and the pub was the visit was

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.389 
ian austin and the pub was the visit was
to<00:00:46.909> come<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.300> look<00:00:47.420> at<00:00:47.659> a<00:00:47.719> project<00:00:48.229> that<00:00:48.499> we've

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
to come and look at a project that we've

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.430 
to come and look at a project that we've
just<00:00:49.429> finished<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:50.089> prototype<00:00:50.510> level<00:00:50.839> which

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
just finished a prototype level which

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.739 
just finished a prototype level which
was<00:00:51.679> to<00:00:51.829> create<00:00:51.949> a<00:00:52.100> prototype<00:00:52.339> electric<00:00:53.269> taxi

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
was to create a prototype electric taxi

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.289 
was to create a prototype electric taxi
the<00:00:54.469> thinking<00:00:54.679> is<00:00:54.889> how<00:00:55.190> we<00:00:55.249> get<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.789> a<00:00:56.059> position

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
the thinking is how we get to a position

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.949 
the thinking is how we get to a position
where<00:00:56.749> the<00:00:57.170> West<00:00:57.319> Midlands<00:00:57.620> can<00:00:57.799> lead<00:00:58.010> in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:58.959 
where the West Midlands can lead in

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.119 
where the West Midlands can lead in
low-carbon<00:00:59.959> electric<00:01:00.379> vehicles<00:01:00.769> just<00:01:01.039> as

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
low-carbon electric vehicles just as

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.309 
low-carbon electric vehicles just as
we've<00:01:01.280> led<00:01:01.459> in<00:01:01.690> traditional<00:01:02.690> automotives<00:01:03.199> in

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
we've led in traditional automotives in

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.170 
we've led in traditional automotives in
the<00:01:03.379> past<00:01:03.619> I<00:01:03.829> think<00:01:04.129> what<00:01:04.670> you're<00:01:04.820> doing<00:01:05.059> with

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
the past I think what you're doing with

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.130 
the past I think what you're doing with
these<00:01:05.299> engines<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:06.940> no<00:01:07.940> showing<00:01:08.299> that<00:01:08.420> you

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
these engines is no showing that you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.510 
these engines is no showing that you
know<00:01:09.230> that's<00:01:09.380> possible<00:01:09.710> that's<00:01:09.860> not<00:01:09.980> my<00:01:10.250> dream

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
know that's possible that's not my dream

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.400 
know that's possible that's not my dream
it<00:01:10.880> can<00:01:11.060> actually<00:01:11.150> happen<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:12.020> vehicle<00:01:12.380> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.490 
you going to see in this country I think
this<00:01:49.820> development<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.750> really<00:01:51.440> exciting

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
this development is a really exciting

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.649 
this development is a really exciting
part<00:01:52.040> of<00:01:52.159> that<00:01:52.280> there's<00:01:53.030> no<00:01:53.210> reason<00:01:53.540> why<00:01:53.630> we

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
part of that there's no reason why we

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.780 
part of that there's no reason why we
can't<00:01:54.020> why<00:01:54.380> can't<00:01:54.620> we<00:01:54.710> be<00:01:54.740> why<00:01:55.340> can't<00:01:55.550> we<00:01:55.610> set

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
can't why can't we be why can't we set

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.580 
can't why can't we be why can't we set

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
electric vehicles and low-carbon

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.980 
electric vehicles and low-carbon
automotives<00:02:02.330> that's<00:02:02.540> what<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.690> want<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.870> see

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
automotives that's what I want to see

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.750 
automotives that's what I want to see
happen

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
happen

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.280 
happen
and<00:02:04.120> I<00:02:04.210> think<00:02:04.390> through<00:02:04.630> what<00:02:05.050> we're<00:02:05.170> doing

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
and I think through what we're doing

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.690 
and I think through what we're doing
with<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.440> vantage<00:02:06.070> west<00:02:06.190> midlands<00:02:06.640> the

like this and companies like yours you

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.690 
like this and companies like yours you
know<00:02:11.260> i<00:02:11.290> think<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:12.250> know<00:02:12.280> i<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.430> that's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
know i think you know i think that's

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.460 
know i think you know i think that's
that's<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.270> possibility<00:02:13.600> for<00:02:13.810> us<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.320> not

you've<00:03:25.720> got<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> leaner<00:03:26.820> more<00:03:27.820> efficient

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
you've got a leaner more efficient

you've got a leaner more efficient
manufacturing<00:03:28.330> process<00:03:29.110> yeah<00:03:29.380> it's<00:03:30.190> more

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
manufacturing process yeah it's more

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.920

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
just the tip of the iceberg I think the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.240 
just the tip of the iceberg I think the
minister<00:04:52.380> was<00:04:52.470> very<00:04:52.650> impressed<00:04:52.980> and

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
surprised as well a little bit I think

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600 
surprised as well a little bit I think
about<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.230> about<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.920> technology<00:04:56.280> the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
about the about the technology the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.310 
about the about the technology the
performance<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.240> technology<00:04:57.750> yeah<00:04:57.990> quiet

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
performance of the technology yeah quiet

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.770 
performance of the technology yeah quiet
it<00:04:58.560> is<00:04:58.650> how<00:04:58.980> well<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.280> drives<00:04:59.580> and<00:05:00.360> that's<00:05:00.630> just

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
it is how well it drives and that's just

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.170 
it is how well it drives and that's just
in<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:00.990> prototype<00:05:01.410> vehicle<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.010> we'd<00:05:02.700> expect<00:05:03.060> it

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
in a prototype vehicle so we'd expect it

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.820 
in a prototype vehicle so we'd expect it
