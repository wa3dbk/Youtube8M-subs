i'm taking the color cafe and i'm a
punch<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.490> flat<00:01:08.760> shader<00:01:09.000> brush<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
punch on a flat shader brush but a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
punch on a flat shader brush but a
little<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.960> wider<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> I'm<00:01:11.490> upon

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
little bit of a wider one and I'm upon

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550 
little bit of a wider one and I'm upon
us<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> center<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.869> lid<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.380> outer

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
us on the center of the lid on the outer

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.460 
us on the center of the lid on the outer
corner<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.479> just<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:15.689> padding<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.290> on

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
corner and just really padding this on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
corner and just really padding this on
there<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.220> step<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.360> both

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
there and this step just really both

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390 
there and this step just really both
makes<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> colors<00:01:19.500> look<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.860> lot<00:01:19.950> more<00:01:20.009> bold

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
makes the colors look a lot more bold

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.529 
makes the colors look a lot more bold
and<00:01:20.610> intensifies<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.990 

now<00:01:26.539> I<00:01:26.570> will<00:01:27.079> be<00:01:27.200> taking<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.859> color<00:01:28.100> chai<00:01:28.549> and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
now I will be taking the color chai and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.719 
now I will be taking the color chai and
I<00:01:29.990> will<00:01:30.140> be<00:01:30.259> applying<00:01:30.409> this<00:01:30.829> just<00:01:31.250> in<00:01:31.490> the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
I will be applying this just in the

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.969 
I will be applying this just in the
crease<00:01:32.149> and<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:32.659> really<00:01:33.020> working<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.799> in

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
crease and just really working it in

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.980 
crease and just really working it in
there<00:01:34.159> as<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.610> see<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.090> really<00:01:35.960> just

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
there as you can see so really just

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:51.430 
there as you can see so really just
blending<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.219> working<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.729> in<00:01:37.880> there

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.240 

and<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.190> will<00:01:52.340> look<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:52.550> that<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.360> far<00:01:53.630> and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
and it will look like that so far and

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.040 
and it will look like that so far and
now<00:01:55.250> I'm<00:01:55.400> going<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.730> take<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.090> color<00:01:56.270> mink<00:01:56.720> and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
now I'm going to take the color mink and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.290 
now I'm going to take the color mink and
I'm<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:58.010> to<00:01:58.040> pile<00:01:58.280> is<00:01:58.430> just<00:01:58.790> on<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.030> outer

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
I'm going to pile is just on the outer

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.180 
I'm going to pile is just on the outer
corner<00:01:59.810> and<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.260> just<00:02:00.350> really<00:02:00.920> where<00:02:01.070> the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
corner and this is just really where the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.010 
corner and this is just really where the
smokiness<00:02:01.670> comes<00:02:02.120> into<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:02.750> look<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.960> as

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
smokiness comes into this I look so as

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.960 
smokiness comes into this I look so as
you<00:02:06.230> can<00:02:06.320> see<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.830> tape<00:02:07.040> really<00:02:07.520> helps<00:02:07.790> to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
you can see this tape really helps to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.150 
you can see this tape really helps to
make<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.270> nice<00:02:08.510> clean<00:02:08.960> edge<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.590> I'm<00:02:10.070> just

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
make a nice clean edge and I'm just

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.370 
make a nice clean edge and I'm just
really<00:02:10.250> blending<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:11.690> smoking<00:02:12.290> it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
really blending it and just smoking it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.460 
really blending it and just smoking it

location and this will also just make

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.430 
location and this will also just make
the<00:02:19.190> look<00:02:19.400> look<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.790> lot<00:02:20.120> more<00:02:20.200> smokier<00:02:21.200> and
