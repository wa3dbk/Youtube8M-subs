00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.230 
I found come on shot how did you
possibly<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:08.670> really<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.119> at

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
possibly see that I'm really good at

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.810 
possibly see that I'm really good at
this<00:01:09.330> game<00:01:09.590> well<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> had<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.400> bearings

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this game well I had to get my bearings

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.679 
this game well I had to get my bearings
straight<00:01:11.939> he<00:01:12.270> looks<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.570> strike<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.960> Who<00:01:13.140> am<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
straight he looks at strike a Who am I

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.570 
straight he looks at strike a Who am I
so<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> part<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> strategy<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.369> game

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so the part of the strategy of this game

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.940 
so the part of the strategy of this game
is<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.180> make<00:01:18.390> any<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.750> curved<00:01:19.110> moves<00:01:19.500> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
is to not make any like curved moves so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.800 
is to not make any like curved moves so
you<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.400> move<00:01:20.640> exactly<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you want to just move exactly like the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
you want to just move exactly like the
NPC's<00:01:23.869> man<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.590> soon<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.100> he<00:01:26.280> hear<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
NPC's man and as soon as he hear the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.640 
NPC's man and as soon as he hear the
noise<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.720> means<00:01:27.990> he's<00:01:28.170> killed<00:01:28.439> somebody

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
noise that means he's killed somebody

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.319 
noise that means he's killed somebody
and<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> put<00:01:29.700> my<00:01:29.820> cursor<00:01:30.180> over

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
and I but I have to put my cursor over

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.090 
and I but I have to put my cursor over
the<00:01:30.659> character<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:31.590> killed<00:01:31.890> before

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the character that was killed before

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.370 
the character that was killed before
they'd<00:01:32.430> actually<00:01:32.670> die<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.869> Jordan<00:01:34.140> could<00:01:34.290> get

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
they'd actually die so Jordan could get

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
they'd actually die so Jordan could get
away<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> lot<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.100> kills<00:01:35.369> okay<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.060> that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
away with a lot of kills okay so that

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
away with a lot of kills okay so that
character<00:01:36.540> died<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.470> no<00:01:37.619> idea<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
character died but I have no idea I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
character died but I have no idea I
didn't<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:38.880> hear<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> noise<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
didn't actually hear the noise because I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.810 
didn't actually hear the noise because I
was<00:01:40.439> talking

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:50.940 

I<00:01:48.870> don't<00:01:49.870> believe<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:50.230> though<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.620> haven't

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
