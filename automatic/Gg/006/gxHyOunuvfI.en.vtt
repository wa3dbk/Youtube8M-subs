00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.670 
and that is where the mason jar candles
really<00:03:08.400> come<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.180> they<00:03:09.900> can<00:03:10.110> sort<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.410> take

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
really come in and they can sort of take

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.330 
really come in and they can sort of take
over<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:11.040> bit<00:03:11.690> because<00:03:12.690> they<00:03:12.959> are<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:14.130> bit

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
over a bit because they are a little bit

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.970 
over a bit because they are a little bit
smaller<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.080> one<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.440> blackberry

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
smaller like this one this blackberry

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.780 
smaller like this one this blackberry
spice<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:18.000> very<00:03:18.959> subtle<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.280> have<00:03:20.640> been

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
spice one is very subtle so I have been

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.670 
spice one is very subtle so I have been
burning<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.450> our<00:03:21.570> basement<00:03:21.840> where<00:03:22.350> we<00:03:22.500> sit

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
burning it in our basement where we sit

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.289 
burning it in our basement where we sit
and<00:03:22.769> watch<00:03:22.890> TV<00:03:23.190> because<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.640> room<00:03:23.820> isn't<00:03:23.970> very

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
and watch TV because the room isn't very

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.440 
and watch TV because the room isn't very
big<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.410> gives<00:03:25.560> enough<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.489> cent<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.120> fill

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
big so it gives enough of a cent to fill

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.270 
big so it gives enough of a cent to fill
the<00:03:27.600> room<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.410> not<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:28.799> much<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.010> you're

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
the room but not so much that you're

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.430 
the room but not so much that you're
like<00:03:29.459> wow<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.150> have<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.690> blow<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.019> out<00:03:31.080> it's

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
like wow I have to blow that out it's

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.870 
like wow I have to blow that out it's
too<00:03:31.650> much<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.100> think<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.580> these<00:03:32.700> are

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
too much so I think that these are

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.600 
too much so I think that these are
really<00:03:33.000> nice<00:03:33.269> for<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.600> smaller<00:03:34.019> space<00:03:34.610> like

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
really nice for a smaller space like

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.800 
really nice for a smaller space like
I've<00:03:35.730> been<00:03:35.820> thinking<00:03:36.090> about<00:03:36.209> putting<00:03:36.510> one<00:03:36.630> in

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
I've been thinking about putting one in

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.800 
I've been thinking about putting one in
my<00:03:37.019> office<00:03:37.200> at<00:03:37.560> work<00:03:38.120> these<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.390> size<00:03:39.630> of

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
my office at work these are the size of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.270 
my office at work these are the size of

even<00:04:18.030> for<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.419> Christmas<00:04:18.810> gift

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
even for like a Christmas gift

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.479 
even for like a Christmas gift
put<00:04:19.359> something<00:04:19.569> in<00:04:19.870> or<00:04:20.139> whatever<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.620> want<00:04:20.829> so

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
put something in or whatever you want so

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.420 
put something in or whatever you want so
that<00:04:21.669> is<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.389> perk<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.930> both<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.770> really<00:04:24.280> like

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
that is a perk of both I really like

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.400 
that is a perk of both I really like
both<00:04:24.699> to<00:04:25.030> be<00:04:25.150> honest<00:04:25.509> depending<00:04:26.020> on<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.229> size

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
both to be honest depending on the size

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.800 
both to be honest depending on the size
of<00:04:26.620> room<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.160> what<00:04:27.310> you're<00:04:27.430> going<00:04:27.759> for<00:04:27.810> I

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
of room and what you're going for I

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.659 
of room and what you're going for I
think<00:04:29.229> they<00:04:29.349> each<00:04:29.530> serve<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.190> really<00:04:30.490> nice

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
think they each serve a really nice

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.150 
think they each serve a really nice
purpose<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.419> this<00:04:32.139> one<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.710> think<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:33.009> could

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
purpose so this one I think you could

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.710 
purpose so this one I think you could
even<00:04:33.250> get<00:04:33.430> away<00:04:33.669> with<00:04:33.819> just<00:04:34.030> getting<00:04:34.210> mason

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
even get away with just getting mason

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.469 
even get away with just getting mason
jars<00:04:35.160> but<00:04:36.160> not<00:04:36.370> expecting<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.120> fill<00:04:37.330> your

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479
