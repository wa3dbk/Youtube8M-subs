00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.620 
is only in the arms and none in the legs
unfortunately<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
unfortunately and then here is the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.400 
unfortunately and then here is the
awesome<00:02:37.170> part<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:39.180> lift<00:02:39.840> him<00:02:40.110> up<00:02:40.140> right

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
awesome part you can lift him up right

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.220 
awesome part you can lift him up right
here<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.880> throw<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.090> your<00:02:42.120> iron<00:02:42.600> man<00:02:42.840> figure

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
here and throw in your iron man figure

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.190 
here and throw in your iron man figure
and<00:02:43.470> they<00:02:44.250> actually<00:02:44.840> meaning<00:02:45.840> all<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.110> way

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
and they actually meaning all the way

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.450 
and they actually meaning all the way
down<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.650> legs<00:02:48.410> has<00:02:49.410> some<00:02:49.680> circuit<00:02:50.130> to

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
down to the legs has some circuit to

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.880 
down to the legs has some circuit to
printing<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.300> there<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
printing in there and in the in the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.770 
printing in there and in the in the
actual<00:02:53.250> face<00:02:53.700> part<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.240> actually<00:02:54.540> has<00:02:54.750> like

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
actual face part it actually has like

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.180 
actual face part it actually has like
more<00:02:55.320> circuit<00:02:55.860> tree<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.550> I'm<00:02:57.510> guessing<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.260> HUD

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
more circuit tree and I'm guessing a HUD

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.210 
more circuit tree and I'm guessing a HUD
heads-up<00:02:59.910> display<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.440> all<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.830> other<00:03:01.950> fun

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
heads-up display and all that other fun

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.300 
heads-up display and all that other fun
stuff<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.900> very<00:03:03.930> very<00:03:04.500> cool<00:03:04.920> too<00:03:05.160> bad

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
stuff so that is very very cool too bad

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.800 
stuff so that is very very cool too bad
you<00:03:05.430> can't<00:03:05.550> put<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.820> Hulk<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.150> there<00:03:06.300> could<00:03:06.780> be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
you can't put the Hulk in there could be

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.410 
you can't put the Hulk in there could be
busting<00:03:07.320> himself<00:03:07.800> but<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.060> look<00:03:09.270> at<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
busting himself but if you look at the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.660 
busting himself but if you look at the
size<00:03:09.750> comparison<00:03:10.560> they're<00:03:10.740> like<00:03:11.090> massively

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
size comparison they're like massively

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.880 
size comparison they're like massively
totally<00:03:14.670> different<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.270> mean<00:03:15.660> he<00:03:16.590> could<00:03:16.770> be

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
totally different I mean he could be

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.930 
totally different I mean he could be
like<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.340> know<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:18.560> need<00:03:19.560> fly<00:03:19.800> away<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.640> anyways

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
like you know I need fly away so anyways

only cost nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.270> two<00:03:27.540> figures<00:03:28.020> so<00:03:28.770> that's<00:03:29.040> actually

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
cents for two figures so that's actually

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.880 
cents for two figures so that's actually
really<00:03:29.850> cool<00:03:30.150> I'm<00:03:30.720> used<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.050> seeing<00:03:31.350> figures

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
really cool I'm used to seeing figures

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.190 
really cool I'm used to seeing figures
for<00:03:32.540> like<00:03:33.540> 12<00:03:34.050> 99<00:03:34.350> or<00:03:34.680> 999<00:03:35.130> for<00:03:35.489> one<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.989> is

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
for like 12 99 or 999 for one so this is

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.740 
for like 12 99 or 999 for one so this is
actually<00:03:37.350> pretty<00:03:37.739> awesome<00:03:38.450> alright<00:03:39.450> so
