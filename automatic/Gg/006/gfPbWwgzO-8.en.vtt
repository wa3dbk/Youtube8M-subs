00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello welcome to my 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.080
 pie mills you already have 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.539
 I noticed that I was a big pumpkin 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.509
 I'm fanatic and that's why there is one today 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.129
 delicious pumpkin soup and these 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.020
 Pumpkin soup is especially delicious 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.760
 Thus, because I'm doing something orange juice 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.260
 So it does not just taste delicious 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.090
 after pumpkin but also just one 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.680
 a bit fruity and I say it now 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.370
 just the ingredients for about four 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 people 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.770
 I have a bit of butter here 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.320
 about ten grams are one tablespoon 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.710
 A piece of sugar must have something 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.760
 about ten to 15 grams will be one 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 half teaspoon curry powder 250 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.329
 milliliters of water and a bouillon cube there 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.899
 could also be just 250 milliliters 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.550
 take vegetable broth 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.380
 I have some chilif flakes here 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.260
 Who likes it a bit 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.489
 sharp like a pumpkin when I take 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.489
 but only 500 grams of it 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:21.799
 and here I have 200 milliliters 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.020
 Orange juice and 100 milliliters cream 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.250
 I'll take mine here now 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.250
 pumpkin and cut in half 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:40.880
 and it's a bit difficult because 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:42.590
 that he is tough and I also now 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.390
 here again a hokkaido pumpkin taken 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.860
 because I can not steal it 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.469
 I use the shell with it because the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.349
 Schmalwald is then removed 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.799
 will the inner goes very well with 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.799
 a spoon 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.800
 and here I just remove that way 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.800
 to put these hard ones 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.100
 and dice the remaining flesh 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.880
 I now just about an inch 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.880
 big pieces 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.640
 a pot heats up and 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.520
 is there now the diced 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.130
 fruit meat into it 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.180
 it should ever admit a bit of 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.180
 with very well 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.300
 Here I give the sugar now 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.510
 meter to make it a bit so 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.280
 caramelized and also the curry powder 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.000
 so that the taste is right 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.000
 can unfold 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.140
 and I'll leave that up for about three 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.910
 steam for four minutes and then it works 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.170
 continue right away 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.870
 and now it can still be the ginger here 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.590
 Peel and short small pieces 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.590
 and with acg 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:24.460
 now extinguish the pumpkin with the water 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:27.400
 ab gives it to the orange juice and 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.680
 the beating for and then that has to be done now 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.350
 boil and then it will take about 20 minutes 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.730
 cooked until just the pumpkin is soft 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.800
 and then we can get the soup 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.540
 complete 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.010
 My pumpkins sits white, I cooked 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.990
 also had the lid on the pot on it 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.890
 and now I can fine-tune him that 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.410
 I just do it with one now 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.410
 once through 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.319
 and then it should be pretty 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.689
 be thick 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.689
 and now the cream is added 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.870
 is briefly stirred again and now 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.650
 Let's not cook it anymore 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.630
 cream then does not clot in it and now 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.020
 should still taste with some salt 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.020
 and pepper 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.330
 and if then the taste is right 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.330
 the soup is ready 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.290
 I just need a little salt 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.669
 in the follow-up yes, everyone can do it himself 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.669
 then the soup should serve 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.050
 and I always like to go an even 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.470
 bit of this pumpkin seed oil with 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.270
 purely 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.130
 First of all, there is such a beautiful one again 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.130
 season and 42 off 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.409
 Why 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.560
 and then the soup I finished it 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.880
 It's best to be pure, but you could 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.980
 for example, a few 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.080
 make chicken skewers and give them 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.270
 or just a little toasted 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.160
 Of course there is the recipe for bread 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.930
 read also very much reads places world.de 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.550
 and i would be happy if i did that 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.110
 tried it even if you do not 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.450
 pumpkin window that is always 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.580
 Again I find pumpkin totally 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.430
 delicious and I wish you a lot 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.960
