 hello everyone with you day and bacon in 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.120
 simple and understandable guide on heroes and on 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 queues we have jaggernut so go 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.769
 a masked jagger 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.070
 is a hero with a great ultimate 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.010
 hatch escape darling ward 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.619
 and crits but collectively it does 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.529
 his very serious carry character 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.990
 let 's look at the skillbild jagernaut 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 The first ability is blade fury in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.550
 a small radius of jagernaut will 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.190
 inflict up to 140 damage per second on 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.170
 the last laval around and in 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.750
 moment of caste he cannot pronounce 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.030
 other spells but sang on him 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 not working with this ability 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.309
 it is possible to fine any old itit 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 skills on the blade fury target worth max 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 1 and away from the benefits of emoji almost 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.739
 lost second ability is healing 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.230
 ward jagger calls a manageable amount 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 on namely in from which hastily I 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 speed health is not important 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.880
 forget order bowstring in the midst of battle 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.040
 imba in this style is the main thing to remember 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.920
 that he dies from one butting on 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.630
 initial stages one or two times to pump 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.729
 worth 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.719
 the next passive ability is 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.850
 blade dance 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.039
 gives a chance to a juggernaut put double 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.990
 Damage and with each level of pumping 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.840
 increases crit chance 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.090
 thirty-five percent well, and ultimate 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.130
 jagernaut is mind not slash in 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.920
 which jagi sprinkles over all 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.590
 nearby enemies inflicting 9 hits 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.340
 on the last level is ultimat he 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.819
 invulnerable 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.220
 the remote works for bkb physical damage but 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.439
 don't forget this crowd 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.899
 which creeps should not be 3 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.000
 class sector and so what do 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.399
 juggernaut early in the game 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.740
 we should focus on the farm and 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.799
 never mind even in a light or difficult line 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.289
 we play but also if with us stands for 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.799
 port with any design for example crystal 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.439
 maiden 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.319
 we can do in b and using the blade 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.020
 smokes walkie-talkie more importantly count 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.360
 your strength by the way with the help of this 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.150
 abilities can save yourself by doing 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.940
 taunt pay attention to manul to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.790
 on both caste enough mono can say 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.069
 sick jagernaut not quite 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.040
 experienced players if we have a team 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.519
 there is a cool brain zaebal type black hole 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.980
 and I broke the trend there is a sense to collect 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.430
 battle fury with him and farm convenient 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.470
 other cases on dms I advise you to collect 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.360
 insulator but what if we all are very cool 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.790
 at the beginning of the farm game, it is not 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.370
 feel free to assemble the shadow blade 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.739
 after all with lotar ultimate the jagernaut 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.739
 will deal with almost any heroes 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.560
 Mitu orli game yeah I can not advise 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.019
 in the case when the opponent 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.060
 some karrik that will surely be pcb 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.390
 after all, smart support just buy 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.000
 conceptor and will try to trick us bkb 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.489
 most dzhagernaut and also by the way no one 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.980
