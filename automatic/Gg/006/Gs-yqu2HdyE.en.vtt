squirrel<00:01:14.729> cage<00:01:14.820> blower<00:01:16.369> for<00:01:17.369> ventilation<00:01:23.930> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
squirrel cage blower for ventilation and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:48.749 
squirrel cage blower for ventilation and
this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:26.720> looking<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.229> bunker

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.090 

this<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.179> latrine<00:01:50.689> you<00:01:51.289> can<00:01:51.500> see<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:54.100> two

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
this is the latrine you can see the two

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.149 
this is the latrine you can see the two
holes<00:01:55.369> there<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.939> you<00:01:56.090> would<00:01:56.270> sit<00:01:56.600> on<00:01:59.020> and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
holes there that you would sit on and

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:11.410 
holes there that you would sit on and
this<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.220> where<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.850> waste<00:02:02.090> would<00:02:02.509> go<00:02:10.420> that

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
this is where the waste would go that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:44.100 
this is where the waste would go that
looks<00:02:11.630> like<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:22.060> far<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.299> goes

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.830 

this<00:02:44.680> area<00:02:45.130> here<00:02:45.340> there<00:02:45.550> was<00:02:45.670> probably<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.300> sink

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
this area here there was probably a sink

00:02:46.840 --> 00:03:10.340 
this area here there was probably a sink
here

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.309 

and<00:03:11.350> right<00:03:11.620> here<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.660> door<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
and right here is that the door to the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:26.160 
and right here is that the door to the
escape<00:03:14.770> hatch<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:21.160> can<00:03:21.370> see<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:25.420> bolts<00:03:25.870> there

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
escape hatch you can see the bolts there

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:45.600 
escape hatch you can see the bolts there
to<00:03:26.380> hold<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.709> closed<00:03:44.280> here's<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.520> other

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
to hold it closed here's the other

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.170 
to hold it closed here's the other
ventilation<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:51.040> these<00:03:51.220> are<00:03:51.400> some<00:03:51.700> type<00:03:51.970> of

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
ventilation and these are some type of

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.699 
ventilation and these are some type of
weird<00:03:52.510> sockets<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:54.239> don't<00:03:55.239> know<00:03:55.300> if<00:03:55.360> those<00:03:55.540> are

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
weird sockets I don't know if those are

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:36.090 
weird sockets I don't know if those are
fluorescent<00:03:56.709> or<00:03:56.830> what<00:03:57.010> those<00:03:57.220> were

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:06:14.459 

lights<00:04:37.990> lighting<00:04:38.990> run<00:04:39.500> along<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.100> top<00:04:40.370> here

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.709 

there's<00:06:15.469> the<00:06:15.939> intake<00:06:16.939> to<00:06:17.149> the<00:06:17.209> squirrel-cage

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
there's the intake to the squirrel-cage

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.309 
there's the intake to the squirrel-cage
blower<00:06:18.759> you<00:06:19.759> can<00:06:19.939> see<00:06:20.119> they<00:06:20.239> had<00:06:20.360> filters<00:06:20.989> on

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
blower you can see they had filters on

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:30.129 
blower you can see they had filters on
it<00:06:26.019> those<00:06:27.019> filters<00:06:27.379> wouldn't<00:06:28.069> really<00:06:28.899> do<00:06:29.899> much

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
it those filters wouldn't really do much

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.079 
it those filters wouldn't really do much
but<00:06:30.499> they<00:06:30.649> could<00:06:30.830> have<00:06:30.919> had<00:06:31.039> more<00:06:31.249> filtering<00:06:31.939> I

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:32.089 
but they could have had more filtering I

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:34.839 
but they could have had more filtering I
imagine<00:06:32.509> this<00:06:32.629> headed<00:06:33.019> door<00:06:33.429> yeah<00:06:34.429> this<00:06:34.639> had<00:06:34.819> a

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
imagine this headed door yeah this had a

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.539 
imagine this headed door yeah this had a
door<00:06:35.149> on<00:06:35.179> it
