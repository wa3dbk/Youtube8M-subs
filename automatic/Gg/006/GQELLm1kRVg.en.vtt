00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
our lap here at the end I think that's a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.609 
our lap here at the end I think that's a
steal<00:01:57.240> i<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.600> she's<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> fantastic<00:01:58.020> player<00:01:58.590> i

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
steal i think she's a fantastic player i

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.580 
steal i think she's a fantastic player i
had<00:01:58.950> her<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.310> our<00:01:59.430> 23<00:01:59.939> s<00:02:00.000> also<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.659> she<00:02:01.439> can

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
had her with our 23 s also and she can

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.080 
had her with our 23 s also and she can
play<00:02:01.770> anywhere<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> field<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.909> i<00:02:03.000> think

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
play anywhere on the field so i think

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.749 
play anywhere on the field so i think
for<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.630> new<00:02:04.049> expansion<00:02:04.590> franchise<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.430> need

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
players that have that kind of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.869 
players that have that kind of
versatility<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.590> i<00:02:07.799> couldn't<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.550> happier

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
