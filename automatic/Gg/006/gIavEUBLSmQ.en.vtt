been running sprints all year but it's

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.750 
been running sprints all year but it's
different<00:02:01.619> once<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> come<00:02:02.160> here<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.670> on

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
different once you come here you get on

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.609 
different once you come here you get on
a<00:02:02.790> weight<00:02:03.300> program<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.350> near

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
a weight program and you get near

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.440 
a weight program and you get near
between<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> lines<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.910> play<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.330> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
between the lines and play so is a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
between the lines and play so is a
different<00:02:06.780> type<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.990> conditioning<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.740> guys

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
different type of conditioning so guys

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.500 
different type of conditioning so guys
want<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> head<00:02:08.880> start<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.420> we

think<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.350> know<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:19.709> okay<00:02:20.010> but<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.400> know

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
think is you know it's okay but you know

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.220 
think is you know it's okay but you know
anybody<00:02:20.970> conditioning<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.570> be<00:02:21.720> even<00:02:22.200> better

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
anybody conditioning to be even better

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.199 
anybody conditioning to be even better
you<00:02:22.560> know<00:02:22.709> once<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.100> know<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.310> get<00:02:23.700> planning

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
you know once you know you get planning

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.600 
you know once you know you get planning
a<00:02:24.300> structured<00:02:24.780> offense<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:26.489> know

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
a structured offense and you know

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.420 
a structured offense and you know
running<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.360> down<00:02:27.440> jump<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
running up and down jump in and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.580 
running up and down jump in and
uh<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:30.090> know<00:02:30.239> running<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:30.840> jumping<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.349> think

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
uh you know running and jumping I think

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.880 
uh you know running and jumping I think
you<00:02:32.159> can't<00:02:32.400> really<00:02:33.379> do<00:02:34.379> that<00:02:34.409> on<00:02:34.709> your<00:02:34.739> own

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
you can't really do that on your own

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.410 
you can't really do that on your own
running<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.519> jumping<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.969> trying<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.299> get

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
