just<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> hearings

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.469 

okay<00:01:29.560> let's<00:01:29.740> get<00:01:29.829> into<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.130> specs<00:01:30.369> alright<00:01:31.270> so

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
okay let's get into the specs alright so

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.880 
okay let's get into the specs alright so
um<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:33.189> does<00:01:33.429> um<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:34.240> controller<00:01:34.659> why<00:01:34.899> why<00:01:35.860> I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
um it does um this controller why why I

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.499 
um it does um this controller why why I
figured<00:01:36.130> on<00:01:36.340> picking<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.759> up<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.759> helps<00:01:40.119> when

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
figured on picking it up it helps when

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.350 
figured on picking it up it helps when
you're<00:01:40.659> sniping<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.789> sensitivity<00:01:42.789> of<00:01:42.819> it<00:01:43.119> it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
you're sniping the sensitivity of it it

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.740 
you're sniping the sensitivity of it it
changes<00:01:43.750> automatically<00:01:44.319> um<00:01:45.240> another<00:01:46.240> another

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
changes automatically um another another

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.109 
changes automatically um another another
