00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
first you invited us to look at the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.249 
first you invited us to look at the
first<00:00:09.469> site<00:00:09.759> and<00:00:10.759> that<00:00:11.509> gives<00:00:11.719> me<00:00:11.809> inspiration

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
first site and that gives me inspiration

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.440 
first site and that gives me inspiration
because<00:00:12.830> it<00:00:13.039> was<00:00:13.160> already<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.519> site<00:00:13.759> but<00:00:14.120> it<00:00:14.299> was

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
because it was already a site but it was

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.630 
because it was already a site but it was
like<00:00:14.599> a<00:00:14.629> village<00:00:14.990> community<00:00:15.679> with<00:00:16.340> as<00:00:16.490> well

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
like a village community with as well

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.060 
like a village community with as well
houses<00:00:16.970> on<00:00:17.090> top<00:00:17.240> of<00:00:17.360> roofs<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.140> there<00:00:18.560> we<00:00:18.770> find

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
houses on top of roofs so there we find

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.220 
houses on top of roofs so there we find
out<00:00:19.250> okay<00:00:19.490> let's<00:00:19.730> try<00:00:19.940> to<00:00:20.060> make<00:00:20.390> this<00:00:20.840> kind<00:00:21.170> of

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
out okay let's try to make this kind of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.020 
out okay let's try to make this kind of
community<00:00:21.680> on<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.100> spot<00:00:22.340> instead<00:00:22.700> of<00:00:22.790> a<00:00:22.850> big

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030 
community on the spot instead of a big

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.110 
community on the spot instead of a big
block<00:00:23.270> I<00:00:23.600> know<00:00:24.260> the<00:00:24.500> process<00:00:24.740> but<00:00:25.340> gradually

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.120 
block I know the process but gradually

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.970 
block I know the process but gradually
the<00:00:26.240> city<00:00:26.450> will<00:00:26.780> turn<00:00:27.020> in<00:00:27.200> higher<00:00:27.410> densities

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
the city will turn in higher densities

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.260 
the city will turn in higher densities
because<00:00:28.280> of<00:00:28.370> the<00:00:28.460> value<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:29.030> ground

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
because of the value of the ground

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.210 
because of the value of the ground
that's<00:00:29.720> in<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:29.960> same<00:00:30.170> moment<00:00:30.440> people<00:00:30.980> that

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
that's in the same moment people that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.830 
that's in the same moment people that
used<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:31.490> live<00:00:31.670> on<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.059> ground<00:00:32.239> we're<00:00:32.599> having

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
used to live on the ground we're having

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.130 
used to live on the ground we're having
a<00:00:32.930> town<00:00:33.620> house<00:00:33.890> they<00:00:34.250> go<00:00:34.399> out<00:00:34.579> of<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.090> city<00:00:35.270> so

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
a town house they go out of the city so

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.260 
a town house they go out of the city so
I<00:00:36.170> was<00:00:36.290> wondering<00:00:36.560> can't<00:00:37.340> we<00:00:37.460> not<00:00:37.579> get<00:00:38.180> those

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
I was wondering can't we not get those

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.480 
I was wondering can't we not get those
people<00:00:38.480> back<00:00:38.630> can't<00:00:39.440> we<00:00:39.560> not<00:00:39.680> say<00:00:39.920> instead<00:00:40.370> of

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
people back can't we not say instead of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.910 
people back can't we not say instead of
saying<00:00:41.079> reducing<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:42.350> tapestry<00:00:42.920> of<00:00:43.780> villages

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
saying reducing the tapestry of villages

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:58.630 
saying reducing the tapestry of villages
make<00:00:45.920> more

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.340 

architecture<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.790> as<00:00:59.940> no<00:01:00.090> about<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.600> responding

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
architecture is as no about a responding

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.310 
architecture is as no about a responding
to<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:02.010> directions<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:03.320> everyone

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to two directions and to think everyone

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960 
to two directions and to think everyone
I<00:01:04.530> saw<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.040> Thanks<00:01:05.400> right

I saw is what Thanks right
it's<00:01:06.330> about<00:01:06.510> curiosity<00:01:06.810> about<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.580> want

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
it's about curiosity about what you want

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.280

to<00:01:08.850> learn<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.480> know<00:01:09.690> what<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.050> next

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to learn you want to know what the next

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.230 
to learn you want to know what the next
next<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:12.979> forever<00:01:13.979> creature<00:01:14.340> city<00:01:14.670> program

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
next is is forever creature city program

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.020 
next is is forever creature city program
default<00:01:15.870> or<00:01:16.260> where<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.620> can<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.550> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
default or where we can see that the

default or where we can see that the
reasoning<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.140> exercised

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
the vertical village concert was

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.679 
the vertical village concert was
questioning<00:01:28.479> now<00:01:29.610> kind<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.700> typology<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.390> is

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
questioning now kind of typology that is

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.660 
questioning now kind of typology that is
dominating<00:01:32.380> in<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.619> city<00:01:33.009> as<00:01:33.219> you<00:01:33.429> could

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
dominating in the city as you could

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:43.469 
dominating in the city as you could
easily<00:01:34.030> see<00:01:34.479> all<00:01:34.509> over<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:35.350> world<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:43.240> try<00:01:43.390> to

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
easily see all over the world we try to

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.990 
easily see all over the world we try to
be<00:01:43.810> very<00:01:43.840> utopian<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.069> visionary<00:01:45.579> at<00:01:45.880> the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
be very utopian and visionary at the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.669 
be very utopian and visionary at the
same<00:01:46.299> time<00:01:46.539> it's<00:01:46.719> very<00:01:46.869> necessary<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.560> have

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
same time it's very necessary to have

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:56.570 
same time it's very necessary to have
linked<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.909> possible<00:01:49.569> to<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.020> practical

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.490 

we<00:01:57.580> have<00:01:57.759> five<00:01:58.030> groups<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.569> students<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.140> we

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
we have five groups of students and we

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.669 
we have five groups of students and we
aim<00:01:59.890> to<00:01:59.920> reduce<00:02:00.520> five<00:02:01.179> dreams<00:02:01.569> of<00:02:02.289> what<00:02:02.560> the

aim to reduce five dreams of what the
vertical<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.459> be<00:02:03.549> which<00:02:03.700> could<00:02:03.939> become<00:02:04.119> we

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
vertical to be which could become we

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.990 
vertical to be which could become we
focused<00:02:05.170> on<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.950> typical<00:02:06.429> plot<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:06.909> the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
focused on the typical plot in the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.150 
focused on the typical plot in the
village<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.569> especially<00:02:08.079> on<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.560> farm<00:02:08.799> a<00:02:08.950> lot

village and especially on the farm a lot

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.819 
village and especially on the farm a lot
our<00:02:09.700> conclusion<00:02:10.299> was<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.720> was<00:02:10.989> one<00:02:11.709> of

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
our conclusion was that it was one of

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.949 
our conclusion was that it was one of
the<00:02:11.980> most<00:02:12.430> important<00:02:12.940> qualities<00:02:13.630> was<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
the most important qualities was the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.350 
the most important qualities was the
flexibility<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.310> our<00:02:15.549> practical<00:02:16.060> village

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
flexibility and our practical village

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.120 
flexibility and our practical village
everything<00:02:17.079> is<00:02:17.200> based<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.829> smallest

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
everything is based on the smallest

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.240 
everything is based on the smallest
range<00:02:18.579> which<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:18.970> furniture<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:19.989> case<00:02:20.250> so

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
range which is furniture in this case so

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.339 
range which is furniture in this case so
people<00:02:21.610> will<00:02:21.760> assemble<00:02:22.420> their<00:02:22.599> village<00:02:22.870> by

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
people will assemble their village by
