00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
spending all the time just on the figure

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.359 
spending all the time just on the figure
itself<00:01:10.930> in<00:01:11.930> Japan<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.130> super<00:01:14.119> link<00:01:14.300> he<00:01:14.780> was

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
itself in Japan and super link he was

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.400 
itself in Japan and super link he was
named<00:01:16.369> Rodimus<00:01:17.180> convoy<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.990> guess<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.380> just

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
named Rodimus convoy and I guess I just

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.980 
named Rodimus convoy and I guess I just
didn't<00:01:22.160> want<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.399> name<00:01:22.670> Rodimus<00:01:23.390> Prime<00:01:23.420> in<00:01:23.869> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
didn't want to name Rodimus Prime in the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.889 
didn't want to name Rodimus Prime in the
US<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.950> they<00:01:25.280> just<00:01:25.520> stuck<00:01:25.850> him<00:01:26.030> with<00:01:26.060> Rodimus

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
US so they just stuck him with Rodimus

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.440 
US so they just stuck him with Rodimus
and<00:01:27.140> that's<00:01:27.740> why<00:01:27.979> he<00:01:28.190> kind<00:01:28.459> of<00:01:28.550> has<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.000> truck

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
and that's why he kind of has the truck

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.969 
and that's why he kind of has the truck

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
just gave a big monster look to it even

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.380 
just gave a big monster look to it even
though<00:02:19.790> it's

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
though it's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.410 
though it's
a<00:02:20.420> deluxe<00:02:21.080> class<00:02:21.290> figure<00:02:24.370> as<00:02:25.370> these<00:02:25.970> really

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
a deluxe class figure as these really

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.480 
a deluxe class figure as these really
cool<00:02:26.600> up<00:02:26.810> which<00:02:27.440> will<00:02:27.680> become<00:02:27.860> his<00:02:28.160> arms<00:02:28.490> here

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
cool up which will become his arms here

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.220 
cool up which will become his arms here
rocket<00:02:31.490> thrusters<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.450> guess<00:02:32.660> when<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
rocket thrusters I guess when the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.210 
rocket thrusters I guess when the
batches<00:02:34.420> just<00:02:35.420> gives<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.930> real<00:02:36.230> more<00:02:36.500> powerful

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
batches just gives a real more powerful

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.250 
batches just gives a real more powerful
with<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.820> his<00:02:38.360> missile<00:02:38.810> launcher<00:02:39.110> have

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
with it and his missile launcher have

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.500

but very dead gone I you pull it down
this<00:03:21.890> whole<00:03:22.160> flat<00:03:25.360> separate<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:27.500> here

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.590 

otays<00:03:37.210> hands<00:03:37.660> around<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:42.210> supposed<00:03:43.210> to<00:03:43.330> spin

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
otays hands around that supposed to spin

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:53.870 
otays hands around that supposed to spin
around<00:03:43.720> like<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:48.570> thing<00:03:49.570> for<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.080> side<00:03:50.410> and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.580 

put<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.120> bed<00:03:55.390> all<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.960> way<00:03:56.080> around<00:03:56.260> and

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
put this bed all the way around and

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.060 
put this bed all the way around and
there<00:03:56.830> he<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:57.100> rottenness<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.300> robot<00:03:58.780> mode<00:03:59.070> it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
there he is rottenness in robot mode it

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.990 
there he is rottenness in robot mode it
is<00:04:00.840> pretty<00:04:01.840> nice<00:04:02.140> looking<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.860> definitely<00:04:03.310> has

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
is pretty nice looking it definitely has

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.640 
is pretty nice looking it definitely has
its<00:04:04.300> own<00:04:04.480> twist<00:04:04.960> to<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.650> rotters<00:04:06.310> character

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
its own twist to the rotters character

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.800 
its own twist to the rotters character
especially<00:04:08.650> with<00:04:09.430> these<00:04:09.610> pieces<00:04:10.300> come<00:04:10.630> out

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
especially with these pieces come out

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.300 
especially with these pieces come out
like<00:04:10.960> look<00:04:11.620> closely<00:04:11.890> as<00:04:13.350> phase<00:04:14.350> v<00:04:14.770> definitely

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
like look closely as phase v definitely

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.260 
like look closely as phase v definitely
see<00:04:15.520> a<00:04:15.550> rotten<00:04:16.090> his<00:04:16.210> prime<00:04:16.860> look<00:04:17.860> to<00:04:18.130> them

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.120 

possibility<00:04:22.270> is<00:04:22.889> pretty<00:04:24.509> basic<00:04:25.509> but<00:04:26.169> then

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
possibility is pretty basic but then

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.950 
possibility is pretty basic but then
just<00:04:27.550> thought<00:04:27.699> everything<00:04:28.150> gets<00:04:28.539> in<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.780> way

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
just thought everything gets in the way

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.499 
just thought everything gets in the way
you<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.380> put<00:04:29.710> his<00:04:29.830> arm<00:04:30.039> straight<00:04:30.520> down<00:04:32.940> but<00:04:33.940> is

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
you can put his arm straight down but is

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.390 
you can put his arm straight down but is
they<00:04:35.110> even<00:04:35.139> when<00:04:35.680> they<00:04:35.770> are<00:04:35.919> straight<00:04:36.220> down

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
they even when they are straight down

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.520 
they even when they are straight down
there<00:04:36.580> just<00:04:36.849> kind<00:04:36.970> of<00:04:37.060> like<00:04:37.180> going<00:04:37.509> out<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.440> the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
there just kind of like going out to the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.260 
there just kind of like going out to the
side<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.680> in<00:04:41.979> his<00:04:42.160> knee<00:04:42.430> guards<00:04:42.970> getting

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
side so it is in his knee guards getting

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.040 
side so it is in his knee guards getting
it<00:04:43.360> away<00:04:43.949> so<00:04:44.949> like<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.669> said<00:04:45.970> he<00:04:46.120> has<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.270> torso

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
it away so like I said he has a torso

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.520 
it away so like I said he has a torso
and<00:04:47.440> pants<00:04:47.979> mode<00:04:48.220> pants<00:04:48.849> motors<00:04:49.360> my<00:04:50.080> social

and pants mode pants motors my social

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.640 
and pants mode pants motors my social
pants<00:04:50.800> for<00:04:51.160> me<00:04:51.280> it's<00:04:51.400> basically<00:04:51.789> just<00:04:53.400> I

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
pants for me it's basically just I

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.320 
pants for me it's basically just I
recall<00:04:56.650> basically<00:04:57.490> just<00:04:57.729> this<00:04:59.669> I'm<00:05:00.669> probably

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
recall basically just this I'm probably

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.960 
recall basically just this I'm probably
know<00:05:02.289> this<00:05:02.560> but<00:05:03.690> i<00:05:07.020> may<00:05:08.020> do<00:05:08.080> another<00:05:08.470> video

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
know this but i may do another video

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.020 
know this but i may do another video
showing<00:05:10.050> combination<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:12.220> them<00:05:12.460> because<00:05:12.789> i

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
showing combination of them because i

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.050 
showing combination of them because i
have<00:05:13.770> prepared<00:05:14.770> a<00:05:15.099> little<00:05:15.340> bit<00:05:15.430> more<00:05:15.610> for<00:05:15.909> that

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
have prepared a little bit more for that

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.930 
have prepared a little bit more for that
little<00:05:16.240> demonstration<00:05:16.599> but<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:17.740> is<00:05:18.250> kind<00:05:18.849> of

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
little demonstration but it is kind of

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.700 
little demonstration but it is kind of
neat<00:05:19.090> but<00:05:19.300> on<00:05:19.449> this<00:05:19.630> i<00:05:19.780> just<00:05:19.810> want<00:05:20.169> to<00:05:20.229> focus<00:05:20.409> on

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
neat but on this i just want to focus on

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.230 
neat but on this i just want to focus on
the<00:05:20.860> video<00:05:21.159> or<00:05:21.720> focus<00:05:22.720> on<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:22.990> figure<00:05:23.289> it's<00:05:23.979> a

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
the video or focus on the figure it's a

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.300 
the video or focus on the figure it's a
fairly<00:05:25.240> nice<00:05:25.719> representation<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.860> Rodimus

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
fairly nice representation of Rodimus

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.749 
fairly nice representation of Rodimus
Prime<00:05:27.719> not<00:05:28.719> too<00:05:28.930> bad<00:05:29.169> it's<00:05:29.560> uh<00:05:29.860> there's<00:05:30.550> some

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
Prime not too bad it's uh there's some

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.070 
Prime not too bad it's uh there's some
better<00:05:31.000> ones<00:05:31.180> out<00:05:31.419> there<00:05:32.159> coming<00:05:33.159> out<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.930> or

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
better ones out there coming out that or

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.749 
better ones out there coming out that or
that<00:05:35.860> I've<00:05:36.009> been<00:05:36.159> out<00:05:36.340> so<00:05:36.630> it's<00:05:37.630> a<00:05:37.719> decent<00:05:38.469> it's

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
that I've been out so it's a decent it's

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.010 
that I've been out so it's a decent it's
definitely<00:05:39.759> Energon<00:05:40.330> ask<00:05:40.979> just<00:05:41.979> the<00:05:42.070> kind<00:05:42.460> of

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
definitely Energon ask just the kind of

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.700 
definitely Energon ask just the kind of
bulkiness<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:45.039> huge<00:05:45.550> huge<00:05:45.880> feet

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
bulkiness to it the huge huge feet

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.089 
bulkiness to it the huge huge feet
remove<00:05:47.710> those<00:05:47.889> feet<00:05:48.190> they're<00:05:48.460> retarded<00:05:49.330> huge

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
remove those feet they're retarded huge

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.360 
remove those feet they're retarded huge
so<00:05:51.099> it's<00:05:51.250> not<00:05:51.400> bad<00:05:52.469> not<00:05:53.469> sure<00:05:53.710> if<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:53.889> can<00:05:53.919> really

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
so it's not bad not sure if I can really

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.490 
so it's not bad not sure if I can really
recommend<00:05:54.610> picking<00:05:55.360> this<00:05:55.659> one<00:05:56.020> up<00:05:56.080> just

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
recommend picking this one up just

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.020 
recommend picking this one up just
because<00:05:58.860> maybe<00:05:59.860> if<00:06:00.069> it's<00:06:00.280> bigger<00:06:00.550> maybe

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
because maybe if it's bigger maybe

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.070 
because maybe if it's bigger maybe
there's<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.419> Voyager<00:06:01.990> Class<00:06:02.020> figure<00:06:02.699> or<00:06:03.699> mega
