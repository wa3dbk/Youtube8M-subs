00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:09.270
 Hello River examples for the effect that you use frequently in today's competition 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.320
 I'm going to show you. 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:16.830
 In other words, this is just a graphical representation of the graph. 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.360
 When you want to show to the conclusion about the enemy was here under an optical Joan cancer 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.800
 So I'm going to blur it on the screen and then put it in the message. 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.700
 I'll make it once, but as you can see now, the menu is in English. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.530
 I have it 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:36.390
 The prophecy is beta I laid my PowerPoint 2010 beta version 6 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 I do not get Korean support so I'm in English. 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.420
 I think that 2013 is not much different. 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 Although some like too little, but I bolttaen big difference is that rather than later 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.290
 I do not think it's going to get any better. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.130
 4 I think so anyway before now try to start in earnest 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.149
 I'm calling. 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.170
 First I'll add Slide 1 controls where I say New Year's Dana replica 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.760
 I did it. 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.539
 Then you can use the insert shape to make a rectangle. 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.100
 Then cover the rectangle over here. 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.819
 After removing the contour of the shape, the color of the shape is changed to black 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.420
 I'll see. 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:20.759
 Then, right-click on the shape of the mouse 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 Two people that seemed to say all the time floating'll show you adjust the transparency hasimyeo the location change 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.369
 At least the text above 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.630
 I see the background behind and it looks good. 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.759
 After that, there were a lot of people who wrote the test and the test. 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:40.349
 Of course I can write it down, but it's not in the middle of it. 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:44.609
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:48.689
 In the case of me, I often use the insert text box separately 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.709
 Write it down on the top of the text. 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.880
 Do not do it. 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:59.069
 Fourth in the text box on the outside to take you for one side slides out 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.829
 After you make it active, you write it down . 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:05.770
 What do you say to the conclusion about this? 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:12.730
 There is no voice at all, but friendly Kang 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:18.790
 Yes, I do so in the next few times you are doing that kind kindness 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.670
 Its nice that one old geezer I'll ever change significantly once eusigo up 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.200
 There's a shortening that makes it bigger. 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.959
 Reduction of geutja big dog, but suddenly something segin pressing the control key 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.930
 It was a cramp in the state . 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.140
 But I do not know why in 2016 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.670
 Control shift and we 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:44.769
 It's just a yo-yo shape, so I do not know why it makes it more uncomfortable. 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:49.090
 Anyway, in 2010, the Jordan will be cold only. 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:53.140
 In the childless version, pressing the control key 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.819
 Do you have cramps doesimyeon stayed comfortably be brought before yesterday was a line and 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.069
 I think you'll use it. 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:04.090
 So I'm a little strange about these two. 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.099
 And then you can re-deploy it. 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.139
 I want to emphasize kindness 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.519
 When you do this , change the color of your kindness and avoid self control 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.090
 Geek would get along 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:20.650
 That's why you gave us the main content. 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.430
 In other words, the results for this material are kind to you, 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.450
 still 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.350
 For this part, I'll set up the group. 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.190
 For even under the succession and the text is not selected 0 you'll have a choice 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.630
 Selecting one after another is delayed by the control key and you can press the shift key . 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.430
 Please choose what you eat 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.959
 I use Sifu specifically , including these three shapes with the cap text 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.769
 I chose the world. 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.239
 Then , when you set up the group as a control , 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.750
 It was a lump . 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.220
 What did you do next ? 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:58.890
 I'll animate it once it's in place. 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:04.040
 It's just that the letters are getting brighter, and the brightness changes. 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:09.360
 When the presentation of this content was over, I came back a little more when I came back . 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:13.290
 So I want to change to disappear, to disappear slowly. 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.920
 Pressing the Menu animations that here there are just changes doesimyeon 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.480
 I will. 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.980
 If you want to add a new one , click Add Animation to disappear 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.350
 You have to press menu 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:31.200
 I'm so press line groups disappear through the brightness change character animations 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.610
 If you click the window, related menu appears. 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.880
 I got a menu called Time . 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.710
 It is now in English, but all of it is read in Korean. 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.440
 There are features. 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.190
 Yes , you can memorize everything if you do a lot. 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.250
 Anyway, I think it's not too bad when you click on it like this. 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.150
 Let's take a look at how it works. 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.810
 I 'll try running the entire screen once. 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.090
 To see if it works . I'm showing the presenter first. 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:03.540
 Oh, there was this kind of data, and if you click on it, 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.520
 We'll come out a friendly kind of message is still a thorn click again 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.950
 If you go back to the original screen. 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:14.300
 Because these parts are very popular format in Powerpoint Contest 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.300
 Try it once.
