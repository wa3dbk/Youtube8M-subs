play this throughout the week and then

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.640

once<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.880> February<00:03:39.720> it'll<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.049> casually

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
once I in February it'll be casually

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.710 
once I in February it'll be casually
because<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:40.950> know<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.220> career<00:03:41.579> mode<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.000> kind

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
because I know the career mode is kind

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.770 
because I know the career mode is kind
of<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.110> does<00:03:43.500> have<00:03:43.769> an<00:03:43.950> end<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.280> think<00:03:44.630> but<00:03:45.630> that

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
of it does have an end I think but that

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.150 
of it does have an end I think but that
would<00:03:45.900> take<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.079> long<00:03:46.290> time<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.920> don't<00:03:47.100> know
