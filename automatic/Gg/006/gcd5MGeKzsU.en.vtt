today we're going to show you how we
start<00:00:08.099> seeds<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:09.030> our<00:00:09.269> germination<00:00:09.870> chamber

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
start seeds in our germination chamber

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.820 
start seeds in our germination chamber
our<00:00:11.550> germination<00:00:12.150> chamber<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.320> big

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
our germination chamber is this big

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.180 
our germination chamber is this big
container<00:00:14.580> right<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> doors<00:00:16.770> on

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
container right here with the doors on

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.240 
container right here with the doors on
it<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.420> lots<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.230> humidity<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.949> there

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
it you can see lots of humidity on there

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.929 
it you can see lots of humidity on there
it's<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.119> controlled<00:00:21.630> environment<00:00:22.519> it<00:00:23.519> holds

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it's a controlled environment it holds

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.290 
it's a controlled environment it holds
up<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> 24<00:00:24.810> flats<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.410> plants<00:00:26.010> all<00:00:26.189> at<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.550> time

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
up to 24 flats of plants all at one time

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.550 
up to 24 flats of plants all at one time
so<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:28.830> 12,000<00:00:29.789> seeds<00:00:30.060> each<00:00:30.929> time<00:00:31.349> we

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
so we do about 12,000 seeds each time we

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.069 
so we do about 12,000 seeds each time we
fill<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.009> chamber<00:00:32.960> okay<00:00:35.510> over<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.870> the

next<00:01:58.229> thing<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.950> plant<00:01:59.220> our<00:01:59.340> seeds

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
next thing we do is we plant our seeds

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.940 
next thing we do is we plant our seeds
and<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.479> them<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.840> salt<00:02:01.200> shaker<00:02:01.560> I

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609 
holes for this application these pansies
we<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.820> are<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> put<00:02:10.200> them<00:02:10.290> in<00:02:10.380> color

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
we just are going to put them in color

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.770 
we just are going to put them in color
bowls<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.190> we'll<00:02:11.340> take<00:02:11.550> them<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:12.540> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
bowls so we'll take them out of this in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.080 
bowls so we'll take them out of this in
groups<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.350> when<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.590> grow<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.580> I'm<00:02:14.820> going

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
groups and when they grow so I'm going

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.060 
groups and when they grow so I'm going
to<00:02:15.240> sprinkle<00:02:15.980> some<00:02:16.980> seeds<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:19.200> over<00:02:19.890> this

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
to sprinkle some seeds all over this

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.640 
to sprinkle some seeds all over this
soil<00:02:20.520> here<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:23.540> try<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.600> get<00:02:24.810> them<00:02:24.900> even<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.530> I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
soil here and try to get them even as I

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.500 
soil here and try to get them even as I
can<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.250> gives<00:02:26.489> me<00:02:26.610> there's<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.000> thousand

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
can and that gives me there's a thousand

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.560 
can and that gives me there's a thousand
seeds<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:28.019> this<00:02:28.140> salt<00:02:28.830> shaker<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.519> up<00:02:29.700> end<00:02:30.420> up

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
seeds in this salt shaker so up end up

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.270 
seeds in this salt shaker so up end up
with<00:02:30.750> approximately<00:02:31.130> 500<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.280> each<00:02:32.489> flat

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.600 

I<00:02:37.340> go<00:02:38.470> get<00:02:39.470> them<00:02:39.620> spread<00:02:39.950> out<00:02:39.980> they're<00:02:40.340> nice

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
I go get them spread out they're nice

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.920 
I go get them spread out they're nice
and<00:02:40.640> even<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.970> makes<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.330> easier<00:02:44.660> for<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
and even it makes it easier for the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.320 
and even it makes it easier for the
people<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.380> planning<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:46.069> do<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.910> there's

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
people is planning to do that there's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.940 
people is planning to do that there's
always<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.600> couple<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.020> seeds<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.410> don't<00:02:48.680> quite

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
always a couple of seeds so don't quite

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.240 
always a couple of seeds so don't quite
get<00:02:49.130> through<00:02:49.340> there<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.970> tension<00:02:50.209> okay

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
get through there so the tension okay

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.800 
get through there so the tension okay
then

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
then

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.920 
then
with<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.959> next<00:02:54.260> thing<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.739> I<00:02:55.430> have<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.330> seed

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
with the next thing that I I have a seed

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.880 
with the next thing that I I have a seed
energizer<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.110> nutrients<00:03:00.650> that

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
energizer and this is the nutrients that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.530 
energizer and this is the nutrients that
the<00:03:01.069> seed<00:03:01.340> needs<00:03:01.720> when<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:04.540> dispersed

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
the seed needs when it is dispersed

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.800 
the seed needs when it is dispersed
germinate<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> spray<00:03:08.510> bottle

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
germinate and so I have a spray bottle

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.870 
germinate and so I have a spray bottle
hisses<00:03:09.550> seed<00:03:10.550> energizer<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.220> spray<00:03:13.580> bottle

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
hisses seed energizer in a spray bottle

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.259 
hisses seed energizer in a spray bottle
and<00:03:14.209> it's<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.530> nutrient<00:03:16.070> some<00:03:16.370> food<00:03:16.730> if

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
and it's just a nutrient some food if

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.990 
and it's just a nutrient some food if
you<00:03:17.510> would<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.739> little<00:03:19.010> seedling<00:03:19.670> needs

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
you would that the little seedling needs

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.470 
you would that the little seedling needs
when<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.840> sprouts<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:22.819> we're<00:03:23.030> going<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.269> put

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
when it sprouts so we're going to put

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.410 
when it sprouts so we're going to put
that<00:03:23.630> on<00:03:23.840> there<00:03:24.519> give<00:03:25.519> it<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.970> little<00:03:26.000> bit

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
that on there give it just a little bit

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.250 
that on there give it just a little bit
of<00:03:27.410> energizer<00:03:31.000> then<00:03:32.000> we<00:03:32.360> lightly<00:03:32.630> cover<00:03:33.050> the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
of energizer then we lightly cover the

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.780 
of energizer then we lightly cover the
seed<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:33.980> have<00:03:34.310> para<00:03:35.300> light<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.920> pansies

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
seed and I have para light and pansies

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.910 
seed and I have para light and pansies
one<00:03:41.239> that<00:03:41.480> has<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.049> seed<00:03:42.380> covered

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
one that has to have the seed covered

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.630 
one that has to have the seed covered
some<00:03:43.190> some<00:03:44.090> plants<00:03:44.570> or<00:03:45.500> some<00:03:45.709> seeds<00:03:46.010> don't

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
some some plants or some seeds don't

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.340 
some some plants or some seeds don't
need<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:46.970> be<00:03:47.090> covered<00:03:47.390> they<00:03:47.810> need<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.170> light

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
need to be covered they need the light

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.610 
need to be covered they need the light
to<00:03:48.560> germinate<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.370> case<00:03:49.640> that<00:03:50.620> pansy

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
to germinate in this case that pansy

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.670 
to germinate in this case that pansy
needs<00:03:51.860> dark<00:03:52.420> so<00:03:53.420> we<00:03:54.079> sprinkle<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.620> para<00:03:54.890> light

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
needs dark so we sprinkle the para light

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:11.030 
needs dark so we sprinkle the para light
all<00:03:57.680> over<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.579> seeds<00:03:58.880> here

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.300 

get<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.280> nice<00:04:12.019> even<00:04:13.610> covering

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.990 

this<00:04:17.880> para<00:04:18.510> light<00:04:18.750> holds<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.470> moisture<00:04:20.130> in

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
this para light holds the moisture in

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.820 
this para light holds the moisture in
the<00:04:21.060> seed<00:04:22.700> or<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.630> soil<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.800> that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
the seed or in this in the soil so that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.070 
the seed or in this in the soil so that
this<00:04:26.280> ceiling<00:04:26.700> doesn't<00:04:26.940> dry<00:04:27.330> out<00:04:27.360> when<00:04:27.960> it

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
this ceiling doesn't dry out when it

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.980 
this ceiling doesn't dry out when it
first<00:04:28.820> germinates<00:04:29.820> because<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.810> little

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
first germinates because the little

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.480 
first germinates because the little
roots<00:04:31.260> are<00:04:31.710> just<00:04:32.070> pretty<00:04:32.970> delicate<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:34.490> then

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
roots are just pretty delicate and then

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.550 
roots are just pretty delicate and then
I<00:04:35.639> tee<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.950> missed<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.700> just<00:04:39.470> moisten<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
I tee and I missed it just moisten the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.680 
I tee and I missed it just moisten the
top<00:04:40.800> just<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.700> the<00:04:41.850> para<00:04:42.120> light<00:04:42.300> doesn't

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
top just so that the para light doesn't

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:53.260 
top just so that the para light doesn't
suck<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.080> moisture<00:04:43.620> out<00:04:43.680> right<00:04:44.010> away<00:04:44.160> and

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.270 

put<00:04:54.270> my<00:04:54.419> tag<00:04:54.750> in<00:04:55.050> here<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.470> says<00:04:55.680> pansy

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
put my tag in here that says pansy

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.420 
put my tag in here that says pansy
