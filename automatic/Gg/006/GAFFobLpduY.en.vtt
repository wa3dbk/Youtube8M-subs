one of the signal achievements of our

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:21.910 
one of the signal achievements of our
society<00:00:19.189> plants<00:00:20.189> play<00:00:20.580> an<00:00:20.910> essential<00:00:21.119> role<00:00:21.810> in

society plants play an essential role in

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.570 
society plants play an essential role in
that<00:00:22.920> process<00:00:23.840> by<00:00:24.840> giving<00:00:25.260> us<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.890> goods<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that process by giving us the goods the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.570 
that process by giving us the goods the
fruits<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> vegetables<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.980> provide<00:00:28.980> much

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
fruits and vegetables that provide much

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.510 
fruits and vegetables that provide much
of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.090> raw<00:00:30.330> material<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.170> our<00:00:31.230> cuisine<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
of the raw material for our cuisine and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.080 
of the raw material for our cuisine and
yet<00:00:32.669> plants<00:00:33.149> themselves<00:00:33.890> never<00:00:34.969> get<00:00:35.969> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
yet plants themselves never get to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.440 
yet plants themselves never get to
experience<00:00:36.290> cuisine<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:38.219> do<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.329> me

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
experience cuisine as we do and to me

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
experience cuisine as we do and to me
that<00:00:39.480> seemed<00:00:40.040> always<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.489> kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:43.040> shame

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that seemed always to be kind of a shame

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.310 
that seemed always to be kind of a shame
I<00:00:44.070> suppose<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.660> should<00:00:45.930> give<00:00:46.170> us

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I suppose that they should give us

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.979 
I suppose that they should give us
something<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.300> extraordinary<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.780> they<00:00:48.930> do

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
something as extraordinary as they do

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.670 
something as extraordinary as they do
and<00:00:49.590> not<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.239> turn<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.829> started<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
and not get it in turn so I started to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
and not get it in turn so I started to
think<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:55.800> how<00:00:56.489> plants<00:00:57.289> might<00:00:58.789> get<00:00:59.789> their

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
think about how plants might get their

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200 
think about how plants might get their
own<00:01:00.510> form<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> cuisine<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.430> would<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.820> beyond

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
own form of cuisine that would go beyond

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.100 
own form of cuisine that would go beyond
the<00:01:03.989> everyday<00:01:04.589> experience<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.810> have

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the everyday experience that they have

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.660 
the everyday experience that they have
of<00:01:07.939> gouging<00:01:08.939> themselves<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.689> sunlight<00:01:10.520> if<00:01:11.520> you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of gouging themselves on sunlight if you

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.990 
of gouging themselves on sunlight if you
think<00:01:11.909> about<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.390> our<00:01:12.600> cuisine<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.760> simply<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
think about it our cuisine is simply a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.070 
think about it our cuisine is simply a
fancy<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.060> basic<00:01:18.299> nutrients

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
fancy way in which the basic nutrients

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
fancy way in which the basic nutrients
that<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.409> need<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:21.020> articulated<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> balance

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that we need are articulated in balance

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.719 
that we need are articulated in balance
with<00:01:23.310> each<00:01:23.340> other<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.360> provide<00:01:24.689> an

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
with each other to provide an

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.960 
with each other to provide an
aesthetically<00:01:26.729> pleasing<00:01:26.759> experience<00:01:27.450> I

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
aesthetically pleasing experience I

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
aesthetically pleasing experience I
figured<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.500> there's<00:01:31.500> no<00:01:31.680> reason<00:01:31.920> why<00:01:32.100> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
figured that there's no reason why you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.620 
figured that there's no reason why you
can't<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> same<00:01:33.090> thing<00:01:33.890> for<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> plant

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
can't do the same thing for a plant

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.280 
can't do the same thing for a plant
given<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.750> plants<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:38.150> consuming<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.390> full

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
given that plants are consuming the full

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.770 
given that plants are consuming the full
spectrum<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.979> sunlight<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.450> different

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
spectrum of sunlight and that different

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.609 
spectrum of sunlight and that different
parts<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> spectrum<00:01:43.729> give<00:01:44.729> plants

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
parts of the spectrum give plants

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.420 
parts of the spectrum give plants
different<00:01:46.640> essential<00:01:48.770> elements<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.890> their

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
different essential elements in their

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.270 
different essential elements in their
diet<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:53.030> started<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.210> look<00:01:54.479> at<00:01:55.070> some<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
diet so I started to look at some of the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.359 
diet so I started to look at some of the
leading<00:01:56.520> cookbooks<00:01:57.329> by<00:01:57.840> Julia<00:01:58.619> Child<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
leading cookbooks by Julia Child and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.370 
leading cookbooks by Julia Child and
others<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.079> trying<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.229> reverse<00:02:02.210> engineer

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
others and trying to reverse engineer

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.459 
others and trying to reverse engineer
from<00:02:04.380> those<00:02:04.590> cookbooks<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.939> various<00:02:06.479> ways<00:02:07.049> in

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
from those cookbooks the various ways in

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.219 
from those cookbooks the various ways in
which<00:02:07.710> different<00:02:08.520> ingredients<00:02:09.300> work

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
which different ingredients work

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.060 
which different ingredients work
together<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:11.310> way<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.580> which<00:02:11.730> different

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
together the way in which different

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.710 
together the way in which different
foodstuffs<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.460> are<00:02:14.910> necessary<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:15.690> our

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
foodstuffs that are necessary for our

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.070 
foodstuffs that are necessary for our
sustenance<00:02:16.140> are<00:02:16.890> put<00:02:17.190> together<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:18.450> transform

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
sustenance are put together to transform

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.310 
sustenance are put together to transform
them<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:19.440> cuisine<00:02:20.300> at<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> same<00:02:21.600> time<00:02:21.960> I

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
them into cuisine at the same time I

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.150 
them into cuisine at the same time I
started<00:02:22.950> looking<00:02:23.370> at<00:02:24.200> sunlight<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.950> way

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
started looking at sunlight and the way

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.180 
started looking at sunlight and the way
in<00:02:26.340> which<00:02:26.520> different<00:02:26.550> parts<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> spectrum

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
in which different parts of the spectrum

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.820 
in which different parts of the spectrum
are<00:02:29.190> essential<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.450> plants<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.110> plants

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
are essential to plants and plants

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.050 
are essential to plants and plants
respond<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.400> different<00:02:32.550> parts<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
respond to different parts of the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.040 
respond to different parts of the
spectrum<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.960> different<00:02:34.920> ways<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.020> then<00:02:37.020> I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
spectrum in different ways and then I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.230 
spectrum in different ways and then I
started<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.710> map<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.370> one<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> other

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
started to map the one on to the other

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.470 
started to map the one on to the other
in<00:02:39.750> order<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.800> make<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.670> photosynthetic

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
in order to make a photosynthetic

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.740 
in order to make a photosynthetic
cuisine<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.710> photosynthetic<00:02:44.280> restaurant<00:02:45.150> for

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
cuisine a photosynthetic restaurant for

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.380 
cuisine a photosynthetic restaurant for
plants<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:47.550> idea<00:02:47.910> was<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:49.040> build<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.280> meal<00:02:50.700> that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
plants the idea was to build a meal that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880 
plants the idea was to build a meal that
the<00:02:51.570> plant<00:02:51.840> would<00:02:52.020> experience<00:02:52.620> over<00:02:52.770> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
the plant would experience over the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.520 
the plant would experience over the
course<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.460> day<00:02:53.700> by<00:02:54.450> filtering<00:02:54.840> sunlight

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
course of the day by filtering sunlight

to the plant would be the cuisine that

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.280 
to the plant would be the cuisine that
would<00:03:05.490> have<00:03:05.910> all<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.480> nutritive<00:03:07.200> value

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
that the plants would get were they

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.940 
that the plants would get were they
exposed<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.960> full<00:03:10.140> spectrum<00:03:10.380> for<00:03:10.890> the

exposed to the full spectrum for the
entire<00:03:11.340> day<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.360> would<00:03:12.630> put<00:03:13.230> those<00:03:13.710> nutrients

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
entire day but would put those nutrients

more in the red to more in the blue
range<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:44.280> then<00:03:44.490> back<00:03:44.700> again<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:46.320> can

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
range and then back again and I can

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.340 
range and then back again and I can
increase<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.310> redness<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.870> blueness

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
increase the redness and the blueness

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.010 
increase the redness and the blueness
and<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.800> can<00:03:49.980> make<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.490> that<00:03:50.640> it's<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.850> more

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
and I can make it so that it's a more

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.180 
and I can make it so that it's a more
extreme<00:03:52.020> version<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.560> what<00:03:52.710> happens<00:03:53.040> in

extreme version of what happens in

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.510 
extreme version of what happens in
nature<00:03:53.340> or<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.210> can<00:03:54.990> switch<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.470> up<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:56.370> make

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
nature or I can switch it up I can make

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.010 
nature or I can switch it up I can make
it<00:03:56.640> so<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> plant<00:03:57.360> is<00:03:57.510> constantly

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
it so that the plant is constantly

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.160 
it so that the plant is constantly
surprised<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.490> surprise<00:04:00.000> becomes<00:04:00.660> in

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
surprised and that surprise becomes in

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.750 
surprised and that surprise becomes in
the<00:04:01.260> way<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.500> avant-garde<00:04:02.070> cuisine<00:04:02.160> works

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
the way that avant-garde cuisine works

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.630 
the way that avant-garde cuisine works
part<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.540> pleasure<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.470> meal<00:04:04.740> so<00:04:05.610> I

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
part of the pleasure of the meal so I

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.660 
part of the pleasure of the meal so I
opened<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.210> restaurant<00:04:06.390> in<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:08.220> town<00:04:08.250> of

Museum out in the gardens there were

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.130 
Museum out in the gardens there were
hundred<00:04:14.190> year<00:04:14.370> old<00:04:14.400> rose<00:04:14.910> bushes<00:04:15.270> that<00:04:15.690> had

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
hundred year old rose bushes that had

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.760 
hundred year old rose bushes that had
always<00:04:16.350> been<00:04:16.850> gouging<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:18.000> sunlight<00:04:18.570> just<00:04:18.930> as

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
always been gouging on sunlight just as

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.940 
always been gouging on sunlight just as
it<00:04:19.890> came<00:04:20.239> down<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.479> them<00:04:21.600> from<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.989> sky<00:04:22.290> had

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
it came down to them from the sky had

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.159 
it came down to them from the sky had
never<00:04:23.190> had<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.760> cuisine<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.330> their<00:04:24.510> own

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
never had a cuisine of their own

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.709 
never had a cuisine of their own
and<00:04:25.319> I<00:04:25.889> built<00:04:27.499> some<00:04:28.520> filters<00:04:29.520> into<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> garden

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719 
and I built some filters into the garden

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.890 
and I built some filters into the garden
that<00:04:31.469> were<00:04:32.280> oriented<00:04:32.879> according<00:04:33.569> to<00:04:33.689> how<00:04:33.840> the

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
that were oriented according to how the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.730 
that were oriented according to how the
Sun<00:04:34.229> arcs<00:04:34.560> across<00:04:35.009> the<00:04:35.219> sky<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.300> that

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
Sun arcs across the sky so that

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.830 
Sun arcs across the sky so that
naturally<00:04:37.740> over<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.490> course<00:04:38.759> of<00:04:38.939> the<00:04:39.060> day<00:04:39.270> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
naturally over the course of the day the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.499 
naturally over the course of the day the
plants<00:04:40.259> get<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.830> meal<00:04:41.279> that<00:04:41.729> involves<00:04:42.300> many

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
plants get a meal that involves many

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.989 
plants get a meal that involves many
different<00:04:42.599> colors<00:04:43.289> and<00:04:43.620> then<00:04:44.189> since<00:04:44.639> not

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
different colors and then since not

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.800 
different colors and then since not
every<00:04:45.300> plant<00:04:45.569> can<00:04:45.779> go<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.639> Sacramento<00:04:47.639> in<00:04:47.939> fact

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
every plant can go to Sacramento in fact

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.179 
every plant can go to Sacramento in fact
they<00:04:48.930> can't<00:04:49.110> travel<00:04:49.319> at<00:04:49.590> all<00:04:49.740> for<00:04:49.949> the<00:04:50.009> most

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 
they can't travel at all for the most

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.309 
they can't travel at all for the most
part<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:50.789> decided<00:04:51.479> that<00:04:51.599> plants<00:04:51.990> at<00:04:52.080> home

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
part I decided that plants at home

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.689 
part I decided that plants at home
should<00:04:52.560> have<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.889> opportunity<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.550> have<00:04:53.669> a

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
should have the opportunity to have a

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.489 
should have the opportunity to have a
photosynthetic<00:04:54.389> cuisine<00:04:54.810> as<00:04:54.960> well

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:55.499 
photosynthetic cuisine as well

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.129 
photosynthetic cuisine as well
I<00:04:55.529> made<00:04:56.009> a<00:04:56.039> TV<00:04:56.310> dinner<00:04:56.610> for<00:04:56.969> plants<00:04:57.449> that<00:04:57.629> was

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
I made a TV dinner for plants that was

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.219 
I made a TV dinner for plants that was
broadcast<00:04:58.740> over<00:04:59.300> public<00:05:00.300> access<00:05:00.779> television

it's<00:05:11.159> pretty<00:05:11.430> weird<00:05:11.699> when<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.090> see<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.330> plant

it's pretty weird when you see a plant

enjoying a gourmet meal maybe a little

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.820 
enjoying a gourmet meal maybe a little
bit<00:05:16.050> off-putting<00:05:16.909> possibly<00:05:17.909> even<00:05:18.089> upsetting

this<00:05:19.830> is<00:05:20.039> something<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:22.009> specific<00:05:23.009> to<00:05:23.279> us

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
this is something that is specific to us

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.969 
this is something that is specific to us
to<00:05:24.270> our<00:05:24.479> culture<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:25.379> is<00:05:25.529> something<00:05:25.770> that<00:05:25.889> we

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
to our culture this is something that we

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.600 
to our culture this is something that we
do<00:05:26.279> with<00:05:27.180> plants<00:05:27.539> and<00:05:27.749> to<00:05:27.990> plants<00:05:28.529> and<00:05:28.830> when<00:05:29.460> we

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
do with plants and to plants and when we

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.679 
do with plants and to plants and when we
see<00:05:29.879> a<00:05:29.909> plant<00:05:30.449> doing<00:05:31.439> this<00:05:31.729> having<00:05:32.729> a<00:05:32.939> great

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.490 
see a plant doing this having a great
meal<00:05:34.110> I<00:05:34.439> think<00:05:35.009> that<00:05:35.279> it<00:05:36.089> has<00:05:36.539> the<00:05:36.779> effect<00:05:37.229> of

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
meal I think that it has the effect of

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.839 
meal I think that it has the effect of
taking<00:05:37.919> us<00:05:38.250> outside<00:05:38.430> of<00:05:38.699> ourselves<00:05:39.029> and<00:05:39.779> of

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
taking us outside of ourselves and of

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.899 
taking us outside of ourselves and of
allowing<00:05:41.849> us<00:05:41.939> to<00:05:41.969> reorient<00:05:42.509> ourselves<00:05:43.909> to

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
allowing us to reorient ourselves to

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.709 
allowing us to reorient ourselves to
think<00:05:45.719> about<00:05:46.020> what<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.919> is<00:05:46.949> that<00:05:47.939> makes<00:05:48.270> our

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
think about what it is that makes our

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.740 
think about what it is that makes our
cuisine<00:05:49.589> so<00:05:49.889> special<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.879> makes<00:05:51.089> a<00:05:51.240> meal<00:05:51.509> so

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
cuisine so special that makes a meal so

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.779 
cuisine so special that makes a meal so
special<00:05:52.319> and<00:05:52.500> more<00:05:53.189> broadly<00:05:53.520> what<00:05:54.389> is<00:05:54.569> it<00:05:54.779> that

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
special and more broadly what is it that

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.230 
special and more broadly what is it that
makes<00:05:56.789> our<00:05:57.149> culture<00:05:57.870> what<00:05:58.199> it<00:05:58.319> is<00:05:59.000> what<00:06:00.000> is<00:06:00.120> it

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
that makes us humans is really the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.920 
that makes us humans is really the

when you see another species doing

something that is so particularly human

according to their needs you find

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:30.200 
according to their needs you find

I think that we can do this every day
and<00:06:42.479> it<00:06:42.900> doesn't<00:06:42.930> take<00:06:44.120> putting<00:06:45.120> up<00:06:45.810> a<00:06:45.840> bunch

and it doesn't take putting up a bunch

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.309 
and it doesn't take putting up a bunch
of<00:06:46.949> filters<00:06:47.400> in<00:06:47.639> a<00:06:47.699> garden<00:06:48.150> in<00:06:48.270> Sacramento

it<00:06:49.979> doesn't<00:06:50.340> necessarily<00:06:50.490> even<00:06:51.270> take

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:51.509 
it doesn't necessarily even take

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.499 
it doesn't necessarily even take
building<00:06:52.199> something<00:06:52.500> literally<00:06:53.360> simply<00:06:54.360> the
