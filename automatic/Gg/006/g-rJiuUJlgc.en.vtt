00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
strange way I can't hold him accountable

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
object cutter appears to be going for a

object cutter appears to be going for a
lengthwise<00:00:31.969> cut<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.079> definitely<00:00:35.030> much

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
lengthwise cut this is definitely much

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.729 
lengthwise cut this is definitely much
more<00:00:36.329> difficult<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> accomplish<00:00:37.200> than<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
more difficult to accomplish than a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.360 
more difficult to accomplish than a
horizontal<00:00:38.520> cut<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:38.910> he<00:00:39.780> has<00:00:40.340> probably<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
horizontal cut as he has probably a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.680 
horizontal cut as he has probably a
length<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.940> over<00:00:42.570> 14<00:00:43.500> inches<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:44.309> bisect<00:00:45.059> here

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
length of over 14 inches to bisect here

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
length of over 14 inches to bisect here
doesn't<00:00:46.680> seem<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.010> having<00:00:47.160> any<00:00:47.399> trouble

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
doesn't seem to be having any trouble

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
doesn't seem to be having any trouble
piercing<00:00:48.360> through<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.930> entirety<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
piercing through the entirety of the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.619 
piercing through the entirety of the
radish<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.590> vegetable<00:00:52.590> does<00:00:52.770> contain<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
radish and the vegetable does contain a

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.270

large amount of water it is quite soft
now<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.910> question<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.620> what<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
now the question is what is going to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.210 
now the question is what is going to
happen<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.750> cutter<00:01:03.989> approaches<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> very

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
happen as the cutter approaches the very

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.200 
happen as the cutter approaches the very
very<00:01:05.670> thin<00:01:06.240> tip<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.070> vegetable<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.909> by

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
very thin tip of the vegetable a by

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
section there is going to require a lot

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.219 
section there is going to require a lot
of<00:01:12.240> precision<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.470> frankly<00:01:14.400> Rob<00:01:14.970> helped<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
of precision and frankly Rob helped to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.270 
of precision and frankly Rob helped to
ensure<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.830> happens<00:01:18.830> I'm<00:01:19.830> quite

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
ensure that it happens I'm quite

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.679 
ensure that it happens I'm quite
impressed<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.850> cutter<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.450> point

impressed with a cutter at this point

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.649 
impressed with a cutter at this point
considering<00:01:22.820> what<00:01:23.820> happened<00:01:23.970> earlier<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.509> the

that's<00:01:40.530> no<00:01:40.740> good<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.509> bisection<00:01:43.229> has<00:01:43.500> now

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
that's no good the bisection has now

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.850 
that's no good the bisection has now
come<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:46.020> looks<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.409> though<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.740> going

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
come to what looks as though it's going

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
come to what looks as though it's going
to<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.369> three-way<00:01:48.560> dissection<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.790> half

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
to be a three-way dissection as the half

to be a three-way dissection as the half
that<00:01:51.990> he<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.259> removing<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.250> split<00:01:53.549> into

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
that he was removing is now split into

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.109 
that he was removing is now split into
three<00:01:54.990> parts<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:56.189> seems<00:01:56.430> although<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
three parts and it seems although the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.679 
three parts and it seems although the

going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:00.990> lose<00:02:01.259> points<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:03.860> it's<00:02:04.860> not

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
going to lose points here it's not

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.910 
going to lose points here it's not
wonderful<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.939> slide<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.660 

maybe<00:02:12.920> they<00:02:13.160> spoke<00:02:13.550> too<00:02:13.760> soon<00:02:13.970> about<00:02:15.670> he

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
maybe they spoke too soon about he

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.010 
maybe they spoke too soon about he
problems<00:02:17.120> have<00:02:19.000> what<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.090> he<00:02:20.270> doing<00:02:20.600> here

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
problems have what is he doing here

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.190 
problems have what is he doing here
