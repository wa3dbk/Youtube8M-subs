sometimes I did add a little chartreuse

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.580 
sometimes I did add a little chartreuse
bead<00:02:26.850> here<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:28.380> what<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.100> does<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:31.319> just

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
bead here and what that does it just

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.150 
bead here and what that does it just
gives<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.920> fish<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> little<00:02:32.489> target<00:02:34.160> fish
