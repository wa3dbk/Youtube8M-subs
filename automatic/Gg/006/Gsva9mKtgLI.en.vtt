00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.850
 Real Madrid could take the 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.310
 victory after a good second half 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.960
 of the team this is the common feeling 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.940
 of the Madrid players after the 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.990
 draw against borussia dortmund and so 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.990
 they expressed it in mixed zone 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.270
 team work also team has 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.980
 worked a lot 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.390
 well sketched a lot but good the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.090
 result more unaccompanied but 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.619
 We remain open to recruitment but 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.349
 well I think the most important thing has 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.010
 been the collective work that we have 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.130
 done and we left here happy then to 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.080
 Although perhaps be out 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.120
 that the team has gone from less to more in 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.130
 a bit more daring part has 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.560
 marked a little more the rhythm and the game 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.940
 much faster and maybe that grief of 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.950
 that you go with the draw after 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.400
 have had many rotations that in 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.320
 other parties because they have finished 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.450
 I believe that today Real Madrid and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.980
 bernabÃ©u leaves with those sensations of 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.260
 champions not from the comeback of their 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.440
 team and satisfied with the attitude of the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.030
 players 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.690
 the disgust because I think we've had 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.690
 chances to win 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.090
 but good seeing how it has been put 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.330
 end of the game seeing that the city does not 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.330
 has won 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.300
 therefore it is clear that in Champions League 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.980
 part of very complicated equipment that 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.570
 they play very well 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.680
 and we are seeing in this group a 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.680
 very competitive group with 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.150
 very good and good shared and where 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.960
 we have our hands and steps that we have 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.260
 had the party most controlled by the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.260
 bands 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.070
 some times and we have gotten 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.570
 goals but 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.570
 I do not think that either is 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.710
 we like a little bit at stake 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.580
 on three occasions and the second passive 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.130
 totally different does not have many 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.930
 Sometimes it's a shame not to be able to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.240
 score more goals because because good 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.490
 because it does not achieve a result 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.770
 different but in the end I get a point 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.869
 very good and I'm worth that at the start 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.520
 the second part jose alley sees as 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.439
 'the and nullify a goal for a supposed 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.300
 out of play that is not such 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.340
 in spite of it the real madrid is approaching 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.890
 to the goal of moving to eighths and still 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.260
 you can do so as group I 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.690
 I did not know when when I maried 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.150
 ball 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.030
 so it's not because running behind 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.030
 it and because I want to put 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.340
 still has no chance and could 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.340
 vary but you have told me that you want 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.920
 well I think it's good 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.650
 is to pass this highlight 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.420
 in the hype and I think that 's the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.740
 moment 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.540
 well I think we have to 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.540
 continue our life game by game 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.349
 the group remains practically the same and 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.519
 we depend on ourselves and that 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.670
 we have the matches that we have to 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.670
 win
