00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
know rugby I think rugby sevens is a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
know rugby I think rugby sevens is a
perfect<00:00:17.490> sport<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:18.119> almost<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.510> full<00:00:18.840> sprint

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
perfect sport it's almost a full sprint

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.290 
perfect sport it's almost a full sprint
for<00:00:19.380> 14<00:00:19.800> minutes<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.910> bit<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> like

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
for 14 minutes so it's a bit of like

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.599 
for 14 minutes so it's a bit of like
taking<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.070> essentials<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> game<00:00:23.400> and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
taking the essentials in the game and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.009 
taking the essentials in the game and
really<00:00:23.730> kind<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> putting<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.359> out<00:00:24.510> there<00:00:24.539> for

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
really kind of putting it out there for

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
really kind of putting it out there for
for<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.070> crowd<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.460> that's<00:00:26.730> kind

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
for the for the crowd to see that's kind

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
for the for the crowd to see that's kind
of<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.060> separates<00:00:27.330> really<00:00:27.570> does<00:00:30.710> it's<00:00:31.710> such

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
of what separates really does it's such

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.440 
of what separates really does it's such
an<00:00:32.040> awesome<00:00:32.130> feeling<00:00:32.460> oh<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:32.969> many<00:00:33.149> people

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
an awesome feeling oh not many people

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.030 
an awesome feeling oh not many people
you<00:00:33.540> actually<00:00:33.750> represent<00:00:34.469> their<00:00:34.620> country<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you actually represent their country and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920 
you actually represent their country and
really<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.000> tight-knit<00:00:36.239> group<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> think

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
really a tight-knit group and I think

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
really a tight-knit group and I think
that's<00:00:37.110> something<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.440> kind<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> hold<00:00:37.829> over

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that's something we kind of hold over

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
that's something we kind of hold over
other<00:00:38.250> teams<00:00:38.550> other<00:00:38.850> teams<00:00:39.030> don't<00:00:39.180> quite<00:00:39.420> have

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
other teams other teams don't quite have

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
other teams other teams don't quite have
that<00:00:39.629> there's<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.500> big<00:00:41.390> camaraderie

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that there's just this big camaraderie

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.119 
that there's just this big camaraderie
between<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.200> teams<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.920> something

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
between the teams and it was something

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
between the teams and it was something
really<00:00:44.489> special<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.239> exciting<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.899> be

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.550 
bit of a spotlight on it and the
defending<00:01:35.490> champion<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.060> from<00:01:36.329> Guadalajara<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
think if we come back here and do it

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.969 
think if we come back here and do it
again<00:01:39.390> at<00:01:39.840> home<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.290> would<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.680> amazing

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
we've been kind of coming up with leafs

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.580 
we've been kind of coming up with leafs
imbalance<00:01:44.880> instead<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> play<00:01:46.530> some

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590

imbalance instead to and play some
really<00:01:46.950> good<00:01:47.070> rugby<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.759> winning<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.360> be

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
really good rugby so winning it would be

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.740
