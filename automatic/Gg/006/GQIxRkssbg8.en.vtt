00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.040
 good to do the drawing we are going to 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.070
 begin by defining the units that 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.670
 write with the following command from 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.580
 iun its go center and we select 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.980
 meters a few meters we are going to 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.460
 accept when in the following draw 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.830
 a rectangle the rectangle of where it is 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:31.150
 it does not matter for example over here and I'm going to 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.150
 have a few values ​​of at point 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:39.470
 20,154 of the mouse twice to zoom 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.480
 and we are going to continue with a line of 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.180
 midpoint for that we activate the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.740
 control right click middle point without 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.550
 triangulito that is still this 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:52.070
 we activate the the north function with that 8 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.810
 so that we have straight lines and the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.090
 value of this line of those two points 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.150
 are masters accounts center 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.580
 now let's draw the ellipse for that 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.909
 we draw another line part of the drawing 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.410
 that entering here and outlined 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.200
 they have an innocent point value of 44 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.760
 escape super line and point volume 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.370
 half that as a midpoint that the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.160
 control right click middle point towards 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.070
 above and this will have a point value 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.350
 now we close enter and we will have a 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.870
 structure of our ellipse just missing 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.690
 write ellipse to select 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.190
 we receive them ellipse we give enter 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.230
 end-of-century selection of 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.650
 this select another endpoint comes 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.890
 being this and the distance of gestha 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.270
 we leak and erase the lines of the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.140
 medium with let's give it right click 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:52.310
 winter and we will make a lag until the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.100
 lag function in the distance of the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.220
 phase shift is going to be zero point let's bring 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.430
 enter and we move it we select the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.130
 object this and we do it up 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.680
 there we have this then the following 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.679
 move it we will select the 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.430
 objects 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.390
 enter the base point is still this 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.880
 here and the final point is this 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.459
 ok now the next thing is to draw a 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.319
 line of the midpoint of this line with 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.350
 our link rights both medium 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.209
 triangulito up does not matter 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.540
 where it is the same is going to be erased 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:37.000
 around roughly the same line of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.950
 this point again and escaping back 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.140
 to choose the line and the intersection that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.959
 mark leave you have to mark here is 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.800
 we select and we go to here 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.540
 Right click control and we will select 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.600
 perpendicular so that it collides with this 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.780
 line is not only to train each one the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.569
 it's more or less 15 we give it there where 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.329
 top and as a center we click 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.120
 we formed escape we go back online 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.420
 the intersection of here below to the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.630
 perpendicular here control and right 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.640
 perpendicular 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.850
 and there ok now let's cut this part 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.150
 from here this here just seems like 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.610
 let's cut this function 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.460
 we select the object these gestures 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.870
 whatever on twitter this means that 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.120
 what you select up there is going to 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.680
 cut is not going to cut anymore there and 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.140
 we want to cut this out of here 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.620
 outside then we select this and 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.430
 only automatically safe escapes to 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.540
 remove the function and we will erase the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.629
 baselines that were these 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.500
 now it is simply necessary to put a 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:55.090
 circulito and he more or less around here goes to 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.090
 have a value this is to your liking 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.310
 and they do not like how they move 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.640
 selecting enter base point and what 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.640
 move 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.050
 let's round the corners of the 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.570
 toilet this wall we choose junction 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.640
 let's select is the first object 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.920
 we give a radio crushing here and 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.770
 asking here and the radio is going to be 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.490
 point 052 center and select the 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.520
 second object 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.800
 we come back to join and select 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.710
 the first object we give enter because 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.050
 there is the default radius which is 0.05 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.780
 we enter and select the second 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.289
 object that is being here and there 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.000
 our toilet will be finished if 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.080
 you like to change the color remember that 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.529
 they are by the layers you go to layer and here 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.729
 the color you got happens to you 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:55.039
 we accept and lists has changed color 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.839
 I hope it has served and see you 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.839
 in another goodbye tutorial
