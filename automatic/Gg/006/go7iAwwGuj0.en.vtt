00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello very good boys and girls students 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.369
 I am the teacher and teacher 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.820
 engineer with double s that is taught to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.660
 the easiest and most difficult subjects and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.650
 most regular market 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.199
 we have today nothing today we have 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.480
 and electrotechnical capacitors yo 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.030
 explain everything you have to know about 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.100
 a capacitor seen from the point of 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.760
 View of electrical circuits is worth 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.030
 direct current the capacitor that 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.350
 represents with this symbol here is worth 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.600
 with a capital C 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.379
 OK 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.870
 we have a pile with a fall of 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.659
 voltage or whatever it is the voltage that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.289
 it's from the battery I'm going to plug this 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.289
 condenser 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.810
 it is represented as well with two bars 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.670
 Parallel of the same length is worth 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.460
 between its edges there will be a fall of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.250
 tension pile 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.420
 and circulate at an intensity and we have 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 to know that the load that goes to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.590
 going through this capacitor is going to be c 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.689
 where c is the capacity of the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 capacitor is worth depending on the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.140
 Capacitor capacity of one or the other 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.799
 circular capacitor to so much so much 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.429
 intensity and it will be loaded then of a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.759
 determined way how we calculate the 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:45.299
 tension will lose as we calculate the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.600
 intensity that passes through that capacitor 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.299
 because the intensity is the derivative of the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.369
 charge with respect to time then 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.180
 nothing we plug this formula here 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.120
 is derived from c 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.320
 by 1 with respect to time but 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.360
 we have to keep in mind that it is 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.790
 constant is constant so can 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.970
 leave the derivative I left with 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.240
 differential of v with respect to time 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.050
 OK 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.330
 ce with variation of one with respect to 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.640
 time this is the intensity that circulates 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.220
 by the condenser conclusion then the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.260
 intensity will depend on the capacity of the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.690
 capacitor and the variation of the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.120
 tension with respect to time is worth 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.980
 only first afterwards if we want 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.170
 calculate the voltage that circulates through that 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.200
 capacitor that will also depend on the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.390
 time because the capacitor is going to go 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.760
 loading little by little just what 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.320
 we cleared from here in it 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.050
 the differential then I have left 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.190
 differential of 1 equals 1 starting 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.920
 CXY differential t worth it 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.620
 we simply integrate this from here the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.210
 Integral differential between 30 and 32 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.430
 of t happens is the time when 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.140
 we plug in the capacitor which is when 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.760
 it had zero load and it starts loading 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.610
 this is the moment we are 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.170
 studying will be 1 party efe is a 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.650
 constant because so much is out of 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.660
 the integral by the integral of and after 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.180
 will depend or not depend on you not what 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.350
 we know but we leave it like that because we do not 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.750
 we know 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.310
 differential since then I will 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.630
 stay 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.390
 vt less but I imagine that these 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.250
 heights you already know how to integrate truth is 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.830
 equal to 1 match of integral c 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.269
 differential seer of teo I repeat and 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.099
 it may depend on the time or 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.110
 it may not depend on time that does not 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.430
 I know I do not know that will be in each case 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.019
 so I'm going to leave it like that 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.010
 integral of the differential ticket of t 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:50.480
 so then clearing from t 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.060
 we will stay with the next 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:00.340
 dt expression will be 0 + 1 match per 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.769
 the integral between 30 and of and of 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.360
 influence to dt and this is the tension in 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.590
 a capacitor you see depends 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.480
 strictly of the time it is worth 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.970
 Now I'm going to give you an example of 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.579
 apply specific application for the case 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.190
 of the capacitor is worth the case where 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.590
 we put the circuit in regime 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.590
 permanent direct current 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.270
 means this because it means that all 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.919
 the intensities and tensions of the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.660
 circuit will be constant because it 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.430
 We are leaving in permanent regime 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.120
 ie we leave it plugged much 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.000
 little while 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.190
 to the same voltage source for example 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.199
 to the same source intensity is worth 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.560
 then what will happen that the 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.210
 intensity will no longer depend on time 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.280
 will be a constant let's call her in 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.639
 capitalized and the tension will likewise be 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.950
 a constant then what happens that the 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.950
 intensity that circulates through the 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.340
 capacitor will be as we have deduced 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:02.090
 previously the capacity for 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.039
 variation is the differential of cv with 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.960
 Regarding time but of course how it is 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.120
 constant in this variation will be zero 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.729
 will be zero then the intensity will be 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.010
 zero is worth the intensity that circulates through 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.350
 the capacitor will be zero what does it mean 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.980
 So, what if I put here 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.710
 a resistance for example 10 years 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.160
 to give you an example, it is here and 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.760
 I put a capacitor in parallel here 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.420
 It's worth with your ability to make it 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.860
 I put here a 10 volt battery for 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:39.470
 example is worth so more less worth goes to 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.570
 circulate here a fall of tension 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.120
 of 10 volts will circulate the intensity 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.680
 in this sense it happens that if I leave it 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.180
 in permanent flow regime 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.180
 continuous of the intensity that circulates 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.770
 for the capacitor is 0 or this is 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.390
 can remove on practical fronts not 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.990
 it is circulating nadal is already loaded 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.990
 then we have this circuit here 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.090
 10 volts the battery is left this 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.920
 circuit here because then why not 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.440
 circulate intensity by the 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.840
 capacitor 10 omnium if we can calculate 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.080
 what intensity circulates around here with 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.790
 the law of ohm u equals airport and 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.080
 we can take that the intensity that 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:21.380
 circulate here is or between r 10 between 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.150
 10 will be an amp is worth a case 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.520
 practical permanent flow regime 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.770
 continue come a lot of greetings and I hope 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.260
 that has served you for something you can 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.850
 see next I'll make a video of 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.740
 capacitors for alternating current 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.740
 ok come greetings
