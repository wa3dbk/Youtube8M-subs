00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.740
 so hello to all so today I 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.929
 will teach you how to use a bomb 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.450
 paint 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.190
 so to paint what you want 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 so already first of all you have to look 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.300
 the wind direction if you are in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.900
 outside 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.500
 so me here the wind is going in this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.970
 direction 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 that's why I like it 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.429
 side here then it takes really well 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 protected where you go to paint 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:01:14.729
 what he now I want to talk about 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:01:15.960
 War really subscribe to this is to 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.479
 what are you opening your bombs from 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.740
 painting and so he'll have to do 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.470
 about to 10 15 cm and make strips 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.509
 well obviously here these little ones so that's 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.400
 a small object so it will not serve to 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.100
 great thing to paint them things 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.280
 more consistent but not really 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.280
 bands 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:54.800
 So here we are like a little bit 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.220
 sees the bomb sphere and so put 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.810
 a layer wait for it to dry 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.100
 and put a second one so the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.470
 first just for the second 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.360
 hangs well so redo exactly the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 same thing for the second layer that 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.209
 for the first thanks for watching 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.209
 the video and see you soon
