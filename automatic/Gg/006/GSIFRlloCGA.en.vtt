00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
thumb there is you need enough room for

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.170 
thumb there is you need enough room for
2%<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> herd<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> got<00:01:44.159> 100<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:45.000> up

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
2% of the herd so if you got 100 to up

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
2% of the herd so if you got 100 to up
need<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.509> able<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> drink<00:01:45.930> 500<00:01:46.890> head<00:01:47.040> tin

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
need to be able to drink okay and so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.740
