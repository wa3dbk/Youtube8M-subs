00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
best defense you can play it from the

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.400 
best defense you can play it from the
sideline<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:38.750> some<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:38.959> those<00:03:39.049> longer

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
and fourth quarter it really helped us

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.300 
and fourth quarter it really helped us
as<00:03:44.480> far<00:03:44.750> as<00:03:44.870> defensively<00:03:45.470> go<00:03:45.680> yeah<00:03:45.859> we<00:03:45.980> gave<00:03:46.129> up

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
as far as defensively go yeah we gave up

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.949 
as far as defensively go yeah we gave up
some<00:03:46.549> big<00:03:46.669> plays<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.150> first<00:03:47.389> half<00:03:47.599> I

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
some big plays in the first half I

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.900

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
thought we did pretty well except for

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.580 
thought we did pretty well except for
the<00:03:50.150> four<00:03:50.329> big<00:03:50.510> plays<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.019> we<00:03:51.139> you<00:03:51.349> know<00:03:51.440> we

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
the four big plays that we you know we

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
know we we had a player go down guy in

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.960

the<00:04:02.389> secondary<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:04.280> know<00:04:04.370> we<00:04:04.489> were<00:04:04.549> shuffling

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
the secondary you know we were shuffling

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.470 
the secondary you know we were shuffling
through<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.480> couple<00:04:05.690> backups<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.530> and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
through a couple backups and and

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.050 
through a couple backups and and
I<00:04:08.800> guess<00:04:09.800> by<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.040> end<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.370> third<00:04:10.400> second

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
I guess by the end of the third second

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.899 
I guess by the end of the third second
quarter<00:04:11.360> I<00:04:11.390> think<00:04:11.629> we<00:04:11.690> found<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.050> right

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909

field<00:05:06.410> position<00:05:06.470> on<00:05:07.010> kick<00:05:07.520> return<00:05:07.940> and

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
field position on kick return and

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.050 
field position on kick return and
limited<00:05:09.020> them<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:10.460> know<00:05:10.550> when<00:05:10.880> they<00:05:10.970> were

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
limited them you know when they were

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.390 
limited them you know when they were
returning<00:05:11.449> the<00:05:11.630> ball<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:12.130> again<00:05:13.130> I<00:05:13.160> think<00:05:13.280> it

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
returning the ball so again I think it

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.800 
returning the ball so again I think it
was<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.550> total<00:05:13.820> team<00:05:13.970> effort<00:05:14.150> for<00:05:14.630> four
