weakness<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.900> when<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:03.010> television<00:02:03.610> networks

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
weakness is when the television networks

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.580 
weakness is when the television networks
play<00:02:05.100> many<00:02:06.100> episodes<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.299> same<00:02:07.510> show<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:08.200> a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
play many episodes of the same show in a

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.979 
play many episodes of the same show in a
row<00:02:08.799> so<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.820> makes<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.149> impossible<00:02:10.420> for<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.959> to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
row so it makes it impossible for you to

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.020 
row so it makes it impossible for you to
turn<00:02:11.140> off<00:02:11.260> my<00:02:11.470> television<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.700> they'll<00:02:12.880> play

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
turn off my television like they'll play

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.090 
turn off my television like they'll play
