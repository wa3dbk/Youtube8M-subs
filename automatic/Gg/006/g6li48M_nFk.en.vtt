 Gallen 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:20.109
 Sustainable was positively the mood not reactive the easiest 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.429
 go wrong 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.429
 the painted that came out 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.229
 I want to say Mappus on the market 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.460
 Natl Acad have approval feeling 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 mine the sales have sucked on Bosphorus 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.970
 they always make me said i'm going to have this left 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.830
 I warned it is actually warned as a 2 1 defense in Pakistan and with 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.560
 this 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.579
 Of course it is done 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.180
 I thought I'm going right does not make much and shot to 1 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.370
 I am ashamed that this night was given to him the paramedic Stena 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.690
 SMI's first wind turbines have achieved this 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.610
 but in fact this DAX did not exist before ADCO ice cream bicycle 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.540
 and it has a lot to do 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.320
 the sleeping place 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 that sounds different 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.490
 I like the IQWiG is once unity is to speak a goal you mean what the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.060
 important fields 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.030
 They are not contractually the first time for everything you need 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.550
 say as if actually everyone should actually say that s 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.200
 I now what I still open everything 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840
 SafeStick 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.710
 the fourth point helps this kind quite fast Grand Prix 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.850
 shepherd-GÃ¼mbel 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.759
 as witnesses of the results measured for thrillers 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.170
 I've been there for eleven years, making it express 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.580
 After a shift, you're going to get on pretty well 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.560
 humid 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.100
 in the medina, easily requesting the mission in time I have requested 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 I now applied two coats 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.379
 he is dried fairly quickly 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.650
 So bleeding so APA was already dipping since it was drying up 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.239
 been served up 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.900
 after the label pouring shifted away in the track or just in none 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.549
 prevent other country 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.549
 After about 10 am it's important 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.650
 We guarantee you that is not growing with your powers 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.249
 i want something else it's mostly dry pat now we finally have 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.600
 Vettel is also fourth in the cup 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.790
 I think before as exactly as huge that we did not succumb to this fight 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.790
 so absolutely necessary it is possible a brand CPI is 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.449
 vote 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:54.159
 I've never made Karl Thaller out of this a beer 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.749
 and actually is not in sight for now 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.759
 Treasury 30 calendar 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.639
 Do not even take the two strokes and hit the stomach 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.919
 eat 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.119
 I can not in any case 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.720
 It is important that the PC is not too much not too little club 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.089
 he would not have scolded 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.689
 eat 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.279
 and give it the second layer right next to it 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.249
 if possible 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.319
 reasonably parallel 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.319
 I do not really care that it is exactly that 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.469
 the remaining debts can not be expected 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.949
 but certainly not to indicia half reasonably 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.209
 arise over time 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.859
 Student 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.649
 I thought, child said 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.649
 and then we do it extremely hard 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.150
 so the water has been seasick was previously off you have to but the country 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.699
 some made straight lines since mid-April the mix did not come 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.279
 wrong is difficult 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.889
 if you agree with her for this website 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.889
 I got it too 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.729
 as does not give me yet 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.449
 and 7 us is food 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.620
 and then it's cloudier 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.629
 okay this wool 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.909
 Eric likes that 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.909
 I can do it, I hope you liked it 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.409
