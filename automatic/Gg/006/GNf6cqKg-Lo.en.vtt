00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.500
 welcome i am thin stripe frames for 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.389
 draw well dotcom in this video you 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.029
 I'm going to teach one of the most tricks 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.050
 effective and simple for you to draw 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.220
 without problems the things that you see how 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.320
 measure angles 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.410
 as I have already told you to draw 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.399
 something you see requires 80% of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 observation and 20% of drawing learn 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.640
 to observe is very important as much as 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.640
 it is to have a nice and fluid line 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.840
 I'll start by asking you a question would you know 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.410
 tell me if this box you see here is 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.960
 big or small you will not know if you do not 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.900
 I give some more information if I do not use 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.490
 a reference to be able to compare in 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.730
 this case the silhouette of a person 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.269
 now it looks much clearer truth 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.750
 well imagine that you can install in your 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.360
 eye a kind of sniper cross 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.940
 that gives you the horizontal information and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.180
 vertical with which to compare the angles 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.310
 of the things you see with this help is 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.900
 much easier to measure the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.259
 angles that things have and 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.259
 objects 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.950
 how are you going to be able to install something like that 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.410
 in the eye without putting your eyes on the danger 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.470
 I will teach you to use the pencil as 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.810
 substitute but remember the idea well 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.230
 this peephole as a concept of 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 agreement 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.900
 when looking at an object for example this one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.170
 here place the pencil so totally 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.200
 vertical and you will see the space that is 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.860
 create between your pencil and the line you have 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.380
 this object you only have to perceive this 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.920
 angle and represent it on your surface 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.619
 of drawing 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.140
 The same is true if you put the pencil in 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.360
 horizontal position we have replaced 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.030
 basically the sniper peephole 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.610
 for a simple pencil that gives us the same 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.300
 result without endangering our 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.300
 view 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.750
 now you know how to put the pencil and so 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.329
 is how it is to place yourself in this 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.780
 position is how things are measured on 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:30.239
 arm well stretched and one eye closed and 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.239
 using the reference pencil 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.160
 keep in mind that you have to draw 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.250
 many objects around you for 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.470
 to be able to draw from your imagination 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.910
 there is another way so enjoy 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.010
 to be able to draw the things you see 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.130
 correctly now with this new 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.980
 tool to measure angles 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.290
 I know it may not be the exercise anymore 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.110
 attractive that I proposed but is of 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.820
 the most important ones so about 20 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.480
 or 30 drawings of the object you choose 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.860
 using this technique and you will see as notes 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.860
 a level rise 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.540
 follow the guides you will find in this 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.610
 entry to do the exercises 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.970
 subscribe to the youtube channel and also 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.240

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.610

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.610
 thanks for drawing well
