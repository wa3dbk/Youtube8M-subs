to<00:00:29.670> fight<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> their<00:00:31.140> first<00:00:31.380> reflex<00:00:31.650> will

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
to fight so their first reflex will

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.729 
to fight so their first reflex will
often<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.520> avoid<00:00:32.640> fighting<00:00:33.410> for<00:00:34.410> example

here<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.250> would<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.489> ridiculous<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.030> try<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
here it would be ridiculous to try and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.560 
here it would be ridiculous to try and
fight<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> soldier<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.469> his<00:00:37.620> ammo<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
fight a soldier with all his ammo so the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.970 
fight a soldier with all his ammo so the
easiest<00:00:39.690> solution<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.649> avoid

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
easiest solution is to avoid
