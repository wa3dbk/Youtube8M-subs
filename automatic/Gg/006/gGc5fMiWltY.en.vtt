00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
just too mouse actually turned to a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.100 
just too mouse actually turned to a
couple<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:29.980> weeks<00:02:30.129> ago<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:31.390> she<00:02:31.450> doesn't

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
couple of weeks ago and she doesn't

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.570 
couple of weeks ago and she doesn't
quite<00:02:32.440> get<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.830> rule<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.250> think<00:02:33.370> the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
quite get the rule so I think the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.160 
quite get the rule so I think the
three-year<00:02:34.030> old<00:02:34.239> age<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.140> right<00:02:35.379> age<00:02:35.620> but

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
three-year old age is the right age but

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.009 
three-year old age is the right age but
