00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
example of what you can make with this

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.120 
example of what you can make with this
texture<00:01:53.869> packet<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.290> looks<00:01:54.439> really<00:01:54.619> faulty

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
texture packet it looks really faulty

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.050 
texture packet it looks really faulty
all<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:56.840> course<00:01:57.759> sandstone<00:01:58.759> hey<00:01:58.880> let's

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
all this of course sandstone hey let's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.609 
all this of course sandstone hey let's
show<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.240> as<00:01:59.719> you<00:01:59.930> can<00:01:59.990> see<00:02:00.200> all<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.409> its

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
show you as you can see all of its

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.980 
show you as you can see all of its
sandstone<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:02.390> doesn't<00:02:02.600> get<00:02:02.780> in<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.899> way

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
sandstone so it doesn't get in the way

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.300 
sandstone so it doesn't get in the way
and<00:02:03.110> if<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.469> was<00:02:03.649> able<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.979> show<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:04.219> a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
and if I was able to show you a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.639 
and if I was able to show you a
sandstone<00:02:04.789> temple<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.869> would<00:02:06.020> see<00:02:06.289> that<00:02:06.500> it

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
sandstone temple you would see that it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.870 
sandstone temple you would see that it
would<00:02:06.799> look<00:02:06.890> like<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:07.130> ball<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.549> it's

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
would look like a ball and it's

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.860 
would look like a ball and it's
