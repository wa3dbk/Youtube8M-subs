you're helping out being green and on

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.750 
you're helping out being green and on
top<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.019> it's<00:03:16.260> gonna<00:03:16.530> save<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.040> thousands

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
top of it it's gonna save you thousands

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.399 
top of it it's gonna save you thousands
of<00:03:17.849> dollars<00:03:18.180> over<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.510> years<00:03:18.750> keeping<00:03:19.290> your

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
of dollars over the years keeping your

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:26.000 
of dollars over the years keeping your
house<00:03:23.510> right<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.169> audience<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.739> can

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
house right here in the audience I can

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.809 
house right here in the audience I can
and<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.079> an<00:03:28.470> initial<00:03:28.979> expense<00:03:29.519> of

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
and so this is an initial expense of

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.039 
and so this is an initial expense of
course<00:03:30.000> when<00:03:30.329> you<00:03:30.540> install<00:03:31.109> a<00:03:31.139> new<00:03:31.519> boiler<00:03:33.049> how

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
course when you install a new boiler how

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.469 
course when you install a new boiler how
much<00:03:34.260> should<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.829> expect<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.489> save<00:03:35.849> over<00:03:36.359> the

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
much should I expect to save over the

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.349 
much should I expect to save over the
next<00:03:36.690> say<00:03:36.900> five<00:03:36.930> years<00:03:37.290> well<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.430> you're<00:03:38.879> you

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
next say five years well if you're you

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.180 
next say five years well if you're you
have<00:03:39.510> like<00:03:39.750> John<00:03:40.109> said<00:03:40.440> from<00:03:40.650> well<00:03:40.829> McClane

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
have like John said from well McClane

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.789 
have like John said from well McClane
you<00:03:41.909> have<00:03:42.030> an<00:03:42.150> old<00:03:42.269> boiler<00:03:42.569> that's<00:03:42.659> 15<00:03:43.139> 20<00:03:43.500> 30

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
you have an old boiler that's 15 20 30

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.309 
you have an old boiler that's 15 20 30
years<00:03:44.069> old<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.549> you're<00:03:45.150> gonna<00:03:45.239> put<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:46.079> have

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
years old and you're gonna put you have

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.069 
years old and you're gonna put you have
to<00:03:46.470> upgrade<00:03:46.889> your<00:03:47.639> heating<00:03:48.090> system<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.690> you

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
to upgrade your heating system and you

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.869 
to upgrade your heating system and you
put<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.470> modulating<00:03:50.159> boiler<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:50.760> can

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
put this modulating boiler and you can

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.969 
put this modulating boiler and you can
see<00:03:51.030> between<00:03:51.569> three<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.109> five<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.650> make<00:03:52.799> up

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
see between three and five to make up

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.409 
see between three and five to make up
the<00:03:53.129> difference<00:03:53.340> where<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:53.760> cost<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.150> put<00:03:54.269> an

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
the difference where the cost to put an

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.180 
the difference where the cost to put an
old-style<00:03:54.720> boiler<00:03:55.109> in<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.769> module<00:03:56.099> in

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
old-style boiler in and the module in

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.860 
old-style boiler in and the module in
boiler<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:56.699> it's<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:57.329> gonna<00:03:57.449> keep<00:03:57.629> saving

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
boiler so it's just gonna keep saving

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.869 
boiler so it's just gonna keep saving
you<00:03:58.079> money<00:03:58.199> so<00:03:58.799> three<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.129> five<00:03:59.310> years<00:03:59.639> really

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
you money so three to five years really

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.949
