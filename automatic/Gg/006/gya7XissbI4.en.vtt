00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello guys good luck and here we are like 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.110
 every first of the month with the video 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.660
 dedicated to the most important outings of the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.610
 next 31 days last month vi 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 I promised I wouldn't be there at 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 first of January actually this video 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 I'm shooting it at December 31st because 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.840
 tomorrow i 'm sure i'm in 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.029
 pitiful conditions 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.980
 anyway call the talk here 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.990
 are the titles provided for the next ones 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 days for the truth are not there 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.059
 lots of games because in January it's a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.550
 month of flat calm but open with 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.860
 the exit of January 9th day on which 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.260
 will arrive exclusively on nintendo wii u 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110
 captain top three shore tracker title 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.800
 which we have already reviewed is a puzzle 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.440
 game based on a mini game that was 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.789
 present in an old title for 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.280
 nintendo 3ds which is super mario 3d land e 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.859
 it was also partially recovered in super 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.840
 mario 3d world for nintendo wii u 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.520
 and it's a game that turned out to be better 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.830
 than expected because we expected a 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.100
 really very very small title e 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.200
 instead it turned out to be rather long and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
 full of challenges and if desired 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.060
 complete one hundred percent needed 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.700
 so many hours playing the quality is 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.430
 that of nintendo games then 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.830
 certainly for your him one of the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.530
 most important releases of the month we pass 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.920
 on January 14th the day it will arrive 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.950
 atelier in jesce plast alchemist of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.340
 dust that I hope I said right 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.350
 is the umpteenth title in the series 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.869
 atelier series much appreciated by fans 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.810
 which this time comes in a version for 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.950
 playstation life the game had already come out 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.710
 on playstation 3 therefore substantially 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.210
 it is a porting which are the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 differences from the version 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.680
 playstation 3 and there will be a new level 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.850
 of difficulty and finally there will be the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.409
 double audio so you will have the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.840
 possibility to select 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.700
 English or Japanese if you are a fan 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.530
 of this saga and you missed the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.380
 chapter on playstation 3 is this is the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.789
 your good chance to replay it on 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.940
 playstation life 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.090
 the 20th of January is the turn of a 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.459
 other rpg and another portable game 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.069
 because citizen of earth arrives on 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.540
 nintendo 3ds and playstation life in play 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.299
 he is very interested first of all because 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.280
 was developed by atlus that you are from 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.010
 rpg therefore intends a lot 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.780
 in short it is a sort of guarantee but 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.959
 above all he was inspired by 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.450
 earthbound earthbound was one of the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.579
 most popular rpg of the generation of the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.360
 90's unfortunately never arrived in 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.970
 europa but is still remembered as one 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.920
 of the best games you can re 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.140
 download on the virtual console on 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.849
 nintendo wii u because some came out 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.879
 month ago then draws offer 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.849
 inspired by the pound assumptions are 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:57.060
 really very good always the day 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.910
 20 will arrive on a PC in exclusive black 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.910
 guards two black cars the first black 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.000
 card title developed by the dalic is a 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.319
 rpg that also mixes elements of 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.690
 adventure because and that's where it is 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.250
 a company dedicated to the production of 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.440
 graphic adventures and we liked it 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.599
 really so we are curious about 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.040
 find out what the company did in 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.859
 this sequel 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.650
 day 23 is the time for same strong 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:26.579
 and out of hell stand alone expansion 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.760
 by sense 4 so you don't need the disk 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.880
 original to play it in the title comes 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.829
 open a portal to hell is in 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.239
 practice the map of is recycled 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.760
 sencer or four but this time we have 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.709
 to do with demons with satan in 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.290
 person and with so many new game powers 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.450
 obviously very very tamarro a lot 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.400
 over the top if you love the series is 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.620
 certainly not to be missed also 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.109
 relatively little because we're around 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.000
 20 euros for stand alone expansion 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.090
 but it's not over because the same day 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.340
 arrives even if I go into xbox edition 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.900
 one and playstation 4 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.569
 so if you want to play the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.430
 title on the new consoles 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.459
 generation this is your good 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.439
 occasion for which also includes the new 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.970
 chapter the new stand alone expansion 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.370
 in short, you play 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.560
 the original edition plus the new ones 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.870
 expansions to the price this time of 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.630
 about 50 euros so a little lower 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.759
 compared to the usual releases next gen 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.990
 could be a bargain the title is 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.280
 it is really very very worthwhile 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.190
 funny 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.620
 day 26 is the day of a great one 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.070
 return because grim fandango returns the 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.470
 title originally released in 1998 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.690
 created by the shopper team for lucasarts 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.520
 in short, a truly graphic adventure 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.449
 excellent from the monkey island era 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.850
 and is still remembered as one of the 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.760
 best graphic adventures but brand 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.020
 luca sachs is an unmissable title if 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.110
 you didn't play it 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.150
 absolutely try it because it is one of 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.550
 those games that leave their mark 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.360
 we recommend it even if yes 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.300
 it is a re release issued at 17 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.370
 years away from the original title but 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.280
 it's really worth it because the story 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.220
 it is still very much fun today 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.690
 on January 27th, as you will discover 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.760
 very little is the day anymore 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.310
 important of the month because two arrive 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.280
 very important titles the first one is from 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.789
 inlight daylight game with zombies 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.360
 developed by techland open world that 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:33.729
 remembers the old old people from afar 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.710
 dead island although the title rather 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.680
 we've tried differently for a long time 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.060
 playlife characterized by the break 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.520
 of the beta version we have 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.840
 fixed towards the end of the live broadcast 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.060
 however a pretty title 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.550
 promising and we found it 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.380
 quite funny we really are 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.210
 curious to find out how it will be 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.830
 implemented as they will be implemented 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.139
 all the mechanics in the version 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.330
 final but for now the premises are 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.000
 good enough we move on to the other 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.460
 very important title of the day 27 that 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.740
 obviously it's the pc i grand version 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.510
 theft auto 5 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.090
 the pc version of grand theft auto 5 is 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.700
 based on the next gen versions 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.460
 so we will find the same quality 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.070
 graphic the same graphic remake if so 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.610
 we mean the next gen versions 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:24.190
 but obviously like in every day this 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.810
 time there will be an opening to the communities 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.849
 of maunder so we can expect 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.919
 great things to be gta 5 if you are 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.590
 fans of the saga surely been 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.279
 waiting for months perhaps even from 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.250
 more than a year 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:41.050
 this game on your pc is 27 of 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.620
 January is a date to mark on 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.169
 calendar 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.960
 the month ends on the 28th with 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:50.440
 hyper dimension neptunia rivers 2 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.240
 sisters generations long title 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.659
 as always as in all the titles of the 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.630
 series ae for dimension and tonia is an rpg 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:07:01.750
 is a rpg of a series that has had 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.510
 highs and lows is certainly dedicated 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.900
 to fans of the saga if you don't have 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.909
 appreciated the previous hardly 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.760
 you will appreciate this good guys too 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:14.260
 I concluded I wanted to close the video 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.450
 saying that in February they would be there 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.130
 been the great titles etc etcetera 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.650
 unfortunately it will not be so because the adults 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.500
 stocks expected in February were 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.210
 almost all postponed to March over 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.409
 so unfortunately also next month 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.650
 we 'll get a month's worth 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:30.969
 quiet there will be some very output 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.370
 interesting and probably the 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:35.620
 situation will be much better 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.110
 compared to that of January however still 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.840
 for the most anticipated titles of 2015 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.789
 we should wait until March indeed 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.270
 even the second half of March 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:48.880
 after the gdc I really finished see you 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.930
 the first of February with the next 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.320
 video dedicated to the outputs 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.320
 bye Bye
