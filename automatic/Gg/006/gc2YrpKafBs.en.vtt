00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.370
 beh 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.369
 Yes 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.559
 Yes 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.870
 the prince or I think they are versions of the current 9 to 11 percent 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.900
 the very last 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.880
 yes it's like the best that is special in the gt3 anywhere you can 0 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 And do not think that ordinary GT3 RSR a few plugs they essentially can show the car 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.329
 not the engine 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.570
 14 11 last three points behind him, good for two boat matches 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.969
 to spend 3 there is more the club from london at 5 on the k in many regions 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.229
 always euros per night 500 hp from four liters only the five years 50 has one 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.150
 high spaceshiptwo found apples resounded 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.610
 and on if you are 50 hp more that speed is always give or sight as the forbidden 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.120
 the first on that too 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.010
 the track is set even more under pressure and therefore tenth in front 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.880
 the so light that she also lady export said buffett to compensate for that 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.880
 thousands of flights 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 we want to have 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.010
 9 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.040
 young boys 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.220
 and now i 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.190
 yes I know how to drive is quite an experience a bald head rode an artist 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.230
 a recount 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.900
 boats could heat up so you sweat faster and the two of you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.170
 again quiet again with something great the engine is an oral best 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 only top is waiting is really necessary makes strange jumps that little bit nrc 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.360
 next but the couple is more silent at the regular give that entitles the low 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.880
 touring minnema see this car 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.090
 the link is especially heavy for me 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.940
 and the link has a long time in utrecht on a lot of impression than the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.970
 students sit down don't think you can post a comment as quickly 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.970
 observant networks w 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.780
 look 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.069
 look 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.659
 the 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.219
 the 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.930
 the jury is a great race director flexworker feels 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.429
 what happens in 2004 all information is moderate but 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.919
 it is really true for both chips that is completely good that the back then 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.869
 imagine the bucket seats where the problem is so far westernized 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:40.299
 enter the conditions may look good in much control the most important says 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.529
 the chassis wide balance of the car michielsen leaves them in the end when 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.549
 perfect balance exactly as it should be yes that money after it is not for this gt3 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.469
 rs 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.639
 he is tilburg taller 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.079
 more powerful, more exciting it is 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.669
 now it's looking up again 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:59.269
 But who must go and see the movie in Rome is a bit of a baby in the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.609
 if you are harder than before 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.689
 and if you really implement faster for wesley downforce it will work 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.849
 at the nose 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.849
 beh 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.040
 and I think that you should actually just do it law is nothing 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.819
 in each other's highway voice overs that kind of speeds you have to turn on and grow up with 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.769
 below 780 in the turns that outte stuck in how much checks with it 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.509
 send 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.289
 and I put a rub in developing countries outside in the tank 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.229
 has canceled the flights watleesjij.nu 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.279
 I also think it does not have a recovery in 2010 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.209
 so there could not trust a cent more and it was announced on Monday that we have this wooden boat 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.349
 m 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.639
 as a conclusion, the steel market is by far the best sports car that I have 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.409
 have ever driven down the street that we know earlier that has yet to prove 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.899
 for the Flemish so maybe that in the neighborhoods but for me it is really one 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.899
 a unique nothing 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.609
 to do 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.089
 the 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:01.089
 the 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:09.259
