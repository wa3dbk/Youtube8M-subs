00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello dear friends today we are 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.940
 do with you a boat and for this we 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.010
 will need the usual so small these 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:18.210
 rectangular shapes 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:22.789
 leaf in half well ironed then 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.789
 open this side the same way 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:43.070
 we fold in half a piece so good 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.110
 iron and now we open it and 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:01:03.750
 each stone is poured here this 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:01:05.939
 central one edge of us turned out 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 now we have these 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.720
 the good of the car 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 we twist the edges to this side 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.299
 already iron and turn on 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.180
 the other side and now stay in 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.700
 which we always have a jab 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.700
 bend down well iron 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:43.190
 and this seems too now we take this 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.619
 part of and approach me up here this 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:53.410
 help and a parallel is the bottom 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:55.910
 which iron well and 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:08.539
 flip and again so the cap 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:13.180
 small our drink so now we 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:16.670
 us down here is such a hole we 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.630
 open up for this hole and add 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:25.940
 in half like this we should have 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:29.300
 here here such here such mountain here we 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.150
 we take where we have the lower part 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.860
 every corner opens and 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:43.340
 applied protein tops and protein 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:51.430
 the other side in the same way we open 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:56.810
 again so that we have this 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.870
 Now it is not only open but Denmark 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:05.590
 closed we take these edges 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.590
 and like that you slowly turn them away 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.930
 that's what's this 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:23.700
 there were such a figure we have no dimple 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:26.069
 we open eyes to them 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.599
 volumes rolled them we have turned 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.400
