also do the same thing with the other
eye

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.180 

and<00:02:36.120> now<00:02:36.540> I'm<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.750> gonna<00:02:37.080> go<00:02:37.200> ahead<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.620> line

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
and now I'm just gonna go ahead and line

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.850 
and now I'm just gonna go ahead and line
my<00:02:38.220> tight<00:02:38.730> line<00:02:38.970> as<00:02:39.150> well

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:51.030 

I<00:02:48.630> also<00:02:49.630> try<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.020> get<00:02:50.200> underneath<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.800> lash

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
I also try to get underneath the lash

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.120 
I also try to get underneath the lash
line<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.930> connects<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:53.770> the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
line just so that it connects with the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.090 
line just so that it connects with the
other<00:02:54.880> eye<00:02:55.060> liner<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.660> true<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.830> it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
other eye liner that I true so that it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.460 
other eye liner that I true so that it
wouldn't<00:02:57.310> be<00:02:57.580> no<00:02:57.820> gap<00:02:58.210> of<00:02:58.510> skin<00:02:58.990> where<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.320> can

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
wouldn't be no gap of skin where you can

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.960 
wouldn't be no gap of skin where you can
see<00:02:59.740> it's<00:02:59.890> lighter<00:03:00.190> than<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.550> rest<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.850> your

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240 
see it's lighter than the rest of your
eyeliner<00:03:01.330> moving<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.590> third<00:03:02.860> product

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
eyeliner moving on to the third product

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.990 
to be making one straight line that
connects<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.910> bottom<00:03:16.570> lash<00:03:17.230> line<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.880> it's

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
connects to the bottom lash line so it's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.430 
connects to the bottom lash line so it's
going<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.180> be<00:03:19.240> a<00:03:19.540> it's<00:03:20.050> going<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.320> be<00:03:20.410> a
