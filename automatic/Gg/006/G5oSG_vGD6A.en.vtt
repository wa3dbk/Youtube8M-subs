a chance to do some 3d printing of my
own<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.900> fact<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.949> modeled<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> my<00:00:30.420> space

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
own in fact I modeled up one of my space

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.410 
own in fact I modeled up one of my space
guns<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.710> had<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.189> sent<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.910> Shapeways

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
guns and had it sent out to Shapeways

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
guns and had it sent out to Shapeways
and<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:33.840> printed<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.770> me<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.190> tiny

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and they printed it for me that tiny

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
and they printed it for me that tiny
little<00:00:35.850> space<00:00:36.270> gun<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.870> they<00:00:37.020> sent<00:00:37.320> back<00:00:37.559> to

little space gun that they sent back to
me<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:38.430> filled<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.090> sanded<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.050> used<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
me was then filled in sanded and used to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.520 
me was then filled in sanded and used to
make<00:00:40.950> what's<00:00:41.250> known<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> junk<00:00:42.210> mold<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:43.350> is

make what's known as a junk mold this is

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.220 
make what's known as a junk mold this is
a<00:00:43.559> crummy<00:00:43.950> fast<00:00:44.430> mold<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.120> i<00:00:45.180> use<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> pour<00:00:46.079> in

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
a crummy fast mold that i use to pour in

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.619 
a crummy fast mold that i use to pour in
just<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.559> little<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.070> resin<00:00:47.489> pop<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
just a little bit of resin pop out a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.779 
just a little bit of resin pop out a
copy<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.070> copy<00:00:50.430> gets

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
copy of it and then that copy gets

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.479 
copy of it and then that copy gets
finished<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.480> nice<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.440> pretty<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.890> so

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
finished all nice and pretty like so

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
finished all nice and pretty like so
that<00:00:53.640> i<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.820> make<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.750> nice<00:00:55.110> production

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that i can make a really nice production

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069 
that i can make a really nice production
mold<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.430> make<00:00:56.850> some<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.270> neat<00:00:57.539> keychains

out<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.949> me<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.789> what<00:01:00.090> 3d

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
out of it for me that's kind of what 3d

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
out of it for me that's kind of what 3d
printing<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.800> me<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
printing can do for me right now a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640 
printing can do for me right now a
really<00:01:03.180> great<00:01:03.329> way<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> quickly<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
really great way to quickly make a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.130 
really great way to quickly make a
prototype<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.030> awesome<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.600> since

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
prototype which is awesome and since

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.170 
prototype which is awesome and since
then<00:01:07.380> I've<00:01:07.590> had<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> chance<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.580> some<00:01:08.880> 3d

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
then I've had a chance to do some 3d

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.710 
then I've had a chance to do some 3d
printing<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.869> own<00:01:10.340> where<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.520> handle<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.510> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
printing of my own where I handle all of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
printing of my own where I handle all of
the<00:01:12.869> nuts<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.229> bolts<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> printing<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the nuts and bolts of the printing on a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.840 
the nuts and bolts of the printing on a
really<00:01:15.479> nice<00:01:15.720> hobby<00:01:16.350> printer<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.130> took<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
really nice hobby printer I took that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
really nice hobby printer I took that
same<00:01:18.119> exact<00:01:18.600> model<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> sent<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
same exact model that I sent to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
same exact model that I sent to
Shapeways<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.549> printed<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> myself<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.720> my

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
Shapeways and printed it myself on my

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
Shapeways and printed it myself on my
brother-in-law's<00:01:22.560> home<00:01:23.220> printer<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
brother-in-law's home printer the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.090 
brother-in-law's home printer the
results<00:01:25.020> were<00:01:26.060> educational<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.420> starters<00:01:27.869> I

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
results were educational for starters I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
results were educational for starters I
actually<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> lot<00:01:29.759> about<00:01:29.939> 3d<00:01:30.540> modeling

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
actually know a lot about 3d modeling

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.990 
actually know a lot about 3d modeling
doing<00:01:31.590> meshes<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.520> polygons<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:34.200> animation

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
doing meshes and polygons for animation

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.340 
doing meshes and polygons for animation
turns<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> much

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
turns out I don't know all that much

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.969 
turns out I don't know all that much
about<00:01:37.530> generating<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.939> nice<00:01:39.560> STL<00:01:40.560> files

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
about generating really nice STL files

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.609 
about generating really nice STL files
for<00:01:41.729> 3d<00:01:41.970> printing<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.750> print<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.350> got

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
for 3d printing the print that we got

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.520 
for 3d printing the print that we got
out<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> machine<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.939> missing<00:01:45.689> parts<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
out of the machine was missing parts and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.999 
out of the machine was missing parts and
I<00:01:46.799> didn't<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.310> why<00:01:47.990> also<00:01:48.990> even<00:01:49.560> though<00:01:49.829> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
I didn't know why also even though this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.719 
I didn't know why also even though this
was<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> higher<00:01:50.880> resolution<00:01:51.590> printer<00:01:52.729> it's

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
was a higher resolution printer it's

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.389 
was a higher resolution printer it's
still<00:01:54.060> lacked<00:01:54.509> kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> refinement<00:01:56.369> that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
still lacked kind of the refinement that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
still lacked kind of the refinement that
I<00:01:56.549> wanted<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.630> print<00:01:58.020> now<00:01:58.409> these

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
I wanted out of the print now these

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.850 
I wanted out of the print now these
results<00:01:59.310> are<00:01:59.430> probably<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.750> factor<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> my
