13 and then a nice on the bottom so

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.699 
13 and then a nice on the bottom so
every<00:02:47.920> 13<00:02:48.370> cards<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.910> an<00:02:49.000> ace<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.319> can<00:02:50.470> say

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
every 13 cards is an ace so you can say

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.690 
every 13 cards is an ace so you can say
all<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.670> Walters<00:02:52.030> there's<00:02:52.660> no<00:02:52.870> setups<00:02:53.700> but

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
all the Walters there's no setups but

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.640 
all the Walters there's no setups but
because<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.359> Aces<00:02:55.989> looked<00:02:56.260> like<00:02:56.470> they're

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
because the Aces looked like they're

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.270 
because the Aces looked like they're
randomly<00:02:57.069> set<00:02:58.060> up<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.420> deck<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:59.139> then<00:03:00.130> you

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
randomly set up in the deck and then you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.080 
randomly set up in the deck and then you
put<00:03:00.720> 13<00:03:01.720> cards<00:03:02.109> down<00:03:02.350> going<00:03:02.829> 1<00:03:03.100> 2<00:03:03.370> 3<00:03:03.970> 4<00:03:04.660> 5<00:03:05.079> 6<00:03:05.850> 7<00:03:06.850> 8

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
put 13 cards down going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.720 
put 13 cards down going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:03:07.600> 10<00:03:08.190> 12<00:03:09.190> 13<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:11.230> ace<00:03:11.799> is<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.310> top<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.519> this

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730
