00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
together anymore because it was too

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.639 
together anymore because it was too
perfect<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.210> things<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.470> see

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
perfect with things like this you see

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.260 
perfect with things like this you see
that<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.860> don't<00:01:44.310> escape<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.909> side<00:01:45.119> alley

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that I don't escape down that side alley

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.030

much<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:51.899> too<00:01:52.140> strong<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.850> think

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
much it's just too strong and you think

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.789 
much it's just too strong and you think
this<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.270> madness<00:01:54.869> right<00:01:55.049> here<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> actually

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
this is madness right here it actually

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.920 
this is madness right here it actually
gets<00:01:56.009> even<00:01:56.189> crazier<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:57.180> not<00:01:57.329> sure<00:01:57.540> quite

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
gets even crazier I'm not sure quite

where<00:01:58.110> they're<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.320> think<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> first

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
where they're I think this is the first

where they're I think this is the first
one<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.030> had<00:02:00.180> two<00:02:00.390> crazy<00:02:00.869> lives<00:02:01.369> involved

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
