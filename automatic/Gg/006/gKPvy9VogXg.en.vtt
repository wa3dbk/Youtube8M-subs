different things it's more of an
interactive<00:01:06.060> movie<00:01:06.630> than<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> game<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
typically I really don't care for

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.719 
typically I really don't care for
interactive<00:01:10.409> movies<00:01:10.740> however<00:01:11.130> when<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> played

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
interactive movies however when I played

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
interactive movies however when I played
the<00:01:11.880> demo<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> Stanley<00:01:12.780> parable<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.290> was

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the demo for the Stanley parable I was

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
the demo for the Stanley parable I was
immediately<00:01:14.130> sucked<00:01:14.520> into<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> game<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
immediately sucked into the game and I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
immediately sucked into the game and I
wasn't<00:01:15.720> bored<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.920> second<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> i've

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
wasn't bored for one second and i've

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.570 
wasn't bored for one second and i've
spent<00:01:18.450> about<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> last<00:01:19.049> day<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.890> trying<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
spent about the last day or so trying to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
spent about the last day or so trying to
figure<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.840> about<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.229> game

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
figure out what it is about this game

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.310 
figure out what it is about this game
that<00:01:22.680> has<00:01:22.890> me<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.430> intrigued<00:01:24.150> now<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.810> demo

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that has me so intrigued now the demo

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740 
that has me so intrigued now the demo
itself<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:26.100> doesn't<00:01:26.549> contain<00:01:26.909> any<00:01:26.970> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
itself actually doesn't contain any of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.770 
itself actually doesn't contain any of
the<00:01:28.049> actual<00:01:28.500> game<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> created<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.329> demo

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the actual game so you created a demo

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.100 
the actual game so you created a demo
for<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.200> game<00:01:31.560> using<00:01:32.369> all<00:01:32.700> new<00:01:33.000> material<00:01:33.540> it's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
for the game using all new material it's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.899 
for the game using all new material it's
almost<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.860> mini<00:01:35.100> game<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.610> just

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
almost like a mini game that really just

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.359 
almost like a mini game that really just
gives<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.570> feel<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.710> full<00:01:37.950> game<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
gives you the feel of the full game and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.640 
gives you the feel of the full game and
I<00:01:38.430> thought<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.790> was<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.270> coolest<00:01:39.960> idea<00:01:40.409> so

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
I thought this was the coolest idea so
