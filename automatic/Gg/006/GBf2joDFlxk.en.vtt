00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.110 
then I realized it actually wasn't me at
all<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:45.450> technology<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.120> this

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
even at 40 30 50 miles an hour you

cars these days where even a guy like me

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.600 
cars these days where even a guy like me
only<00:02:03.450> 5/9<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.680> bump<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.040> head<00:02:05.310> when<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
you can take a look at and see that it's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.630 
you can take a look at and see that it's
just<00:02:26.360> really<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> radio<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.500> then<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
cruise control and the best part about

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.130 
cruise control and the best part about
this<00:02:31.340> car<00:02:31.580> it's<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.090> six-speed<00:02:32.540> manual<00:02:32.570> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
this car it's a six-speed manual and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.690 
this car it's a six-speed manual and
that's<00:02:33.410> always<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.709> blast<00:02:33.980> never<00:02:34.310> been<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:34.520> big

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
that's always a blast never been a big

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.210 
that's always a blast never been a big
fan<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.209> paddle<00:02:35.570> shifts<00:02:35.959> although<00:02:36.740> those

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
fan of the paddle shifts although those

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.940 
fan of the paddle shifts although those
might<00:02:37.430> shift<00:02:37.700> smooth<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:39.230> quickly<00:02:39.739> but

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
might shift smooth and quickly but

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.560 
might shift smooth and quickly but
there's<00:02:40.459> nothing<00:02:40.820> like<00:02:40.940> testing<00:02:41.390> your<00:02:41.540> own

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
there's nothing like testing your own

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.290 
there's nothing like testing your own
prowess<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.530> shifting<00:02:43.310> through<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> gears

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
prowess and shifting through the gears

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.130 
prowess and shifting through the gears
and<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:45.380> car<00:02:45.709> allows<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.520> do<00:02:46.670> just<00:02:46.700> that

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
and this car allows you to do just that

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.660 
and this car allows you to do just that
again<00:02:48.140> there's<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:48.890> much<00:02:49.040> going<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.489> with

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
again there's just so much going on with

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.940 
again there's just so much going on with
this<00:02:49.760> particular<00:02:50.330> vehicle<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.930> can't<00:02:51.709> mention

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
this particular vehicle I can't mention

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.250 
this particular vehicle I can't mention
it's<00:02:52.790> got<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.120> heated<00:02:53.480> seats<00:02:53.780> there's<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.050> lot

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
it's got the heated seats there's a lot

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.810 
it's got the heated seats there's a lot
of<00:02:54.380> different<00:02:54.650> amenities<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.640> voice

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
of different amenities that the voice

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.060 
of different amenities that the voice
activation<00:02:56.360> as<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.750> mentioned<00:02:57.230> was<00:02:57.650> something

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
activation as I mentioned was something

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.240 
activation as I mentioned was something
that<00:02:58.100> works<00:02:58.430> very<00:02:59.000> very<00:02:59.120> well<00:02:59.680> if<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.100> to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
that works very very well if I have to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
that works very very well if I have to
say<00:03:01.430> one<00:03:01.940> drawback<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.660> think<00:03:02.870> probably<00:03:03.050> the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
say one drawback I think probably the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.720 
say one drawback I think probably the
biggest<00:03:03.380> drawback<00:03:03.920> would<00:03:04.100> be<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.400> length<00:03:04.580> of

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
biggest drawback would be the length of

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.640 
biggest drawback would be the length of
time<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.060> takes<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.450> get<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.690> top<00:03:05.900> down<00:03:06.140> which

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
time it takes to get the top down which

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.590 
time it takes to get the top down which
is<00:03:06.830> only<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.130> matter<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.430> 20<00:03:07.850> seconds<00:03:08.300> but<00:03:08.480> I'll

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
is only a matter of 20 seconds but I'll

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.199 
is only a matter of 20 seconds but I'll
tell<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.900> what<00:03:09.160> when<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.340> get<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.640> top<00:03:10.940> down

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
tell you what when you get that top down

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.449 
tell you what when you get that top down
and<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:12.080> put<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:12.440> car<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:12.860> gear<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.130> you

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
and you put this car in gear and you

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.350 
and you put this car in gear and you
take<00:03:13.730> off<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.810> is<00:03:14.959> absolutely<00:03:15.799> fantastic<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.180> I

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
take off it is absolutely fantastic so I

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.060 
take off it is absolutely fantastic so I
would<00:03:17.600> encourage<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.320> get<00:03:18.739> down<00:03:18.920> your

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
would encourage you to get down your

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.830 
would encourage you to get down your
