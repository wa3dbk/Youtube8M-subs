00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hey people for all teams 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.550
 and players with a special one 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.809
 want to train ball there is now 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.530
 the adidas brasilia finale in the top 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.619
 version 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.029
 it is the cheaper one 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.960
 Execution of the official game ball 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.150
 for the wm finale 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.170
 It's a ball for training 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 is thought of and the normal over the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.480
 however, his browser has the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.550
 that means wearing colors of the endgame 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.559
 did you get here with exactly the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.940
 same ball as the normal top 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.079
 Training ball in the multi color look 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 from the construction ago 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.030
 just stop with the new design for that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.149
 wm-final highlights of the ball are 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.489
 quite clearly the form of the browser 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.579
 that means you have a ball out 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.340
 there are six equal breadcrumbs 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.430
 with tsb glued there will be no 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.339
 moisture can penetrate the ball 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.490
 In addition, the browser has final top 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.830
 republic ball an abrasion resistant surface 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.380
 which makes sure that you have the ball too 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.110
 to play for a longer period of time 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.770
 So you can train with it and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.110
 Thus the attempt of the bazooka is top 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 cap is really synonymous for 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.430
 clubs are meant to work out and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.619
 not just as a fanart article 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.229
 but it is a full-fledged football 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.720
 You are also very good in team sports as well 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.189
 training can use 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.380
 at the top of the track this has me 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.790

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.360

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.939
 training 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.530
