00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.470 
starts on Easter
and<00:02:13.800> before<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.340> had<00:02:14.520> about<00:02:14.640> 30<00:02:15.030> hours<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and before then I had about 30 hours I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.910 
and before then I had about 30 hours I
think<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.110> know<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.320> flipped<00:02:16.590> quite<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.770> bit

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
think so you know I flipped quite a bit

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.700 
think so you know I flipped quite a bit
of<00:02:17.010> soldier<00:02:17.400> not<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.210> lot<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.810> compared<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.440> some

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
of soldier not a lot to compared to some

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.400 
of soldier not a lot to compared to some
but<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> have<00:02:20.430> played<00:02:20.700> decent<00:02:21.150> amount<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.350> do

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
but I have played decent amount and I do

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.400 
but I have played decent amount and I do
think<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.820> cool<00:02:24.270> class<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.230> play

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
think it is a really cool class to play

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.310 
think it is a really cool class to play
extremely<00:02:25.970> aggressive<00:02:26.970> very<00:02:27.510> powerful<00:02:28.170> as

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
extremely aggressive very powerful as

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.200 
extremely aggressive very powerful as
well<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.740> can<00:02:28.860> use<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.070> properly<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.730> I

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
well if you can use it properly and I

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.460 
well if you can use it properly and I
thought<00:02:30.360> I'd<00:02:30.450> give<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> few<00:02:30.840> tips<00:02:30.870> from<00:02:31.200> what

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
thought I'd give a few tips from what

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.550 
thought I'd give a few tips from what
I've<00:02:31.650> picked<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.000> thing<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.630> sort

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
I've picked up now the thing is I sort

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.590 
I've picked up now the thing is I sort
of<00:02:34.590> think<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.310> process<00:02:36.120> information

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
of think and process information

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.900 
of think and process information
completely<00:02:37.560> different<00:02:38.220> completely

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
completely different completely

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.540 
completely different completely
differently<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> lot<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.650> people<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:41.460> you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
differently to a lot of people so if you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.730 
differently to a lot of people so if you
ever<00:02:41.730> explain<00:02:42.270> something<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.780> me<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
ever explain something to me and you

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.110 
ever explain something to me and you
want<00:02:43.890> me<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.100> explain<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.550> back<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> I'll

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
want me to explain it back to you I'll

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.340 
want me to explain it back to you I'll
probably<00:02:45.390> explain<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> completely

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
probably explain it in a completely

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.470 
probably explain it in a completely
different<00:02:46.710> way<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.850> because<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.330> way<00:02:48.450> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
different way just because the way I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.060 
different way just because the way I
think<00:02:48.840> about<00:02:49.050> things<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.500> completely

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
think about things is completely

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.760 
think about things is completely
differently<00:02:50.520> for<00:02:51.240> example<00:02:51.780> i<00:02:51.900> am<00:02:52.050> playing<00:02:52.290> mge

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
the information of what i'm doing is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.710 
the information of what i'm doing is
them<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:07.950> somebody<00:03:08.670> rocky<00:03:08.880> jumps<00:03:09.240> up<00:03:09.420> i'll

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
them if somebody rocky jumps up i'll

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.840 
them if somebody rocky jumps up i'll
give<00:03:10.080> them<00:03:10.290> literally<00:03:10.740> half<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.310> second<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
give them literally half a second and

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.910 
give them literally half a second and
then<00:03:11.910> rocket<00:03:12.420> jump<00:03:12.570> up<00:03:12.690> behind<00:03:12.960> them<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.770> is

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
then rocket jump up behind them this is

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.120 
then rocket jump up behind them this is
so<00:03:14.070> my<00:03:14.250> sense<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.730> you've<00:03:15.300> just<00:03:15.690> moved<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.350> yet

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
so my sense of you've just moved in yet

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.940 
so my sense of you've just moved in yet
you're<00:03:17.640> not<00:03:17.910> fully<00:03:18.330> settled<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:19.050> yet<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.740> this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
you're not fully settled in yet so this

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.040 
you're not fully settled in yet so this
means<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.310> haven't<00:03:20.580> had<00:03:20.880> time<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.360> an<00:03:21.570> attack

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
means I haven't had time to an attack

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.960 
means I haven't had time to an attack
and<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.620> don't<00:03:22.800> know<00:03:22.860> why<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.100> don't<00:03:23.430> know<00:03:23.700> why<00:03:23.940> I

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and I don't know why I don't know why I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.450 
and I don't know why I don't know why I
think<00:03:24.330> like<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.630> or<00:03:24.870> why<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.350> just<00:03:25.890> works<00:03:26.190> but

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
think like this or why it just works but

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.400 
think like this or why it just works but
this<00:03:26.640> guy<00:03:26.790> rocket<00:03:27.090> jumps<00:03:27.270> up<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.630> rocket<00:03:28.230> jump

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
this guy rocket jumps up I rocket jump

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.980 
this guy rocket jumps up I rocket jump
up<00:03:28.560> straight<00:03:28.800> behind<00:03:28.950> him<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.660> just<00:03:30.660> almost

and how I really learned over time has

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.039 
and how I really learned over time has
been<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:20.400> by<00:04:20.520> trying<00:04:20.760> things<00:04:21.090> out<00:04:21.270> I'll<00:04:21.660> try

been just by trying things out I'll try

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.960 
been just by trying things out I'll try
out<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.290> different<00:04:22.680> way<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.950> rocket<00:04:23.370> jumping<00:04:23.700> or
