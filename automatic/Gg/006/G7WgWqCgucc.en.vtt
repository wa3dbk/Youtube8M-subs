00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.120
 literary halfway between the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.580
 literature and painting than with the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.890
 particularity of relating the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.289
 the canons of classical literature e 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.910

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.059
 tell you what I believe to be 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.390
 the most superficial aspect of history

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.780
 a particular innovation that 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.700
 vignette reported the dialogues between the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.750

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.110
 mostly humorous but in 1929 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.700

 newspapers and pulp magazines the most 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.490
 great examples that can be done are

 united states that will revolutionize the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.450
 superhero world a genre now 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.459
 old and maybe it is too realized for 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.349
 an era that no longer believes in the

 problems and weaknesses succeed in 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.350
 destroy the only certainty of that 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.680
 first name 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.270
 the hero the protagonist is no longer

 invincible or even dying icons 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.950
 of this period are his spiderman 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.720
 hulk the fantastic four 80s in 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.190
 especially to the 90s they had a 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.910
 progressive distortion of the 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.290
 balances 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.840
 the strong Japan of transposition 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.060
 animated by his comics starts 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.950
 massively export one 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.050
 different with stories stories 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.360
 characters very different from comics 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.680
 American or European comic strip and 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.630
 beyond physical differences such as 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.790
 may be the pagination la 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.890
 coloring a graphic style of the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.570
 drawings the real difference lies in 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.150
 history and in the narration the comic 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.160
 European is usually identifiable of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.810
 short and self-contained stories from 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.670
 maximum duration of 48 pages 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.380
 unlike the coma of the manga that 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.300
 they have a more serial nature but 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.310
 despite this proximity the two genders 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.710
 differ on other aspects as they can 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.570
 be the style the rhythm the center of the 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.600
 narration and the most obvious difference 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.400
 is in the automaton year of the characters 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.140
 extremized is easily identifiable 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.209
 in one or the other kind this is 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.430
