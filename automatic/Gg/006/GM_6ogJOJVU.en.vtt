00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Talk to people, beauty , welcome, one more. 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.150
 video that is subscribed to the channel 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.919
 this video will be to show the fabric 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.300
 inscribed reginaldo rocha that is the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.920
 number 190 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.799
 so do not waste time and we'll show you 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.230
 this machine there first picture cabinet 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.359
 without side cover side view 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.609
 inside the cabinet showing all the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.619
 components used in the configuration 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 that he really is very good the only one 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.460
 My program is that there are some 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.380
 ways there that are showing the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.150
 func and you can hide this cable a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 a little more calm leaving the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.460
 most controversial configuration 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.079
 its processor is 13 21 21 which is of the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.960
 second generation is between general 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 was able to harvest the model house 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 sell the use and the motherboard of it is a p 8 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.739
 h67 see that it is alleviate 1155 then it just goes 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.530
 so he can put the processors 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.629
 the second generation and perhaps if you have 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.489
 third generation data update 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.109
 in the memory part we are again 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.930
 ten days look lonely 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.170
 only this time two 4g fish from the 5th 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.150
 session and another 2GB all of them with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.400
 1333mhz clock in Bahia I did not like it 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.840
 we can see that this is a cabinet that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 will provide a computer action 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.400
 drawer that best chooses sata cables 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.710
 and we have one more spirit of those who 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.860
 They certainly work with something. 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.799
 day because there are more than 300 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.689
 players and it has a ssd of 128 gb 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.700
 here I am the same as I have here 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.799
 at home and the other one is very cool 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.390
 to make the system gets much faster 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.490
 and for those who have a lot left over 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.210
 It's worth the investment 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.850
 the video card is a r 7 267 model of the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.100
 powercolor video card very good is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.439
 has an excellent cost-benefit rotate 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.630
 in all current games most of them 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.030
 with graphics at least in the middle only the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.250
 action games focus mode is graphics like 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.079
 for example from 23 it will suffer a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.590
 a little bit but I think the rest of the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.860
 current games it turns well and the source is 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.740
 of the brand the model novel home where 750 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.719
 thousand watts was to buy this asset and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.520
 modular galley then certainly a 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.090
 font with good quality I do not know what 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.430
 happened in the old days we had 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.140
 many home brand products here at 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.430
 Brazil and the products that give a 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.900
 missing in the market 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.840
 if anyone knows of anything, 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.510
 comments and finally the cabinet is 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.840
 a house leide he likes the house brand 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.459
 huh 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.739
 and it is not for nothing because it is a brand that has 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.720
 quality products the cabinet is very 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.910
 Good people, he has good support there. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.099
 for a way of mind is based on hd 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.629
 in drawer format and a good space 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.060
 Internal then you can do and 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.760
 settings pop in it as I see the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.379
 Reginaldo has a very good fabric then 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.849
 this ends another video that is 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.349
 written here from the channel if you want 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.690

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.380
 video A hug to everyone and until the next 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.380
 and I went
