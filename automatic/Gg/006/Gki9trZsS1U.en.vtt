00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.920
 video I want to sing his favorite 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.610
 computer game sims 3 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 I like this game because in it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.250
 you can live like a real life first 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.250
 to install 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:31.040
 you need a basic rotating disk of vodka 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.989
 when you let live with us not 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:45.809
 proceed to the choice of the town you choose 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:48.539
 city and character creation that to me 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.010
 like in this game character creation 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.520
 and that is not 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.430
 something you can choose the whole hairstyle 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.770
 You can choose a suit clothes as in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.949
 previous 70 but there are more 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:08.070
 realistic you can choose by pofigu 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:11.630
 there muscles and so on, you can create 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.960

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.950
 have chosen the house you buy furniture for it 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.530
 which not even the most lacking 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.270
 necessary for life and start playing 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.579

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:53.009

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:56.759

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.840
 what to get in general so that it is something 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:08.240
 skillfully and could make money and and 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.240

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:20.640
 and then for the amount of money you can go on 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.460

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.890
