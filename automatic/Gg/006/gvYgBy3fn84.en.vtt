00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.870 

okay<00:01:58.050> this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> second<00:01:59.160> gear<00:01:59.310> launch<00:01:59.640> with

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
okay this is a second gear launch with

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
okay this is a second gear launch with
nitrous<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.259> you're<00:02:01.380> gonna<00:02:01.470> want<00:02:01.770> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
nitrous and then you're gonna want to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.100 
nitrous and then you're gonna want to
shift<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.240> watch<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.690> video<00:02:03.930> at

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
shift it like just watch the video at

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.440 
shift it like just watch the video at
the<00:02:04.229> end<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.400> have<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.670> few<00:02:05.910> runs<00:02:06.150> just

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the end because I have a few runs just

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
the end because I have a few runs just
watch<00:02:06.660> where<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:06.960> shift<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.530> car<00:02:07.800> shift<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
watch where I shift at the car shift the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.360 
watch where I shift at the car shift the
car<00:02:08.520> uh<00:02:09.500> third-years<00:02:10.500> twenty-eight<00:02:11.070> thirty

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
car uh third-years twenty-eight thirty

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.680 
car uh third-years twenty-eight thirty
so<00:02:12.320> twenty-eight<00:02:15.950> thirty<00:02:16.950> fourth<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.120> 20<00:02:18.540> to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so twenty-eight thirty fourth is 20 to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.479 
so twenty-eight thirty fourth is 20 to
80<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:21.080> there's<00:02:22.080> some<00:02:22.230> reason<00:02:22.560> that's<00:02:22.680> not<00:02:22.980> all

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
80 so there's some reason that's not all

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.199 
80 so there's some reason that's not all
the<00:02:23.610> way<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:24.140> 20<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.320> 20<00:02:25.620> 20<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:25.980> 80<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.850> keep<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the way up 20 to 20 20 to 80 to keep it

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.020 
the way up 20 to 20 20 to 80 to keep it
at<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.660> then<00:02:28.110> 1790<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.489> not<00:02:29.670> quite<00:02:29.850> all

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
at that and then 1790 so not quite all

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.060 
at that and then 1790 so not quite all
the<00:02:30.120> way<00:02:30.150> up

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.700 

okay<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.130> there<00:02:37.460> is<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.290> actually<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.440> isn't

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
okay so there is the actually this isn't

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.010 
okay so there is the actually this isn't
yeah<00:02:40.520> no<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:40.820> good<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.240> good<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.750> all

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
yeah no it's good it's good it's all

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.690 
yeah no it's good it's good it's all
good<00:02:42.050> yeah<00:02:42.500> there's<00:02:43.100> your<00:02:43.280> nitrous

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
good yeah there's your nitrous

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.180 
good yeah there's your nitrous
transition<00:02:44.540> team<00:02:44.690> drivetrain<00:02:45.680> everything<00:02:46.100> at

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
transition team drivetrain everything at

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.390 
transition team drivetrain everything at
sixty<00:02:46.640> body<00:02:47.480> yes<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.990> certain<00:02:48.770> power<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.280> want

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
sixty body yes of certain power you want

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.190 
sixty body yes of certain power you want
all<00:02:49.790> your<00:02:49.940> power<00:02:50.120> upgrades<00:02:50.420> high<00:02:50.570> rpm<00:02:50.930> turbo

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
all your power upgrades high rpm turbo

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.890 
all your power upgrades high rpm turbo
range<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.830> nitrous<00:02:52.660> ballast<00:02:53.660> you're<00:02:53.810> gonna

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
range and nitrous ballast you're gonna

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.020 
range and nitrous ballast you're gonna
want<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> put<00:02:54.350> 70<00:02:54.770> kilograms<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.550> rear<00:02:55.820> I

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
want to put 70 kilograms to the rear I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.280 
want to put 70 kilograms to the rear I
think<00:02:56.380> pounds<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.500> would<00:02:57.620> probably<00:02:57.890> be<00:02:58.490> around

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
think pounds it would probably be around

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.320 
think pounds it would probably be around
160<00:03:00.290> 170<00:03:01.010> killed<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.610> hundred<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.060> seventy

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
160 170 killed a hundred and seventy

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.540 
160 170 killed a hundred and seventy
pounds<00:03:02.600> so<00:03:02.750> if<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.650> guys<00:03:03.740> are<00:03:03.920> using<00:03:03.950> pounds<00:03:04.490> I

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
pounds so if you guys are using pounds I

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.280 
pounds so if you guys are using pounds I
can't<00:03:04.880> remember<00:03:05.090> if<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.570> do<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.840> conversion

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
can't remember if you do a conversion

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.060 
can't remember if you do a conversion
like<00:03:06.560> if<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.800> do<00:03:07.450> Imperial<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:09.140> metric<00:03:09.170> I'm

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
like if you do Imperial to metric I'm

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.949 
like if you do Imperial to metric I'm
not<00:03:10.280> sure<00:03:10.459> if<00:03:10.610> metric<00:03:10.970> changes<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> kilograms

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
not sure if metric changes the kilograms

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.630 
not sure if metric changes the kilograms
well<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.350> think<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.010> actually<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
well I think I think actually the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.180 
well I think I think actually the
kilograms<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:14.239> all<00:03:14.390> around<00:03:14.660> because

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
kilograms is all around because

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.130 
kilograms is all around because
kilograms<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.370> metric<00:03:16.790> not<00:03:17.000> imperial<00:03:17.900> but

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
kilograms is metric not imperial but

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.229 
kilograms is metric not imperial but
anyways<00:03:18.770> so<00:03:19.550> we're<00:03:19.670> gonna<00:03:19.760> look<00:03:19.880> at<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.060> no

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
anyways so we're gonna look at the no

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.130 
anyways so we're gonna look at the no
nitrous<00:03:20.630> tune<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.780> only<00:03:23.900> thing<00:03:24.020> is

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
nitrous tune so the only thing is

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.140 
nitrous tune so the only thing is
different<00:03:24.320> is<00:03:24.920> you<00:03:25.489> want<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.700> take<00:03:25.820> off<00:03:25.970> all

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
different is you want to take off all

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.340 
different is you want to take off all
the<00:03:26.239> weight<00:03:26.390> on<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.660> car<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.900> don't<00:03:27.080> want<00:03:27.200> any

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
the weight on the car you don't want any

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.710 
the weight on the car you don't want any
weight<00:03:27.530> on<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.770> car<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.640> you're<00:03:28.790> gonna<00:03:28.850> reset

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
weight on the car and you're gonna reset

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.510 
weight on the car and you're gonna reset
to<00:03:30.080> default<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:30.950> you're<00:03:31.130> gonna<00:03:31.250> put<00:03:31.430> your

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
to default and you're gonna put your

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.400 
to default and you're gonna put your
final<00:03:31.730> gear<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.060> 2,700<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.110> we're<00:03:33.230> going<00:03:33.350> to

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
final gear to 2,700 so we're going to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.430 
final gear to 2,700 so we're going to
drop<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:33.860> bit<00:03:34.450> okay<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.690> once<00:03:36.170> you've<00:03:36.290> done

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
drop it a bit okay so once you've done

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.170 
drop it a bit okay so once you've done
that<00:03:36.500> you're<00:03:37.280> gonna<00:03:37.400> bring<00:03:37.610> your<00:03:37.670> max<00:03:37.910> speed

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
that you're gonna bring your max speed

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.020 
that you're gonna bring your max speed
all<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.300> way<00:03:38.390> down<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.870> left<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.350> 137<00:03:40.190> and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
all the way down to the left to 137 and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.160 
all the way down to the left to 137 and
if<00:03:41.209> you're<00:03:41.330> using<00:03:41.450> kilometers<00:03:41.959> it'll

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
if you're using kilometers it'll

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.380 
if you're using kilometers it'll
probably<00:03:42.410> be<00:03:42.650> around<00:03:42.920> 200<00:03:43.519> something<00:03:44.239> like

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
probably be around 200 something like

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.080 
probably be around 200 something like
that<00:03:44.600> 250<00:03:45.470> something<00:03:45.769> like<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:46.220> final

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
that 250 something like that so final

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.580 
that 250 something like that so final
gear<00:03:47.209> all<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.330> way<00:03:47.450> down<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.810> left<00:03:47.989> okay

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
gear all the way down to the left okay

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.780 
gear all the way down to the left okay
so<00:03:48.650> that<00:03:48.920> first<00:03:49.130> gear<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.370> gonna<00:03:49.519> be<00:03:49.640> all<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
so that first gear is gonna be all the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.930 
so that first gear is gonna be all the
way<00:03:49.850> down<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.239> left<00:03:50.420> 250<00:03:50.989> 250<00:03:51.560> 94<00:03:51.950> second

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
way down to the left 250 250 94 second

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.190 
way down to the left 250 250 94 second
is<00:03:53.030> going<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.239> be<00:03:53.360> exactly<00:03:53.810> 4200<00:03:55.870> okay<00:03:56.870> third

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
is going to be exactly 4200 okay third

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.940 
is going to be exactly 4200 okay third
gear<00:03:57.410> is<00:03:57.560> gonna<00:03:57.709> be<00:03:58.120> 30<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.330> 90<00:04:00.880> all<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:01.970> way<00:04:02.090> up

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.780 

90<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:07.640> then<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:08.269> fifth<00:04:09.019> fourth<00:04:10.010> story<00:04:10.280> is

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
90 and then a fifth fourth story is

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.750 
90 and then a fifth fourth story is
gonna<00:04:11.000> be<00:04:11.860> 2579<00:04:12.860> so<00:04:13.310> all<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.489> way<00:04:13.549> to<00:04:13.610> the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
gonna be 2579 so all the way to the

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.569 
gonna be 2579 so all the way to the
right<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.090> then<00:04:14.980> fifth<00:04:15.980> all<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.310> way<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.459> the

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
right and then fifth all the way to the

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.340 
right and then fifth all the way to the
right<00:04:16.669> as<00:04:16.790> well<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.120> think<00:04:17.209> this<00:04:17.390> is<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.600> first

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
right as well so I think this is a first

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.530 
right as well so I think this is a first
two<00:04:18.769> second<00:04:19.250> or<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.430> second<00:04:19.970> gear<00:04:20.120> launch<00:04:20.450> I
