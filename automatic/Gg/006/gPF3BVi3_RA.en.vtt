ha

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:53.430 

oh<00:01:42.700> we<00:01:43.700> almost<00:01:43.820> keeper<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:45.970> top<00:01:46.970> table<00:01:47.210> real

I'm going to show you a rigging

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.920 
I'm going to show you a rigging
technique<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:56.590> use<00:01:56.860> for<00:01:57.720> spring<00:01:58.720> cold

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
technique that we use for spring cold

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.420 
technique that we use for spring cold
fishing<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.790> start<00:02:00.790> out<00:02:00.909> with<00:02:01.200> 12<00:02:02.200> holes<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
fishing I start out with 12 holes the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.430 
fishing I start out with 12 holes the
pole<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.820> about<00:02:03.910> two<00:02:04.330> feet<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.020> longest

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
pole is about two feet and the longest

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.500 
pole is about two feet and the longest
stretch<00:02:05.710> will<00:02:05.950> be<00:02:06.070> your<00:02:06.220> farthest<00:02:06.640> birds<00:02:07.030> then

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
stretch will be your farthest birds then

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.900 
stretch will be your farthest birds then
before<00:02:07.630> we<00:02:08.200> run<00:02:08.410> forward<00:02:08.800> each<00:02:08.890> side<00:02:09.160> four

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
before we run forward each side four

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.010 
before we run forward each side four
three<00:02:10.330> two<00:02:10.539> one

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
three two one

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.650 
three two one
so<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:11.590> 12<00:02:11.890> poles<00:02:12.250> which<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.670> around<00:02:12.850> 24<00:02:13.390> feet

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
so it's 12 poles which is around 24 feet

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.230 
so it's 12 poles which is around 24 feet
then<00:02:14.350> 10<00:02:14.650> pulls<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.220> seven<00:02:15.610> holes<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.000> five

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
then 10 pulls that seven holes and five

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.910 
then 10 pulls that seven holes and five
pulls<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.170> what<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.410> does<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.770> gives

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
pulls so what that does is that gives

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.620 
pulls so what that does is that gives
your<00:02:18.250> birds<00:02:18.520> instead<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.300> running

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
your birds instead of all running

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.690 
your birds instead of all running
perfectly<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.830> top<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.190> surface<00:02:21.550> it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
perfectly on the top of the surface it

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.310 
perfectly on the top of the surface it
kind<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.970> cants<00:02:22.630> them<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.080> little<00:02:23.110> bit

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
kind of cants them just a little bit

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.620 
kind of cants them just a little bit
where<00:02:24.160> your<00:02:24.370> farthest<00:02:24.760> bird<00:02:24.970> will<00:02:25.120> probably

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
where your farthest bird will probably

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:42.520
