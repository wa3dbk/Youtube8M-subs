00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.719 
cell by 10 and then add a little bit on
and<00:03:50.699> then<00:03:50.790> that's<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.259> range<00:03:52.259> so<00:03:52.919> it<00:03:53.280> looks

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
and then that's the range so it looks

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.270 
and then that's the range so it looks
like<00:03:53.819> his<00:03:54.239> range<00:03:54.629> could<00:03:54.959> be<00:03:55.109> around<00:03:55.349> 50<00:03:55.620> 60<00:03:56.099> k

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280

just crazy Edin Dzeko yo that is that

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.279 
just crazy Edin Dzeko yo that is that
least<00:04:50.969> this<00:04:51.240> power<00:04:51.449> look<00:04:51.659> is<00:04:51.810> pretty<00:04:52.080> insane

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
least this power look is pretty insane

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.899 
least this power look is pretty insane
at<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.620> moment<00:04:52.710> let's<00:04:53.340> have<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.490> look<00:04:53.610> at<00:04:53.729> your

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
at the moment let's have a look at your

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.019 
at the moment let's have a look at your
yeah<00:04:54.479> he's<00:04:54.719> gonna<00:04:54.870> be<00:04:55.080> worth<00:04:55.319> around<00:04:55.729> 60<00:04:56.729> and<00:04:57.000> I

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
yeah he's gonna be worth around 60 and I

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.990 
yeah he's gonna be worth around 60 and I
guess<00:04:57.300> minimum<00:04:58.050> 60<00:04:58.590> k<00:04:58.830> maximum<00:04:59.520> might<00:04:59.669> be<00:04:59.819> even

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
guess minimum 60 k maximum might be even

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.800 
guess minimum 60 k maximum might be even
like<00:05:00.360> 80<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.680> hundred<00:05:01.939> it's<00:05:02.939> pretty<00:05:03.509> crazy
