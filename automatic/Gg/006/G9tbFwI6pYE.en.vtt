that's<00:00:00.390> really<00:00:00.690> kind<00:00:00.960> of<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.159> the<00:00:02.159> crux<00:00:02.490> of

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
that's really kind of the the crux of

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.170 
that's really kind of the the crux of
the<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.510> brewer<00:00:04.520> Brewers<00:00:05.520> job<00:00:05.819> when

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
the of the brewer Brewers job when

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.820 
the of the brewer Brewers job when
they're<00:00:06.299> designing<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.810> recipe<00:00:07.319> you're

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
they're designing a recipe you're

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.870 
they're designing a recipe you're
getting<00:00:08.069> into<00:00:08.189> fermentation<00:00:09.349> my<00:00:10.349> my<00:00:11.040> take<00:00:11.700> on

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
getting into fermentation my my take on

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.610 
getting into fermentation my my take on
is<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.509> want<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.780> control<00:00:13.080> every<00:00:13.440> single

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
is that you want to control every single

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.310 
is that you want to control every single
parameter<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> possibly<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.320> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
parameter that you possibly can and so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.910 
parameter that you possibly can and so
you<00:00:16.410> can<00:00:16.770> completely<00:00:17.550> manipulate<00:00:18.920> this

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
you can completely manipulate this

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.679 
you can completely manipulate this
organism<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.609> exactly<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.359> want

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
organism to do exactly what you want

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.599 
organism to do exactly what you want
so<00:00:22.880> number<00:00:23.880> one<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.070> strength<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so number one is the the strength of the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.130 
so number one is the the strength of the
wort<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> know<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.019> you've<00:00:28.109> got

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
wort and so you know that if you've got

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.019 
wort and so you know that if you've got
a<00:00:28.289> high-strength<00:00:28.769> work<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.760> you're<00:00:29.939> going

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
a high-strength work then you're going

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
a high-strength work then you're going
to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.179> promoting<00:00:30.990> more<00:00:31.199> yeast<00:00:31.529> character<00:00:32.399> out

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
to be promoting more yeast character out

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.780 
to be promoting more yeast character out
of<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.000> beers<00:00:33.840> gonna<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.200> producing<00:00:34.920> or<00:00:35.610> some

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
of that beers gonna be producing or some

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.290 
of that beers gonna be producing or some
be<00:00:36.320> working<00:00:37.320> through<00:00:37.469> more<00:00:37.620> sugar<00:00:37.860> more

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
be working through more sugar more

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.180 
be working through more sugar more
fermentation<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:40.020> also<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.680> higher<00:00:40.920> strength

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
fermentation but also a higher strength

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.580 
fermentation but also a higher strength
beer<00:00:41.640> puts<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.840> more<00:00:42.960> osmotic<00:00:43.379> stress

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
beer puts a little more osmotic stress

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.549 
beer puts a little more osmotic stress
on<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.190> east<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> drive<00:00:45.559> a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
on the east and so it's going to drive a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.290 
on the east and so it's going to drive a
higher<00:00:47.219> ester<00:00:47.610> profile<00:00:50.149> next<00:00:51.149> thing

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
higher ester profile next thing

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.680 
higher ester profile next thing
temperature<00:00:51.920> incredibly<00:00:52.940> important<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.210> we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
temperature incredibly important and we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.959 
temperature incredibly important and we
all<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> Brewers<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.550> really

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
all know this is Brewers but really

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.610 
all know this is Brewers but really
manipulating<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.629> temperature<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.379> can

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
manipulating that temperature you can

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
manipulating that temperature you can
you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.070> come<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.430> dramatically

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you can come up with dramatically

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.770 
you can come up with dramatically
different<00:01:00.449> beers<00:01:01.309> higher<00:01:02.309> temperatures<00:01:02.910> tend

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
different beers higher temperatures tend

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.679 
different beers higher temperatures tend
to<00:01:03.870> promote<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.489> ester<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.510> beer

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to promote a little more ester a beer

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.340 
to promote a little more ester a beer
lower<00:01:07.080> temperatures<00:01:07.590> are<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:09.350> slow

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
lower temperatures are going to slow

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.380 
lower temperatures are going to slow
that<00:01:10.530> down<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.520> reduce<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that down a little bit and reduce the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.200 
that down a little bit and reduce the
ester<00:01:12.600> profile<00:01:13.070> actually<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.369> way<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.490> did<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
ester profile actually the way I did it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.670 
ester profile actually the way I did it
I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.570> touched<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.990> earlier<00:01:16.110> chip

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I think we touched on this earlier chip

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.910 
I think we touched on this earlier chip
is<00:01:17.299> with<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:18.960> beers<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
is with my with my beers that I that I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.760 
is with my with my beers that I that I
like<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.600> cleaner<00:01:21.869> profile<00:01:22.470> on

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
like to have a little cleaner profile on

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
like to have a little cleaner profile on
them<00:01:23.070> I'll<00:01:23.369> start<00:01:23.850> cold<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.390> only<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
them I'll start cold but only for a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.920 
them I'll start cold but only for a
short<00:01:25.080> while<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.890> about<00:01:26.580> 48<00:01:26.939> hours<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> I'll

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
short while for about 48 hours and I'll

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.789 
short while for about 48 hours and I'll
drive<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> temperature<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.799> during

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
drive the temperature up and so during

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.660 
drive the temperature up and so during
the<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.340> major<00:01:32.520> part<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.299> yeast

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
the the major part of of yeast

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.480 
the the major part of of yeast
propagation<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> fermentation<00:01:37.490> it's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
propagation and the fermentation it's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.300 
propagation and the fermentation it's
it's<00:01:39.200> colder<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.740> more<00:01:40.860> controlled

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
it's colder and a little more controlled

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.870 
it's colder and a little more controlled
and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:42.360> once<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.710> strain<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.280> mostly

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and then once the the strain is mostly

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.330 
and then once the the strain is mostly
up<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> terminal<00:01:46.020> population<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:47.220> we're

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
up to terminal population then we're

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.980 
up to terminal population then we're
going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> drive<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:50.390> you've<00:01:51.390> minimized

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
going to drive that and you've minimized

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.990 
going to drive that and you've minimized
the<00:01:52.470> enzyme<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.070> we're<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.369> convert<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the enzyme so we're going to convert to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.990 
the enzyme so we're going to convert to
the<00:01:54.360> esters<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.759> don't<00:01:56.909> have

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the esters and so if you don't have

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.429 
the esters and so if you don't have
those<00:01:57.180> enzymes<00:01:57.570> available<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> can

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
those enzymes available then you can

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.660 
those enzymes available then you can
drive<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> little<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.189> warmer<00:01:59.520> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
drive that a little bit warmer and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.149 
drive that a little bit warmer and
finish<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> off<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.290> come<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.860> a

to<00:04:12.570> reap<00:04:12.720> itch<00:04:12.900> them<00:04:13.140> they<00:04:13.260> reap<00:04:13.410> itch<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:13.739> the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
to reap itch them they reap itch on the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.470 
to reap itch them they reap itch on the
entire<00:04:14.130> cake<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.489> yeast<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.000> when<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.150> do<00:04:15.300> that

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
entire cake a yeast and when you do that

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.750 
entire cake a yeast and when you do that
you're<00:04:16.080> pitching<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.560> ton<00:04:16.979> of<00:04:17.010> yeast<00:04:17.370> into<00:04:17.609> a

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
you're pitching a ton of yeast into a

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.000 
you're pitching a ton of yeast into a
very<00:04:18.030> small<00:04:18.330> amount<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.660> beer<00:04:18.930> if<00:04:19.680> that's<00:04:19.890> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
very small amount of beer if that's the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.190 
very small amount of beer if that's the
case<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.910> yeast<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.239> not<00:04:21.299> going<00:04:21.780> to

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
case that yeast is not going to

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.290 
case that yeast is not going to
very<00:04:22.410> much<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:23.070> what<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.670> want<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:23.910> do<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.210> you

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
very much and what you want to do is you

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.810 
very much and what you want to do is you
want<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.480> drive<00:04:24.750> growth<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:26.040> you're

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
want to drive growth and so you're

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.190 
want to drive growth and so you're
probably<00:04:27.000> gonna<00:04:27.180> want<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.480> pitch<00:04:27.660> on<00:04:27.930> the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
probably gonna want to pitch on the

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.950 
probably gonna want to pitch on the
lower<00:04:28.380> side<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:30.120> guess<00:04:30.510> I'll<00:04:30.630> just<00:04:30.660> kind<00:04:30.930> of

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
lower side and I guess I'll just kind of

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.630 
lower side and I guess I'll just kind of
go<00:04:31.080> through<00:04:31.380> how<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:31.890> would<00:04:32.190> set<00:04:32.400> up<00:04:32.430> this

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
go through how I would set up this

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.580 
go through how I would set up this
experiment<00:04:33.120> if<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.420> was<00:04:33.570> going<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.720> do<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.050> and

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
experiment if I was going to do this and

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.210 
experiment if I was going to do this and
I've<00:04:34.710> thought<00:04:34.860> about<00:04:34.920> this<00:04:35.190> before<00:04:36.290> I<00:04:37.290> pitch

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
I've thought about this before I pitch

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.670 
I've thought about this before I pitch
relatively<00:04:38.670> low<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.500> try<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:41.510> try<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.540> come<00:04:43.530> up

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
relatively low and try to try to come up

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.570 
relatively low and try to try to come up
with<00:04:44.330> basically<00:04:45.330> maximize<00:04:45.960> growth<00:04:46.460> make<00:04:47.460> sure

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
with basically maximize growth make sure

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.850 
with basically maximize growth make sure
you<00:04:47.700> have<00:04:47.820> sufficient<00:04:48.780> oxygen<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:51.860> which

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
you have sufficient oxygen and and which

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.130 
you have sufficient oxygen and and which
is<00:04:53.010> probably<00:04:53.400> about<00:04:54.060> six<00:04:54.510> million<00:04:54.690> cells<00:04:54.990> per

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
is probably about six million cells per

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.360 
is probably about six million cells per
mil<00:04:55.290> which<00:04:55.410> is<00:04:55.530> actually<00:04:55.830> about<00:04:55.950> what<00:04:56.130> our

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
mil which is actually about what our

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.860 
mil which is actually about what our
what<00:04:56.580> our<00:04:56.640> package<00:04:57.060> does<00:04:57.300> you're<00:04:57.690> going<00:04:57.780> to

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
what our package does you're going to

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.570 
what our package does you're going to
get<00:04:57.990> about<00:04:58.110> three<00:04:58.460> three<00:04:59.460> to

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
get about three three to

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.760 
get about three three to
three-and-a-half<00:04:59.880> doublings<00:05:00.450> in<00:05:00.570> there

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
three-and-a-half doublings in there

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.370 
three-and-a-half doublings in there
you're<00:05:01.770> not<00:05:01.890> gonna<00:05:02.010> get<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.190> lot<00:05:02.370> more<00:05:03.230> let<00:05:04.230> that

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
you're not gonna get a lot more let that

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.750 
you're not gonna get a lot more let that
settle<00:05:04.680> out<00:05:06.410> harvest<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.500> yeast<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:08.070> then

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
settle out harvest the yeast and then

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.430 
settle out harvest the yeast and then
pitch<00:05:09.240> about<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.540> hundred<00:05:09.900> mils<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.290> that

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
pitch about a hundred mils of that

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.370 
pitch about a hundred mils of that
slurry<00:05:10.800> into<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.280> next<00:05:11.550> batch<00:05:12.290> something<00:05:13.290> you

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
slurry into the next batch something you

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.110 
slurry into the next batch something you
could<00:05:13.500> also<00:05:13.650> do<00:05:13.920> is<00:05:14.250> maybe<00:05:14.580> hitting<00:05:14.910> it<00:05:15.030> with

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
could also do is maybe hitting it with

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.760 
could also do is maybe hitting it with
intermittent<00:05:15.540> oxygen<00:05:15.990> oxygen<00:05:16.440> is<00:05:16.530> gonna

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
intermittent oxygen oxygen is gonna

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.610 
intermittent oxygen oxygen is gonna
allow<00:05:17.010> it<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:17.810> grow<00:05:18.810> more<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.170> continue<00:05:19.320> the

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
allow it to grow more and continue the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.040 
allow it to grow more and continue the
growth<00:05:19.770> process<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.550> so<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:20.970> mean<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.840> could

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
growth process and so I mean you could

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.050 
growth process and so I mean you could
you<00:05:22.380> could<00:05:22.530> mess<00:05:22.650> around<00:05:22.800> this<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.370> take<00:05:23.910> it

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
you could mess around this and take it

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.600 
you could mess around this and take it
out<00:05:24.240> a<00:05:24.630> lot<00:05:25.050> of<00:05:25.140> generations<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.040> see<00:05:26.430> if<00:05:26.520> you

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
out a lot of generations and see if you

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.050 
out a lot of generations and see if you
could<00:05:26.760> change<00:05:27.000> it<00:05:28.340> some<00:05:29.340> of<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.520> data<00:05:29.730> that

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
could change it some of the data that

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.670 
could change it some of the data that
was<00:05:30.360> done<00:05:30.570> at<00:05:30.720> Bridgeport<00:05:30.960> brewing<00:05:31.440> out<00:05:31.560> in

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
was done at Bridgeport brewing out in

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.040 
was done at Bridgeport brewing out in
Portland<00:05:32.750> or<00:05:33.750> some<00:05:34.290> some<00:05:34.590> testing<00:05:35.720> years<00:05:36.720> ago

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
Portland or some some testing years ago

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.010 
Portland or some some testing years ago
showed<00:05:37.800> that<00:05:38.010> after<00:05:38.660> something<00:05:39.660> like<00:05:39.840> a

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
showed that after something like a

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.870 
showed that after something like a
hundred<00:05:40.410> generations<00:05:40.560> of<00:05:41.160> yeast<00:05:41.370> or<00:05:41.640> was<00:05:41.730> it

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
hundred generations of yeast or was it

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.610 
hundred generations of yeast or was it
was<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.060> very<00:05:42.180> high<00:05:42.360> number<00:05:42.870> of<00:05:42.990> generations<00:05:43.350> of

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
was a very high number of generations of

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.910 
was a very high number of generations of
yeast<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.900> fingerprints<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.470> the

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
yeast the fingerprints of the of the

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.650 
yeast the fingerprints of the of the
original<00:05:47.280> culture<00:05:47.700> and<00:05:47.880> the<00:05:48.000> final<00:05:48.300> culture

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
original culture and the final culture

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.900 
original culture and the final culture
were<00:05:48.930> identical<00:05:49.920> and<00:05:50.280> so<00:05:50.400> they<00:05:50.520> really<00:05:50.730> didn't

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
were identical and so they really didn't

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.180 
were identical and so they really didn't
see<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.090> lot<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.300> genetic<00:05:51.630> shift<00:05:51.780> in<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:52.190> but

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
see a lot of genetic shift in that but

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.500 
see a lot of genetic shift in that but
at<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.400> same<00:05:53.610> time<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.940> could<00:05:54.120> be<00:05:54.240> a

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
at the same time that could be a

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.970 
at the same time that could be a
function<00:05:54.900> of<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.530> strain<00:05:55.740> that<00:05:55.890> was

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
function of the the strain that was

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.480 
function of the the strain that was
being<00:05:56.130> used<00:05:56.220> at<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.610> time<00:05:56.820> so<00:05:58.160> you<00:05:59.160> know<00:05:59.250> I

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
being used at the time so you know I

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.260 
being used at the time so you know I
don't<00:06:00.470> you<00:06:01.470> know<00:06:01.560> ultimately<00:06:01.770> I<00:06:02.340> don't<00:06:03.060> think

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
don't you know ultimately I don't think

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.080 
don't you know ultimately I don't think
you're<00:06:03.360> gonna<00:06:03.450> see<00:06:03.630> a<00:06:03.660> lot<00:06:03.840> of<00:06:03.870> mutation<00:06:04.290> but

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090
