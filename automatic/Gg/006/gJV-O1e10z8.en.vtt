I've ever encountered written about

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.470 
I've ever encountered written about

alcohol has come to symbolize and

alcohol has come to symbolize and
express<00:02:46.840> everything<00:02:47.349> that<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.829> find<00:02:48.639> beautiful

this<00:02:52.000> drink<00:02:52.299> embodies<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.169> want<00:02:53.889> to<00:02:53.919> say

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
this drink embodies it I want to say

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.189 
this drink embodies it I want to say
just<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.549> couple<00:02:54.969> of<00:02:55.209> things<00:02:55.449> about<00:02:55.689> the

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:56.199 
just a couple of things about the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.629 
just a couple of things about the
preparation<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.829> drink<00:02:57.129> before<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.459> get

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
preparation of drink before I get

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.599 
preparation of drink before I get
started<00:02:57.849> one<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.349> traditional<00:03:00.010> silver

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
started one is the traditional silver

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.319 
started one is the traditional silver
cup<00:03:01.079> metal<00:03:02.079> acts<00:03:02.230> as<00:03:02.409> a<00:03:02.439> conductor<00:03:02.829> glass<00:03:03.819> acts

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
cup metal acts as a conductor glass acts

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.709 
cup metal acts as a conductor glass acts
as<00:03:04.540> an<00:03:04.629> insulator<00:03:05.139> so<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.730> cooling<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.359> drink

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
as an insulator so the cooling of drink

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.259 
as an insulator so the cooling of drink
is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.139> physics<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.680> heat<00:03:08.859> transfer<00:03:09.370> when<00:03:10.090> you

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
is the physics of heat transfer when you

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.890 
is the physics of heat transfer when you
have<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.629> metal<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:11.109> conducts<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.280> heat<00:03:13.269> in

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
have the metal it conducts the heat in

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.979 
have the metal it conducts the heat in
the<00:03:14.139> spirit<00:03:14.790> through<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> metal<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
the spirit through the metal to the

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.809 
the spirit through the metal to the
exterior<00:03:17.409> of<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.620> glass<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.069> causes

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
exterior of the glass and causes

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.969 
exterior of the glass and causes
condensation<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.810> actually<00:03:20.290> creates<00:03:20.739> a

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
condensation and actually creates a

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.969 
condensation and actually creates a
frost<00:03:21.579> on<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:22.000> exterior<00:03:22.299> of<00:03:22.479> the<00:03:22.540> cup<00:03:22.979> making

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979 
frost on the exterior of the cup making

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.909 
frost on the exterior of the cup making
it<00:03:24.220> colder<00:03:24.729> and<00:03:25.569> therefore<00:03:26.379> the<00:03:26.500> drink<00:03:26.769> more

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
it colder and therefore the drink more

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.550 
it colder and therefore the drink more
pleasant<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.400> more<00:03:28.000> pleasant<00:03:28.419> to<00:03:28.509> drink<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
pleasant to more pleasant to drink the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.229 
pleasant to more pleasant to drink the
second<00:03:29.919> thing<00:03:30.099> is<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> actual<00:03:30.669> use<00:03:30.819> of<00:03:30.849> mint

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
second thing is the actual use of mint

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.099 
second thing is the actual use of mint
and<00:03:31.389> you'll<00:03:31.689> see<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.109> with<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.349> mojito<00:03:32.970> also

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
and you'll see this with the mojito also

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.869 
and you'll see this with the mojito also
bartenders<00:03:35.109> believe<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.829> by<00:03:36.069> we've<00:03:36.729> all

but one of the things that you have to

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.670 
but one of the things that you have to
learn<00:03:55.659> about<00:03:55.930> men<00:03:56.199> is<00:03:56.349> that<00:03:56.379> it's<00:03:56.620> very

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
learn about men is that it's very

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.979 
learn about men is that it's very
delicate<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.909> doesn't<00:03:58.329> require<00:03:58.569> that<00:03:58.689> you
