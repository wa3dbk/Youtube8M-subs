touching two of the minds so we gotta
watch<00:01:56.780> out<00:01:56.960> for<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.890> count<00:01:58.130> corners

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
watch out for that and the count corners

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.370 
watch out for that and the count corners
count<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.570> this<00:02:00.200> tile<00:02:00.829> right<00:02:01.009> here<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:01.789> yeah

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
count of this tile right here so yeah

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.719 
count of this tile right here so yeah
I'm<00:02:03.380> probably<00:02:03.740> going<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.039> flag<00:02:04.219> this<00:02:04.369> because

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
I'm probably going to flag this because

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.420 
I'm probably going to flag this because
there's<00:02:04.939> a<00:02:05.030> bomb<00:02:05.270> right<00:02:05.509> there<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:06.430> I'm

right-click on the tile and you'll

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.140 
right-click on the tile and you'll
create<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.830> flag<00:02:38.040> that's<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.910> tell<00:02:39.120> you

am quite confused I don't know what to
do<00:02:54.570> let's<00:02:55.020> try<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:55.560> that's<00:02:56.280> right<00:02:56.750> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
do let's try this one that's right you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.470 
do let's try this one that's right you
see<00:02:57.930> these<00:02:58.740> are<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.010> mines<00:02:59.220> right<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.910> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
see these are the mines right here and I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.590 
see these are the mines right here and I
was<00:03:00.600> correct<00:03:00.930> about<00:03:01.850> something<00:03:02.850> i<00:03:03.090> don't<00:03:03.540> know

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
was correct about something i don't know

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.420 
was correct about something i don't know
i<00:03:03.660> didn't<00:03:04.080> get<00:03:04.200> time<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.410> see<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.770> now<00:03:05.130> i've

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
i didn't get time to see it now i've

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.820 
i didn't get time to see it now i've
created<00:03:05.760> another<00:03:06.330> mind<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.990> let's<00:03:07.410> see<00:03:07.650> where

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
created another mind and let's see where

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.920 
created another mind and let's see where
we<00:03:07.950> go<00:03:07.980> off<00:03:08.280> now<00:03:08.610> we<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:09.000> second<00:03:09.480> feature<00:03:09.630> to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
we go off now we have second feature to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.830 
we go off now we have second feature to
tried<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.160> mine<00:03:11.430> detector<00:03:12.030> now<00:03:12.510> what

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
tried it's the mine detector now what

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.120 
tried it's the mine detector now what
the<00:03:12.960> mine<00:03:13.140> detector<00:03:13.590> does<00:03:13.770> is<00:03:13.950> basically

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
the mine detector does is basically

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.040 
the mine detector does is basically
detects<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.940> mind<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.840> probably

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
detects the mind and you probably

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.230 
detects the mind and you probably
guessed<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.440> already<00:03:16.850> let's<00:03:17.850> start<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
guessed that already let's start the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.100 
guessed that already let's start the
game<00:03:18.450> off<00:03:18.630> because<00:03:18.990> oh<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.860> god<00:03:20.070> oh<00:03:20.959> that<00:03:21.959> was

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
game off because oh my god oh that was

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.080 
game off because oh my god oh that was
really<00:03:22.470> bad<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:23.100> was<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> really<00:03:23.489> bad<00:03:23.730> start

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
really bad that was a really bad start

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.229 
really bad that was a really bad start
off<00:03:24.270> let<00:03:24.870> me<00:03:24.900> grab<00:03:25.200> another<00:03:25.530> one<00:03:25.790> okay<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:26.850> I've

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
off let me grab another one okay so I've

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.760 
off let me grab another one okay so I've
grabbed<00:03:27.540> under<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.900> field<00:03:28.080> generator<00:03:28.590> and

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
grabbed under the field generator and

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.040 
grabbed under the field generator and
let's<00:03:29.100> put<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.400> down<00:03:29.610> right<00:03:29.640> here<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.150> we'll

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
let's put it down right here and we'll

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.860 
let's put it down right here and we'll
try<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.380> mine<00:03:31.680> detector<00:03:32.160> again<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.840> one<00:03:33.840> of

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
try the mine detector again and one of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.300 
try the mine detector again and one of
the<00:03:34.020> things<00:03:34.080> about<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.280> can

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
the things about this is that you can

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.500 
the things about this is that you can
only<00:03:35.580> use<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.420> one<00:03:36.630> time<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.580> yeah<00:03:38.580> use<00:03:39.270> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
only use it one time so yeah use it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.870 
only use it one time so yeah use it
efficiently<00:03:39.959> now<00:03:40.920> first<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.520> all<00:03:41.610> I'm<00:03:41.760> gonna

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
efficiently now first of all I'm gonna

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.090 
efficiently now first of all I'm gonna
start<00:03:42.239> off<00:03:42.420> by<00:03:42.750> starting<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.470> game<00:03:43.800> and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
start off by starting the game and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.880 
start off by starting the game and
without<00:03:44.760> hitting<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> mind<00:03:45.390> now<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:46.140> know<00:03:46.170> that

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
without hitting the mind now I know that

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.710 
without hitting the mind now I know that
there's<00:03:47.070> gonna<00:03:47.220> be<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.459> mine<00:03:47.820> right<00:03:48.060> here<00:03:48.090> so

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
there's gonna be a mine right here so

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.150 
there's gonna be a mine right here so
I'm<00:03:48.810> gonna<00:03:48.900> test<00:03:49.170> out<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.440> mine<00:03:49.650> detector

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
I'm gonna test out the mine detector

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.770 
I'm gonna test out the mine detector
