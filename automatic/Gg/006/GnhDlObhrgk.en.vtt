00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello my name is Andrei and this is already 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.240
 The fourth issue of the rubric is useful today. 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
 we will understand the perennial dispute 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 which lasts for more than a decade and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.269
 divided people by almost two 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.080
 warring camps ready to gnaw 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.350
 each other's throats 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 what's better behind or front-wheel drive 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.310
 before almost all cars had a drive 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 only on the rear axle you need their 70s 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.430
 began to crowd out front wheel drive and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.570
 Now it is cars with front 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.560
 leading are the most 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.029
 common 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.939
 but rear-wheel drive does not lose relevance 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.040
 and has its army of fans and let's start with 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.870
 front-wheel drive the most important plus is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.640
 lower cost so almost all 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.800
 massively the car has 3 1 front 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.570
 Judge the wheels for example in such 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.290
 the car does not have a driveshaft and crankcase 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.270
 rear axle 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.100
 and the differential box is located in 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.989
 one casing and requires less detail when 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.700
 producing less weight too sad 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.680
 car gets easier it improves 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 acceleration and deceleration decreases consumption 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.640
 fuel and no cardonata is needed 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.350
 central given in the floor so the place 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 in the cabin becomes more and as 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.559
 move and literally pressure on the front 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.940
 wheels in the car goes up 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.590
 cross dirt and with them 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.570
 improved course stability on 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.909
 wet fool 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.190
 but front-wheel drive cars have their own 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.720
 cons first suffer distribution 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.000
 weights almost all major aggregates 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.220
 is in front but the tail is lightened 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.080
 healthy rear tire grip turns on 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.690
 and on slippery surfaces can 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.910
 spin the elay when you press the pedal 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.800
 gas to the steering wheel transmitted reactive force 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.780
 from the hands of the finite will not break free on its 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.970
 life is also trying to live in the cabin 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.710
 it feels good vibration engine 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.720
 due to its technical features 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.310
 front-wheel drive machines have more 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.990
 turning radius and accordingly 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.220
 suffer from understeer 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.899
 front period is ideal for 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.300
 subcompact sedans from the Greeks and 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.140
 minivans city cork sphere svald 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.149
 this in verse 7 and the front nose is a plus 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.070
 and rear-wheel drive weight distribution 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.500
 tends to ideally 50 to 50 what 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.910
 improves balance and vibration control 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.840
 engine and gearbox almost no 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.940
 transferred to the body 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.979
 this increases cabin comfort when 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.080
 abruptly start without being redistributed to 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.149
 rear axle and drive wheels get 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.560
 better rear car health grip 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.539
 the drive is easier to send us about the lyre 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.990
 it is intuitively simpler for his nose and control 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.220
 about cornering more driving 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.410
 main minus rear-wheel drive in volume 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.390
 that production costs more than parts 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.100
 that can break more into place 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.810
 in the cabin steals the central tunnel in 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.860
 which the propeller shaft hid for 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.230
 cars with a sporty character 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.180
 rear-wheel drive would be preferable then 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.940
 the same can be said about cars where in 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.080
 priority is the comfort of your passenger 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.480
 weigh all the pros and cons as 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.260
 front and rear wheel drive 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.150
 analyze for what purposes you need 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.520
 car and in what conditions will it be 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.310
 exploited come to the conclusion that 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.380
 better all the same all- wheel drive it was 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.890
 usefulness for the site high n. 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.890
 good luck
