asking you to pick out single bass notes

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.560 
asking you to pick out single bass notes
which<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.660> what<00:01:55.930> I'm<00:01:56.050> asking<00:01:56.230> you<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.560> do<00:01:56.800> here

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
which is what I'm asking you to do here

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.200 
which is what I'm asking you to do here
so<00:01:59.110> if<00:01:59.770> you<00:02:00.040> feel<00:02:00.250> comfortable<00:02:00.430> anchoring

so if you feel comfortable anchoring

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.399 
so if you feel comfortable anchoring
here<00:02:01.600> do<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.440> don't<00:02:02.770> worry<00:02:02.950> about<00:02:03.160> it<00:02:03.340> okay

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
here do that don't worry about it okay

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.090 
here do that don't worry about it okay
so<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.460> idea<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.000> basic<00:02:07.420> idea<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:08.100> hitting

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
so the idea the basic idea is hitting

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.059 
so the idea the basic idea is hitting
our<00:02:09.190> bass<00:02:09.429> notes<00:02:09.759> twice<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.740> then<00:02:11.740> doing<00:02:11.890> a

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
our bass notes twice and then doing a

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.130 
our bass notes twice and then doing a
down<00:02:12.280> stroke<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.060> let's<00:02:13.240> just<00:02:13.420> do<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.720> much

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
down stroke so let's just do that much

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:35.420 
down stroke so let's just do that much
together<00:02:14.380> I'm<00:02:15.190> kind<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.700> slow<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.209> we<00:02:16.330> do<00:02:16.510> one

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.550 

great<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:39.540> we're<00:02:40.540> going<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.720> add<00:02:40.900> an<00:02:41.080> upstroke

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
great so we're going to add an upstroke

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.460 
great so we're going to add an upstroke
now<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.269> where<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.690> kind<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.319> get

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
now and this is where it kind of get

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.680 
now and this is where it kind of get
into<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:44.860> little<00:02:45.160> bit<00:02:45.370> relaxed<00:02:45.910> swingy<00:02:46.239> hip

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
into that little bit relaxed swingy hip

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.650 
into that little bit relaxed swingy hip
hoppy<00:02:46.959> kind<00:02:47.319> of<00:02:47.410> feel

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.899 
ultimately what makes a progression
groove<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:25.120> your<00:03:25.989> feel<00:03:26.349> it's<00:03:27.010> not<00:03:27.159> exactly

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
groove is is your feel it's not exactly

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.880 
groove is is your feel it's not exactly
when<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.540> change<00:03:28.870> chords<00:03:29.409> and<00:03:29.560> it's<00:03:29.709> not

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
when you change chords and it's not

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.920 
when you change chords and it's not
exactly<00:03:30.310> getting<00:03:30.670> every<00:03:31.060> single<00:03:31.090> note<00:03:31.690> to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
exactly getting every single note to

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.130 
exactly getting every single note to
sound<00:03:32.319> clearly<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.489> what<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.209> find<00:03:34.629> I<00:03:34.720> do<00:03:34.780> often

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
sound clearly and what I find I do often

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.410 
sound clearly and what I find I do often
in<00:03:35.530> this<00:03:35.980> chord<00:03:36.250> progression<00:03:36.280> at<00:03:36.790> least<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.239> I

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
in this chord progression at least is I

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.220 
in this chord progression at least is I
change<00:03:38.410> my<00:03:38.650> chord<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.250> little<00:03:39.609> bit<00:03:39.870> before<00:03:40.870> I

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
change my chord a little bit before I

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.910 
change my chord a little bit before I
might<00:03:42.220> want<00:03:42.879> to<00:03:42.970> just<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:43.629> can<00:03:43.810> really<00:03:44.650> land

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
might want to just so I can really land

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.770 
might want to just so I can really land
the<00:03:45.250> next<00:03:45.489> chord<00:03:45.790> on<00:03:45.970> one<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.510> what<00:03:46.629> that

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
the next chord on one and what that

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.069 
the next chord on one and what that
means<00:03:47.079> is<00:03:47.319> on<00:03:47.500> my<00:03:48.160> upbeat<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.329> pattern

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
means is on my upbeat of this pattern

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.949 
means is on my upbeat of this pattern
that<00:03:50.109> I<00:03:50.260> showed<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.739> one<00:03:50.980> two<00:03:51.519> three<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.540> four

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
that I showed you one two three and four

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.940 
that I showed you one two three and four
and<00:03:53.430> I'm<00:03:54.430> not<00:03:54.670> exactly<00:03:55.090> playing<00:03:55.540> I'm<00:03:56.079> kind<00:03:56.859> of

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
and I'm not exactly playing I'm kind of

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.430 
and I'm not exactly playing I'm kind of
in<00:03:57.069> transition<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:58.180> if<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.359> watch<00:03:58.599> me<00:03:58.930> my<00:03:59.200> left

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
in transition so if you watch me my left

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.809 
in transition so if you watch me my left
hand<00:03:59.739> one<00:04:00.579> two<00:04:01.209> three<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.230> four<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.950> one<00:04:03.010> two

three and four and one two three and

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.520 
three and four and one two three and
four<00:04:08.379> and<00:04:08.590> one

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
four and one

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:23.080 
four and one
2<00:04:09.800> 3<00:04:10.550> 4<00:04:13.150> mm<00:04:15.010> 3<00:04:16.010> &amp;<00:04:16.370> 4<00:04:16.700> &amp;<00:04:17.030> 1<00:04:17.060> 2<00:04:17.720> 3<00:04:18.410> &amp;<00:04:19.160> 4<00:04:19.220> &amp;<00:04:19.760> 1<00:04:19.790> 2<00:04:21.490> okay<00:04:22.490> so

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
2 3 4 mm 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 2 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 2 okay so

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.260 
2 3 4 mm 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 2 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 2 okay so
as<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.870> might<00:04:24.320> want<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.620> just

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
as you might want to just

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.090 
as you might want to just
otherwise<00:04:26.270> it's<00:04:26.710> it's<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.800> little<00:04:28.010> bit

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
otherwise it's it's a little bit

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.800 
otherwise it's it's a little bit
difficult<00:04:28.280> for<00:04:28.669> me

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
difficult for me

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.680 
difficult for me
to<00:04:31.810> make<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.170> there<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:33.460> because<00:04:34.240> we're

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
to make it there on one because we're

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.720 
to make it there on one because we're
adding<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.200> up<00:04:35.410> beat<00:04:35.770> on<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.010> very<00:04:36.310> last

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
adding this up beat on the very last

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.170 
adding this up beat on the very last
beat<00:04:37.150> of<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.360> measure<00:04:37.590> okay<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:38.650> try<00:04:39.520> that<00:04:39.580> out

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
beat of the measure okay so try that out

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.210 
beat of the measure okay so try that out
you<00:04:40.690> don't<00:04:40.870> want<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.170> sound<00:04:41.350> totally<00:04:41.710> messy

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
you don't want it to sound totally messy

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.950 
you don't want it to sound totally messy
and<00:04:42.490> like<00:04:42.670> you're<00:04:42.850> leaving<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.450> cord<00:04:43.690> way<00:04:43.900> too

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
and like you're leaving the cord way too

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.050 
and like you're leaving the cord way too
soon<00:04:44.380> but<00:04:44.590> if<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:44.800> watch<00:04:45.310> how<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.550> did<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:45.970> and

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
soon but if you watch how I did it and

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.790 
soon but if you watch how I did it and
follow<00:04:46.300> along<00:04:46.480> I<00:04:46.750> think<00:04:46.990> you'll<00:04:47.140> get<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.500> just

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
follow along I think you'll get it just

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.950 
follow along I think you'll get it just
right
