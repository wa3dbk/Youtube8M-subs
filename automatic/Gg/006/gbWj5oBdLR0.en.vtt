00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.880
 hello girls are going to show you, but the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.619
 modelinho decorated day 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.380
 I started by still riding my client who 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.840
 This planet enamel beats on the other 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.489
 I spent a layer of grace and one of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.250
 that I love using the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 Eskimo from vult receive a little french 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.960
 I would not go to my client with the same motto 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.340
 blue and apply the matte base to make 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 decoration we will use fabric paint 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.850
 white cobalt blue and also green 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850
 pistachio 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.199
 Let's go to the decoration for 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.030
 start I'll use the fine brush of 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.629
 very long bristles 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.949
 I bought fragrance brand marco 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.989
 boni 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.420
 I'll get the white paint and I'll do it. 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.229
 a fine line to rent francesinha 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.090
 work with that thought a little 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.250
 hard at first but then we 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.729
 takes skill and does a lot of work 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.490
 beautiful and very delicate customer name 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.700
 with a very light hand. 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.759
 look a very beautiful detail do the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 even on the other hand you can notice that there 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.090
 I gave a little shake of francesinha 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.189
 This detail is also very cool when 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.290
 we end up doing what he does 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.740
 corrects and leaves the perfect francesinha 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.400
 look just ready 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.070
 now we go to the second part 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.460
 I'm going to use the gray cable brush 000 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.380
 I'm fine and I'm going to make a babadinho rent 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.210
 to that white line we made first 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.869
 Okay, blue side of the nail, then let's do it. 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:59.250
 a slight swirl of rings as well 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.909
 take a thin line across the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.909
 this line 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.709
 do it slowly with a little paint 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.709
 in the brush to not get too coarse 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.730
 now between every ring of this I go 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.080
 make a little ball 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.940
 You'll see if you want. 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.459
 I use the toothpick but I prefer it already 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.430
 do with the brush and saves time is more 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.540
 easy to be like this for us 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.540
 even in the other hand 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.260
 Lindomar is very big in the 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.260
 another look to do the same size 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.090
 I finished now, I'm going to put the ball 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.870
 ready our badinho model now 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.459
 Let's go to the double charge button I'm just going 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.790
 use this double load floor that I 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.370
 quite like numbers and square numbers 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.340
 01 I think of flowery caboose 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.560
 I'll use half in cobalt blue ink 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.060
 half in white ink with white 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.700
 turned upwards we'll make a 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.459
 one upside-down movement does not 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.760
 I was the client now doing a lot of 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.130
 head up and so reform button 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.340
 It's very simple, double charge button. 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.390
 come again that will look 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.250
 new in heaven and let's start making the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.620
 head down the first well 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.140
 Little one is not rude either 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.030
 and the eye down now had seam there 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.910
 on top and makes a normal 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.820
 the model of the button is ready now 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.090
 I'll go back with the fine brush number 1000 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:59.900
 I'll use pistachio green paint to make 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.900
 the sheets I make there two sheets 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.310
 the cruise line was good causes 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.340
 You already know but I do a movement of 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:21.010
 drop is very easy and looks good 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.440
 Dinho looks very pretty is ready 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.750
 now I'll come back with the white paint 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.130
 make some more detail 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.500
 Sorry, I'll use the ink 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.880
 first to make the contour of these 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.880
 leaves in forgotten 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.360
 Come on, people, and do it. 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.960
 outline the sheets on one side only 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.960
 leaf 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:52.320
 who was that up side but a dash 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.150
 very fine and delicate and the tiny 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.030
 some girls asked me I'm going 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.860
 do an arabesque some girls me 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.960
 asked why I would rather use the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.570
 ranking and not the black ink to do 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.729
 the outlines look at my zone here he is 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.789
 more liquid then it gives the finish 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.380
 more delicate pieces get thinner 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.400
 but to use the ink we need 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.680
 who loved very light and also need 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.510
 use matte base for the design is 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.760
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.200
 It takes a long time to check with the 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.889
 Blurs the time I'm going to spend the extra 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.190
 brightness 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.650
 That's how it was now, yes, I 'll see 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.090
 the white paint with the same brush Valley 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.720
 in the water, quickly 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.360
 today may not have a toothpick the toothpick is 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.750
 It's easier for you guys to have me at home there. 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.889
 I'll only have three balls there to give only one 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.889
 detail on this button 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.360

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.690
