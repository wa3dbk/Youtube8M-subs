00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
this is one of those LED spotlight chips

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.670 
this is one of those LED spotlight chips
and<00:00:07.460> if<00:00:07.700> you<00:00:07.790> watched<00:00:07.970> my<00:00:08.059> other<00:00:08.270> video<00:00:08.690> on<00:00:08.750> it

and if you watched my other video on it

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.170 
and if you watched my other video on it
I<00:00:09.710> mentioned<00:00:10.370> that<00:00:10.400> it<00:00:10.520> started<00:00:10.850> overheating

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
I mentioned that it started overheating

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.839 
I mentioned that it started overheating
and<00:00:11.750> needs<00:00:12.590> a<00:00:12.710> bigger<00:00:12.890> heatsink<00:00:13.400> and<00:00:13.490> all<00:00:13.640> that

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
and needs a bigger heatsink and all that

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.460 
and needs a bigger heatsink and all that
and<00:00:14.420> what<00:00:14.570> I<00:00:14.599> want<00:00:14.870> is<00:00:14.990> I<00:00:15.080> didn't<00:00:15.320> want<00:00:15.349> a

and what I want is I didn't want a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.290 
and what I want is I didn't want a
monster<00:00:15.950> heatsink<00:00:16.460> on<00:00:16.580> this<00:00:16.790> I<00:00:16.939> wanted<00:00:17.180> it<00:00:17.240> to

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
monster heatsink on this I wanted it to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.790 
monster heatsink on this I wanted it to
be<00:00:17.390> a<00:00:17.420> small<00:00:17.779> package<00:00:18.290> and<00:00:18.410> as<00:00:18.529> you<00:00:18.619> can<00:00:18.740> see

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
be a small package and as you can see

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.560 
be a small package and as you can see
it's<00:00:19.160> not<00:00:19.340> very<00:00:19.400> big<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.849> minute<00:00:20.180> cover<00:00:20.390> with

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
it's not very big a minute cover with

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.390 
it's not very big a minute cover with
the<00:00:20.660> end<00:00:20.750> of<00:00:20.810> my<00:00:20.869> finger<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.919> I<00:00:21.950> wanted<00:00:22.189> a<00:00:22.279> small

the end of my finger so I wanted a small

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.100 
the end of my finger so I wanted a small
package<00:00:23.000> out<00:00:23.150> of<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:23.360> isn't<00:00:23.570> what<00:00:23.660> a<00:00:23.689> monster

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
package out of it isn't what a monster

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.330 
package out of it isn't what a monster
heatsink<00:00:24.560> I<00:00:24.619> don't<00:00:24.739> want<00:00:24.860> to<00:00:24.919> take<00:00:25.070> a<00:00:25.099> lot<00:00:25.250> of

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
heatsink I don't want to take a lot of

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.580 
heatsink I don't want to take a lot of
space<00:00:25.720> and<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:26.899> want<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.110> be<00:00:27.169> able<00:00:27.259> running

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
space and I want to be able running

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.440 
space and I want to be able running
continuously<00:00:28.189> so<00:00:28.960> what<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:29.989> came<00:00:30.140> up<00:00:30.410> with<00:00:30.619> was

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
continuously so what I came up with was

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.120 
continuously so what I came up with was
putting<00:00:32.450> it<00:00:32.509> on<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.750> back<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:33.140> this<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:33.530> fan

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
putting it on the back of this this fan

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.000 
putting it on the back of this this fan
this<00:00:34.399> is<00:00:34.520> a<00:00:35.020> processor<00:00:36.020> cooling<00:00:36.440> fan<00:00:36.710> for<00:00:36.980> a

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
this is a processor cooling fan for a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.110 
this is a processor cooling fan for a
laptop<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.470> kind<00:00:39.470> of<00:00:39.530> aluminum<00:00:39.980> back<00:00:40.640> on<00:00:40.970> it

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
laptop and kind of aluminum back on it

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.970 
laptop and kind of aluminum back on it
so<00:00:41.360> I<00:00:41.390> bolted<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:41.990> the<00:00:42.170> back<00:00:42.320> use<00:00:42.650> some<00:00:42.830> heat

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
so I bolted it to the back use some heat

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.930 
so I bolted it to the back use some heat
sink<00:00:43.310> compound<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.740> I<00:00:45.740> was<00:00:46.100> hoping<00:00:46.430> that<00:00:46.490> the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
sink compound and I was hoping that the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.940 
sink compound and I was hoping that the
heat<00:00:47.390> would<00:00:47.690> go<00:00:47.840> through<00:00:48.200> into<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.710> aluminum

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
heat would go through into the aluminum

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.800 
heat would go through into the aluminum
and<00:00:49.370> then<00:00:49.880> the<00:00:49.970> fan<00:00:50.180> would<00:00:50.390> carry<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.720> heat

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
and then the fan would carry the heat

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.220 
and then the fan would carry the heat
away<00:00:51.670> unfortunately<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:53.330> fan<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.540> 5<00:00:53.900> volts

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
away unfortunately this fan is 5 volts

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.770 
away unfortunately this fan is 5 volts
so<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.380> had<00:00:54.560> to<00:00:54.650> use<00:00:54.800> a<00:00:54.830> 5<00:00:55.370> volt<00:00:55.610> regulator<00:00:55.880> my

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
so I had to use a 5 volt regulator my

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.880 
so I had to use a 5 volt regulator my
other<00:00:56.960> choice<00:00:57.290> was<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:59.050> 12<00:01:00.050> volt<00:01:00.290> fan<00:01:00.380> but<00:01:00.800> as

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
other choice was a 12 volt fan but as

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.719 
other choice was a 12 volt fan but as
you<00:01:00.980> can<00:01:01.100> see<00:01:01.160> it's<00:01:02.060> a<00:01:02.329> lot<00:01:03.320> bigger<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:04.009> lot

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
you can see it's a lot bigger a lot

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.039 
you can see it's a lot bigger a lot
bigger<00:01:06.460> okay<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.090> how<00:01:08.359> does<00:01:08.509> it<00:01:08.600> work<00:01:08.780> well

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
bigger okay so how does it work well

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.440 
bigger okay so how does it work well
let's<00:01:09.439> see<00:01:09.649> well<00:01:10.280> crank<00:01:10.609> it<00:01:10.759> up<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:13.329> this<00:01:14.329> is

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
let's see well crank it up and this is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.389 
let's see well crank it up and this is
about<00:01:14.659> 6<00:01:15.049> volts<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.530> fan<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:15.920> running<00:01:16.100> the

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
about 6 volts the fan is running the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.059 
about 6 volts the fan is running the
lights<00:01:16.609> on<00:01:16.819> on<00:01:17.420> yes<00:01:19.929> should<00:01:20.929> be<00:01:21.079> about<00:01:21.259> 7<00:01:21.740> volts

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
lights on on yes should be about 7 volts

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.690 
lights on on yes should be about 7 volts
they<00:01:22.159> start<00:01:22.429> to<00:01:22.520> come<00:01:22.670> on<00:01:24.310> not<00:01:25.310> really<00:01:25.429> very

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
they start to come on not really very

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:35.349 
they start to come on not really very
bright<00:01:26.030> yet<00:01:28.630> this<00:01:29.630> is<00:01:32.859> 8<00:01:33.859> volts<00:01:33.889> and<00:01:34.429> as<00:01:35.270> you

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
bright yet this is 8 volts and as you

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.429 
bright yet this is 8 volts and as you
can<00:01:35.450> see<00:01:35.569> it's<00:01:35.689> starting<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.109> little<00:01:36.350> bit

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
can see it's starting a little bit

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.989 
can see it's starting a little bit
bright<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:37.069> can<00:01:37.100> start<00:01:37.429> to<00:01:37.520> see<00:01:37.670> even<00:01:37.850> in<00:01:37.909> my

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
bright you can start to see even in my

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.020 
bright you can start to see even in my
finger<00:01:38.359> I<00:01:39.130> can't<00:01:40.130> point<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.520> directly<00:01:40.880> at

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
finger I can't point this directly at

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.879 
finger I can't point this directly at
the<00:01:41.119> camera<00:01:41.270> cuz<00:01:41.719> it<00:01:42.020> just<00:01:42.200> freaks<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.530> camera

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:42.889 
the camera cuz it just freaks the camera

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.739 
the camera cuz it just freaks the camera
out<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:43.729> can<00:01:43.880> use<00:01:44.030> my<00:01:44.209> finger<00:01:44.600> as<00:01:44.659> an

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
out so we can use my finger as an

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:48.609 
out so we can use my finger as an
indicator<00:01:45.139> of<00:01:45.259> how<00:01:45.350> bright<00:01:45.679> it<00:01:45.829> is<00:01:47.619> okay

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
indicator of how bright it is okay

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.590 
indicator of how bright it is okay
cranked<00:01:49.100> up<00:01:49.189> 9<00:01:49.490> volts<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.270> see<00:01:50.539> it

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
cranked up 9 volts you can see it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.249 
cranked up 9 volts you can see it
getting<00:01:50.749> brighter<00:01:52.899> there's<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:53.959> little<00:01:54.170> bit

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
getting brighter there's a little bit

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.469 
getting brighter there's a little bit
over<00:01:54.469> 9<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.979> can<00:01:55.100> see<00:01:55.310> from<00:01:55.520> my<00:01:55.639> finger<00:01:56.029> quite

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
over 9 you can see from my finger quite

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.349 
over 9 you can see from my finger quite
a<00:01:56.509> bit<00:01:56.719> brighter<00:01:57.549> but<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.670> bad<00:01:58.850> news<00:01:59.119> here

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
a bit brighter but the bad news here

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.269 
a bit brighter but the bad news here
here<00:01:59.539> is<00:01:59.689> that<00:02:00.049> this<00:02:00.469> is<00:02:00.679> as<00:02:00.799> bright<00:02:01.039> as<00:02:01.159> it

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:01.279 
here is that this is as bright as it

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:03.519 
here is that this is as bright as it
gets<00:02:01.490> anything<00:02:02.450> more<00:02:02.810> than<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.139> and<00:02:03.409> it

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
gets anything more than this and it

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.389 
gets anything more than this and it
starts<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:03.950> overheat

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
starts to overheat

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.160 
starts to overheat
so<00:02:05.109> this<00:02:06.109> experiment<00:02:06.770> was<00:02:06.859> not<00:02:07.039> 100%<00:02:07.399> success

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
so this experiment was not 100% success

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.940 
so this experiment was not 100% success
well<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.590> got<00:02:08.830> my<00:02:09.009> small<00:02:09.280> package<00:02:09.819> but<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:11.110> can't

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
well I got my small package but I can't

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.670 
well I got my small package but I can't
I<00:02:12.730> can't<00:02:13.330> run<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.630> at<00:02:13.720> 11<00:02:13.810> volts<00:02:14.380> where<00:02:14.560> it's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
I can't run it at 11 volts where it's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.760 
I can't run it at 11 volts where it's
supposed<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.100> be<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.640> I'm<00:02:16.480> still<00:02:16.780> 2<00:02:17.110> volts<00:02:17.470> shy

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
supposed to be so I'm still 2 volts shy

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.050 
supposed to be so I'm still 2 volts shy
of<00:02:18.120> being<00:02:19.120> able<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.480> operate<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.020> at<00:02:20.080> 100%<00:02:21.060> but

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
of being able to operate it at 100% but

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.570 
of being able to operate it at 100% but
still<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.650> know<00:02:23.740> one<00:02:24.010> step<00:02:24.250> forward

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
still it's a you know one step forward

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.930 
still it's a you know one step forward
and<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:25.300> guess<00:02:25.930> I'll<00:02:26.080> have<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.550> think<00:02:27.550> about<00:02:27.820> how

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
and I guess I'll have to think about how

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.580 
and I guess I'll have to think about how
I<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.240> do<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.900> still<00:02:29.080> keep<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.380> down<00:02:29.560> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
I can do this and still keep it down a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.300 
I can do this and still keep it down a
small<00:02:30.280> package<00:02:31.260> okay<00:02:32.260> well<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.709> was<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.040> not

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
small package okay well that was it not

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.729 
small package okay well that was it not
100%<00:02:33.910> success<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.690> something<00:02:35.500> moving

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
100% success but something moving

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.180 
100% success but something moving
forward<00:02:36.190> hope<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.730> found<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.030> interesting
