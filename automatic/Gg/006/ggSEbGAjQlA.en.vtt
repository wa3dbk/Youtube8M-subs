all<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.590> go<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> first<00:00:56.370> drop

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.640 

all<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:03.690> let's<00:01:03.899> take<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> look<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.440> see<00:01:04.559> how

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
all right let's take a look and see how

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.109 
all right let's take a look and see how
the<00:01:04.710> fish<00:01:04.920> tapes<00:01:05.159> performed<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> first

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the fish tapes performed on the first

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.050 
the fish tapes performed on the first
drop<00:01:06.680> first<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> red<00:01:08.220> competitor<00:01:08.820> here

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
drop first we have a red competitor here

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
drop first we have a red competitor here
and<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.200> clearly<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.619> there's<00:01:11.130> some

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and you can clearly see there's some

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.870 
and you can clearly see there's some
stress<00:01:11.700> whitening<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.600> plastic

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
stress whitening here in the plastic

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.300 
stress whitening here in the plastic
although<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> fish<00:01:18.750> tape<00:01:18.960> still<00:01:19.229> performs

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.389 

next<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.520> ideals<00:01:23.940> fish<00:01:24.240> tape<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.399> it

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
next we have ideals fish tape and it

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.749 
next we have ideals fish tape and it
looks<00:01:26.700> almost<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.479> good<00:01:27.539> as<00:01:27.840> new<00:01:28.220> on<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.520> side

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
looks almost as good as new on this side

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.430 
looks almost as good as new on this side
we<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.119> little<00:01:30.479> tiny<00:01:30.720> bit<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.050> whitening

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
we have a little tiny bit of whitening

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:42.290 
we have a little tiny bit of whitening
here<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> works<00:01:36.810> great<00:01:40.610> next<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:41.970> green

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
here so works great next we have a green

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.070 
here so works great next we have a green
competitor

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
competitor

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.160 
competitor
and<00:01:44.330> their<00:01:45.330> product<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.929> cracked<00:01:48.170> apart

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and their product here cracked apart

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.100 
and their product here cracked apart
here<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.970> lot<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.060> stress<00:01:51.330> whitening<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:51.990> in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
here a lot of stress whitening here in

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.399 
here a lot of stress whitening here in
this<00:01:52.229> area<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.240> actually<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.360> boat<00:01:54.630> apart<00:01:55.080> at

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this area and actually at boat apart at

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.160 
this area and actually at boat apart at
the<00:01:55.979> seam<00:01:56.220> here<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.789> would<00:01:57.420> say<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.780> fish<00:01:57.990> tape

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the seam here I would say this fish tape

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.999 
the seam here I would say this fish tape
is<00:01:58.320> no<00:01:58.470> longer<00:01:58.680> usable<00:02:00.619> next<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.860> our

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
is no longer usable next we have our

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.649 
is no longer usable next we have our
orange<00:02:02.189> competitor<00:02:02.790> over<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:05.509> they<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
orange competitor over here they have a

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.770 
orange competitor over here they have a
little<00:02:06.840> tiny<00:02:07.170> bit<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.530> whitening<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
little tiny bit of whitening here a

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.759 
little tiny bit of whitening here a
little<00:02:09.780> tiny<00:02:09.959> bit<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.350> other<00:02:10.530> side

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
little tiny bit on the other side

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.380 
little tiny bit on the other side
otherwise<00:02:13.130> there's<00:02:14.130> also<00:02:14.340> seams<00:02:14.700> perform

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
otherwise there's also seams perform

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.560 
otherwise there's also seams perform
pretty<00:02:15.630> well<00:02:15.840> after<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.200> first<00:02:16.350> drop<00:02:17.570> all

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
pretty well after the first drop all

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:32.280 
pretty well after the first drop all
right<00:02:18.750> here<00:02:18.989> we<00:02:19.079> go<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> second<00:02:19.950> drop

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.449 

all<00:02:33.290> right<00:02:33.470> let's<00:02:33.709> take<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.890> look<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.250> see<00:02:34.370> how

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
all right let's take a look and see how

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.009 
all right let's take a look and see how
the<00:02:34.519> fish<00:02:34.790> tapes<00:02:35.030> look<00:02:35.209> after<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.629> second

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
the fish tapes look after the second

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.670 
the fish tapes look after the second
drop<00:02:37.360> first<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.599> have<00:02:38.690> ideal<00:02:38.989> industries<00:02:39.470> fish

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
drop first we have ideal industries fish

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.550 
drop first we have ideal industries fish
tape<00:02:39.890> here<00:02:40.129> as<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:41.360> can<00:02:41.540> see<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.200> fish<00:02:42.379> tape

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
tape here as you can see the fish tape

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.270 
tape here as you can see the fish tape
still<00:02:42.890> looks<00:02:43.129> very<00:02:43.400> well<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:44.769> minor<00:02:45.769> minor

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
still looks very well a minor minor

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.759 
still looks very well a minor minor
amount<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:47.799> stress<00:02:48.799> whitening<00:02:53.769> still

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
amount of stress whitening still

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.640 
amount of stress whitening still
performs<00:02:55.220> very<00:02:55.519> well<00:02:56.530> almost<00:02:57.530> like<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> new

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
performs very well almost like a new

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.839 
performs very well almost like a new
next<00:03:00.650> we<00:03:01.489> have<00:03:01.610> our<00:03:01.790> red<00:03:01.940> competitor<00:03:02.450> here

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
next we have our red competitor here

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.009 
next we have our red competitor here
there's<00:03:04.849> a<00:03:04.940> crack<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.510> goes<00:03:05.690> all<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.900> way

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
there's a crack that goes all the way

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.729 
there's a crack that goes all the way
from<00:03:06.140> here<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:07.489> here<00:03:07.880> on<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:09.170> inside<00:03:09.560> edge

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
from here to here on the inside edge

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.059 
from here to here on the inside edge
there<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.750> case<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.140> clearly<00:03:12.440> bowed<00:03:12.769> out<00:03:12.920> on
