 I did a tutorial on the side of paola this 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.740
 I love to begin by duplicating the show level 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.530

 we set on average we see that you have 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.460
 then we go on colors 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.140
 investigated 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 and then not on filters 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.100
 artistic 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.600
 light shaded 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 we make the font values ​​and give ok 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.740
 now let's put this level 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.480
 in light mode of the vouchers 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.480
 id diam opacity of 50% 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.470
 we do not doubt 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.960
 and this new level gives 75% opacity 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.540
 duplicate the background 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.690
 and drag the background pair level to the top all the others 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 let's go upstairs 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.159
 we will put a value of 100 in these inputs here on the left 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.790
 and we give ok 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.790

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.629
 this level 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.639
 we will not put it in mode 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.029
 only dark tones 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.029
 and we will give you an opacity of 35% 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.949

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.909
 ns the jumbo 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.329
 and we will give the value of 10 and 25 respectively and give it here 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.459
 now that we have filtered we found ourselves with three levels 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.389
 select nemo background color level 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.809
