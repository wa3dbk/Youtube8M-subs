00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.980
 I have 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.369
 because I 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.160
 hello how about youtuber friends donate 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.860
 for approaching you so much but in this 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.980
 moment is quite night and it's okay 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.810
 dark so if I walk away you see 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.690
 pretty good the truth is that you do not see 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.989
 so well I do not care so we're doing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.629
 well let's go in this new video tutorial 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.629
 let's learn how to calibrate the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.300
 battery in our galaxy is first 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.000
 that a whole story that nobody 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.520
 it interests and it leaves a program and the moment 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.019
 that all the folders of 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.960
 my desk be in the erase 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.120
 so it was very difficult for me to find the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.010
 intro and the end for videos but not 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.010
 I found so I managed 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.909
 well let's start 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.220
 we will charge our cell until 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.140
 stay full as you can see let's 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.810
 pay it and upload it as you can see this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.580
 charge we turn it off and we load it up 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.020
 that is at 100 when they are 100 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.020
 we enter engine corp 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.110
 we are going to enter in great record mode and 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.960
 by the way an ad well facebook that 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.080
 there's a tour today I'm going to put together 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.260
 task gives to ask people to 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.840
 see what I had, I will not show them in 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.670
 one of my videos although there they said that 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.860
 It is not recommended because if you 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.979
 you are wrong and you touch something you can fuck 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.369
 your cell phone and you're going to scream with joy uy 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.470
 well let's go the balloon on a motorcycle 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.780
 let's give kart a plus of influence 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.790
 we are not going to klÃ©ber mod and once we 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.620
 we are in a balloon we are going to go 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.350
 down advance 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.080
 and in advance we will give you white 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.870
 drummer there will be the option in the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.790
 third option sorry to confuse this 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.400
 on the third web 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.100
 white battery start can not be seen very 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.530
 good but hey we're going to give wild 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.380
 patricistas and we are going to give him there in yes 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.510
 we are my way back 'crystals once 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.680
 that we tell him the web drummer we're going 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.040
 to give back 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.720
 and we 're going to give him reboots and 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.110
 stimulated and disconnected the charger 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.450
 and once this is done, our battery 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.970
 it will be completely calibrated 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.920
 because there are sometimes that someone else a 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.680
 very little number then I am very 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.330
 recommended for the battery and we 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.160
 last will normally save us 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.430
 obviously less than with the stock rom 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.010
 but obviously it will last us will have 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.230
 a longer good duration - from u2 this 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.930
 but all the calibration on the button 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.100
 I like here below subscribe if not 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.110
 have subscribed 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.950
 let's wait for my videos to learn 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:18.180
 more new things and lately I've done 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.890
 things that are more common because they are not 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.930
 I've put them in my videos then the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.310
 most common things on android I am 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.709
 putting because I do not have them in my 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.090
 videos but since then things will more 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.129
 advanced depends 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.390
 later on I will make a video 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:36.420
 giving them a good news that we are going to 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.510
 see can be sad or not 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.000
 and good has been the whole tutorial if not 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.069
 the graffiti subscribe subscribe 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.370
 ideal in I like they support me and I 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.950
 I would like very much and this but do it in 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.630
 every rum I installed but first 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.970
 program your battery life because 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.650
 if its duration does not need calibration 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.110
 not what is free because you can not 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.340
 be calibrating the battery every time and 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.239
 well this has been the whole tutorial 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.239
 see you later 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.690
 i 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.599
 yes 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.169
 and good
