in<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> chat<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.449> want<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> put<00:01:00.780> my

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
in the chat I just want to put my

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.420 
in the chat I just want to put my
command<00:01:01.199> block<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> little<00:01:01.920> easier<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
command block so it's a little easier to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.020 
command block so it's a little easier to
edit<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> book<00:01:03.930> called<00:01:04.290> title<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
edit and get a book called title and it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960 
edit and get a book called title and it
has<00:01:06.119> writing<00:01:06.390> inside<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:07.610> that's<00:01:08.610> that's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
has writing inside now that's that's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.010 
has writing inside now that's that's
easy<00:01:09.270> enough<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.869> there's<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.799> big<00:01:11.070> question

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
easy enough but there's a big question

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.219 
easy enough but there's a big question
the<00:01:13.020> question<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.939> what<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.600> run<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the question is what if you run out of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.679 
the question is what if you run out of
space<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:18.210> page<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:18.840> book<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> I'll

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
space on a page in your book and so I'll

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.219 
space on a page in your book and so I'll
just<00:01:21.930> demonstrate<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> open<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
just demonstrate that so open it up and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.359 
just demonstrate that so open it up and
it's<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.100> quite<00:01:26.430> full<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:27.030> else<00:01:28.220> put<00:01:29.220> in

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
it's not quite full here else put in

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.290 
it's not quite full here else put in
some<00:01:29.640> more<00:01:29.939> gunk<00:01:30.450> right<00:01:30.659> there

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
some more gunk right there

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.920 
some more gunk right there
um

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.320 

there<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.800> go<00:01:37.980> it<00:01:38.190> should<00:01:38.550> fill<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.000> about<00:01:39.300> a

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
there we go it should fill up about a

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.850 
there we go it should fill up about a
page<00:01:40.220> let's<00:01:41.220> try<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.850> again

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.110 

nope<00:01:45.860> not<00:01:46.220> quite<00:01:46.250> enough<00:01:46.700> we're<00:01:46.940> going<00:01:47.030> to

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
nope not quite enough we're going to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.630 
nope not quite enough we're going to
have<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.360> add<00:01:47.480> some<00:01:47.560> some<00:01:48.560> more<00:01:48.770> gunk<00:01:49.190> in<00:01:49.400> here

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
have to add some some more gunk in here

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.360 
have to add some some more gunk in here
I<00:01:49.670> didn't<00:01:50.030> have<00:01:50.180> any<00:01:50.390> other<00:01:50.480> text<00:01:51.140> plans<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:52.340> I

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
I didn't have any other text plans so I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.500 
I didn't have any other text plans so I
think<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:53.000> should<00:01:53.060> be<00:01:53.620> professional<00:01:54.620> enough

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
think this should be professional enough

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.710 
think this should be professional enough
but<00:01:56.510> anyway<00:01:57.550> what<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.730> need<00:01:58.910> to<00:01:59.030> show<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.300> is

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
but anyway what I need to show you is

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.770 
but anyway what I need to show you is
that<00:02:00.170> once<00:02:00.980> we<00:02:01.190> have<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.640> full<00:02:01.970> page<00:02:02.180> as<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.600> can

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
that once we have a full page as you can

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.570 
that once we have a full page as you can
see<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.350> just<00:02:03.920> goes<00:02:04.100> off<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.640> page<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:06.770> what<00:02:07.430> we

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
see it just goes off the page so what we

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.100 
see it just goes off the page so what we
need<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.760> do<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.240> make<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.570> go<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.930> another

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
need to do to make it go on to another

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.500 
need to do to make it go on to another
page<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.740> we're<00:02:10.430> just<00:02:10.460> going<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.820> go<00:02:11.090> I'm

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
page is we're just going to go I'm

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.020 
page is we're just going to go I'm
guessing<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.530> page<00:02:12.710> ends<00:02:13.070> around<00:02:13.190> here<00:02:13.820> and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
guessing the page ends around here and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.610 
guessing the page ends around here and
what<00:02:14.690> we're<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.020> want<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.230> do<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.470> we

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
what we're going to want to do is we

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.930 
what we're going to want to do is we
want<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.830> put<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> quotation<00:02:16.630> comma<00:02:17.920> quotation

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
want to put a quotation comma quotation

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.430 
want to put a quotation comma quotation
showing<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.330> another<00:02:20.660> page<00:02:21.050> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
showing that this is another page and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.060 
showing that this is another page and
that's<00:02:21.590> why<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.730> titled<00:02:23.300> pages<00:02:24.070> over

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
that's why that is titled pages over

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.950 
that's why that is titled pages over
there<00:02:25.220> because<00:02:27.040> each<00:02:28.040> quotation<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:31.960> each

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
there because each quotation is is each

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.360 
there because each quotation is is each
page<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.240> then<00:02:35.530> what<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.710> should<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.160> right

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
page and then what that should do right

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.850 
page and then what that should do right
there<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.850> right<00:02:38.510> after<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.810> put<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.170> quotation

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
there is right after I put the quotation

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.910 
there is right after I put the quotation
should<00:02:40.640> stop<00:02:40.970> go<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.540> next<00:02:41.690> page<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.320> it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
should stop go to the next page and it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.280 
should stop go to the next page and it
continues<00:02:43.370> over<00:02:43.430> there<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:44.960> what<00:02:45.170> we

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
continues over there and then what we

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.610 
continues over there and then what we
can<00:02:45.470> do<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.920> we<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.880> just<00:02:46.910> put<00:02:47.620> quotations

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
can do is we can just put quotations

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.780 
can do is we can just put quotations
comma<00:02:49.220> quotation<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.300> we<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:51.410> just<00:02:51.790> split

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
comma quotation and we can just split

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.120 
comma quotation and we can just split
this<00:02:53.030> up<00:02:53.209> as<00:02:53.450> much<00:02:53.630> as<00:02:53.780> we<00:02:53.959> want<00:02:54.200> add<00:02:54.410> as<00:02:55.010> many
