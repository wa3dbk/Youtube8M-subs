00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.949
 Hi, guys and girls, I hope so 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.949
 all right 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.050
 welcome to high tension the district 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.740
 angels financial states 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.890
 united america damn we are in 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.480
 home 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.220
 I would like to share with you some 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.560
 first impressions maybe a bit 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.060
 presented because we hardly carry a 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.980
 week beta but the truth is that the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.900
 tonic is repeated constantly and is that 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.369
 I had a fucking time when 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.500
 we will have a lead game in the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.059
 bloody money when with the m16 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.410
 blood money which is one of the two modes 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.510
 of games available in this beta of 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.250
 battlefield heart line the other way 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.019
 game what is called haste but not 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.190
 played practically nothing I think he plays 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.629
 a game not even complete by 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.839
 so much so, I do not even think about it 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.430
 it seems a bit damaged but maybe such 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.280
 it's not because the mode 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.989
 in itself a pain in the ass but because the way 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.820
 down game and it seems too much 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.899
 too much fun for everyone who 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.000
 I did not have the opportunity to try 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.440
 this beta of battlefield hard line and not 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.239
 know this way blood money game 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.460
 basically it's that in the center 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.690
 of the map and a pile of money from which 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.670
 both teams both policemen as 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.869
 thieves we want to collect all the money 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.910
 that we can and take it to our 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.500
 base where we can deposit it in a 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.670
 armored truck there is but that dough 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.260
 that money will never be of 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.850
 all safe because he 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.110
 about our change provided and if 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.500
 they catch them off guard and nobody 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.790
 defending then you can steal us 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.200
 can choricear all the money that 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.720
 we have taken is something quite 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.640
 interesting is something pretty pretty 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.930
 handsome pretty cool because he makes 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.180
 games that seem like you're going to lose 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.100
 are about to lose because it is the 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.330
 completely back then thanks to a 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.730
 good action of your team a good 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.070
 patrol that approaches approaches the 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.450
 enemy armored truck and hit him all 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.120
 the stick will remove it according to a couple of 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.010
 million or three and then then that 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.020
 demoralizes a little bit to the rival and good 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.330
 it increases the morale of your classmates 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.430
 and I do not know the games are the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.530
 Really fucking whore are really the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.670
 order and vice versa also items that 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.140
 it looks like you're going to win that you're 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.580
 puntito to earn more with your bag of 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.970
 money about to deposit it in your 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.190
 truck and suddenly a patrol 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.250
 enemy with a fucking vehicle destroys you 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.050
 humiliates you steals two or three million and 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.729
 the opposite happens not to demoralize 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.790
 to your companions and they give him residence of me 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.080
 it's really very funny that you see 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.930
 really and with the syringe that I have 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.849
 revived is one of the new 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.370
 the gadgets of the new accessories that 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.650
 we have in this battle to fix line what 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.540
 we can put in one of the two slots of 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.090
 accessories that we have in the class of 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.500
 doctor to the class assault that come to us 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.450
 here but basically it fulfills the function 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.489
 of the assault class of previous 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.170
 battlefield and well it is a 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.480
 syringe which has a single use 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 for life with which we can auto 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.230
 revive there is another syringe which 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.139
 it works exactly like the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.489
 defibrillators but I see it useful when 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.139
 you play with partners when you play with 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.480
 friends but when you play alone when 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.739
 you play with guiris and you have there the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.239
 limitation of voice communication 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.950
 because although you can communicate with 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.659
 voice with them then we usually go to 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.909
 have different languages ​​languages 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.230
 different then but much more useful the 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.359
 of author revive us even though 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.069
 have a single use is much more useful than 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.879
 Well, the other one that works 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.340
 exactly like the 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.739
 defibrillators and has unlimited pulse 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.389
 as for the accessories as for 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.129
 the gadgets that we can carry in the 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.870
 different classes refers the thing has 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.790
 changed a lot and very beautiful things and 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.019
 new things pretty cool the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.919
 sniper for example there is a friend 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.540
 of device that throws it yes and creates false 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.020
 false alerts alerts on the radar 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.750
 enemy 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.030
 false sounds to confuse the enemy 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.490
 and I have not seen any kind of crap 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.410
 cosmic of this antivehicle mine yes 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.720
 shit like that if there's a kind 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.790
 of grenade that we can place with the 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.310
 sniper but not much less is 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.900
 as annoying as we believe them and attention 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.390
 here because I wanted him he wanted what 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.860
 I wanted to pose for questioning when 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.930
 when we expel them we catch them 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.220
 behind we expel them and we can 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.230
 interrogate when they are on the ground we 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.360
 mark so that we press a button 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.730
 -I began is the I do not know what button will be in 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.170
 console and we can interrogate and 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.570
 for a very short period of time 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.550
 we will see all the enemies in the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.140
 minimap marked to all absolutely 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.660
 to all the opposing team we will see 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.670
 marked on my map just pretty handsome 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.290
 something quite useful enough moral in 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.730
 As for the clamor, there is no 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.890
 nothing of that there is nothing there is no believe 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.510
 there are no anti-tank mines no mines 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.710
 anti-aircraft there is nothing there is none of 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.209
 those crap and the truth is that it 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.220
 thank you very many play very comfortable 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.680
 with them I say the scorekeeper has 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.360
 a kind of adhesive grenade that the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.340
 can hang it can be placed in a 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.530
 wall or on the ground and the truth is that 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.090
 they look pretty good they look pretty 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.310
 well I think they're pretty pretty 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.660
 well balanced not too long ago I said that 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.370
 I wish I was in a good balance 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.680
 between infantry and vehicles in the 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.810
 next battlefield good well it seems 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.280
 I do not know that my wish has been fulfilled 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.230
 because in the toilet set line in this beta 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.790
 at least there is an excellent 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.950
 balance between infantry and 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.410
 vehicles or at least a balance 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.020
 infinitely better than the one we saw in 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.220
 battle 54 and sometimes it's better 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.740
 that the one we saw even in battlefield 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.460
 3 is a missing jets is true 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.870
 missing tanks 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.340
 do you want me to say well this 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.190
 setting which personally I 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.960
 fascinates cops against thieves because they do not 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.330
 Justified the appearance of jets 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.410
 nor of tanks in any type of armored 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.240
 beyond what has been seen in this 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.530
 beta this time has achieved something that 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.849
 I thought it good to go see the 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.139
 evolution that the saga had lately 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.000
 Well , I thought it would not happen again 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.740
 and that is to be enjoyed with vehicles and what 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.750
 I'm doing like a dwarf 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.490
 I'm enjoying with vehicles like 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.289
 I really like a bastard 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.210
 pretty well balanced hopefully it 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.160
 keep this balance of català the 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.129
 final version of the game because really 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.839
 they are very funny 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.179
 it is full of details details 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:33.349
 that make the mere act of playing be 

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:34.939
 fun as for example the 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.619
 recovery of shooting by jumping 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.319
 please thank the heavens for power 

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:41.239
 shoot jumping for god thank you but 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.529
 You can not play hip puta 

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:45.529
 mother with practically almost any 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.879
 weapon I do not know is that it has a thousand things 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.150
 that make the game much more 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.460
 dynamic much more fun 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.280
 I do not know to me it really has me 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.570
 absolutely in love you do not have 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.160
 details as for example in final marquez 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.990
 red seat being shot at the wings 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.030
 you shoot the body because the end appears 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.410
 white marker of a lifetime but if you 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.670
 we give in the head it looks like a marquez kit 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.590
 red to let us know what we have done 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.540
 a critical impact uncle of whore mother 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.490
 because that way you have no doubt if you have 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.050
 given in the head or have not disappeared 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.270
 the sniper scenes of 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.320
 the rpg s the grenades do a lot 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.430
 damage to vehicles that's very 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.840
 important 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.030
 another detail when we are capturing 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.920
 The more we are, the faster we take 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.180
 the money I do not know are details for all 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.610
 same parts where you look there 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.840
 details and that is appreciated something that does not 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.340
 I know how the fuck they got, is that if 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.840
 you play with friends you have a fucking time 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.700
 madrid if you play alone you spend 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.020
 exactly as well being 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.870
 completely different experiences 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.610
 When the same or the same map is not 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.860
 have done something this game has magic 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.300
 there is something in this game that makes it 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.740
 the host 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.150
 much has to be left for the 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.860
 final version does not give you a kick in the 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.870
 mouth to battlefield 4 is taking 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.090
 many reviews but good music 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.979
 it was never the most popular I hope that you 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.669
 have liked and until next time 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.669
 chao chao
