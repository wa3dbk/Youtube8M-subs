00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.279
 at 21 we will see how to have 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.530
 internet as you can see I do not have any 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.530
 internal access on my computer in this 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.420
 moment what we are going to do is 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.420
 first let's see my system 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.519
 let's go to the start bar right now 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:26.919
 but equipment properties see two and two 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.239
 followed closed the processors good 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.239
 speed is what it is worth 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 what I want to teach them how they are going to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.440
 do good first the center of our 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.540
 configuration on adapter seems 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.730
 exist to what we are going to see already a 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.530
 steel bridge first thing we're going to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.540
 do that when a network of flt us 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.239
 same we are going to have to create with this 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.730
 configuration from there we're going to create a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 new next and everything will take 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.320
 a little but not a minor a device 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.390
 so that it has marked the analysis 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 next next next put a 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.220
 name and password in alamar I do not 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.520
 I do it because I have it good 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.500
 last is that put a configuration 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.010
 more than asking for a phone 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.010
 and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.009
 who wish to an unknown number of 98 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.850
 said what you leave you are always going to 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.490
 keyboard is marked by the three boxes from 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.340
 down that is I lost that piece and those of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.380
 above remember the password and the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.860
 tail for like this among others to show you 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.630
 a little piquito is good no longer is that they give 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.539
 all create the second they use 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.240
 password for your own internet 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.159
 next clients nothing more that's all 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.399
 already good after that before butcher and 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.200
 teams we are going to put the video 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.560
 to continue the conference 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.560
 electric 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.969
 Well, you can laugh at the team that 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.609
 now as you can see in the book 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.229
 restart tells us that I do not have any 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.480
 reconnected I have nothing internet 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.569
 As I am going to tell you, we have finished 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.970
 create a pn network now let's go 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.420
 to the browser I have we go first 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.750
 cmd 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:30.350
 let's set up com I'm not wrong 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:34.460
 is this is ip with fixed bar to the 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.130
 that is all going everything is already going to appear in 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.980
 all those can not maximize the window 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.140
 so they can see everything good 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.629
 it's not all maximized and now big 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.549
 and it appears to them what they see in the middle is 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.940
 that already have internal we will cover 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.780
 something said and let's see how I'm going to 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.150
 see and google 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.080
 let's go see youtube to see 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.080
 Youtube 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:08.720
 As you can see, loading everything for me is a 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.720
 little slow but faster 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.680
 chord everything for example I have with a 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.920
 line 37 that also consists of turner 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.120
 fast because if not your game too 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.860
 I will return and load all windows 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.360
 that is online well that's true for today
