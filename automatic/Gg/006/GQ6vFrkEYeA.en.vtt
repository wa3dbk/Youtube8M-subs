feels good the screen feels good so it's

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.000 
feels good the screen feels good so it's
just<00:00:25.539> about<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.810> nice<00:00:26.140> interesting<00:00:26.500> look<00:00:26.830> that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
just about a nice interesting look that

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.430 
just about a nice interesting look that
we<00:00:27.100> haven't<00:00:27.369> seen<00:00:27.670> on<00:00:28.449> a<00:00:28.510> lot<00:00:28.990> of<00:00:29.110> Android

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
we haven't seen on a lot of Android

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.830 
we haven't seen on a lot of Android
tablet<00:00:29.830> and<00:00:29.980> then<00:00:30.490> another<00:00:31.119> really<00:00:31.539> really

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
tablet and then another really really

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.479 
tablet and then another really really
cool<00:00:32.020> feature<00:00:32.230> of<00:00:32.410> this<00:00:32.529> that<00:00:32.770> isn't<00:00:33.280> going<00:00:33.399> to

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
cool feature of this that isn't going to

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.610 
cool feature of this that isn't going to
help<00:00:33.610> it's<00:00:34.239> not<00:00:34.450> like<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.780> practical<00:00:35.380> thing

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
help it's not like a practical thing

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.220 
help it's not like a practical thing
that's<00:00:36.220> going<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:36.489> improve<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.390> experience

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
that's going to improve the experience

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.139 
that's going to improve the experience
but<00:00:38.829> on<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:39.130> back<00:00:39.370> I'm<00:00:39.640> not<00:00:39.760> sure<00:00:39.910> if<00:00:40.000> you<00:00:40.090> can

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
but on the back I'm not sure if you can

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.810 
but on the back I'm not sure if you can
see<00:00:40.239> this<00:00:40.600> but<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.500> speaker<00:00:42.220> grill<00:00:42.579> is

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
see this but the speaker grill is

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.850 
see this but the speaker grill is
actually<00:00:43.329> an<00:00:43.420> android<00:00:43.930> robot<00:00:44.230> which<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:44.829> a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
actually an android robot which is a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.790 
actually an android robot which is a
nice<00:00:45.100> little<00:00:45.309> touch<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.840> this<00:00:47.380> is<00:00:47.410> just<00:00:47.680> a

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
nice little touch so this is just a

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.080 
nice little touch so this is just a
reference<00:00:48.160> design<00:00:48.430> you<00:00:48.610> can<00:00:48.640> see<00:00:48.850> it's<00:00:48.969> as

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
reference design you can see it's as

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.049 
reference design you can see it's as
Android<00:00:49.510> tablet<00:00:49.930> it's<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.500> generic<00:00:51.059> generic

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
Android tablet it's a generic generic

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.970 
Android tablet it's a generic generic
device<00:00:52.719> now<00:00:52.930> kind<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.379> prototype<00:00:53.590> but

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
device now kind of the prototype but

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.020 
device now kind of the prototype but
we're<00:00:54.100> told<00:00:54.250> that<00:00:54.399> there<00:00:55.120> is<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.719> GPS<00:00:57.030> related

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
we're told that there is a GPS related

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.970 
we're told that there is a GPS related
company<00:00:58.450> he's<00:00:58.960> actually<00:00:59.140> going<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.620> turn<00:00:59.829> this

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
company he's actually going to turn this

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
company he's actually going to turn this
into<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.700> gps<00:01:01.539> focus<00:01:02.289> device<00:01:02.770> so<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.340> can<00:01:03.879> see

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
into a gps focus device so you can see

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.440 
into a gps focus device so you can see
now<00:01:04.149> it's<00:01:04.329> on<00:01:04.449> maps<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:05.970> presumably<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.270> we

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
now it's on maps and presumably you we

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.680 
now it's on maps and presumably you we
are<00:01:07.630> using<00:01:08.940> google<00:01:09.940> nav<00:01:10.119> or<00:01:10.360> i<00:01:10.420> would<00:01:10.570> assume

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
are using google nav or i would assume

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.950 
are using google nav or i would assume
whatever<00:01:11.229> software

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
whatever software

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.670 
whatever software

the GPS company's proprietary leone's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.310 
the GPS company's proprietary leone's
but<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.330> go<00:01:18.510> back<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> home

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
but you can see if I go back to the home

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
but you can see if I go back to the home
screen<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> typical<00:01:20.610> Android

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
screen it is a typical Android

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.000 
screen it is a typical Android
experience<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:22.530> seems<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
experience and it seems like it's a

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.149 
experience and it seems like it's a
resistive<00:01:23.490> screen<00:01:23.490> which<00:01:24.090> sometimes<00:01:24.720> may<00:01:25.380> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
resistive screen which sometimes may you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.700 
resistive screen which sometimes may you
know<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.490> hindrance<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.690> GPS<00:01:28.320> when

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
know be a hindrance but with a GPS when

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.249 
know be a hindrance but with a GPS when
you<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.970> okay<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.690> don't<00:01:30.840> want<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you want to okay you don't want to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.020 
you want to okay you don't want to
accidentally<00:01:31.800> pressing<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.369> button<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
accidentally pressing on button so it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.540 
accidentally pressing on button so it
makes<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> press

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
makes it so if you really have to press

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.050 
makes it so if you really have to press
on<00:01:35.729> something<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:37.740> make<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> work<00:01:38.220> let's<00:01:38.880> go

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
on something to to make it work let's go

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.749 
on something to to make it work let's go
back<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.720> check<00:01:40.080> really<00:01:40.590> quickly<00:01:41.009> which

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
back and just check really quickly which

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.740 
back and just check really quickly which
version<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.479> Android<00:01:43.170> we're<00:01:43.380> running<00:01:44.750> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
version of Android we're running and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.940 
version of Android we're running and
looks<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.289> android<00:01:46.710> 2.2<00:01:47.750> point<00:01:48.750> 1<00:01:49.050> so<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
looks like android 2.2 point 1 so it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.650 
looks like android 2.2 point 1 so it's
pretty<00:01:50.130> good<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> check<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.509> this

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
pretty good I want to check out this

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.630 
pretty good I want to check out this
this<00:01:52.080> camera<00:01:52.530> real<00:01:52.740> quick<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:54.270> see

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.620 

you<00:01:58.180> see<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.570> app<00:01:58.750> tray<00:02:00.450> let's<00:02:01.450> see<00:02:01.540> if

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
you see the app tray let's see if

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.440 
you see the app tray let's see if
there's<00:02:01.810> any<00:02:01.900> absent<00:02:02.350> here<00:02:02.440> we<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.909> GPS

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
there's any absent here we the GPS

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.780 
there's any absent here we the GPS
viewer<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.140> this<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:05.409> GPS<00:02:05.680> enabled<00:02:06.159> this

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
viewer so this is GPS enabled this

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.719 
viewer so this is GPS enabled this
probably<00:02:07.180> meant<00:02:07.390> have<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.659> lot<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.729> functions

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
probably meant have a lot of functions

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.870 
probably meant have a lot of functions
and<00:02:10.090> specs<00:02:11.080> really<00:02:11.500> for<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.340> know<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.490> high-end

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
and specs really for you know a high-end

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.020 
and specs really for you know a high-end
tablet<00:02:13.360> or<00:02:13.830> or<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:15.040> smartphone<00:02:15.610> or<00:02:15.760> whatever

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
tablet or or like smartphone or whatever

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.470 
tablet or or like smartphone or whatever
seems<00:02:16.690> like<00:02:16.900> more<00:02:17.640> GPS<00:02:18.640> centric<00:02:19.000> device<00:02:19.270> that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
seems like more GPS centric device that

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.840 
seems like more GPS centric device that
they<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.750> want<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:20.020> gps<00:02:20.440> and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
they just want to have gps and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.390 
they just want to have gps and
and<00:02:22.780> work<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.290> something<00:02:23.950> you're<00:02:24.070> taking<00:02:24.340> to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
and work is something you're taking to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.650 
and work is something you're taking to
travel<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:25.690> let's<00:02:25.870> go<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.230> click<00:02:27.180> GPS<00:02:28.180> viewer

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.590 

and<00:02:30.780> interesting

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
and interesting

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.840 

so<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.470> no<00:02:34.650> clue<00:02:34.800> what<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.400> means<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
so I have no clue what this means you

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.890 
so I have no clue what this means you
know<00:02:35.970> I'm<00:02:36.090> guessing<00:02:36.420> these<00:02:36.570> are<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
know I'm guessing these are the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.840 
know I'm guessing these are the
different<00:02:37.050> towers<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.130> connected<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.520> with

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
different towers it's connected to with

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.530 
different towers it's connected to with
the<00:02:39.000> strength<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.990> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.140 

coordinates<00:02:43.379> are<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.040> sure<00:02:44.189> to<00:02:44.280> reset<00:02:44.610> GPS

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
coordinates are you sure to reset GPS

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.729 
coordinates are you sure to reset GPS
satellite<00:02:45.569> receiver<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.079> know<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:46.409> don't<00:02:46.500> want

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
satellite receiver to know we don't want

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.760 
satellite receiver to know we don't want
to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
to
