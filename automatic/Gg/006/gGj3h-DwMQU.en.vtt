00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
seen here in these dvds is a very loose

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.880 
seen here in these dvds is a very loose
style<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.920> i<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.550> wondering<00:00:33.620> has<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.770> work

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
style and i was wondering has your work

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.639 
style and i was wondering has your work
always<00:00:35.520> been<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.180> lucid<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.320> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
always been so lucid what we see it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
always been so lucid what we see it
reads<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.460> realistically<00:00:39.120> even<00:00:39.270> though<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> is

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
reads so realistically even though it is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.500 
reads so realistically even though it is
loose<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.469> fresh<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.910> tell<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.149> water

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
loose and fresh you can tell it's water

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
loose and fresh you can tell it's water
in<00:00:42.750> rocks<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> foliage<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
in rocks and foliage and so have you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.510 
in rocks and foliage and so have you
always<00:00:45.120> painted<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.620> how<00:00:47.280> did<00:00:47.340> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
always painted like that or how did it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.610 
always painted like that or how did it
develop<00:00:47.640> I'd<00:00:48.570> say<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.020> my<00:00:49.140> natural

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
develop I'd say that my natural

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.930 
develop I'd say that my natural
inclination<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.180> tight<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.699> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
inclination is really to be tight and so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.850 
inclination is really to be tight and so
it's<00:00:54.360> something<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.750> fight<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.289> even

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
it's something I fight because even

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.319 
it's something I fight because even
though<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.219> natural<00:00:56.399> inclination<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
though it's my natural inclination it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.240 
though it's my natural inclination it
doesn't<00:00:57.660> mean<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.039> want

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
doesn't mean that I that's what I want

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.529 
doesn't mean that I that's what I want
my<00:00:59.370> paintings<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:02.480> I've<00:01:03.480> just

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
landscapes have you always painted

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.709 
landscapes have you always painted
landscapes<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> think<00:02:03.540> when<00:02:03.689> I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
landscapes you know I think when I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.999 
landscapes you know I think when I
started<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.710> tried<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.969> failed<00:02:07.009> landscapes

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
started I tried and I failed landscapes

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.720 
started I tried and I failed landscapes
are<00:02:08.250> probably<00:02:09.770> one<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> hardest<00:02:11.370> things

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
are probably one of the hardest things

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.970 
are probably one of the hardest things
to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.710 
to
hey<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.159> think<00:02:12.459> because<00:02:12.879> it's<00:02:13.000> hard<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.360> find<00:02:13.569> a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
hey I think because it's hard to find a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.890 
hey I think because it's hard to find a
focal<00:02:13.900> point<00:02:14.909> so<00:02:15.909> actually<00:02:16.299> I<00:02:16.360> started

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
focal point so actually I started

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.710 
focal point so actually I started
painting<00:02:17.409> portraits<00:02:17.980> more<00:02:18.700> than<00:02:18.970> landscapes

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
painting portraits more than landscapes

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.670 
painting portraits more than landscapes
and<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.760> think<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.060> easier<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.870> some<00:02:22.930> ways<00:02:23.200> to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
and I think it's easier in some ways to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.550 
and I think it's easier in some ways to
do<00:02:23.799> a<00:02:23.830> portrait<00:02:24.099> because<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.629> have

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
do a portrait because you I have

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.680 
do a portrait because you I have
something<00:02:26.920> really<00:02:27.159> solid<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:28.269> build<00:02:28.480> your

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
something really solid to build your

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.080 
something really solid to build your
composition<00:02:29.319> on<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:30.340> don't<00:02:30.489> have<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.790> look<00:02:31.030> so

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
composition on you don't have to look so

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.250 
composition on you don't have to look so
hard<00:02:31.569> for<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.080> four<00:02:32.920> center<00:02:33.549> of<00:02:33.640> interest<00:02:34.260> built

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
hard for a four center of interest built

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500 
hard for a four center of interest built
in<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:36.220> course<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.879> problems<00:02:37.299> of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
in of course you have the problems of

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.080 
in of course you have the problems of
anatomy<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.410> getting<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.430> eyes<00:02:39.579> and<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
anatomy and getting the eyes and the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.819 
anatomy and getting the eyes and the
nose<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.660> right<00:02:40.840> place<00:02:41.220> but

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
nose in the right place but

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.979 
nose in the right place but
compositionally<00:02:45.150> landscapes<00:02:46.150> are<00:02:46.450> harder<00:02:46.959> I

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
compositionally landscapes are harder I

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.890 
compositionally landscapes are harder I
think<00:02:47.760> hmm<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:48.940> how<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.390> been<00:02:49.540> able<00:02:49.720> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
think hmm so how have you been able to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.990 
think hmm so how have you been able to
kind<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.470> get<00:02:50.709> yourself<00:02:51.129> into<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.790> mode<00:02:51.970> of

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
kind of get yourself into the mode of

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.150 
kind of get yourself into the mode of
being<00:02:52.870> able<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.140> understand<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.950> landscape

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
being able to understand the landscape

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.180 
being able to understand the landscape
and<00:02:54.700> feel<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.180> know<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.390> live<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:56.190> Phoenix

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and feel it I know you live in Phoenix

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.430 
and feel it I know you live in Phoenix
and<00:02:57.310> you've<00:02:57.430> talked<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.790> little<00:02:57.940> bit<00:02:58.120> about

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
and you've talked a little bit about

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.140 
and you've talked a little bit about
hikes<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.739> just<00:02:59.950> being<00:03:00.250> out<00:03:00.430> in<00:03:00.609> nature<00:03:00.640> is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
hikes and just being out in nature is

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
hikes and just being out in nature is
that<00:03:01.359> sort<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:01.750> where<00:03:02.019> you've<00:03:02.290> grown<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.129> know

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
that sort of where you've grown to know

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.559 
that sort of where you've grown to know
and<00:03:03.370> learn<00:03:04.299> how<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.510> express<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:06.329> well<00:03:07.329> let's

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
and learn how to express it well let's

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.530 
and learn how to express it well let's
see<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:09.519> know<00:03:09.640> they<00:03:09.760> say<00:03:09.790> paint<00:03:10.359> what<00:03:10.450> you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
see you know they say paint what you

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.960 
see you know they say paint what you
know<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.109> you<00:03:11.500> do<00:03:11.769> have<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.280> get<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.609> know<00:03:12.790> it

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
know so you do have to get to know it

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.039 
know so you do have to get to know it
and<00:03:13.859> so<00:03:14.859> I<00:03:15.220> do<00:03:15.370> try<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.760> spend<00:03:16.090> as<00:03:16.150> much<00:03:16.359> time<00:03:16.419> as

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
and so I do try to spend as much time as

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.979 
and so I do try to spend as much time as
I<00:03:17.079> can<00:03:18.780> out<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:20.169> the<00:03:20.290> landscape<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.870> be

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
I can out in the landscape and to be

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.680 
I can out in the landscape and to be
honest<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.650> spend<00:03:23.980> most<00:03:24.099> of<00:03:24.310> my<00:03:24.370> my<00:03:25.299> painting

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
honest I spend most of my my painting

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.890 
honest I spend most of my my painting
time<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.169> studio<00:03:26.410> because<00:03:26.859> it's<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.130> not

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
time in the studio because it's just not

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.280 
time in the studio because it's just not
easy<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.310> out<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.450> landscape<00:03:31.660> all<00:03:32.139> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
easy to be out in the landscape all the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.250 
easy to be out in the landscape all the
time<00:03:33.419> but<00:03:34.560> as<00:03:35.560> far<00:03:35.829> as<00:03:36.329> for<00:03:37.329> instance<00:03:37.660> painting

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
time but as far as for instance painting

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.759 
time but as far as for instance painting
the<00:03:38.609> streams<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.970> creeks<00:03:40.389> I<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:41.410> spent<00:03:41.680> a

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
the streams and creeks I have spent a

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.509 
the streams and creeks I have spent a
lot<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.010> time<00:03:42.959> sitting<00:03:43.959> on<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.650> on<00:03:45.099> a<00:03:45.160> rock<00:03:45.489> in

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
lot of time sitting on the on a rock in

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.990 
lot of time sitting on the on a rock in
the<00:03:45.790> middle<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.299> stream<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.880> feeling<00:03:48.880> the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
the middle of the stream and feeling the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.720 
the middle of the stream and feeling the
cold<00:03:49.180> Rock<00:03:49.599> listening<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.620> water<00:03:50.829> just

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
cold Rock listening to the water just

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.970 
cold Rock listening to the water just
watching<00:03:52.419> it<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:52.750> trying<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.319> internalize<00:03:53.919> it

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
watching it and trying to internalize it

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.690 
watching it and trying to internalize it
because<00:03:55.470> if<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.889> try<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.849> paint<00:03:58.180> moving<00:03:59.019> water

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
because if you try to paint moving water

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.990 
because if you try to paint moving water
without<00:04:00.700> really<00:04:01.000> knowing<00:04:01.329> about<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:03.579> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
without really knowing about it the the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.559 
without really knowing about it the the
shapes<00:04:04.359> are<00:04:04.660> so<00:04:05.669> there<00:04:06.669> are<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:06.910> many<00:04:07.090> shapes

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
shapes are so there are so many shapes

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.039 
shapes are so there are so many shapes
and<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.260> water<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.620> moving<00:04:08.829> so<00:04:09.220> fast<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:10.209> you

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
and the water is moving so fast and you

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.009 
and the water is moving so fast and you
just<00:04:11.260> get<00:04:11.530> very<00:04:11.829> it's<00:04:12.099> very<00:04:12.190> confusing<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.930> you

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
just get very it's very confusing so you

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.550 
just get very it's very confusing so you
have<00:04:14.199> to<00:04:14.440> really<00:04:14.650> learn<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:16.449> feel<00:04:17.260> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
have to really learn to feel the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.020 
have to really learn to feel the
movement<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.039> water<00:04:18.220> as<00:04:18.519> well<00:04:18.760> as

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
movement of the water as well as
