00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
purposes of this demo we're going to

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.160 
purposes of this demo we're going to
organize<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.760> photography<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.749> our<00:00:54.870> video

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
organize a photography and our video

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.009 
organize a photography and our video
workflow<00:00:55.679> using<00:00:55.890> spaces<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:57.690> add<00:00:57.839> an

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
workflow using spaces to add an

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.259 
workflow using spaces to add an
application<00:00:58.679> to<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> certain<00:00:59.550> space<00:00:59.789> all<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
application to a certain space all you

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.189 
application to a certain space all you
have<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.690> click<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.199> plus<00:01:01.469> button<00:01:01.499> and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
have to do is click the plus button and

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.509 
have to do is click the plus button and
then<00:01:04.199> find<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> application<00:01:04.680> you'd<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
then find the application you'd like to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.300 
then find the application you'd like to
add<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.880> spaces<00:01:07.070> I'll<00:01:08.090> start<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.150> iPhoto<00:01:09.570> I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
add two spaces I'll start with iPhoto I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.770 
add two spaces I'll start with iPhoto I
choose<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.430> photo<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> list<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> add<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
choose I photo from the list and add it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.830 
choose I photo from the list and add it
to<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> space<00:01:13.759> by<00:01:14.759> default<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.450> added<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
to a space by default it's added to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.690 
to a space by default it's added to
space<00:01:16.079> 1<00:01:17.899> i'm<00:01:18.899> also<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> add<00:01:19.740> aperture

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.200 

to<00:01:23.700> space<00:01:23.909> 1<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.579> photo<00:01:26.820> editing

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to space 1 so now my photo editing

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.830 
to space 1 so now my photo editing
applications<00:01:27.840> reside<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.649> space

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
applications reside in the same space

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.670 
applications reside in the same space
now<00:01:30.840> I'll<00:01:30.960> move<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.320> my<00:01:31.409> video

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
now I'll move on to my video

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.420 
now I'll move on to my video
applications<00:01:32.450> again<00:01:33.450> click<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> +<00:01:34.049> button

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.270 

and<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> choose<00:01:39.810> iMovie<00:01:41.090> and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
and I'm going to choose iMovie and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.730 
and I'm going to choose iMovie and
change<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
change this

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.810 
change this
it's<00:01:45.070> assigned<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.579> space<00:01:45.820> too<00:01:47.070> i'm<00:01:48.070> also

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
it's assigned to space too i'm also

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.840 
it's assigned to space too i'm also
going<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.210> add<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:52.170> DVD<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:54.430> space<00:01:54.700> too<00:01:56.789> now<00:01:57.789> you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
going to add I DVD to space too now you

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.300 
going to add I DVD to space too now you
can<00:01:58.030> close<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.869> system<00:01:59.200> preferences<00:01:59.680> window

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
can close the system preferences window

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.460 
can close the system preferences window
and<00:02:02.549> spaces<00:02:03.549> will<00:02:04.299> work<00:02:04.450> automatically<00:02:05.080> once

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
and spaces will work automatically once

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.490 
and spaces will work automatically once
you<00:02:05.619> open<00:02:05.740> those<00:02:05.979> applications<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:08.170> now<00:02:08.289> let's

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
you open those applications so now let's

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.479 
you open those applications so now let's
open<00:02:08.590> iphoto<00:02:10.890> since<00:02:11.890> we're<00:02:12.040> currently<00:02:12.220> in

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
open iphoto since we're currently in

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.259 
open iphoto since we're currently in
space<00:02:12.760> 1<00:02:13.060> by<00:02:13.209> default<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:15.280> opens<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.819> space<00:02:16.030> one

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
space 1 by default it opens in space one

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.360 
space 1 by default it opens in space one
because<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.230> assigned<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.709> space<00:02:18.010> 1<00:02:20.370> by

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
because we assigned it to space 1 by

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.390 
because we assigned it to space 1 by
open<00:02:21.610> aperture<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:23.680> also<00:02:23.920> assigned<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
open aperture it's also assigned to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.270 
open aperture it's also assigned to
space<00:02:24.610> one<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:26.530> resides<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.069> same

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
space one and it resides in the same

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.780 
space one and it resides in the same
space<00:02:27.580> as<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.180> photo<00:02:28.769> now<00:02:29.769> watch<00:02:30.010> when<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:30.489> open

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
space as I photo now watch when I open

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.440 
space as I photo now watch when I open
iMovie<00:02:35.100> leopard<00:02:36.100> switches<00:02:36.519> spaces<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.209> space

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
iMovie leopard switches spaces to space

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.490 
iMovie leopard switches spaces to space
too<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.700> movie<00:02:40.180> separate<00:02:40.630> from<00:02:40.959> iPhoto<00:02:41.380> and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
too so I movie separate from iPhoto and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:53.310 
too so I movie separate from iPhoto and
aperture<00:02:43.230> also<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.500> open<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:44.860> DVD<00:02:52.320> its

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
aperture also if I open I DVD its

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.430 
aperture also if I open I DVD its
present<00:02:53.799> in<00:02:53.859> space<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.310> as<00:02:54.400> well<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.230> if<00:02:56.320> I'm

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
present in space to as well so if I'm
