00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
is no cold all the parts I think the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.930 
is no cold all the parts I think the
next<00:02:29.230> time<00:02:29.650> when<00:02:29.769> i'm<00:02:29.860> going<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.010> try<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.640> a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
next time when i'm going to try is a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.390 
next time when i'm going to try is a
method<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.420> i<00:02:31.600> saw<00:02:31.810> candid<00:02:32.410> ian<00:02:32.680> hughes<00:02:32.980> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
method that i saw candid ian hughes and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.640 
method that i saw candid ian hughes and
that's<00:02:34.000> when<00:02:34.209> she<00:02:34.390> did<00:02:34.540> her<00:02:34.569> flat<00:02:34.989> twists

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
that's when she did her flat twists

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.509 
that's when she did her flat twists
going<00:02:36.360> horizontally<00:02:37.360> vs<00:02:37.959> um<00:02:38.310> yeah<00:02:39.310> they<00:02:39.430> were

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
going horizontally vs um yeah they were

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.430 
going horizontally vs um yeah they were
going<00:02:39.730> horizontally<00:02:40.359> versus<00:02:40.690> vertically<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
going horizontally versus vertically and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.979 
going horizontally versus vertically and
so<00:02:42.280> what<00:02:42.670> she<00:02:42.850> was<00:02:43.030> saying<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.420> if<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.690> do<00:02:43.840> it

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
so what she was saying is if you do it

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.020 
so what she was saying is if you do it
horizontally<00:02:44.950> which<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.310> going<00:02:45.609> straight

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
horizontally which is going straight

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.099 
horizontally which is going straight
across<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:47.799> know<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.579> in<00:02:48.820> rose<00:02:49.239> versus

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
across you know like in rose versus

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.030 
across you know like in rose versus
going<00:02:50.290> down<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:51.940> columns<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.799> hair

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
going down like in columns that the hair

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.670 
going down like in columns that the hair
will<00:02:54.250> fall<00:02:54.549> over<00:02:54.940> top<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.600> each<00:02:55.870> other<00:02:56.109> and<00:02:56.500> so

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
will fall over top of each other and so

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.310 
will fall over top of each other and so
that<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:56.890> don't<00:02:57.040> have<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.220> problem<00:02:57.519> with<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
that you don't have a problem with the
