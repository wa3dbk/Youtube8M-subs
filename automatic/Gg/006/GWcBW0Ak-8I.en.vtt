 Argentina 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.130

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.400
 the in June 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.250
 never again 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.529
 battles or donations I could grab 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.500
 they can go 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.429
 hp is just his 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.020
 because I became sick to my dear people 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.740
 a personal touch but good 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.469
 on the other hand 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.820
 it has something to do with it is that it costs 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.480
 the therapy 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.060
 pirlo 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.210
 we perished 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.210
 to offer such a device 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.650
 the Union 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.680
 This is though he has announced that since screen 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.850
 kieft was bugged keyboard he told me to be very bold at the lock 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.670
 steps 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.950
 this is so I understood 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.000
 a full keyboard 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.159
 target church 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.280
 that saves with scroll function 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.220
 m 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.360
 asse lennik we think judges common popped amersfoort 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.170
 puncture 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.110
 then combine the two in one fell swoop 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.080
 further it is before you leave after click here to show this 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.710
 we immediately see a new book in it 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.970
 and talk to the press 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.140
 how so 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.390
 has a number of very small children 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.970
 the fourth generation is that they are nothing 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.400
 in sight 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.200
 did you see here 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.410
 I guess a see 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.010
 why 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.659
 it is not excluded we have the headphones 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.280
 there is and not for a couple combine standing 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560
 he feeds 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.490
 twice and dsb this is not necessary 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.880
 in ten years he gets with her offspring 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.380
 that's why there is one 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.700
 carries the budget 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.020
 I have a contract 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.530
 the pope 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.379
 well the power supply 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.089
 thank you later 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:14.599
 then first this gives an answer to the ones that don't go out 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.959
 and that it work 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.209
 This makes it very much fun to enable the work 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.429
 what to say 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.530
 for carrying casey along 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.959
 the screen one year 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.679
 To go can be more and more the Korean Ki Moon can go to work on 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.119
 cocu plasma or on an LCD TV 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.390
 the reason why that twente is forwarded 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.949
 and those I have I have ever heard 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.759
 there will be a separate offer of our papers to a psychiatrist 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.229
 now the coast guard is 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.159
 something bigger 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.109
 therefore it stood after the book 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.509
 so we work standard with the xtips for example 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.509
 the samsung nc10 putin 2 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.539
 being a city and one session 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.019
 the service gun 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.119
 of things that have their legs here 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.939
 a session 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.229
 that difference 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.569
 nevertheless the bill 6 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.899
 it is indeed the case that the 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.899
 hp mini 311c something happens 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:23.009
 Naturally also in movies the Samsung NC10 is the resolution going 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.779
 these kids got 600 pixels 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.419
 sit here with one 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.419
 this mission of thirteen 166 pixels 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.379
 we see what has been said said that 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.369
 I hope not to be his client 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.369
 at the moment surface 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.469
 in addition and that finds work at the bottom to the dealers at the front 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.739
 do you have speaker sets always acknowledged 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:53.249
 That's lucky he contracted the Deen that you can stand in every day 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.559
 see the book 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.859
 Now the device is purchased for a famous name in the US 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.609
 van den ende map below schaaij below is that construction the euro 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.019
 it may be that the incident is not 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.220
 and with the book to put with this plane Kamperveen pilot to co 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.289
 thanks to his own ideas for chipset 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.209
 I have you one 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.850
 the municipality it is also just some children can do a number of things besides 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.959
 anyway 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.850
 it is for example though the photographer and traffic clear view 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.360
 show a nice idea 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.569
 the slopes what is it about 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.639
 this time three of the fair recommended the standard that is also not necessary 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.229
 did very bad scores 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.830
 but also in terms of performance thanks to that and offer jantje 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.759
 sporty fantastic good 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.810
 the details are even more robust 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.279
 this netbook 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.759
 You might be DDR2 Ram Marie Decker who you are so it may be 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.840
 just a bit further out 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.000
 otherwise it is true that when you wish 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.550
 a contraction that duel 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.050
 the circus will pay 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.740
 for students 3 transics 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.800
 and that the cia 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 something that we definitely come up with 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.330
 I think it works 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.669
 it worked 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.669
 depiction of atypical myopathy 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.539

 who first saved everything that 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.210
 People who heard something serve as netbooks as well as laptops 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.599
 for instance 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.759
 merckens don't 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.469
