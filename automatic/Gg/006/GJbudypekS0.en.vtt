where I could still see myself carrying
this<00:00:48.270> when<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:49.320> 50<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:51.920> that's<00:00:52.920> why<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.100> about

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
this when I'm 50 so that's why I'm about

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.939 
this when I'm 50 so that's why I'm about
this<00:00:53.460> bag<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.320> let<00:00:55.320> me<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.620> tell<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this bag and let me just tell you a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.819 
this bag and let me just tell you a
little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.190> about<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.379> four<00:00:58.379> sizes

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
little bit about it there are four sizes

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.790 
little bit about it there are four sizes
I<00:00:58.949> think<00:00:58.980> there's<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> 25<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> 30<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.570> 35<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> 40

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
I think there's a 25 a 30 or 35 and a 40

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.109 
I think there's a 25 a 30 or 35 and a 40
I<00:01:02.039> believe<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> said<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> 30<00:01:05.119> if

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I believe like I said this is the 30 if

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.770 
I believe like I said this is the 30 if
you<00:01:06.270> guys<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.689> kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.770> size<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
you guys can kind of see the size of it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
you guys can kind of see the size of it
and<00:01:10.310> I<00:01:11.420> originally<00:01:12.420> ordered<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:13.200> 35<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.070 
and I originally ordered the 35 and it
was<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.150> big<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.540> sort<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.840> felt<00:01:16.020> like

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
was just so big it sort of felt like

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.590 
was just so big it sort of felt like
luggage<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.430> sent<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> back<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.240> got<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
luggage so I sent it back and I got the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.870 
luggage so I sent it back and I got the
30<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> actually<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> perfect<00:01:20.549> size

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
30 and this is actually the perfect size

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
30 and this is actually the perfect size
I'm<00:01:21.240> used<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> those<00:01:21.840> big<00:01:22.049> tote<00:01:22.259> bags<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.770> this

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I'm used to those big tote bags and this

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
I'm used to those big tote bags and this
carries<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.640> ton<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.509> it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
carries a ton of you can see in there it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.690 
carries a ton of you can see in there it
does<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> red<00:01:28.290> interior<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
does have the red interior this is the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.109 
does have the red interior this is the
dumb<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.600> yay<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.259> Benigno<00:01:32.070> me<00:01:32.220> am<00:01:32.610> evany

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
dumb and yay a Benigno me am evany

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
dumb and yay a Benigno me am evany
something<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> checked<00:01:34.229> pattern

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
something like that the checked pattern

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.740 
something like that the checked pattern
so<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> checked<00:01:35.759> ones<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.119> believe<00:01:36.360> come<00:01:36.600> with

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
so the checked ones I believe come with

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.730 
so the checked ones I believe come with
the<00:01:36.869> red<00:01:37.049> interior<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.509> dark<00:01:40.500> leather

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the red interior and the dark leather

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.490 
the red interior and the dark leather
handles<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> reason<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.110> went<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
handles so the reason I went with this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.600 
handles so the reason I went with this
pattern<00:01:43.740> instead<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> traditional

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
pattern instead of the traditional

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.130 
pattern instead of the traditional
monogram<00:01:45.570> pattern<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:48.140> handles

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
monogram pattern is because the handles

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.280 
monogram pattern is because the handles
on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.130> monogram<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:51.509> darker<00:01:51.899> over<00:01:51.990> time

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
on the monogram get darker over time

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.389 
on the monogram get darker over time
which<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.619> believe<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.979> called

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
which I believe is called

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.789 
which I believe is called
patina<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:55.950> didn't<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> look<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.799> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
patina and I didn't like the look of the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.289 
patina and I didn't like the look of the
darkening<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> oils<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.180> your

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
darkening like from the oils and your

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
the bag in in a nutshell I guess so I

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.130 
the bag in in a nutshell I guess so I
will<00:03:33.390> tell<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.720> kind<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.820> my<00:03:35.820> my<00:03:36.600> thoughts<00:03:36.870> on

will tell you kind of my my thoughts on
the<00:03:37.260> bag<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.740> absolutely<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.490> think<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.850> super

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the bag I absolutely I think it's super

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.330 
the bag I absolutely I think it's super
professional<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:40.350> classic<00:03:41.010> like<00:03:41.220> I

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
professional and classic like I

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.300 
professional and classic like I
mentioned<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:42.870> perfect<00:03:43.410> for<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:44.040> out<00:03:44.160> to

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
mentioned it's perfect for going out to

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.650 
mentioned it's perfect for going out to
dinner<00:03:44.490> or<00:03:44.610> going<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.180> event<00:03:45.630> or<00:03:46.140> any<00:03:47.070> time

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
dinner or going to event or any time

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.240 
dinner or going to event or any time
that<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:49.020> think<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:49.380> sort<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.650> pulls<00:03:50.010> your

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
that I think it just sort of pulls your

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.400 
that I think it just sort of pulls your
whole<00:03:50.430> look<00:03:50.610> together<00:03:50.900> but<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.930> think<00:03:52.080> it's

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
whole look together but I think it's

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.840 
whole look together but I think it's
only<00:03:52.680> great<00:03:53.070> if<00:03:53.280> you're<00:03:53.400> not<00:03:53.550> going<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.760> be

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
only great if you're not going to be

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.930 
only great if you're not going to be
wearing<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.390> bag<00:03:54.570> for<00:03:55.130> long<00:03:56.130> period<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.670> time

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
wearing the bag for long period of time

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.330 
wearing the bag for long period of time
because<00:03:57.720> it's<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.080> top<00:03:58.290> handle<00:03:58.680> bag<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.250> you

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
because it's a top handle bag and you

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.980 
because it's a top handle bag and you
carry<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.790> in<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.060> crook<00:04:00.240> of<00:04:00.390> your<00:04:00.450> arm

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
carry it in the crook of your arm

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.190 
carry it in the crook of your arm
it<00:04:01.800> essentially<00:04:02.730> renders<00:04:03.180> one<00:04:03.420> arm<00:04:03.660> useless

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
it essentially renders one arm useless

with me but just have it looked at but
it's<00:05:57.630> just<00:05:57.870> not<00:05:58.169> super<00:05:58.470> practical<00:05:59.040> for

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
it's just not super practical for

that in other youtube reviews that I

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.410 
that in other youtube reviews that I
looked<00:07:24.460> at<00:07:24.580> before<00:07:24.820> I<00:07:24.850> bought<00:07:25.030> it<00:07:25.180> and<00:07:25.240> I<00:07:25.300> was

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.420 
looked at before I bought it and I was

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.070 
looked at before I bought it and I was
like<00:07:25.540> I'll<00:07:26.140> be<00:07:26.320> fine<00:07:26.650> and<00:07:27.360> I<00:07:28.360> was<00:07:28.780> showed<00:07:28.930> of

listened<00:07:29.440> but<00:07:30.370> I<00:07:30.640> do<00:07:30.730> think<00:07:31.000> even<00:07:31.270> if<00:07:31.330> I<00:07:31.420> had

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:31.540 
listened but I do think even if I had

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.850 
listened but I do think even if I had
bought<00:07:31.690> the<00:07:31.870> number<00:07:32.110> four<00:07:32.350> I<00:07:32.620> would<00:07:32.770> have

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
bought the number four I would have

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.260 
bought the number four I would have
eventually<00:07:33.100> gone<00:07:33.520> back<00:07:33.730> and<00:07:33.910> gotten<00:07:33.970> the

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.270 
eventually gone back and gotten the

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.430 
eventually gone back and gotten the
sweetie<00:07:34.600> I<00:07:35.370> just<00:07:36.370> think<00:07:36.610> it's<00:07:36.760> so<00:07:37.260> like<00:07:38.260> I<00:07:38.380> said

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 
sweetie I just think it's so like I said
