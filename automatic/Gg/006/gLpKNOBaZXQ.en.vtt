pieces<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:52.030> I'm<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.329> going<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.540> glue<00:03:52.720> these

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
pieces so I'm just going to glue these

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.090 
pieces so I'm just going to glue these
individual<00:03:53.560> pieces<00:03:53.859> on<00:03:55.500> my<00:03:56.500> lower<00:03:56.739> lashes

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
individual pieces on my lower lashes

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.520 
individual pieces on my lower lashes
which<00:03:57.670> is<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.970> very<00:03:58.329> thin<00:03:58.840> drop<00:03:59.109> of<00:03:59.290> glue<00:03:59.500> and

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
which is the very thin drop of glue and

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.259 
which is the very thin drop of glue and
try<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.590> find<00:04:02.890> ones<00:04:03.130> that<00:04:03.250> aren't<00:04:03.640> like<00:04:03.790> crazy

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
try to find ones that aren't like crazy

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.580 
try to find ones that aren't like crazy
long<00:04:05.400> but<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.820> know<00:04:07.290> they're<00:04:08.290> obviously

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
long but you know they're obviously

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.140 
long but you know they're obviously
gonna<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:08.799> longer<00:04:09.010> because<00:04:09.220> lower<00:04:09.579> lashes<00:04:09.820> are

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
gonna be longer because lower lashes are

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.630 
gonna be longer because lower lashes are
usually<00:04:10.540> shorter<00:04:10.900> but<00:04:11.220> don't<00:04:12.220> get<00:04:12.340> ones<00:04:12.549> that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
usually shorter but don't get ones that

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.090 
usually shorter but don't get ones that
are<00:04:12.730> crazy<00:04:12.970> long<00:04:13.269> let<00:04:14.109> it<00:04:14.230> get<00:04:14.380> tacky<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.829> little

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
are crazy long let it get tacky a little

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.650 
are crazy long let it get tacky a little
bit<00:04:15.220> once<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:15.820> put<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.060> glue<00:04:16.239> on<00:04:16.269> and

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
bit once you put the glue on and

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.770 
bit once you put the glue on and
basically<00:04:17.789> we're<00:04:18.789> going<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.000> actually<00:04:19.419> put
