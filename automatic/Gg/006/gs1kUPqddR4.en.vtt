was<00:01:12.979> basically<00:01:13.340> trying<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.910> create<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.740> free

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
was basically trying to create a free

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.270 
was basically trying to create a free
ride<00:01:15.950> sliding<00:01:16.880> wheel<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.860> from<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.979> reviews

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
ride sliding wheel and from the reviews

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.380 
ride sliding wheel and from the reviews
that<00:01:19.310> I've<00:01:19.520> seen<00:01:19.729> in<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:19.970> feedback<00:01:20.180> that

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
that I've seen in the feedback that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.660 
that I've seen in the feedback that
people<00:01:20.840> have<00:01:20.930> given<00:01:21.220> they've<00:01:22.220> completely

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
people have given they've completely

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.570 
people have given they've completely
accomplish<00:01:23.180> their<00:01:23.390> task<00:01:24.010> they<00:01:25.010> have<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
accomplish their task they have a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.540 
accomplish their task they have a
contact<00:01:26.090> patch<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.660> 43<00:01:27.200> millimeters<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:27.890> are

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
contact patch of 43 millimeters and are

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.070 
contact patch of 43 millimeters and are
70<00:01:29.240> millimeters<00:01:29.690> tall<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.790> got<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.910> 81<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.600> zero

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
70 millimeters tall I got the 81 a zero

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.560 
70 millimeters tall I got the 81 a zero
but<00:01:33.740> they<00:01:33.950> come<00:01:34.190> in<00:01:34.700> they<00:01:35.270> also<00:01:35.420> come<00:01:35.750> in<00:01:36.100> 75<00:01:37.100> a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
but they come in they also come in 75 a

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.999 
but they come in they also come in 75 a
78<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.020> 84<00:01:40.720> they<00:01:41.720> are<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:41.930> side<00:01:42.259> set<00:01:42.560> wheel<00:01:42.740> as

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
78 a and 84 they are a side set wheel as

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.160 
78 a and 84 they are a side set wheel as
you<00:01:43.220> can<00:01:43.369> see<00:01:43.550> they<00:01:43.729> are<00:01:43.759> completely<00:01:44.240> side<00:01:44.869> set

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
you can see they are completely side set

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.330 
you can see they are completely side set
and<00:01:46.960> it's<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:48.140> disadvantage<00:01:48.740> because<00:01:48.770> once

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
and it's a disadvantage because once

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.790 
and it's a disadvantage because once
they<00:01:49.460> start<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.790> cone<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:51.140> you're<00:01:51.380> not<00:01:51.530> going

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
they start to cone that you're not going

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.380 
they start to cone that you're not going
to<00:01:51.890> be<00:01:51.979> able<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.190> flip<00:01:52.430> them<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.210> really

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
to be able to flip them so it really

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.310 
to be able to flip them so it really
reduces<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.990> lifespan<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:56.080> because<00:01:57.080> they<00:01:57.289> are

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
reduces of lifespan but because they are

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.230 
reduces of lifespan but because they are
side<00:01:57.710> set<00:01:57.979> all<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.369> pressure<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.850> going<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.149> be

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
side set all the pressure is going to be

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.940 
side set all the pressure is going to be
on<00:01:59.420> this<00:01:59.600> one<00:01:59.899> side<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.410> wheel<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.860> is

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
on this one side of the wheel and is

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.800 
on this one side of the wheel and is
allow<00:02:01.160> you<00:02:01.220> is<00:02:01.550> going<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:01.970> allow<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.600> break

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
allow you is going to allow you to break

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.870 
allow you is going to allow you to break
into<00:02:03.020> your<00:02:03.110> slides<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.770> lot<00:02:03.979> easier<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.700> lot
