unfortunately<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.580> short-lived<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.450> feels

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
unfortunately it's short-lived and feels

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.630 
unfortunately it's short-lived and feels
like<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.080> campaign<00:02:37.620> will<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.040> better<00:02:38.280> suited

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
like the campaign will be better suited

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.510 
like the campaign will be better suited

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520
