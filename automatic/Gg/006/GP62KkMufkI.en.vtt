00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
you put a firm pressure on the look of

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.930 
you put a firm pressure on the look of
the<00:02:50.170> hair<00:02:51.170> because<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:52.100> will<00:02:52.460> kind<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.730> help

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
the hair because that will kind of help

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.660 
the hair because that will kind of help
you<00:02:53.440> distribute<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.770> heat<00:02:54.980> on<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.400> every

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
you distribute the heat on to every

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.860 
you distribute the heat on to every
strand<00:02:56.410> if<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:57.860> literally<00:02:58.220> do<00:02:58.490> that

strand if you just literally do that

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.120 
strand if you just literally do that
then<00:02:59.870> you're<00:03:00.110> not<00:03:00.230> going<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.650> get<00:03:00.770> your<00:03:00.950> hair

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
straighten up so you need to really pay
