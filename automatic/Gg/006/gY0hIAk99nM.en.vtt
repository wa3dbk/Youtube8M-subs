this<00:00:54.670> one's<00:00:54.879> grey<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:56.620> dubbing<00:00:57.039> what<00:00:57.730> we

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
this one's grey for the dubbing what we

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.400 
this one's grey for the dubbing what we
do<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:59.350> get<00:00:59.649> a<00:00:59.710> piece<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:03.479> tower<00:01:04.479> wing<00:01:04.809> and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
do we get a piece of the tower wing and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.330 
do we get a piece of the tower wing and
you<00:01:05.500> can<00:01:05.710> use<00:01:06.210> polygons<00:01:07.210> or<00:01:07.590> any<00:01:08.590> synthetic

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
you can use polygons or any synthetic

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.359 
you can use polygons or any synthetic
walls<00:01:09.899> cut<00:01:10.899> it<00:01:11.050> into<00:01:12.360> strips<00:01:13.360> about<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:15.220> or

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
walls cut it into strips about one or

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.770 
walls cut it into strips about one or
two<00:01:15.399> centimetres<00:01:16.210> long<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:19.330> we<00:01:19.420> roll<00:01:19.630> it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
two centimetres long and then we roll it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.789 
two centimetres long and then we roll it
into<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:19.990> ball<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:23.020> that's<00:01:23.200> what<00:01:23.439> forms<00:01:23.680> our

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
into a ball and that's what forms our

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
into a ball and that's what forms our
dubbing<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.810> designed<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:30.009> represent

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
dubbing so is designed to represent

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.149 
dubbing so is designed to represent
caddis<00:01:33.150> generally<00:01:34.150> fish<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.630> in<00:01:34.810> faster<00:01:35.799> water

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
caddis generally fish it in faster water

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:44.550 
caddis generally fish it in faster water
so<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.560> want<00:01:38.740> body<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:41.490> heavy<00:01:42.490> point<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
so you want body to the heavy point so

00:01:44.560 --> 00:02:15.050 
so you want body to the heavy point so
not<00:01:45.009> looking<00:01:45.310> at<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:46.979> sparsely<00:01:47.979> tied<00:01:48.369> fly

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.080 

is<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.860> good<00:02:16.860> fast<00:02:17.250> water<00:02:17.520> fly<00:02:19.580> also<00:02:20.580> works<00:02:20.849> in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
is a good fast water fly also works in

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.699 
is a good fast water fly also works in
the<00:02:21.500> smaller<00:02:23.120> glides<00:02:24.120> bring<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.140> up<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.410> dark

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the smaller glides bring it up on dark

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:39.650 
the smaller glides bring it up on dark
water

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.700 

dubbing<00:02:41.400> Ruiz<00:02:42.400> will<00:02:42.910> weigh<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.560> look

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
dubbing Ruiz will weigh up you look

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.860 
dubbing Ruiz will weigh up you look
better<00:02:44.830> space<00:02:45.310> because<00:02:46.120> we're<00:02:46.300> gonna<00:02:46.450> put<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
better space because we're gonna put the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.670 
better space because we're gonna put the
wing<00:02:47.080> on<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:50.710> hook<00:02:51.040> reasonably<00:02:51.610> clear<00:02:52.680> so

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
wing on the hook reasonably clear so

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.630 
wing on the hook reasonably clear so
that's<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> body<00:02:54.540> now<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.860> wing<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.400> out<00:02:57.550> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
that's the body now the wing is out the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.330 
that's the body now the wing is out the
same<00:02:57.850> material<00:02:58.650> which<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.770> one<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> nice

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
same material which is one of the nice

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.900 
same material which is one of the nice
things<00:03:00.370> about<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:01.000> particular<00:03:01.840> fly<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:03.730> it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
things about this particular fly is it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.960 
things about this particular fly is it
only<00:03:04.030> uses<00:03:07.020> one<00:03:08.020> of<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.260> material<00:03:08.850> apart<00:03:09.850> from

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
only uses one of the material apart from

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.490 
only uses one of the material apart from
the<00:03:10.120> thread<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:14.460> so<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.610> wing<00:03:16.080> this<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.230> three

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
the thread so so the wing this is three

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.590 
the thread so so the wing this is three
strands<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.310> yarn

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.310 

personal<00:03:22.600> choices<00:03:22.900> -<00:03:23.170> how<00:03:23.230> much<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.440> use<00:03:25.320> the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
personal choices - how much you use the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:42.450 
personal choices - how much you use the
wing<00:03:26.560> goes<00:03:26.830> on<00:03:27.220> one<00:03:27.850> side<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.450> hook<00:03:41.460> trap

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
wing goes on one side of the hook trap

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.180 
wing goes on one side of the hook trap
the<00:03:42.610> wing<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.930> couple<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.320> fairly<00:03:44.920> tight

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
the wing and a couple of fairly tight

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.890 
the wing and a couple of fairly tight
turns<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:49.750> wing<00:03:49.960> is<00:03:51.510> about<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.660> same<00:03:52.870> length

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
turns the wing is about the same length

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.120 
turns the wing is about the same length
as<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.380> body<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.060> offcut<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:56.950> get

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
as the body and the offcut can get

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.860 
as the body and the offcut can get
rolled<00:03:57.370> up<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.620> use<00:03:59.920> for<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.250> dubbing

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.540 

in<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:05.560> front<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.300> wing<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:11.310> really<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
in the front of the wing is really the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.080 
in the front of the wing is really the
point<00:04:13.150> fly<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.980> they<00:04:15.099> didn't<00:04:15.340> feel<00:04:15.610> struggling

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
point fly so they didn't feel struggling

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:32.930 
point fly so they didn't feel struggling
this<00:04:16.709> isn't<00:04:17.709> that<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:18.040> be<00:04:22.530> don't<00:04:23.530> see

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:05:16.820 

yeah

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.750 

you<00:05:17.400> don't

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
you don't

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.390 
you don't
it's<00:05:19.210> been<00:05:19.420> too<00:05:19.660> long<00:05:20.110> tiling<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.770> fly<00:05:21.040> up

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
it's been too long tiling the fly up

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.280 
it's been too long tiling the fly up
it's<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:25.000> loose<00:05:25.240> fibers<00:05:25.690> tend<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.990> give<00:05:26.140> it<00:05:26.230> a

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
it's the loose fibers tend to give it a

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.990 
it's the loose fibers tend to give it a
bit<00:05:26.410> more<00:05:26.440> life<00:05:26.800> in<00:05:26.980> the<00:05:27.070> water<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:27.760> they

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
bit more life in the water and they

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.080 
bit more life in the water and they
certainly<00:05:28.240> add<00:05:28.510> to<00:05:28.540> the<00:05:28.660> buoyancy<00:05:29.280> so<00:05:30.280> yeah

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
certainly add to the buoyancy so yeah

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.310
