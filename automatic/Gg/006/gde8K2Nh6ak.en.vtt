00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
go in here again and look for it's gonna

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.270 
go in here again and look for it's gonna
be<00:03:17.519> in<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.730> different<00:03:17.760> place<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:20.010> code

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
be in a different place that that code
