00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.429
 I had just seen in the series of the 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.530
 exercise for the regular services of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.940
 two now we have the possibility of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.730
 touch all possible combinations 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.590
 using three different fingers of the hand 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.020
 left thinking that this is the one 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.480
 this is two the three and this is the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.700
 four like that before skillfully want twelve 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.900
 the combinations 12 13 14 21 23 24 31 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.850
 32 and 34 41 42 and 43 now we have many 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.859
 more combinations would be in 24 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.629
 combinations are going to have them all 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.019
 written here at the foot of the video is not 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.659
 worry or you can also see in the 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.460
 screen are all written with gel in 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:49.309
 the video a little while there and the things and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.510
 well they are 24 we said 123 for example not 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.999
 also always leaving the fingers 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.999
 stepped on you do not need to lift anything 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.070
 London 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.990
 but no 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.080
 why it would be important to think I touch 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.080
 123 I can not feel any 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:39.799
 as center the 22 between the 3 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.080
 I know that those 24 combinations are going away 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.890
 to 72 it is said just 123 now we can 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.890
 do 1 3 2 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.760
 and then we have one 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.790
 1 1 2 3 132 we can do 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.219
 124 are 6 combinations that start 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.560
 with finger 16 combinations that start 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.629
 with the 26 finger with the 3 and others there are 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.420
 combinations with the 4 is said 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.420
 12 31 32 can now be 12 4 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.120
 Then I have 142 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.880
 then I have 2 3 4 and 11 34 sorry 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.800
 then I have 143 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.760
 those are the first six combinations 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:28.879
 of the finger one after we have from the of 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.879
 we all have 2 1 3 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.800
 231 than others 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.830
 do not 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.019
 then we have 214 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.989
 if we have 214 it means that we have 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.989
 241 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.090
 then we have say 21 the two 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.920
 the two currents with him and then we 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.920
 243 left 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.860
 and then we have two three four 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:37.309
 d 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:37.309
 now let's go to finger three we have 3 1 2 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.720
 314 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.300
 31 23 14 after we have 3 2 1 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.210
 yes 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.290
 then we have three tenths 321 324 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.290
 this is more difficult 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.169
 then we have 341 as the 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.169
 characteristic of the rosary 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:49.259
 and the last one is also difficult 342 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.259
 it is characteristic santafesina 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.190
 after 4 and 6 combinations 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.190
 from that of 2 441 2 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.070
 4 13 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.060
 4 2 1 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:38.070
 412 we did after 432 when they left 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.980
 finger 1 outside is like that hand 77 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.780
 loses a relationship of location and 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.670
 space that's the hardest thing when the 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:53.790
 one finger does not work and the other is the 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:55.440
 last 423 the coherence of each of 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.640
 the series you can have the situation in the 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.640
 first second third no 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.580
 now I feel in the third 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.890
 13 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.890
 since 2000 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.659
 so we are going to all the 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:22.129
 combinations that this tutorial of the 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:25.300
 series of three fingers very many thanks 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:25.300
 we will see the CD4
