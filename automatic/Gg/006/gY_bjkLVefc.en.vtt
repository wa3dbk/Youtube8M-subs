00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
they transform and and so so I think I

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.430 
they transform and and so so I think I
think<00:01:40.720> there's<00:01:40.869> something<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.170> bit<00:01:41.200> more

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
think there's something a bit more

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.680 
think there's something a bit more
creepy<00:01:41.830> about<00:01:42.099> him<00:01:42.340> being<00:01:42.610> longer<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.179> the

creepy about him being longer and the
fact<00:01:43.899> that<00:01:43.989> he's<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.679> fact<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:44.979> he's<00:01:45.190> so

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
fact that he's the fact that he's so

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.999 
fact that he's the fact that he's so
well-read<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.539> so<00:01:46.869> well<00:01:47.140> because<00:01:47.619> the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
well-read and and so well because the

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.510 
well-read and and so well because the
music<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.440> way<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.770> he<00:01:50.890> speaks<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.459> the

things<00:01:51.729> that<00:01:51.849> he<00:01:52.000> knows<00:01:52.209> I<00:01:52.509> don't<00:01:52.690> think<00:01:52.869> it

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
things that he knows I don't think it

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.749 
things that he knows I don't think it
makes<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.560> don't<00:01:53.860> think<00:01:54.099> it<00:01:54.220> was

that<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.450> wouldn't<00:03:50.380> otherwise<00:03:51.040> have<00:03:51.580> had<00:03:51.790> and

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
that I wouldn't otherwise have had and

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.229 
that I wouldn't otherwise have had and
and<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.630> think<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.349> lot<00:03:53.860> for<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:55.150> I

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
and I think it a lot for that and I

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.570 
and I think it a lot for that and I
don't<00:03:55.690> know<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.780> think<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.140> for<00:03:56.290> everything<00:03:56.580> but

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
don't know I think it for everything but

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.160 
don't know I think it for everything but
I<00:03:57.700> think<00:03:58.180> one<00:03:58.330> of<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.510> main<00:03:58.690> things<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.050> that

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
that I can't imagine not doing it would

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.710 
that I can't imagine not doing it would
ruin<00:04:48.400> me<00:04:48.670> if<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:48.910> couldn't<00:04:49.180> do<00:04:49.270> either<00:04:49.450> of<00:04:49.540> those

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
two things I think the answer is going

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.640 
two things I think the answer is going
to<00:04:52.330> get<00:04:52.480> in<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.630> way<00:04:52.750> it's<00:04:53.080> tough<00:04:53.380> it's

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650
