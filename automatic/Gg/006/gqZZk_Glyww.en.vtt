00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.009
 Who does not want to be an asshole for 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.009
 a scene or sometimes lovingly 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.780
 david you were with this project 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.190
 the heart and soul as it can 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.470
 then for that I have are against the 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.720
 meanwhile two and a half three years 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.780
 together with christian angermayer in the 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.400
 festival in cannes in france after 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.120
 Just have a longer dinner 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.820
 I have a few ideas spun here 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 Of course, as mentioned in many 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.879
 Talks and interviews before the fall 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 Of course that was a big one 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.280
 passion of me frame film music 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.909
 is and paganini is of course one too 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.400
 figure and an incredible 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.970
 Personality in the field of 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.510
 instrumental music 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.720
 Accordingly, I have a little bit 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.530
 also spun that certainly one 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.130
 great project would be especially among the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.240
 circumstances that movies about 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.540
 instrumentalists, in particular violinists 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 never work because the person the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.830
 to see her, so to speak, is just that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 is thus unable to play and thereby 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.979
 For me it's always a feeling of being unwell 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.920
 in the audience is because you feel that it 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.280
 does not work and eat out of this 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.930
 this evening dinner is for april 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.710
 this idea came together with 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.539
 offices written in treatment and now 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.000
 the movie is finished so to speak so it 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.700
 was a very long process of gemini 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.620
 is also a great role model of mine 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.630
 believes everyone has a violinist 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.420
 piece far paganini as a model easy 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 only because of the technical possibilities 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.560
 the technical skills you get 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.180
 must own to play this music 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.800
 are also very important to big 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.080
 to play other music 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.010
 free from technical difficulties 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.010
 to be able to play 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.530
 insofar as I believe for everyone unfortunately 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:30.420
 in a certain part of his 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:32.070
 life paganini very very important with 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.020
 safety was also a lot of nervousness 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:39.000
 but I also have one 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.720
 big thanks say to all the people 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.890
 who have worked in the film because 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.300
 without their confidence and trust 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 which have certainly been more nervous so 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.810
 especially the other actors 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.590
 the jared harris richardson or too 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.030
 Veronica ferres so very many 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.560
 dear colleagues who are in music 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.180
 first line of course appreciated 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.910
 what i made there on stage 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.100
 and of course one 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.780
 far the respect that 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.459
 Confidence have given me too 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.959
 get the other ten right 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:23.459
 did you have the acting lesson yes 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.470
 I actually enjoyed myself 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.690
 had a very very good one very much 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.310
 acting is his extreme thing 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.959
 as and pure emotion 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.070
 You also have to be able to go outside yourself 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.770
 even if you want that at the moment 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.959
 Not at all that's how it feels 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.239
 can spontaneously become choleric 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.910
 So really all emotion bandwidth 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.690
 in a moment, so to speak, to call 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.030
 can make crazy fun 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.670
 Who does not want to be an asshole for 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.620
 a scene or sometimes lovingly as 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.519
 i believe in this emotional bandwidth 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.330
 really spontaneous but sometimes hang out 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.720
 allow 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.520
 in quotes as well as yours 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.600
 to have no inhibitions and also 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.770
 not to withdraw 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.540
 I have no with the natural gas 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.940
 little practiced but it can be 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.340
 so of course someone became natural too 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.940
 The said has so much fun now 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.940
 you can do that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.250
 can you open up with paganini? 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.699
 a level identify the now 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.639
 not necessarily the music is very concerned 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.169
 very difficult for me it was 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.860
 important that I am a bit far in the 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.740
 script with involved is uninvolved 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.030
 It was just because I got through it 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.189
 of course, a connection too 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.979
 can create from my life to his 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:58.319
 live and there very few anyway 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.129
 historical facts from his life of 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.240
 had a private love 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.190
 Of course we have a certain there 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.909
 of course, and of course I have that 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.719
 made use of 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:13.500
 musically, of course, is in him 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.969
 rather a connection can be the film 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.560
 I think it's very nice to have one 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.270
 If you are in the high price you have to pay 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.319
 is public and if you have his 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:27.629
 It is a down and passion 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:30.330
 so you have big advantages 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:34.080
 with certainty if you can not do that 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.819
 to deal with disadvantages but also one 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.460
 of course, film always plays 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:46.169
 far into the clichÃ© I believe that 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:49.589
 if you live healthy and also with 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.690
 Satisfied with his life is that one 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:54.180
 certainly these problems a bit far 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.250
 coped better than the one in the film 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.190
 case is but you can find the system 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.180
 The price is not the same for me 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.570
 so high just because I 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.479
 avoid certain things and thereby 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.410
 just do not get into the situation 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.410
 negative for me
