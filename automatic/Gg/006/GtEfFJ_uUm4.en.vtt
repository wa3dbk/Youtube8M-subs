00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 but tell a little about your 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.220
 aquarium farming also I just 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.840
 I'll tell you about the processes and blog 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.350
 that's what your aeration looks like and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:19.619
 filtering me attacked 700 liters 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.230
 there are 2 computers or rather one company one 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:30.960
 the filter here is two and a half thousand 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 liters also installed compressor uni 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:41.719
 max watercolor unique 800 set 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:50.250
 temporary here with time I will put them and 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:54.770
 2260 here we have a compressor installed and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.770
 him 2260 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:07.700
 the filter is so warm and proper 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:10.990
 hp 20 this is about the size of the book 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.759
 I bought this one in the kitchen 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.270
 metal comb at once with 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:23.710
 kranikami on 10 coupons on the radio flank 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.710
 happy and slando thick enough 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.720
 he comes to a big one 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.330
 metal tube well and then already 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 distributed through tees 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.430
 for all other consumers of iron 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.360
 bought a little thing separately from us and the birds 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 little shop authors guards 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.380
 special muted to not too 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.380
 strongly was the flow of all the air flow 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.810
 I envy the rear wall here 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.950
 one can see such greenbacks 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.450
 aerators are approximately 40 45 each 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:14.940
 centimeters both 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.420
 here here is the usual green ball four 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.980
 output 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.200
 farther respectively salt marshes 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.880
 skipped on a plinth x here here 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.450
 here here here here here 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.750
 here on the door sill is under the cabinet 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.570
 but again on the baseboard 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.470
 and that tu tu tu tu tu tu du here you are there 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.800
 But from the baseboard go up and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.440
 do aeration my right here too 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.210
 a small green rear 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.650
 probably smaller centimeters 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:49.200
 there are 30 behind a rear stenochki 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.600
 Well, here, too, is small 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.920
 the operator here I specifically muffled you 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.920
 so that the flow of water was not too sitting 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.380
 thus it avoids 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:10.820
 heap of small compressors, and of course, but 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:15.989
 my view raises painfully convenience 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.670
 use here in general, something like this well 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.500
 and I have no herbalists yet 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:26.489
 worth it just starts here 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:29.060
 even see the water is still turbid dill still 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.060
 not yet 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.680
 Well, something like this at the moment 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.450
 all in the form 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.030
 sorry still big planet 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.100
 covers master words only today 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.640
 probably all the same she will be ready and he 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.640
 not and bring show him 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.140
 here 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.080
 something like this you were so requests and 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.420
 the scenery of attention is still not particularly 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.490
 to draw 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.050
 I really like how to arrest I just 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.599
 decided to add a stone now and then very 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.760
 great we all Malawians 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.970
 great tore good if enough 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.400
 shelters feel put in 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.000
 some pebbles at least they 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.950
 will stop 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.760
 hell of a dig that bulldozer basically 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.760
 all I wanted to show 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.250
 until next meetings
