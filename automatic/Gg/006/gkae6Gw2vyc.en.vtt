00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Three years ago, there was a young Frenchwoman 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.690
 with smoky voice to guest at the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.230

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.320
 debut cd ships sold and was able to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 Success story as it describes 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.669
 even the rad music how does it deal with 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 the fast big success itself 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 very likely will continue with 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.059
 her second album director had one 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.059
 rondo with which sat 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.350
 but you want or not there is always 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.000
 still no comfort this earworm since 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.590
 his sudden emerge before three 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.309
 that will make me happy 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.110
 that became the former 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.790
 street musician to the world star 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.890
 her debut album stormed the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 international hit parades and before you 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.700
 it is right they Fasano right in the middle 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.550
 the unprecedented musician's career 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.590
 We met the 33 year old sitting in London 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:23.250
 must after her huge success with juve 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.840
 her new album rector introduced it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.509
 three years ago that our album in 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 France came out to have people 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 barely seen me there the last few years 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.619
 and I thought I was off 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.050
 window 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.509
 but i was very much abroad 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.369
 Tournee and then I rested 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.860
 and retreated to the mountains 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.970
 There we work very slowly 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.970
 started on the new album 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.610
 spontaneous concert in London like too 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:05.570
 times as a street musician only less 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:06.710
 it also has to be prominent in a way 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.810
 used to be issued 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.000
 a rainy house in thicket 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.040
 the city and before that a girl that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.530
 with effortless scherm his audience 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.520
 to cheer up in the sense of let 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.360
 do not fool you 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 life is Beautiful 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.829
 the sudden success of three years ago 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.040
 constantly in the limelight 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.349
 It was not just positive experiences 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.290
 the tours lured them from newspapers 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.219
 reported a collapse 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.469
 concerts were canceled 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.920
 and on the internet she became massive 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.920
 hostility 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.530
 I was not prepared for it 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.540
 you are never prepared for that when 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.730
 you are not loved in someone's life 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.430
 then it will be like that everyone goes his way 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.319
 away and that 's it in the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.930
 social networks there will be something 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.489
 written and it leaves it behind 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.680
 indelible marks 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.260
 everyone gives their comments on the internet 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.199
 From that is like a trash can all puke 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.790
 Turned out to be like a toilet 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.469
 it also positive critiques the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.769
 constructive goods that I belong to 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.769
 have 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.980
 the new album is for saas 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.690
 Actually, isabelle geoffroy is also called 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.160
 a personal new beginning with the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.150
 Message I will not let me 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.440
 be beaten 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.330
 I'm back in their texts celebrating 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.489
 they the disparity of a man 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.290
 political statement in times where in 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.260
 france demonstrations against the 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.940
 gay marriage changed into violence and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.940
 conformity is more important than obstinacy 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.480
 is 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.829
 Today, everything is clinically pure 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.170
 to keep 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.940
 everything resembles that I think too bad 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.160
 because it's nice when the things 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.860
 the differences are different 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.419
 enrich us if you have something that 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.090
 I do not have it then you bring it to me 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.770
 at and vice versa if all are similar 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.610
 it goes so far that all the same 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.260
 think 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.780
 We all have something 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.060
 to convey authentic but much too 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.320
 Often you try to format us in 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.840
 to press a mold 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:54.930
 that makes us unhappy if you do not 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:57.210
 know who you are that this is jazz 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.000
 rock and her new definition of 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.460
 french chance she has the success 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.560
 he fought hard for himself 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.960
 from industry or castingshows 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.960
 created and that feels the audience 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:18.580
 sat on the third of august in the boy 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.580
 Guard in Dresden
