00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:20.030
 well hello to each and all of these 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.300
 exotic and we find ourselves today 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.300
 for episode 14 of those special jdm 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.400
 flying men on battlefield 3 so 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.680
 the cliques will be proposed by six 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.230
 at 69 so my big provider of 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.880
 clicks 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.340
 so here it will be a special clip man 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.260
 flying I hope they enjoy it 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.930
 and as I have nothing special to you 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.699
 say for this episode we will start 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.680
 immediately with in 5th place 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.910
 flying first is what you 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.379
 have you ever wondered what it was like 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.089
 when you get off your plane in 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.860
 course of travel not in the course of flight she 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.180
 that's the point of view 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.830
 crafts for the air look at it too 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.850
 idle so a plane he's running 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.870
 quiet at 10 thinks about 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.220
 so that 's it's enough 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 funny and in fourth place a 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.570
 second part goes back quite classic 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.490
 hutier on and with the explosion the guy 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.500
 fly away but if it's really huge 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.899
 it seems frankly where it makes me 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.780
 always laughing bringing them to the third 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.060
 place two bugs weird so already there 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.530
 falls on two but like that the guy I 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.899
 do not have what they were doing a halt 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.800
 and croup the other they fly over 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.660
 it's weird and the second bug with the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.399
 guy totally buggy so they shoot 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.530
 on top they're killing him by the way 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.690
 by the way this chance of curious as 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.640
 it's quiet and in the second place a 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.459
 clip really not bad with the job 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.190
 dead and who flies away or in his momentum from 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.679
 thanks he will try to revive him but 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.319
 without success hervÃ© bien meters flies away 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.119
 it's ugly not how it's possible 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.530
 and in the first place a clip really 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.599
 helped me look at the veil that flies away 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.860
 but super heroes with his army all 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.800

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.750

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.330
