00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
add to our bottom line a little bit but

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.420 
add to our bottom line a little bit but
also<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.839> people<00:00:51.870> would

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
also it was so that people would

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.869 
also it was so that people would
continue<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.970> start<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.600> buy<00:00:54.750> beans<00:00:55.019> again

because<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.710> practices<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.400> we<00:00:59.670> employ

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
because of the practices that we employ

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.140 
because of the practices that we employ
I'm<00:01:00.720> making<00:01:01.110> sure<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.760> when<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.909> leave<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
I'm making sure that when you leave a

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.710 
I'm making sure that when you leave a
field<00:01:03.540> you<00:01:03.750> clean<00:01:04.019> off<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.199> equipment<00:01:05.720> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
field you clean off your equipment you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
field you clean off your equipment you
only<00:01:06.990> spray<00:01:07.350> when<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.830> absolutely<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
only spray when you absolutely have to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.990 
only spray when you absolutely have to
with<00:01:09.450> chemicals<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.290> weeds<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.920> bugs<00:01:11.190> or<00:01:11.640> mold

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
with chemicals for weeds or bugs or mold

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.810 
with chemicals for weeds or bugs or mold
not<00:01:12.750> organic<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.670> out

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
not organic but it's not just going out

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.209 
not organic but it's not just going out
there<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> blanket<00:01:15.780> system<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.950> just

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
there with a blanket system and just

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.709 
there with a blanket system and just
this<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.149> it<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
this is the way we do it so this is

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.599 
this is the way we do it so this is
we're<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.079> do<00:01:19.289> it<00:01:19.469> we<00:01:19.829> treat<00:01:20.159> each<00:01:20.219> field

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
we're going to do it we treat each field

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.050 
we're going to do it we treat each field
differently<00:01:21.560> after<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.829> beans<00:01:23.039> get<00:01:23.759> dumped

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
differently after the beans get dumped

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.639 
differently after the beans get dumped
in<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.240> truck<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.869> they<00:01:25.020> take<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> trucks

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
in the truck and they take the trucks

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.469 
in the truck and they take the trucks
into<00:01:25.979> Truett's<00:01:26.659> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> Salem

and<00:01:30.570> they'll<00:01:31.439> dump<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.830> on<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> slab<00:01:32.659> within

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and they'll dump them on a slab within

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
and they'll dump them on a slab within
three<00:01:33.900> hours<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> time<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.680> fit<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.580> have

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
equipment that'll clean them sniffing

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.630 
equipment that'll clean them sniffing
and<00:01:37.560> we'll<00:01:37.710> cut<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.189> put<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.580> the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.240 
about a lot of common sense you know
using<00:02:09.000> less<00:02:09.269> water<00:02:09.390> makes<00:02:09.869> sense

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
using less water makes sense

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.550 
using less water makes sense
environmentally<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.400> economically<00:02:12.049> we<00:02:13.049> look

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
environmentally and economically we look

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650 
environmentally and economically we look
at<00:02:13.650> our<00:02:13.739> energy<00:02:13.920> usage<00:02:14.640> again<00:02:15.180> both

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
at our energy usage again both

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.840 
at our energy usage again both
economically<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.519> environmentally<00:02:17.519> it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
economically and environmentally it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.670 
economically and environmentally it
makes<00:02:18.030> sense<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:19.290> affects<00:02:19.590> your

their<00:02:47.860> own<00:02:47.950> home<00:02:48.190> garden<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.299> we<00:02:49.660> do<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.959> for

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
their own home garden so we do that for

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.990 
their own home garden so we do that for

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.800 
them our growers do it for him
and<00:02:52.239> then<00:02:52.420> we<00:02:52.599> package<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.080> for<00:02:53.140> them<00:02:53.379> in<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.950> can

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
and then we package it for them in a can

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.660 
and then we package it for them in a can
so<00:02:55.810> there<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.080> lot<00:02:56.319> of<00:02:56.349> satisfaction<00:02:56.769> out<00:02:57.610> of
