 hello girls how are you a taste 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.759
 huge to greet you as always here in 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.710
 this his channel of bellini tea and in this 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.830
 On occasion we will give continuity to the 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.490
 designs with craquelure enamel flowers 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.239
 you know something very easy very nice and 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.069
 also today is a very colorful variant 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:26.359
 let's start with our nails 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:28.609
 completely clean dry and can 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.009
 apply a transparent enamel base 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.780
 That will protect some nails on 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.059
 everything if we are going to apply on the surface 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.210
 a very strong color enamel like 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.719
 this case this beautiful blue blue very 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.839
 vibrant and only paint completely 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.839
 the accent nails that would be in this case 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.320
 the ring and the thumb 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:54.440
 the other nails were French style 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.490
 and with a type brush enamel 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.579
 very thin brush 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.230
 I finished the base 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.460
 horizontally as you can see here 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.049
 it costs me a little work to go 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.619
 right but who has the 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.780
 practice will be very nice 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.790
 later with white enamel 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.049
 I made these little flowers with 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.409
 crackle glaze you know they're dots 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:24.070
 I gave curved shape to the accent nails 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.490
 the base up 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.820
 We wait for it to dry and in the center 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.160
 apply a very very bright color that 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.400
 is this neon yellow color in the case 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.990
 of the pink flower apply enamel 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.820
 white in the center 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.759
 you can give him the variant that 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.090
 want to change the colors is something very 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.030
 pretty fun and in the end I 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.289
 I applied this shiny glaze that gives 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.060
 a very striking finish and can 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.520
 subsequently apply also a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.520
 transparent enamel that's already optional 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.509
 I hope this design is of your total 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.060
