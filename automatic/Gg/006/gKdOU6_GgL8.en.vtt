the inlays dannion has like the goofy

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.800 
the inlays dannion has like the goofy
bat<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.580> lays<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.970> over<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> place<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
bat it lays all over the place this is a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.660 
bat it lays all over the place this is a
little<00:00:19.050> more<00:00:19.170> traditional<00:00:19.410> source<00:00:20.400> checker

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
little more traditional source checker

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.640 
little more traditional source checker
scale<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.660> I'm<00:00:21.869> not<00:00:21.960> sure<00:00:22.020> about<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
scale and then I'm not sure about this

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
scale and then I'm not sure about this
but<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.580> don't<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> Dameon<00:00:24.750> is

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
but I don't know if the Dameon is

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.990 
but I don't know if the Dameon is
available<00:00:25.320> with<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> quilted<00:00:26.279> top<00:00:26.460> although

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
available with a quilted top although

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330 
available with a quilted top although
this<00:00:27.180> I'm<00:00:27.420> sure<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.619> paper

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this I'm sure is just you know paper

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.460 
this I'm sure is just you know paper
thin<00:00:29.670> veneer<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.720> definitely<00:00:30.900> looks<00:00:31.140> nice

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
thin veneer but it definitely looks nice

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.040 
thin veneer but it definitely looks nice
and<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:31.920> done<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.340> kind<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.329> satin<00:00:33.690> finish

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and it's done in kind of a satin finish

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
and it's done in kind of a satin finish
so<00:00:34.739> hopefully<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.460> doesn't<00:00:35.610> end<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:35.940> with

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
so hopefully it doesn't end up with

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.119 
so hopefully it doesn't end up with
little<00:00:36.540> shiny<00:00:36.809> spots<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.410> over<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.950> my

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
little shiny spots all over it like my

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.720 
little shiny spots all over it like my
Jeff<00:00:38.670> Loomis<00:00:38.850> signature<00:00:39.360> has<00:00:40.070> but<00:00:41.070> time<00:00:41.399> zone

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
Jeff Loomis signature has but time zone

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
Jeff Loomis signature has but time zone
so<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.690> far<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> features<00:00:43.469> go

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so as far as the features go

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.869 
so as far as the features go
the<00:00:44.850> woods<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> mahogany<00:00:46.530> body<00:00:47.219> with

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the woods are it's a mahogany body with

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.209 
the woods are it's a mahogany body with
a<00:00:47.910> maple<00:00:48.180> neck<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.559> me<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> think<00:00:49.950> is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
a maple neck which to me I think is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.479 
a maple neck which to me I think is
about<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> best<00:00:51.210> combination<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> woods<00:00:52.489> as

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
about the best combination of woods as

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.450 
about the best combination of woods as
far<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> Tonio's<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.980> neck<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
far as the Tonio's and then the neck is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.970 
far as the Tonio's and then the neck is
a<00:00:56.489> three-piece<00:00:57.270> maple<00:00:57.870> which<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.199> important

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
a three-piece maple which is important

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
a three-piece maple which is important
because<00:00:59.160> three-piece<00:00:59.820> necks<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
because three-piece necks have a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420 
because three-piece necks have a
tendency<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> move<00:01:01.680> around<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
tendency not to move around when the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.160 
tendency not to move around when the
humidity<00:01:02.789> changes<00:01:02.820> they<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.719> tend<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
humidity changes they do tend to be a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.830 
humidity changes they do tend to be a
little<00:01:04.290> stronger<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.339> stable<00:01:05.840> so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
little stronger a little more stable so

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.420 
little stronger a little more stable so
you<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.290> shouldn't<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.100> worry<00:01:08.280> about

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
you really shouldn't have to worry about

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.730 
you really shouldn't have to worry about
fiddled<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> truss<00:01:09.600> rod<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.650> know

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
fiddled with the truss rod or you know

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.560 
fiddled with the truss rod or you know
adjusting<00:01:11.280> action<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> tired<00:01:12.180> shouldn't

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
adjusting action on the tired shouldn't

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.880 
adjusting action on the tired shouldn't
pretty<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.840> stay<00:01:13.080> where<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:13.770> it's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
pretty much stay where where it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.460 
pretty much stay where where it's
supposed<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.600> setback<00:01:15.869> weaning

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
supposed to so it's a setback weaning

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.560 
supposed to so it's a setback weaning
it's<00:01:16.619> glued<00:01:16.890> into<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> body<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:18.210> did<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> very

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it's glued into the body they did a very

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
it's glued into the body they did a very
nice<00:01:18.750> job<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.369> sculpting<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> back<00:01:20.670> here

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
nice job on sculpting it back here

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.490 
nice job on sculpting it back here
hopefully<00:01:21.270> that's<00:01:21.450> shows<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.380> guys

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
hopefully that's shows up for you guys

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700 
hopefully that's shows up for you guys
but<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> access<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> high<00:01:24.000> frets<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:25.350> very

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
but the access to the high frets is very

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.999 
but the access to the high frets is very
very<00:01:25.920> good<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.960> they<00:01:27.960> call<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.590> ultra

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
very good so they call this the ultra

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.090 
very good so they call this the ultra
access<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.110> called<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
access but I think they called that the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.160 
access but I think they called that the
same<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.700> Jeff<00:01:33.090> Loomis<00:01:33.270> signature<00:01:33.840> which

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
same on my Jeff Loomis signature which

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.130 
same on my Jeff Loomis signature which
access<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.220> terrible<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.930> any

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
access was terrible up there but at any

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.560 
access was terrible up there but at any
rate<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.590> very<00:01:38.400> very<00:01:38.640> playable<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:39.119> top<00:01:39.299> so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
rate it's very very playable up top so

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.910 
rate it's very very playable up top so
other<00:01:40.530> than<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
other than that

while<00:02:25.060> playing<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.720> then<00:02:25.900> you've<00:02:26.020> got<00:02:26.170> a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
while playing and then you've got a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.680 
while playing and then you've got a
single<00:02:26.590> tone<00:02:26.709> not<00:02:26.950> as<00:02:27.100> well<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.610> apart<00:02:28.600> from

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
single tone not as well so apart from

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.690 
single tone not as well so apart from
that<00:02:28.840> there's<00:02:29.320> not<00:02:29.770> really<00:02:29.830> much<00:02:30.190> else<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.550> can

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
that there's not really much else I can

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.540 
that there's not really much else I can
tell<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.240> about<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:32.010> profile<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.340> neck

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
tell you about it the profile the neck

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.660 
tell you about it the profile the neck
is<00:02:34.080> thin<00:02:35.080> enough<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:35.770> not<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.310> know<00:02:36.400> it's

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
is thin enough it's not you know it's

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.060 
is thin enough it's not you know it's
not<00:02:36.820> super<00:02:37.450> skinny<00:02:37.959> like<00:02:38.260> some<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.830> Ibanez

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
not super skinny like some of the Ibanez

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.180 
not super skinny like some of the Ibanez
necks<00:02:39.870> but<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.989> definitely<00:02:41.290> feels<00:02:41.680> pretty

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
necks but it definitely feels pretty

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.720 
necks but it definitely feels pretty
thin

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
thin

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.370 
thin
I<00:02:42.760> mean<00:02:43.090> I'm<00:02:43.270> typically<00:02:43.780> playing<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.110> seven

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
I mean I'm typically playing a seven

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.729 
I mean I'm typically playing a seven
string<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:45.600> seven<00:02:46.600> strings<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.020> little

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
string so seven strings have a little

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.320 
string so seven strings have a little
bit<00:02:47.830> beefier<00:02:48.130> neck<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.730> feels<00:02:49.060> kind<00:02:49.270> of

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
bit beefier neck so it feels kind of

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.880 
bit beefier neck so it feels kind of
dainty<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.050> me<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:51.239> apart<00:02:52.239> from<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.890> yeah

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
dainty to me but apart from that yeah

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.949 
dainty to me but apart from that yeah
I'll<00:02:54.150> show<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.239> what<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.450> sounds<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.780> I

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
I'll show you what it sounds like I

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:26.680 
I'll show you what it sounds like I
guess

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.500 

so<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:28.020> guess<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.920> probably<00:03:29.160> sounds<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:29.940> every

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
so I guess it probably sounds like every

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.180 
so I guess it probably sounds like every
other<00:03:30.600> guitar<00:03:30.960> out<00:03:31.170> there<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.530> has<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.830> mg's

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.000 
other guitar out there that has the mg's
in<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.490> but<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:33.300> won't<00:03:34.020> do<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> clean<00:03:34.770> channel

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
in it but I won't do a clean channel

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.490 
in it but I won't do a clean channel

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
because I'm pretty sure

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.680 
because I'm pretty sure
