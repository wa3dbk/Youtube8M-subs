00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.590 
times so um what I did is I started out
by<00:00:16.710> applying<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.340> moisturizer<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.060> has<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> ton

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
for textural reasons also if like your

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.499 
for textural reasons also if like your
kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.520> fair<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.299> face<00:01:39.479> is

darker<00:01:40.049> than<00:01:40.079> your<00:01:40.350> neck<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> good

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
darker than your neck so it was a good

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
to the neck now in this case this powder

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.690 
to the neck now in this case this powder
actually<00:01:45.899> matches<00:01:46.170> my<00:01:46.290> neck<00:01:46.470> pretty<00:01:47.100> well<00:01:47.310> so
