00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
baby food we just need the the good and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
baby food we just need the the good and
tender<00:01:40.079> part<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> asparagus

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
tender part of the asparagus

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.780 
tender part of the asparagus
it<00:01:41.700> means<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.570> top<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.380> jam<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.610> are

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it means the top the jam and then we are

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.660 
it means the top the jam and then we are
going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.390> cut<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:46.049> until<00:01:46.619> basically<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
going to cut up until basically the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.569 
going to cut up until basically the
green<00:01:48.000> color<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.990> soon<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.070> color<00:01:50.310> will

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
green color as soon as the color will

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.289 
green color as soon as the color will
turn<00:01:50.610> kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.479> pale<00:01:52.200> green<00:01:52.409> almost<00:01:53.189> white<00:01:53.549> we

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
turn kind of pale green almost white we

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389 
turn kind of pale green almost white we
are<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.720> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> use<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.710> part<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
are not going to use that part and

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.139 
are not going to use that part and
another<00:01:57.299> trick<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.140> white<00:01:59.130> cut<00:01:59.549> here

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
another trick is that white cut here

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.959 
another trick is that white cut here
this<00:02:00.450> purpose<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.170> will<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:02.040> at<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> certain

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
this purpose you will see at a certain

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.860 
this purpose you will see at a certain
point<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.259> color<00:02:04.530> is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
point when the color is

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.710 
point when the color is
to<00:02:05.140> switch<00:02:05.470> then<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.580> des<00:02:06.850> purpose<00:02:07.300> will<00:02:07.510> get

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
to switch then the des purpose will get

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.920 
to switch then the des purpose will get
harder<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.800> cut<00:02:09.040> that<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:10.000> when<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.600> have<00:02:10.720> to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
harder to cut that is when you have to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.470 
harder to cut that is when you have to
stop<00:02:11.350> because<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:12.220> software<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.030> good<00:02:13.210> part

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
stop because the software the good part

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.180 
stop because the software the good part
is<00:02:13.750> both<00:02:14.110> will<00:02:14.410> be<00:02:14.620> cut

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
is both will be cut

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.600 
is both will be cut
so<00:02:15.810> let's<00:02:16.810> shop<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.440> timepieces

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
so let's shop in timepieces

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.700 
so let's shop in timepieces
our<00:02:18.970> three<00:02:19.860> services<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:22.080> then<00:02:23.080> we<00:02:23.380> are<00:02:23.500> going

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
to steam them for ten minutes I mean
just<00:02:27.700> check<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:28.330> 10<00:02:28.570> minutes<00:02:28.720> they<00:02:29.260> will<00:02:29.470> be

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
just check but 10 minutes they will be

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.410 
just check but 10 minutes they will be
enough<00:02:29.860> because<00:02:30.070> we<00:02:30.460> are<00:02:30.580> going<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.000> cut<00:02:31.210> them

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
enough because we are going to cut them

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.780 
enough because we are going to cut them
in<00:02:31.570> small<00:02:31.780> pieces<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:33.040> smaller<00:02:33.370> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
in small pieces and the smaller the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.680 
in small pieces and the smaller the
