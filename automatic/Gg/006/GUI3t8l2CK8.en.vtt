be wondering why would I choose 11:8

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.250 
be wondering why would I choose 11:8
well<00:00:27.060> I've<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:27.990> good<00:00:28.109> reasons

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
well I've got two really good reasons

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.980 
well I've got two really good reasons
why<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> might<00:00:29.130> give<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.519> go<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
why you might give it a go the first is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.319 
why you might give it a go the first is
to<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.380> sound<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.040> while<00:00:32.850> mutes<00:00:33.149> that

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
to do with sound and while mutes that

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.660 
to do with sound and while mutes that
are<00:00:33.420> made<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.840> rubber<00:00:34.140> metal<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:35.130> wood<00:00:35.370> are

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
are made from rubber metal or wood are

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.389 
are made from rubber metal or wood are
really<00:00:35.940> effective<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.780> reducing<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.829> volume

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
really effective at reducing the volume

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.450 
really effective at reducing the volume
of<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.700> instrument<00:00:39.180> they<00:00:40.110> also<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.100> at

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
of your instrument they also do so at

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.720 
of your instrument they also do so at
the<00:00:42.149> expense<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.649> quality<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.129> texture

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the expense of the quality and texture

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
the expense of the quality and texture
of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.969> sound<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.539> that's<00:00:46.260> why<00:00:46.410> though<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
of the sound and that's why though the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
of the sound and that's why though the
mutes<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.430> bit<00:00:47.610> different<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.239> can

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
mutes are a little bit different you can

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
mutes are a little bit different you can
use<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> leather<00:00:49.410> mute<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.100> reduce<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
use the leather mute to reduce the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
use the leather mute to reduce the
volume<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.449> instrument<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.289> any<00:00:52.620> other

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
volume of your instrument like any other

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.310 
volume of your instrument like any other
mute<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.539> still<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:54.960> really

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
mute but you still get some really

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.290 
mute but you still get some really
beautiful<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.039> overturns<00:00:56.550> coming<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
beautiful or overturns coming out of the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
beautiful or overturns coming out of the
instrument<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.379> makes<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.859> much<00:00:59.039> more

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
instrument and that makes it a much more

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.770 
instrument and that makes it a much more
pleasant<00:00:59.399> experience<00:00:59.670> for<00:01:00.300> people<00:01:00.449> who<00:01:00.660> are

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
pleasant experience for people who are

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.020 
pleasant experience for people who are
listening<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.530> your<00:01:01.680> audience<00:01:02.030> but

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
listening to you in your audience but

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
listening to you in your audience but
also<00:01:03.270> underneath<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.290> ear<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
also underneath your ear you get a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.910 
also underneath your ear you get a
little<00:01:05.339> bit<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:05.700> clarity<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.650> believe

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
little bit more clarity and I believe

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.090 
little bit more clarity and I believe
that<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.189> helps<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:08.880> intonation

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
that that helps you with your intonation

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
that that helps you with your intonation
the<00:01:11.100> second<00:01:11.460> reason<00:01:11.610> why<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:11.970> might<00:01:12.270> give<00:01:12.510> me

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the second reason why you might give me

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
the second reason why you might give me
this<00:01:13.350> mute<00:01:13.590> ago<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.580> its<00:01:14.729> design

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
this mute ago is because of its design

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.960 
this mute ago is because of its design
and<00:01:15.780> its<00:01:16.380> unique<00:01:16.770> design<00:01:16.799> allows<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> be

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and its unique design allows it to be

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
and its unique design allows it to be
used<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.420> two<00:01:18.659> different<00:01:18.689> ways<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.979> achieve

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
used in two different ways to achieve

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.090 
used in two different ways to achieve
two<00:01:20.759> distinctly<00:01:21.630> different<00:01:22.049> muted<00:01:22.770> effects

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
two distinctly different muted effects

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100 
two distinctly different muted effects
and<00:01:23.430> I'll<00:01:24.090> demonstrate<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and I'll demonstrate that for you in a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.100 
and I'll demonstrate that for you in a
moment<00:01:26.119> when<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> first<00:01:27.330> take<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> mute<00:01:27.960> out

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
moment when you first take the mute out

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
moment when you first take the mute out
of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> packet<00:01:28.829> you'll<00:01:29.009> notice<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.400> there

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
of the packet you'll notice that there

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.969 
of the packet you'll notice that there
are<00:01:29.700> two<00:01:29.970> sides<00:01:30.229> there's<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.470> side<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
grooves no logo the reason why there are

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
grooves on the other so that you can put

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.499 
grooves on the other so that you can put
it<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> instrument<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.970> position

it on the instrument in this position

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.100 
it on the instrument in this position
and<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.619> stays<00:01:52.860> vertical<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.119> parallel<00:01:54.869> to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.910 
against the backside of the bridge and
that's<00:02:31.180> how<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.870> achieve<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.860> to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
to use it in its full capacity simply

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.710 
to use it in its full capacity simply
take<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.799> off<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.220> quickly<00:02:39.849> put<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.060> on<00:02:40.330> top<00:02:40.690> of

take it off and quickly put it on top of
the<00:02:40.989> bridge<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.560> when<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:42.580> sitting<00:02:42.760> over
