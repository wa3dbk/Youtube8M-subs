portal<00:00:08.099> after<00:00:09.030> beating<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:09.929> like<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
portal after beating it for like the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.480 
portal after beating it for like the
13th<00:00:10.830> time<00:00:11.190> but<00:00:11.849> that's<00:00:12.540> another<00:00:12.809> story<00:00:13.490> now

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
13th time but that's another story now

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.910 
13th time but that's another story now
this<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> repeated<00:00:15.299> demonstrations<00:00:16.260> as<00:00:16.500> I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
this is a repeated demonstrations as I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830 
this is a repeated demonstrations as I
wasn't<00:00:17.369> recording<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> time<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.720> had

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
wasn't recording at the time that I had

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.019 
wasn't recording at the time that I had
actually<00:00:19.260> discovered<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> glitch<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.939> took

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
actually discovered the glitch so I took

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.519 
actually discovered the glitch so I took
the<00:00:24.269> last<00:00:24.449> core<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> flew<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the last core and I flew to the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.130 
the last core and I flew to the
incinerator<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.609> then<00:00:27.240> accidentally<00:00:27.779> jumped

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
incinerator and then accidentally jumped

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.870 
incinerator and then accidentally jumped
in<00:00:28.320> myself<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.220> trying<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> get<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.849> of

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
in myself as I was trying to get out of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.870 
in myself as I was trying to get out of
there<00:00:30.740> but<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> didn't<00:00:32.099> feel<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.279> starting

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
there but I didn't feel like starting

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.389 
there but I didn't feel like starting
over<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.899> let<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> run<00:00:36.829> now<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> realized

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
over so I just let it run now I realized

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.100 
over so I just let it run now I realized
that<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> quality<00:00:38.969> isn't<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> best<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that the quality isn't the best in the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.389 
that the quality isn't the best in the
world<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:40.980> didn't<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.340> much

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
world but I really didn't have much

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.540 
world but I really didn't have much
choice<00:00:42.410> when<00:00:43.410> i<00:00:43.469> tried<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.770> use<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> in-game

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
choice when i tried to use the in-game

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
choice when i tried to use the in-game
reporter<00:00:45.120> built<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.079> source

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
reporter built in with all the source

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.540 
reporter built in with all the source
games<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:48.090> video<00:00:48.390> was

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
games the video was

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.330 
games the video was
so<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.580> tried<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:50.910> start<00:00:51.300> over<00:00:51.830> this<00:00:52.830> time<00:00:53.130> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
so I tried to start over this time it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
so I tried to start over this time it
worked<00:00:53.490> but<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.210> video<00:00:54.480> came<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.870> rather<00:00:55.110> odd

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
worked but the video came out rather odd

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.000 
worked but the video came out rather odd
looking<00:00:56.330> so<00:00:57.330> I<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.720> decided<00:00:57.900> to<00:00:58.290> say<00:00:58.470> fuck<00:00:58.650> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
looking so I just decided to say fuck it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
looking so I just decided to say fuck it
and<00:00:59.040> just<00:00:59.400> record<00:00:59.790> it<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.120> fraps<00:01:00.890> which

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and just record it with fraps which

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.430 
and just record it with fraps which
pissed<00:01:02.610> me<00:01:02.730> off<00:01:02.880> because<00:01:03.030> fraps<00:01:03.900> runs<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.320> lot

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
pissed me off because fraps runs a lot

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.730 
pissed me off because fraps runs a lot
slower<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:06.060> often<00:01:06.300> be<00:01:06.630> chopped<00:01:07.020> because

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
slower and can often be chopped because
