let's<00:02:20.470> give<00:02:20.680> him<00:02:20.740> his<00:02:20.890> base<00:02:21.220> though<00:02:22.230> make<00:02:23.230> him

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
let's give him his base though make him

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.860 
let's give him his base though make him
complete<00:02:23.920> all<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.120> kind<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.420> makes<00:02:25.630> him<00:02:25.750> you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
complete all that kind of makes him you

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.780 
complete all that kind of makes him you
know<00:02:25.960> strict<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.410> tough<00:02:26.620> being<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.640> ground
