like<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.509> said<00:01:52.570> time<00:01:52.990> management<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> big

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
like I said time management is a big

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.489 
like I said time management is a big
factor<00:01:54.909> mainly<00:01:55.359> because<00:01:55.630> sometimes<00:01:56.109> it<00:01:56.289> does

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
factor mainly because sometimes it does

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.499 
factor mainly because sometimes it does
take<00:01:56.710> time<00:01:57.280> for<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.579> barbarian<00:01:58.060> King<00:01:58.270> to
