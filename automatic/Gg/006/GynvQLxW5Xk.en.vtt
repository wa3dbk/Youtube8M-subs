00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:09.899
 tutorial of a very easy mini album 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.899
 bound with liquid silicone 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.910
 by mister west and sanz 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 we will use a decorated sheet of paper 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.529
 for a single face of 28 x 28 centimeters 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.220
 and we will fold it in half and again 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.259
 in half 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.480
 and we helped ourselves from the folder for 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.930
 mark the folds well 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.430
 to keep the sheet folded 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.370
 we will use a little site in this 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 case we have used with the liquid 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.170
 with the help of the folder we make 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.989
 so there are no bubbles 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.090
 and we have our first page of the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.630
 mineral 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.110
 we will repeat this step nine times more 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.489
 is to have a total of 10 sheets as you see 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.980
 each leaves of a decorated paper 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.180
 different then we will have a mini album 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.160
 very colorful let's go for the stage 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:14.210
 we will mark first and cut with the 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.860
 shear a cardboard to 29 centimeters 14.4 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.200
 between one centimeter is a 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.820
 centimeter more in the exit of the bucket 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.909
 decorator 14.4 are four millimeters more 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.960
 two on each side of half the paper 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.990
 decorated 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.350
 once we have the cardboard we mark 14 and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.979
 15 centimeters two lines we will understand 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.979
 the bending marks with the bulldozer 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.930
 these folds will form the back of 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.840
 our mini album 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.760
 Now we are going to cover the lid with paper 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.710
 decorative 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.360
 a couple of cuts of the order of a colon 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.040
 and a third for the back of 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.160
 ecologically 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.580
 with the help of the glue we are sticking 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.780
 the cardboard to the decorated paper leaving 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.000
 left over on all three sides 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.119
 the folder helps us not to be left 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.119
 bubbles 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.030
 we make our sides 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.600
 and with a piece of decorated paper 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.070
 different we do the pain 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.070
 that we hit also completely 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.390
 we mark the folds 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.579
 and let it dry 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.430
 Once dry with scissors we cut the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.670
 vertices but without touching the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.209
 cardboard we will leave a millimeter of margin 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.480
 with glue we adhere these edges that 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.480
 remain 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.740
 and 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:29.040
 now we will erase the interior with the 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.650
 same decorated paper with which we have 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.810
 forged the loin 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.420
 We cut two pieces of paper from the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.420
 just measure with a little bit of glue 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.340
 we get hooked 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.120
 always with the help of the steamroller 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.780
 so that there are no air bubbles and 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.780
 glue 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.830
 we'll let it dry and we'll have the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.140
 prepared lid 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.060
 we are going to bind, we will prepare the 10 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.800
 we will fix them with tweezers 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.830
 all over the back of the leaves 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.239
 we will apply a generous amount of 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.239
 liquid silicone adhesive 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.700
 once done this we will put the covers 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.610
 we will also fix them with the tweezers and 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.710
 Let dry at least three hours 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.409
 once the ciboure dry we have 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.270
 it dominates us perfectly bound and 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.789
 ready to hook our photos of 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.680
 vacation let's decorate a little the 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.680
 cover with a couple of stickers 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.060
 and we have already finished, it has been easy 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.670
 and fast and the result very fun and 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.740
 summery if you liked to remember that 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.980
