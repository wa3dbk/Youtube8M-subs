00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
peeled it and we're going to use the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.850 
peeled it and we're going to use the
knife<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:50.250> make<00:00:50.489> long<00:00:50.969> thin<00:00:51.480> slices<00:00:52.170> now<00:00:52.530> if

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
knife to make long thin slices now if

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.930 
knife to make long thin slices now if
you<00:00:53.039> want<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> slice<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.730> horizontally

you want to slice it horizontally

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.319 
you want to slice it horizontally
instead<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.930> vertically<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:56.100> fine<00:00:56.460> too<00:00:56.760> we

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
instead of vertically that's fine too we

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.029 
instead of vertically that's fine too we
just<00:00:57.539> find<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> easier<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.770> way

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
just find it easier to do it this way

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.099 
just find it easier to do it this way
when<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.489> lay<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> out<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.180> top<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.719> sushi

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
when we lay it out on top of the sushi

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
when we lay it out on top of the sushi
so<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> nice<00:01:03.149> sharp<00:01:03.510> knife

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
so here we have a nice sharp knife

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.299 
so here we have a nice sharp knife
that's<00:01:04.049> cutting<00:01:04.379> through<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> avocado<00:01:05.070> like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that's cutting through the avocado like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:05.859 
that's cutting through the avocado like

our<00:01:36.360> other<00:01:36.420> video<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.530> explain<00:01:37.890> how

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
our other video because we explain how

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.240 
our other video because we explain how
to<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.790> depth<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.920> we're<00:01:41.070> doing

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to do that in depth so what we're doing

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.990 
to do that in depth so what we're doing
here<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.460> we're<00:01:41.579> putting<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
here is we're putting all the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
here is we're putting all the
ingredients<00:01:42.450> together<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.710> we've

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
ingredients together you see that we've

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.420 
ingredients together you see that we've
added<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.549> cucumber<00:01:45.119> slice<00:01:45.360> our<00:01:46.100> two<00:01:47.100> rice

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
added the cucumber slice our two rice

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.810 
added the cucumber slice our two rice
sticks<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.560> avocado<00:01:50.159> as<00:01:50.340> well<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
sticks and now the avocado as well and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.520 
sticks and now the avocado as well and
that<00:01:51.000> last<00:01:51.299> piece<00:01:51.600> always<00:01:51.960> sinks<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that last piece always sinks to the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.149 
that last piece always sinks to the
plate<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.759> once<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.200> point<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
plate so once we get to this point the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.950 
plate so once we get to this point the
next<00:01:56.490> thing<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.390> roll<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.840> up

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
next thing we have to do is roll it up

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.170 
next thing we have to do is roll it up
so<00:01:58.909> grab<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
so grab the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.790 
so grab the
the<00:02:03.180> saran<00:02:03.480> wrap<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.840> bamboo<00:02:04.170> mat<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.650> lift

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.440 
it up and over the ingredients and you
want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.440> squeeze<00:02:07.710> firmly<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
want to squeeze firmly and you want to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.000 
want to squeeze firmly and you want to
do<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.960> get<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> ingredients<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.740> stick

do that to get the ingredients to stick

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.980 
do that to get the ingredients to stick
together<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.880> don't<00:02:12.210> want<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.690> smash

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990

together but you don't want to smash
everything<00:02:13.230> together<00:02:13.740> it's<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.790> hard<00:02:15.360> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
everything together it's really hard to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360 
everything together it's really hard to
explain<00:02:15.720> verbally<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.650> something<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.130> kind

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
explain verbally it's something you kind

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.530 
explain verbally it's something you kind
of<00:02:17.460> get<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> feel<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:19.160> you'll<00:02:20.160> know

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
of get the feel for and you'll know

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.640 
of get the feel for and you'll know
after<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.630> slice<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.320> look<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
after you slice it and look in the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.230 
after you slice it and look in the
middle<00:02:22.770> whether<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.310> squeeze<00:02:23.610> too<00:02:23.850> hard<00:02:24.090> or

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
middle whether you squeeze too hard or

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.420 
middle whether you squeeze too hard or
not<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:25.080> after<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> couple<00:02:25.620> times<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.010> practice

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
not but after a couple times a practice

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.370 
not but after a couple times a practice
I'm<00:02:26.580> sure<00:02:26.610> you'll<00:02:26.880> get<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.180> no<00:02:27.300> time<00:02:27.570> so

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
I'm sure you'll get it in no time so

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
I'm sure you'll get it in no time so
there<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.460> keep<00:02:29.640> rolling<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.180> over

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
there we go we just keep rolling it over

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.020 
there we go we just keep rolling it over
and<00:02:30.600> squeezing<00:02:31.110> firmly<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.310> not<00:02:32.370> too<00:02:32.550> hard<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and squeezing firmly but not too hard to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.390 
and squeezing firmly but not too hard to
smash<00:02:33.270> everything<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.020> once<00:02:34.860> again<00:02:35.070> we

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
smash everything and once again we

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.460 
smash everything and once again we
flipped<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.790> over<00:02:36.060> again<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.510> doing<00:02:37.200> those

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
flipped it over again and doing those

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.340 
flipped it over again and doing those
nice<00:02:37.800> firm<00:02:38.280> gripping<00:02:39.210> all<00:02:39.420> over<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.230> want

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
nice firm gripping all over and you want

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.050 
nice firm gripping all over and you want
to<00:02:40.500> be<00:02:40.590> sure<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.950> get<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.460> parts<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.940> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to be sure to get it on all parts of the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.950 
to be sure to get it on all parts of the
sushi<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.640> next<00:02:44.880> step<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.720> basically

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
sushi so the next step is to basically

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.580 
sushi so the next step is to basically
roll<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.530> out<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.800> bamboo<00:02:47.160> mat<00:02:47.840> onto<00:02:48.840> your

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
roll it out of the bamboo mat onto your

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.510 
roll it out of the bamboo mat onto your
table<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:52.410> shrimps<00:02:52.800> wraps<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.310> little

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
table and the shrimps wraps a little

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.300 
table and the shrimps wraps a little
sticky<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.180> there<00:02:54.570> we<00:02:54.750> go<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:56.160> we're

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
sticky but there we go and what we're

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.190 
sticky but there we go and what we're
doing<00:02:56.340> here<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:57.000> we're<00:02:57.240> adding<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.720> toasted

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
doing here is we're adding the toasted

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.949 
doing here is we're adding the toasted
sesame<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.890> top<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.430> a<00:03:00.420> little<00:03:00.660> bit<00:03:00.810> goes

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
sesame to the top and a little bit goes

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.290 
sesame to the top and a little bit goes
a<00:03:01.170> long<00:03:01.440> way<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.430> see<00:03:02.640> we<00:03:02.730> put<00:03:02.910> some<00:03:03.120> there

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
a long way so you see we put some there

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.120 
a long way so you see we put some there
and<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.630> gently<00:03:04.020> rub<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.950> touch

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
and we gently rub it in just to touch

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.460 
and we gently rub it in just to touch
and<00:03:05.459> we<00:03:06.209> roll<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.630> its<00:03:06.780> side<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.020> add<00:03:07.440> a

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
and we roll it on its side and add a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.370 
and we roll it on its side and add a
little<00:03:07.770> bit<00:03:08.040> more<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.610> gently<00:03:09.420> tap<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380

rice is sticking up we really don't have

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.350 
rice is sticking up we really don't have
to<00:03:12.570> do<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.709> if<00:03:13.739> you're<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.730> know<00:03:14.760> flavoring

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.210 
on and the next thing we're going to do
is<00:03:22.769> we're<00:03:22.920> going<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.100> cut<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.430> sushi<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:25.220> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
is we're going to cut the sushi and the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.009 
is we're going to cut the sushi and the
ends<00:03:26.610> are<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.790> little<00:03:27.000> odd<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> tend<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
ends are a little odd so you tend to

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.270 
ends are a little odd so you tend to
have<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.230> make<00:03:28.380> those<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> little<00:03:28.800> bit<00:03:29.010> thicker

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
have to make those a little bit thicker

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.000 
have to make those a little bit thicker
than<00:03:29.519> other<00:03:29.670> ones<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.560> there<00:03:31.560> really<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.980> no

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
than other ones and there really is no

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.220 
than other ones and there really is no
hard<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.430> fast<00:03:32.519> rule<00:03:32.970> for<00:03:33.450> how<00:03:33.660> thick<00:03:34.019> or<00:03:34.200> thin

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
hard and fast rule for how thick or thin

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.680 
hard and fast rule for how thick or thin
your<00:03:34.500> slices<00:03:34.980> are<00:03:35.160> it's<00:03:35.640> whatever<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.090> prefer

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
your slices are it's whatever you prefer

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.259 
your slices are it's whatever you prefer
now<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.620> those<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.220> audience<00:03:38.370> who

now for those of you in the audience who

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.960 
now for those of you in the audience who
are<00:03:39.900> experimenting<00:03:40.410> with<00:03:40.830> different<00:03:41.070> ways<00:03:41.489> to

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
are experimenting with different ways to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.810 
are experimenting with different ways to
make<00:03:42.870> rice<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.560> want<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.220> point<00:03:44.370> something<00:03:44.640> out

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
make rice I want to point something out

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.229 
make rice I want to point something out
here

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
here

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.070 
here
we<00:03:45.750> made<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.200> rice<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:47.040> stovetop<00:03:47.310> and

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
we made this rice on the stovetop and

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.540 
we made this rice on the stovetop and
stovetop<00:03:49.080> rice<00:03:50.000> tastes<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.180> same<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:52.830> is<00:03:53.310> a

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
stovetop rice tastes the same I it is a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.040 
stovetop rice tastes the same I it is a
little<00:03:53.820> bit<00:03:53.940> more<00:03:54.060> process<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.720> make<00:03:54.870> but

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
little bit more process to make but

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.509 
little bit more process to make but
where<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.320> really<00:03:55.680> makes<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:56.070> difference<00:03:56.400> is

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
where it really makes a difference is

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.460 
where it really makes a difference is
what<00:03:56.700> you're<00:03:56.820> seeing<00:03:57.060> here<00:03:57.150> how<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.140> kind<00:03:58.380> of

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
what you're seeing here how it kind of

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.800 
what you're seeing here how it kind of
comes<00:03:58.709> off<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:59.130> clumps<00:03:59.580> you<00:04:00.030> really<00:04:00.480> don't<00:04:00.660> get

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
comes off in clumps you really don't get

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.440 
comes off in clumps you really don't get
the<00:04:00.989> same<00:04:01.230> stickiness<00:04:01.910> as<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.120> do<00:04:03.239> on<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
the same stickiness as you do on the

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.060 
the same stickiness as you do on the
rice<00:04:03.600> cooker<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.200> looks<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.620> little<00:04:04.769> messy

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
rice cooker and it looks a little messy

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.390 
rice cooker and it looks a little messy
when<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.640> cut<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.390> but<00:04:07.170> at<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:08.070> end<00:04:08.100> though

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
when you cut it but at the end though

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.180 
when you cut it but at the end though
when<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.090> put<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.360> out<00:04:09.420> for<00:04:09.660> display<00:04:10.190> you

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190
