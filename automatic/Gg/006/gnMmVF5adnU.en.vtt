00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
thinking if it's gonna be a maintenance

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.860 
thinking if it's gonna be a maintenance
break<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.840> get<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.430> gym<00:01:12.430> everything<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.300> get<00:01:13.720> my

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
of moving my infernal tower closer to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030 
of moving my infernal tower closer to
the<00:02:13.180> walls<00:02:13.390> where<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.260> doesn't<00:02:14.560> look<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:14.890> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040

could<00:02:15.160> be<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.430> close<00:02:15.700> but<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.780> just

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
could be that close but it is it just

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.510 
could be that close but it is it just
takes<00:02:17.170> out<00:02:17.350> all<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> wall<00:02:17.890> breakers<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.460> they
