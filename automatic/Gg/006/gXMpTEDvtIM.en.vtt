00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:34.349 
smoothly it's light coverage but it can

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:36.139

looks like a second skin - if you're
looking<00:01:50.849> for<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.179> foundation<00:01:51.389> that<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
looking for a foundation that is a

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.069 
looking for a foundation that is a

natural looking it still covers stuff
and<00:01:55.289> also<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:56.009> buildable<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.609> I<00:01:56.880> think

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

foundation<00:02:27.690> though<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.410> don't<00:02:28.590> blend

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
foundation though is if you don't blend

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.550 
foundation though is if you don't blend
it<00:02:28.980> properly<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.970> will<00:02:30.120> have<00:02:30.360> some<00:02:30.960> oxidize

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
it properly you will have some oxidize

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.050 
it properly you will have some oxidize
is<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.160> oxy<00:02:32.520> oxidation<00:02:33.510> that's<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.110> word<00:02:34.260> it

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
is it oxy oxidation that's the word it

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.270 
is it oxy oxidation that's the word it
oxidizes<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.390> can<00:02:36.570> leave<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.990> some<00:02:37.860> marks

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
oxidizes so it can leave like some marks

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.550 
oxidizes so it can leave like some marks
on<00:02:38.520> your<00:02:38.820> face<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.600> look<00:02:39.780> slightly<00:02:40.170> orange

suggest if you use this foundation you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.160 
suggest if you use this foundation you

have that problem

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.470 
have that problem
just<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.740> blend<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.460> foundation<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.120> bit

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
just to blend in the foundation a bit

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.300 
just to blend in the foundation a bit
more<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.960> then<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.320> won't<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.680> this

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
more and then you won't have that this

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.710 
more and then you won't have that this
one<00:02:50.580> retails<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:51.330> eighteen<00:02:51.900> pounds<00:02:52.140> fifty

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
one retails for eighteen pounds fifty

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.260 
one retails for eighteen pounds fifty
which<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.990> quite<00:02:55.440> okay<00:02:55.770> because<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.850> lasts<00:02:57.090> a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
which is quite okay because it lasts a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.930 
which is quite okay because it lasts a
really<00:02:57.300> long<00:02:57.540> time<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.710> bottle<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
really long time like the bottle the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.750 
really long time like the bottle the
bottle<00:03:00.060> life<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:01.050> pan<00:03:01.290> life<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.610> use

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
bottle life the pan life so if you use

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.430 
bottle life the pan life so if you use
it<00:03:02.910> everyday<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.270> think<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.870> would<00:03:03.990> last<00:03:04.170> you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
it everyday I think it would last you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.740 
it everyday I think it would last you
about<00:03:04.980> three<00:03:05.340> months<00:03:05.490> wala<00:03:05.880> lasts<00:03:06.360> me<00:03:06.540> about

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
about three months wala lasts me about

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.440 
about three months wala lasts me about
three<00:03:06.960> months<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.980> think<00:03:08.880> 18-pound

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
three months and I think 18-pound

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.690 
three months and I think 18-pound
fifty-fifty<00:03:10.140> spread<00:03:11.070> over<00:03:11.190> three<00:03:11.310> months

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
fifty-fifty spread over three months

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.370 
fifty-fifty spread over three months
about<00:03:11.790> six<00:03:12.120> pounds<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.600> month<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.050> not<00:03:13.110> really

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
about six pounds a month it's not really

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.810 
about six pounds a month it's not really
bad<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:13.770> good<00:03:13.890> foundation<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.460> this<00:03:14.640> I
