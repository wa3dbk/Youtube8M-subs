00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
imagery I was working on was was very

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.420 
imagery I was working on was was very
stylized<00:02:53.560> imagery<00:02:55.319> by<00:02:56.319> no<00:02:56.379> means<00:02:56.709> was<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.069> you

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
stylized imagery by no means was it you

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.319 
stylized imagery by no means was it you
know<00:02:57.689> photo<00:02:58.689> realism<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.609> think<00:03:00.879> there

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
know photo realism and I think there

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.819 
know photo realism and I think there
were<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.659> were<00:03:01.719> certain<00:03:02.019> art<00:03:02.439> directors

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
were there were certain art directors

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.500 
were there were certain art directors
and<00:03:02.980> designers<00:03:03.099> who<00:03:03.549> understood<00:03:04.209> where<00:03:04.389> I<00:03:04.419> was

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
and designers who understood where I was

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.890 
and designers who understood where I was
coming<00:03:04.659> from<00:03:05.019> with<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.849> others<00:03:06.849> who<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.359> think

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
coming from with that others who I think

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.020 
coming from with that others who I think
had<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.109> difficult<00:03:08.739> time<00:03:08.769> trying<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.790> figure

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
had a difficult time trying to figure

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.420 
had a difficult time trying to figure
out<00:03:10.150> where<00:03:10.599> this<00:03:11.079> type<00:03:11.319> of<00:03:11.439> imagery<00:03:11.829> would<00:03:12.040> fit

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
out where this type of imagery would fit

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.949 
out where this type of imagery would fit
how<00:03:13.299> they<00:03:13.419> could<00:03:13.569> use<00:03:13.599> it<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:15.689> met<00:03:16.689> with<00:03:16.810> any

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
how they could use it and I met with any

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.289 
how they could use it and I met with any
number<00:03:17.349> of<00:03:17.379> different<00:03:20.549> criticisms<00:03:21.549> of<00:03:21.730> the

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
number of different criticisms of the

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.110 
number of different criticisms of the
style<00:03:22.629> of<00:03:22.750> work<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.109> did<00:03:23.319> but<00:03:23.790> ultimately<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.909> was

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
style of work I did but ultimately I was

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.149 
style of work I did but ultimately I was
fortunate<00:03:25.359> enough<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.959> find<00:03:26.139> some<00:03:26.829> folks<00:03:27.010> who

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
fortunate enough to find some folks who

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.740 
fortunate enough to find some folks who
were<00:03:27.280> very<00:03:27.669> encouraging<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.359> what<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.569> was

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
doing and while they were encouraging I

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.849 
doing and while they were encouraging I
I<00:03:34.180> think<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.959> think<00:03:35.469> one<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.709> most
