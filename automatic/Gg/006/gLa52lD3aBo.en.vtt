00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.460
 all these is looking at 38 for a new 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.470
 video is today I decided so 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.279
 to show you an application for 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.860
 fans of music and mix so this is 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.320
 of hedging dj mix and scratch for free 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.520
 so an application that came out 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.890
 free one day ago I believe 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.510
 she was 2013 leader of her 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.450
 paid application so because it's the 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.070
 best mix app and you 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.690
 can share your knicks which is the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.800
 first application that does that I'm going 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.810
 you show it right away 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.200
 she is really great and very 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.960
 well rated so here you see 2013 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.680
 win the app awards so here you go 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.079
 best application really not bad 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.180
 the slogan is full blender tanks so 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.680
 play mixer and share so not bad 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.869
 you install it I will show it to you 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.909
 right now she only makes 16.6 her 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.210
 words so what is very little for a 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.409
 mixer application compared to mate 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.340
 dj has to all the others all the others 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.370
 mix apps so here I louvre 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.810
 and I'm going to put my iphone on the other 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:35.110
 side that like this here you can 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.430
 note the application of course so is 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.540
 here so there is a money system 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.130
 automatic which is rather funny because 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.280
 you can buy something else so 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.170
 with this money 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.680
 So here it is here I think 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.869
 and here you have everything 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.020
 recording with headphones and all that 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.450
 so that's good I do not I'm going 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.369
 to show you that it is directly 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.239
 for 2 to become lovers old magpies 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.310
 So after that, you have to pay 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.390
 to play without paying, I tell you 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.620
 so advise here you put your 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.099
 music like these give a 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:32.709
 fun music 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:36.220
 we will put this example with 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.019
 so that's totally music 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.830
 different 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.760
 you click here to start the music 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.680
 is here too 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.920
 you can put them at the same time and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.350
 do a sync in the middle you 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.459
 can do several things he erased 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.110
 which is what eliminates the like well 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.810
 really a very nice application here 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:04.000
 look in the east in the options 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.160
 you have several things you have 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.770
 the restart after there are options 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.590
 that you have to buy with money from 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.690
 men of gold money what so 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.440
 here you also have some tips for 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.540
 edit the are really very fun 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.960
 so here it is as these are here you 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.170
 can change so the speed of sound 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.660

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.480
