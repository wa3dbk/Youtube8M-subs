00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
a bone and drag it around you should see

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
a bone and drag it around you should see
the<00:02:32.480> image<00:02:32.750> move<00:02:33.020> like<00:02:33.320> this

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
it looks like it's working now we can

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.550 
it looks like it's working now we can
animate<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.430> image<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.030> timeline

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
one other thing about bones is that you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.930 
one other thing about bones is that you
can<00:03:41.400> adjust<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.180> strength<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.750> each<00:03:42.900> bone<00:03:43.940> to

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
can adjust the strength of each bone to

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.479
