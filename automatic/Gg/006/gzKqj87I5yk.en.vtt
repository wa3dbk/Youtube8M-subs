00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 but always comfortable before taking 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.870
 any jump home 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.500
 look to see if they really do not get 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:17.220
 leave it up all day on the lady gaga and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.590
 she exaggerates also cheerful or performed 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.090
 but she can she is with us in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.279
 doubt the times they use jump with much 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 but we like to jump even without 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.269
 doubt that of long codÃ³ and there is 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.490
 teach us the best jumps 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.679
 of the pec type can use each type of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 each type of footwear and also in the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.940
 foot care in winter she goes 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.469
 teach a way to get cream on the foot and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.870
 You did not know but a little bit later. 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.640
 first start here with the shoes without 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.620
 jump and I showed the two boots here that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.329
 just because it's better than just because it 's worse 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
 that in winter 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.289
 Well here's the case, let's talk about the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.789
 jump and the beak to deal with each boot 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.469
 right 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.870
 The jump this first boot is best for 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.899
 because the jump will be 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.159
 high but has a compensation here in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.250
 tip 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.340
 so you actually end up eliminating 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.460
 is not a part of the jump as shown 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.850
 even in matters within it 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.979
 This half-paw strip ends up 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.689
 independent the eggs are very thin 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.780
 important is to have a compensation 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.049
 here, at least you will avoid a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.810
 callus exactly in that part of the foot 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.570
 which is what women most complain about 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.509
 down low and 4 ADESA again 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.579
 next to the fingers is where you have it 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.950
 lots of light is why so for us and 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.430
 let's talk the compensation that the beak 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.049
 the peak and if a little more rounded a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:53.600
 it is more appropriate than this 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.009
 is very little face of the ingrown toenail 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.899
 worse jonet 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:04.140
 is the fine beak and if the foot is of the woman not 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.390
 is suitable for this type of nozzle as 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.060
 stone for example that is in the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.920
 shoes very virgilio son 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.480
 This coarse stone is how long 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.470
 even better said the pilot in the face of 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.590
 Pain can tell if you and I can take 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.590
 to observe that the foot of the talita 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.220
 before announcing the program then 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.519
 You can observe the pdl is square 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.040
 attack then you wonder how 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.230
 You'll put that square foot in. 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.030
 of a fine alley with whoever has this is more 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.430
 More br quadradinho must avoid 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.260
 super slim jump and also that does not have the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.530
 compensation that the only son 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.040
 exactly that will compress then the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.319
 first problem that is going to is are 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.470
 calluses that usually give in 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.610
 the top of the drawing where it is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.410
 can not worsen a bunion yes despite the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.500
 be a disease a problem 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.769
 but it can be yes 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.569
 prioritized with the use of the daughter 's beak 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.829
 sneakers and shoes over the banks 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.170
 sneakers of course they are in real is 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.900
 because there is no leap you can choose 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.680
 the nozzle is also more suited to your 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.269
 foot 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.780
 We just have to be careful with the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.060
 a shoe that totally crawled the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.290
 orthopedists also do not indicate and 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.720
 always a jump of 3 centimeters of three 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.090
 the four used centimeters is ideal 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.609
 for the column so totally 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.709
 is not indicated either. 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.590
 orthopedists usually do not indicate 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.549
 This one you need to use a 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.230
 suddenly right 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.380
 Are you going to a party or to your party? 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.220
 profession and look for a wedge that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.370
 here is one this is besides being one in the beautiful 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.130
 nor does he have to compensate him at half-paw 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.569
 so a neon chooses anabelle hair to 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.459
 people finish that people promised 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.530
 Carlos's personal care of the feet in the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.269
 winter waiting the same message here and 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.940
 to exercise 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.130
 the people pass the cream people the cream on 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.569
 winter we just have to take a 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.239
 caution 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.820
 it is preferable to opt for a 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.209
 cream that is silicone-based 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.220
 urea here are moisturizers is more 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:28.289
 deep right sure lets pass the cream 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.229
 avoiding passing between the fingers only in the 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.539
 the top IEEs also a center 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.880
 times today stems precisely because 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.250
 You're probably going to put a sock 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.050
 You'll put a ball up and go. 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.560
 stay down here and dryer because 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.229
 because it's a tip that we give when 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.990
 You finished your bath to dry yourself. 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.220
 between the fingers sometimes have difficulty 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.860
 to lower the failure of the cold mecca 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.110
 for the same is the cold dryers not to 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.199
 burn and also not to leave the foot 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.610
 hot and still see the warm environment a 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.780
 environment conducive to the background then 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:10.849
 put the dryer in the cold and seven of them 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.849
 Fingers thank you, Christ.
