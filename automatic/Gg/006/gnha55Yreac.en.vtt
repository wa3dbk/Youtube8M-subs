show<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.820> variation<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:59.270> this<00:03:59.480> fan<00:03:59.990> mode<00:04:00.410> um

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:16.150 

so<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:04.970> snap<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:11.320> this<00:04:12.320> is<00:04:14.800> this<00:04:15.800> is<00:04:16.010> the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
so you snap that and this is this is the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.870 
so you snap that and this is this is the
other<00:04:16.340> variation<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.420> snapped<00:04:18.049> down<00:04:18.880> so

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
other variation so that snapped down so

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.880 
other variation so that snapped down so
it'd<00:04:20.000> be<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.180> ventus<00:04:20.859> version<00:04:21.859> and<00:04:22.750> these<00:04:23.890> are

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
it'd be a ventus version and these are

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:31.690 
it'd be a ventus version and these are
like<00:04:25.580> flipped<00:04:27.130> but<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.550> snap<00:04:28.850> down<00:04:29.210> um<00:04:30.700> show

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
like flipped but just snap down um show

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.240 
like flipped but just snap down um show
you<00:04:31.760> how<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.090> make<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:36.200> various<00:04:36.680> really

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.940 
you how to make it the various really
simple<00:04:37.780> completely<00:04:38.780> open<00:04:39.110> various<00:04:39.680> and

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
simple completely open various and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.270 
simple completely open various and
closes<00:04:40.490> back<00:04:40.730> legs<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:44.030> meta<00:04:44.360> wavern<00:04:44.990> uh<00:04:45.410> just

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
closes back legs the meta wavern uh just

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.810 
closes back legs the meta wavern uh just
make<00:04:46.610> life<00:04:47.240> metal<00:04:47.900> tear<00:04:48.940> this<00:04:49.940> um<00:04:51.490> okay<00:04:52.490> first

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
make life metal tear this um okay first

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.659 
make life metal tear this um okay first
you<00:04:52.970> hook<00:04:53.240> waiver<00:04:53.600> ins<00:04:53.840> fee<00:04:54.260> on<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.890> Nagas<00:04:55.400> head

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
but pushes horn down a little bit and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.980 
but pushes horn down a little bit and
then<00:04:58.610> attach<00:04:59.240> wired<00:05:01.000> like<00:05:02.000> right<00:05:02.479> there<00:05:03.169> and

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
then attach wired like right there and

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.950 
then attach wired like right there and
the<00:05:05.990> Mojito<00:05:06.410> brothers<00:05:06.890> um<00:05:07.360> it's<00:05:08.360> pretty

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
the Mojito brothers um it's pretty

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.790 
the Mojito brothers um it's pretty
fairly<00:05:09.710> simple<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.250> figure<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.700> out<00:05:11.530> but<00:05:12.530> you

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
fairly simple to figure that out but you

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.340 
fairly simple to figure that out but you
in<00:05:13.160> case<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:13.820> don't<00:05:13.970> know<00:05:14.150> just<00:05:14.960> take<00:05:15.200> the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
in case you don't know just take the

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.650 
in case you don't know just take the
regular<00:05:15.500> one<00:05:15.800> flip<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.340> head<00:05:16.520> over<00:05:16.850> will

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
regular one flip the head over will

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.159 
regular one flip the head over will
actually<00:05:17.960> keep<00:05:18.140> this<00:05:18.430> Provos<00:05:19.430> is<00:05:19.610> closed<00:05:20.169> and

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
actually keep this Provos is closed and

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.210 
actually keep this Provos is closed and
then<00:05:21.440> flip<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.190> out<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.760> yeah<00:05:23.979> um<00:05:24.979> and<00:05:25.940> this

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
then flip it out and yeah um and this

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.940 
then flip it out and yeah um and this
you<00:05:28.220> just<00:05:29.140> build<00:05:30.140> it's<00:05:30.320> pretty<00:05:30.620> simple<00:05:32.950> except

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
you just build it's pretty simple except

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.890 
you just build it's pretty simple except
that<00:05:34.160> you<00:05:34.430> open<00:05:34.790> the<00:05:34.910> peg<00:05:35.180> on<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.510> back<00:05:35.690> of

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
holes there's one there so you can just

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:48.580 
holes there's one there so you can just
insert<00:05:41.840> two<00:05:42.110> maxis<00:05:42.590> Drago<00:05:44.050> so<00:05:45.050> yeah<00:05:47.080> that's<00:05:48.080> my
