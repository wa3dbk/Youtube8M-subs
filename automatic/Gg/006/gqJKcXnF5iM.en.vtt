00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
the big eye tuna and then there y'all

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.289 
the big eye tuna and then there y'all
Ophelia<00:02:35.530> before<00:02:36.530> another<00:02:36.830> species<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.489> the

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
Ophelia before another species so the

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.110 
Ophelia before another species so the
big<00:02:38.989> eye<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.769> bluefin<00:02:40.220> tend<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.730> migrate

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
big eye and the bluefin tend to migrate

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.089 
big eye and the bluefin tend to migrate
at<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.540> deeper<00:02:41.900> depth<00:02:42.140> than<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.530> other<00:02:42.769> species

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
at a deeper depth than the other species

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.759 
at a deeper depth than the other species
and<00:02:43.549> for<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.510> most<00:02:44.720> part<00:02:44.989> there's<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.380> bit<00:02:45.560> more

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
and for the most part there's a bit more

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.920 
and for the most part there's a bit more
fat<00:02:46.099> in<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.430> tissue<00:02:46.640> itself<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.720> far

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
fat in the tissue itself so it's a far

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.820 
fat in the tissue itself so it's a far
more<00:02:47.959> flavorful<00:02:48.650> fish<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.160> may<00:02:49.700> be<00:02:49.760> all<00:02:50.030> of

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
more flavorful fish that may be all of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.310 
more flavorful fish that may be all of
this<00:02:51.830> this<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.670> good<00:02:52.880> example<00:02:53.269> of<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:54.079> little

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
this this is a good example of a little

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.580 
this this is a good example of a little
bit<00:02:54.440> more<00:02:54.620> fat<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.489> white<00:02:55.780> cell<00:02:56.780> specks<00:02:57.290> in

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
bit more fat the white cell specks in

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.220 
bit more fat the white cell specks in
between<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.280> concentric<00:02:58.850> circles<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.390> fat<00:02:59.660> so

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
between the concentric circles is fat so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.349 
between the concentric circles is fat so
like<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.650> see<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.340> Morikami<00:03:02.120> no

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
like you can see this on is Morikami no

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.180 
like you can see this on is Morikami no
fat<00:03:02.630> at<00:03:02.780> all<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.560> this<00:03:03.680> has<00:03:03.890> got<00:03:04.070> the
