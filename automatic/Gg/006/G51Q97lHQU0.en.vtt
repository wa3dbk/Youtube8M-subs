00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.390
 new tutorial on how to download e 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.760
 install a zoom and 1.8 hundred for 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.189
 minecraft in its most recent version that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 is the 1.8 the first thing that you have to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.000
 to do is open your browser 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.419
 favorite favorite in my case is the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.060
 missile to firefox you go to the link that you 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.590
 I'll leave in the description of the video and 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.590
 you wait for the 5 sounds 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.149
 you give jump advertising 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.149
 and you download the file 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.719
 it takes very little as you see 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.820
 and good once the file is downloaded 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.760
 you have not downloaded the file saying 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.610
 you open it 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.880
 and see that what you have to do it 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.000
 also right click and extract here 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.210
 what you have to do with this folder 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.420
 this you can already eliminate it is that the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.060
 copy is good the cover is rather it 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.530
 give to 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 windows r 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.979
 to accept so he does not know what is the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.110
 symbol of the windows here you give to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.470
 run 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.100
