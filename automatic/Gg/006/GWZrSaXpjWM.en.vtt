00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.239
 talented travel and writing 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.460
 net fresh is not too pretentious 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.270
 members rather the demolisher of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 marketwatch 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.399
 is a light and humorous footprint the freight 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 and even makes fun of the fact 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.110
 hawk archer if type avenger half b 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 know nobody believes that it is a 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.680
 avenger in his building 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.390
 plots are half the day to day of the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.309
 client button however will not see them 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.229
 saving the world every week at least 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 not up to American edition six that was the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.310
 last theory is not pretentious 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.229
 the first year for 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.010
 example it will solve a problem in the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.710
 his building 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.830
 ksh that would give a great TV series 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.080
 sabit a sitcom much by the drawing of the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.570
 travel game is very cool as they are 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.790
 legal the angles he places and he uses 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.860
 several frames per page is a 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.570
 nice series to accompany me nothing 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.890
 out of the ordinary but it 's a very 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.229
 cool to have a good mix captain america is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 a series written by Rick Remender and 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.040
 designed by junior john romita who is 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.990
 the case of what you want and have already designed 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.119
 almost everything nice here the captain 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.640
 America falls into a trap and ends up being 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.890
 taken to dimension z having a 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.500
 place full of bizarre monsters know 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.780
 This picture looks like a 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 late with a low budget with those 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.630
 malicious monsters is a job was 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.490
 total 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.159
 the traffic in the joke or not enters 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.560
 I found fun I've read so are six 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.780
 and the bow extends even further 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.399
 is a series that has good designs 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.420
 It is not the best that home had has 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.849
 to offer 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.810
 but I but it's cool I like the traits 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.489
 his squares 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.960
 the patch and will will include in the script 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.610
 a flashback 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.290
 then America as a child even though 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.390
 to justify the way he 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.970
 currently, 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.800
 I really liked it out there, I do not know why it's a 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.200
 very different from the captain of the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.690
 ed brubaker I liked it is a series 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.270
 irregular knows average is nothing much 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.650
 elaborated in a script that reflects 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.750
 You know but it's fun to follow good 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.540
 secret avengers is a series focused 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.950
 the child in their agents is aimed at 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.980
 the espionage that what is a thing 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.660
 I was only going to write the first edition 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.560
 I left here in the state I did not have access 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.960
 to the americans 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.030
 well we have four characters here one 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.940
 film is that it is the agent 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.580
 coulson the archer hawk the black widow 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.550
 and the nick fury jun for this nick fury 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.130
 in fact it is called landmarks of a sound 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.500
 he is the son of the original nick fury and how 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.840
 the original retired and he finished 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.450
 giving the father's name and legacy face it 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.370
 obviously the marvel trying to enjoy 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.190
 success in the movie character in the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.070
 comics that is not an idea but 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.320
 was not very well done as nick fury 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.450
 original he enjoys an air of 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.140
 respect knows why this affection nick 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.380
 fury 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.820
 but when the nike junior appears I do not 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.830
 I have no idea what to think. 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.810
 simply replace the face with a 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.300
 another ethnic group 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.310
 I think it was not a good idea, I do not know. 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.530
 why would a nick fury make a 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.690
 michael jackson reverse treatment 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.910
 It was good to know that this is an idea. 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.310
 stupid but last but not least every year 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.350
 convinced it does not compromise the series only 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.540
 that cause a certain expensive and 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.280
 the latter here was a comic that I 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.320
 It surprised me a lot, I thought it was cool. 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.620
 the first story has art here 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.630
 luke ross guy here is fantastic is a lot 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.190
 cool is the type of dash I like 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.890
 Read this, he said He said, and I, and you. 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.210
 I think I recommend it here, I like it 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.560
 It was worth the investment. 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.660
 I'll follow up at least until 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.490
 finish the first acts 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.010
 she has a board meeting that has a 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.330
 advantage of having two stories closed 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.489
 in the case of the archer hawk 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.170
 secret avengers and the captain's 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.210
 america it's kind of a series 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.320
 then you can read and have a 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.810
 whether it is worth it or not 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.950
 the single from the mix that arrived here in 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.230
 sierra gaucho is on the way good sellers 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.700
 the fabulous avengers were a series 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.470
 that he was eager to follow 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.580
 I learned that would have a 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.200
 regional 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.690
 is a series written by rick remender 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.910
 who is the same face as captain america and 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.800
 drawn by a hunting fighter and it's a guy 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.930
 who has already designed the etherea being 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.730
 in the stands is an excellent series of 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.650
 amazing drawings ex-member him 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.990
 is not in its prime that it is not a 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.910
 Bad art, I like it, but I do. 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.920
 I preferred him in other jobs and at 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.900
 I read on the internet this series goes 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.140
 to switch from face to face 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.330
 pink brain the red skull steals the 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.360
 Professor Xavier's brain to try 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.090
 control people's minds to 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.700
 eradicates threat mutants face and form 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.520
 that he is portrayed is terrible knows the 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.500
 His stance looks like those year old villains. 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.180
 who dream of dominating the world 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.310
 good and captain america while 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.800
 Alexander was recruited if his brother 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.080
 to release a mixed team of 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.000
 Avengers heating it ends up giving 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.230
 facing the red skull plane 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.560
 running 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.350
 I found it to be weak is not bad, but I know 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.720
 I found the plot silly to a single 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.880
 The good thing was that it would be a 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.010
 consequence of the avengers of sexy 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.620
 I even went to the American edition 4 that 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.400
 the last designed by the game casai e ea 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.520
 plot does not solve avengers air is 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.600
 inscribed by dn the clothes and drawn 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.040
 by kevin walker 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.470
 the plot unfolds on an island 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.360
 controlled by the arcade where much of 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.580
 members of the Avengers Academy 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.770
 go to them are required to participate 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.380
 of a game in which only one of them will leave 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.760
 I live and is an impromptu game 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.470
 brazen right 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.300
 they even make jokes about it 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.220
 here in the magazine itself was canceled in 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.920
 edition 18 had one including one below 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.260
 signed fan because it is expensive reached 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.080
 die five characters here during the 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.090
 series finally I found them not cool zinho 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.080
 supports an investment of a mix 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.000
 whole only because of this series 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.430
 finishing the mix we have the sale already 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.560
 sowed that it is a series with a footprint 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.900
 I did not like it very much 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.680
 corrosive she will switch writers 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.810
 and designers over time 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.880
 she is more focused on the avengers of 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.900
 cinema including the Iron Man for 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.120
 example he 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.770
 he does not wear a black outfit as in 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.080
 series of newspaper sea in the others 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.610
 He wears the traditional red suit I 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.060
 I think it 's kind of a separate universe 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.560
 and I do not want to look pretentious or 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.449
 arrogant or higher okay but I do not 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.120
 I managed to finish the first expensive edition 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.350
 it's terrible xii it looks like a group of 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.210
 generic sellers 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.039
 we took the verdict man I 'm not going 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.660
 keep on going will not be worth 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:13.349
 The investment is so great for me. 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.210
 this is my assessment the staff 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.169
 I hope that my reflections have been 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.050
 used for those who want 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:21.270
 accompany the new or rude margin 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.410
 What you want to buy the kit is interesting 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.410
 comment and a hug
