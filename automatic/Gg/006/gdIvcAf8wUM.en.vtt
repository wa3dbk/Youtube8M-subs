response<00:02:15.850> when<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:16.940> look<00:02:17.120> at<00:02:17.240> your<00:02:17.360> notation

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
response when you look at your notation

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.840 
response when you look at your notation
you'll<00:02:18.020> see<00:02:18.230> how<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.530> cascades<00:02:18.770> into<00:02:19.370> one

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
you'll see how this cascades into one

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.310 
you'll see how this cascades into one
another<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.330> really<00:02:20.690> have<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.990> have<00:02:21.140> them

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
another and you really have to have them

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.420 
another and you really have to have them
smooth<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:22.220> tie<00:02:22.400> them<00:02:22.610> together<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:28.070> then

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
smooth to tie them together and then

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.630 
smooth to tie them together and then
back<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.850> your<00:02:28.970> walking<00:02:29.209> line

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.760 

and<00:02:34.120> that's<00:02:34.360> how<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.569> last<00:02:35.230> bar<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.650> the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
and that's how the last bar of the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.890 
and that's how the last bar of the
metric<00:02:36.100> or<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.610> example<00:02:37.000> goes<00:02:39.630> now<00:02:40.630> what's

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
metric or the example goes now what's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.010 
metric or the example goes now what's
the<00:02:41.050> constant<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:42.120> whole<00:02:43.120> time<00:02:43.690> that's

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
the constant the whole time that's

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.660 
the constant the whole time that's
what's<00:02:44.319> really<00:02:44.470> important<00:02:44.980> you'll<00:02:45.459> even<00:02:45.580> see

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
what's really important you'll even see

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.559 
what's really important you'll even see
in<00:02:45.910> your<00:02:46.030> notation<00:02:46.569> that<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.720> have<00:02:46.959> no<00:02:47.650> X<00:02:47.950> no<00:02:48.310> X<00:02:48.760> 1
