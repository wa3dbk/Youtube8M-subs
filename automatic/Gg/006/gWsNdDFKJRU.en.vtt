00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:21.420
 The place is 20 hours from tomorrow Jorge 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:25.050
 go play but it does not rain 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.810
 today do not tell me that this generation was 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.169
 hot and six in the vacancy during the drought 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.169
 extreme 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:38.340
 adelino was driven dis which 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 I did not claim 1 for flamengo 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.180
 but this is a big secret maybe 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.239
 decay of the church from the collapse of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.760
 contemporary church fall church 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.939
 of Christian failure to overcome sin 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.840
 in his sanctification in the expansion of the kingdom 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.289
 and the neo-testamentary characteristic 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.170
 apostolic 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:16.140
 the fact that the church is not giving in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.380
 do God's will in doing in the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.549
 scriptures in doing the gospel emphasis 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.950
 not spiritual 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.819
 she is emphasizing her own 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.569
 will at will in the human will to 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:35.460
 anthropocentric is giving I do in 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:36.750
 earth things I do in the conquest 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.720
 material 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.470
 we are losing the centrality of 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.750
 Christ and when a Christian a church 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.009
 asks the centrality of Christ 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.130
 she becomes a Christian ethic, the primacy is 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.710
 all in all the corner stone is the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.869
 foundation 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.740
 The Bible Tells My Brother That We Do not 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.549
 we do only religious acts for the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.770
 glory of him as a simple act of 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.920
 drinking water is made for his glory 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.760
 nothing out of Christ will satisfy you of 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.440
 Fill 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.950
 nothing nothing a trip to europe 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.230
 clothes no medical or sex courses 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.010
 neither a marriage nor a trip to the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.609
 france is deuteronomy chapter 8 no 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:34.530
 by bread alone does man live but by every 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:38.790
 a word that proceeds from the mouth of my God 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.000
 Brother, everything out of Christ is absurd. 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:48.620
 because of this, to Christians who never 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.160
 insatiable 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.459
 desperate in the attempt of happiness 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.859
 completude pleasure out of christ you 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.730
 will never find 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.750
 see centrality christ 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.090
 verse all things were created by 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:14.480
 he thrones principalities powers 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.700
 governments invisible invisible things 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.280
 were created by him 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.400
 but pay attention the text does not reveal 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.849
 that things were only created by him 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.970
 that he is the center of all things 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.909
 everything that was created was created for him 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.440
 I see the text says no 16 in the last 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:39.769
 phrase everything was created through him and 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.129
 for him everything has to converge for him 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.090
 our whole life is lived for him all 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:50.930
 what do we do for him 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:56.930
 in him the Christian life has only one 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:00.950
 goal for christ time to follow 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.150
 he is before all things old 17 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.930
 in him everything subsists he is the head of the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.049
 body of the church and it is the principle 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.030
 firstborn among the dead to 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:19.700
 all things take precedence 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.079
 intending Christ to have primacy over his 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.539
 marriage 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.560
 christ time sky image in stereo 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:31.250
 Christ takes precedence over his profession 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.789
 Christ has primacy of the heavens is our father. 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.270
 that are in the heavenly sanctification be thy 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:43.099
 name come to us your kingdom be 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.950
 Thy will be done on earth as 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.260
 in the sky this Christocentric prayer that 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.060
 prayer of the ecclesia that prayer of who 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.310
 is in the first love this prayer of the 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.070
 this pastor 's prayer is yours. 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.990
 The priest's heart do not make mine. 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:02.570
 Will but do your let me tell you 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.830
 something here my brother there is absolutely 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.870
 Anything out of Christ is the most 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.289
 complete absurdity 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.389
 whatever you do 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:19.089
 he desires to make him out of Christ in 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:22.449
 that Christ is the center without 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:26.249
 centrality of Christ is absurd is a 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:32.520
 scandal is blasphemy 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:32.520
 everything out of Christ means nothing
