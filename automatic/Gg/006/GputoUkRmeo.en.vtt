00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
instead of ripping them but I feel like

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.900 
instead of ripping them but I feel like
that<00:03:06.310> helps<00:03:06.489> my<00:03:06.730> hair<00:03:06.760> grow<00:03:07.230> longer<00:03:08.230> because

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.660 
when I'm like trimming it I'll trim it
and<00:03:13.180> then<00:03:13.450> I'll<00:03:14.290> trim<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.650> an<00:03:14.709> inch<00:03:14.860> then<00:03:15.220> it

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
and then I'll trim it an inch then it

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.490 
and then I'll trim it an inch then it
grows<00:03:15.910> an<00:03:16.180> inch<00:03:16.300> over<00:03:16.690> like<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.959> next<00:03:17.230> couple

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.560 
grows an inch over like the next couple
months<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.950> then<00:03:18.550> it's<00:03:18.760> time<00:03:19.209> for<00:03:19.239> another

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
months and then it's time for another

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.190 
months and then it's time for another
trim<00:03:20.080> so<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:20.890> feel<00:03:21.310> like<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.810> kind<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.870> helps

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.009 
it and if I just cut the done it dead
ends<00:03:26.170> off<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.470> then<00:03:26.860> leave<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.370> rest

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
ends off and then leave the rest

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.229 
ends off and then leave the rest
it<00:03:29.019> grows<00:03:29.380> longer<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.190> works<00:03:30.430> for<00:03:30.700> me<00:03:30.850> so
