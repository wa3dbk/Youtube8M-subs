safety on all the time make sure that
safety<00:01:57.939> always<00:01:58.119> stays<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:59.770> I'm<00:01:59.829> gonna<00:01:59.950> load

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
safety always stays now I'm gonna load

are going to open both of our safeties

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.550 
are going to open both of our safeties
here<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:07.479> do<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.600> quick<00:02:07.899> test<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.380> make<00:02:08.500> sure

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
here just do a quick test to make sure

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.370 
here just do a quick test to make sure
the<00:02:08.800> trap<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:09.220> actually<00:02:09.550> going<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> work<00:02:10.380> just

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
the trap is actually going to work just

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.450 
the trap is actually going to work just
a<00:02:11.500> quick<00:02:11.800> demonstration

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.100 

that's<00:02:16.390> how<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.660> use<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.290> daily<00:02:17.740> trap<00:02:19.110> all

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
that's how you use a daily trap all

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.720 
that's how you use a daily trap all
right<00:02:20.290> Here<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> am<00:02:20.620> standing<00:02:21.130> next<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.460> our

the trap is submerged triggered we're

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.150 
the trap is submerged triggered we're
ready<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.860> go<00:02:30.960> here's<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.140> trigger<00:02:32.380> right

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
there okay now what we did was use a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.760 
there okay now what we did was use a
series<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.440> pieces<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.640> sticks<00:02:40.560> jammed<00:02:41.560> into

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:51.219 
of water over your trigger we'll see if

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:58.050 
of water over your trigger we'll see if
we<00:03:51.340> can<00:03:51.489> be<00:03:51.609> ID<00:03:55.260> okay<00:03:56.260> we're<00:03:56.439> almost<00:03:57.060> getting

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
we can be ID okay we're almost getting

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.699 
we can be ID okay we're almost getting
there

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
there

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.319

might<00:04:04.329> have<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.689> dig<00:04:05.139> a<00:04:05.200> little<00:04:05.470> bit<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:05.799> this

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
might have to dig a little bit so this

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.979 
might have to dig a little bit so this
edge<00:04:06.400> right<00:04:06.730> here<00:04:07.109> will<00:04:08.109> be<00:04:08.200> underwater<00:04:09.989> it's

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
edge right here will be underwater it's

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.390 
edge right here will be underwater it's
always<00:04:11.169> a<00:04:11.200> good<00:04:11.319> idea<00:04:11.379> to<00:04:11.769> leave<00:04:11.889> the<00:04:11.950> Safety's

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
always a good idea to leave the Safety's

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:22.900 
always a good idea to leave the Safety's
on<00:04:12.519> while<00:04:12.760> your<00:04:12.879> difference

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910
