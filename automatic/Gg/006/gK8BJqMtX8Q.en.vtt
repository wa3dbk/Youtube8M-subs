00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
trying it out a little bit this I love

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.409 
trying it out a little bit this I love
it<00:04:43.310> I'll<00:04:44.310> start<00:04:44.639> off<00:04:44.699> by<00:04:44.910> talking<00:04:44.970> about

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
it I'll start off by talking about

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.779 
it I'll start off by talking about
craftsmanship<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:49.020> kicks<00:04:49.440> aren't<00:04:50.130> perfectly

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
craftsmanship the kicks aren't perfectly

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:58.219 
craftsmanship the kicks aren't perfectly
rounded<00:04:51.419> but<00:04:52.520> they're<00:04:53.520> okay<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:57.110> you're<00:04:58.110> not

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
rounded but they're okay and you're not

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.240 
rounded but they're okay and you're not
perfect<00:04:59.030> the<00:05:00.030> kind<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.330> squares<00:05:01.250> but

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
perfect the kind of squares but

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.270 
perfect the kind of squares but
everything<00:05:02.580> else<00:05:02.760> is<00:05:02.940> perfect<00:05:03.810> I<00:05:04.440> think<00:05:04.919> we're

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
everything else is perfect I think we're

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.790 
everything else is perfect I think we're
not<00:05:05.400> perfect<00:05:05.700> with<00:05:06.380> great<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:10.410> could<00:05:10.590> be<00:05:10.770> a

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
not perfect with great it could be a

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.580 
not perfect with great it could be a
little<00:05:11.450> couple<00:05:12.450> more<00:05:12.599> plots<00:05:12.900> because<00:05:13.200> you<00:05:13.349> can

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
little couple more plots because you can

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:24.610 
little couple more plots because you can
bend<00:05:14.039> them<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.280> little<00:05:14.729> bit<00:05:16.070> but<00:05:18.950> it's<00:05:19.950> fine

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:32.870

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
I pick this up at target for ten dollars

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.290 
I pick this up at target for ten dollars
which<00:05:58.349> was<00:05:58.590> totally<00:05:58.830> worth<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.699> think

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
which was totally worth it I think

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.290 
which was totally worth it I think
anyways<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:02.280> reason<00:06:02.550> I<00:06:02.610> didn't<00:06:02.880> put<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.120> tech

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
anyways the reason I didn't put the tech

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.620 
anyways the reason I didn't put the tech
deck<00:06:03.479> grip<00:06:03.690> on<00:06:03.900> it<00:06:03.930> was<00:06:04.409> because<00:06:04.919> when<00:06:05.789> i<00:06:05.880> try

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
deck grip on it was because when i try

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.879 
deck grip on it was because when i try
to<00:06:06.659> take<00:06:06.870> off<00:06:07.050> the

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
to take off the
