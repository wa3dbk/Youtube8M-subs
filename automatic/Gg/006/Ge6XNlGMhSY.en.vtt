00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.230 

okay<00:02:35.100> for<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.400> you're<00:02:35.610> probably<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.030> gonna

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
okay for this you're probably just gonna

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.690 
okay for this you're probably just gonna
wanna<00:02:36.510> run<00:02:37.380> forward<00:02:37.950> if<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.220> don't<00:02:38.400> want<00:02:38.580> to

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
wanna run forward if you don't want to

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.100 
wanna run forward if you don't want to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.280 

Mario<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.330> Bowser<00:02:47.330> turns<00:02:47.690> into<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.020> dead

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
Mario and Bowser turns into a dead

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.220 
Mario and Bowser turns into a dead
blooper<00:02:48.680> afterwards<00:02:49.660> cuz<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.900> know<00:02:50.990> what

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
blooper afterwards cuz you know what

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.970 
blooper afterwards cuz you know what
drugs<00:02:52.040> that's<00:02:52.760> what

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.130 

yeah<00:02:57.550> I'm<00:02:57.819> not<00:02:58.000> even<00:02:58.300> gonna<00:02:58.450> bother<00:02:58.959> with<00:02:59.319> that

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.650 

and<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.490> probably<00:03:06.730> shouldn't<00:03:07.090> run<00:03:07.240> our<00:03:07.360> lives

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
and you probably shouldn't run our lives

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.800 
and you probably shouldn't run our lives
here<00:03:08.020> since<00:03:08.380> there's<00:03:08.620> many<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:10.510> one's<00:03:10.690> gone

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
here since there's many that one's gone

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.809 
here since there's many that one's gone
but<00:03:13.810> basically<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.530> just<00:03:14.560> gotta<00:03:14.950> go<00:03:15.520> up<00:03:15.700> and

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
but basically you just gotta go up and

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.710 
but basically you just gotta go up and
hit<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:17.640> now<00:03:18.640> you're<00:03:18.940> probably<00:03:19.300> gonna<00:03:19.600> want

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
hit this now you're probably gonna want

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.810 
hit this now you're probably gonna want
to<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.410> as<00:03:20.620> much<00:03:20.830> time<00:03:21.160> here<00:03:21.220> as<00:03:21.550> you<00:03:21.790> can

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
to have as much time here as you can

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.860 
to have as much time here as you can
because<00:03:22.390> if<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:24.310> fall<00:03:24.520> here<00:03:25.120> you're<00:03:25.330> not<00:03:25.450> dead

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
because if you fall here you're not dead

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.190 
because if you fall here you're not dead
but<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.230> are<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:27.459> do<00:03:27.580> have<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.200> start

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
but you are you do have to like start

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.460 
but you are you do have to like start
this<00:03:29.470> area<00:03:29.920> over<00:03:30.930> not<00:03:31.930> from<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.290> like

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
this area over not from the like

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.030 
this area over not from the like
beginning<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.220> level<00:03:33.550> as<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.670> whole<00:03:34.000> but

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
beginning of the level as a whole but

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.710 
beginning of the level as a whole but
and<00:03:36.040> i'll<00:03:36.340> probably<00:03:36.610> fall<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.390> you'll

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
and i'll probably fall so you'll

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:46.530 
and i'll probably fall so you'll
probably<00:03:37.989> see<00:03:44.130> okay<00:03:45.130> yeah

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
probably see okay yeah

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
and that's pretty much it for this for

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.469 
and that's pretty much it for this for
this<00:06:27.009> level<00:06:27.310> map<00:06:27.970> pack<00:06:28.300> thing<00:06:29.229> I<00:06:30.300> might<00:06:31.300> do

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
this level map pack thing I might do

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:37.050 
this level map pack thing I might do
some<00:06:31.719> more<00:06:31.900> add<00:06:32.740> another<00:06:32.800> time<00:06:35.219> because<00:06:36.219> but<00:06:37.030> I

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
some more add another time because but I

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.089 
some more add another time because but I
haven't<00:06:37.569> really<00:06:37.840> tried<00:06:38.199> any<00:06:38.469> of<00:06:38.560> these<00:06:38.860> other

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.099 
haven't really tried any of these other

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.550 
haven't really tried any of these other
ones<00:06:39.400> but<00:06:39.759> i'll<00:06:40.120> probably<00:06:40.360> do<00:06:40.659> that<00:06:40.870> i<00:06:41.199> might

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
ones but i'll probably do that i might

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.529 
ones but i'll probably do that i might
not<00:06:41.740> record<00:06:42.159> it<00:06:42.310> but<00:06:42.520> you<00:06:42.669> know<00:06:43.229> and<00:06:45.419> i'll<00:06:46.419> see
