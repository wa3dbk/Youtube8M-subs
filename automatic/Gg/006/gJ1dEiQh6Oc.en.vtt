00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
a little first impression of it as you

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.789 
a little first impression of it as you
can<00:00:11.910> see<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> package<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.049> says<00:00:13.410> it's

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
can see on the package that says it's

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.580 
can see on the package that says it's
the<00:00:14.519> most<00:00:14.730> precise<00:00:15.420> stylus<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> market

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the most precise stylus on the market

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.620 
the most precise stylus on the market
and<00:00:16.880> I'm<00:00:17.880> curious<00:00:18.510> if<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:20.640> could<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.970> true<00:00:21.270> so

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
and I'm curious if this could be true so

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.859 
and I'm curious if this could be true so
let's<00:00:22.170> find<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> open<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.800> you

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
let's find out so I open it up for you

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.010 
let's find out so I open it up for you
first<00:00:29.150> we<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:31.800> pen<00:00:32.009> itself<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:33.570> stylus

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
first we have the pen itself the stylus

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.160 
first we have the pen itself the stylus
it<00:00:34.410> looks<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:36.360> common<00:00:36.809> ball

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
it looks just like a very common ball

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.020 
it looks just like a very common ball
pen<00:00:37.489> as<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:40.100> in<00:00:41.100> addition<00:00:41.670> we

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
pen as you can see and in addition we

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.139 
pen as you can see and in addition we
have<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:44.390> little<00:00:45.390> cap<00:00:46.370> which<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.550> keep<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
have this little cap which we keep the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.880 
have this little cap which we keep the
screw<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.809> back<00:00:52.489> or<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:54.059> course<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
screw on the back or of course if you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.700 
screw on the back or of course if you
want<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> take<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.829> on<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.890> top<00:01:01.039> so

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
want to take it with you on the top so

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.970 
want to take it with you on the top so
the<00:01:04.250> top<00:01:04.489> won't<00:01:04.910> break<00:01:05.210> off<00:01:06.670> so<00:01:07.670> let's<00:01:07.970> see<00:01:08.980> so

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
the top won't break off so let's see so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.370 
the top won't break off so let's see so
the<00:01:10.190> most<00:01:10.370> important<00:01:10.970> difference<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.990> other

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
the most important difference to other

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.920 
the most important difference to other
styluses<00:01:13.010> is<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:14.510> top<00:01:15.250> where<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.340> see<00:01:16.930> in

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
styluses is the top where you see in

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.690 
styluses is the top where you see in
this<00:01:18.110> little<00:01:18.500> plastic<00:01:18.800> plate<00:01:21.130> which<00:01:22.130> protects

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
this little plastic plate which protects

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.920 
this little plastic plate which protects
the<00:01:23.210> top<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:24.200> course<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.740> iPad<00:01:25.160> from

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
the top and of course the iPad from

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.240 
the top and of course the iPad from
being<00:01:26.930> scratched<00:01:27.410> by<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:28.310> pen<00:01:28.960> as<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:31.070> can

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
being scratched by the pen as you can

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.810 
being scratched by the pen as you can
see<00:01:32.170> comparison<00:01:33.170> I<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:35.750> other<00:01:36.229> no-name<00:01:36.820> very

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
see comparison I have other no-name very

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.080 
see comparison I have other no-name very
common<00:01:38.300> stylus<00:01:38.869> which<00:01:39.770> has<00:01:40.040> this<00:01:42.820> plastic<00:01:43.820> top

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
common stylus which has this plastic top

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.880 
common stylus which has this plastic top
it's<00:01:44.960> very<00:01:45.080> big<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:47.110> we'll<00:01:48.110> see<00:01:48.380> about<00:01:48.619> the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
it's very big and we'll see about the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.580 
it's very big and we'll see about the
difference<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.630> now<00:01:50.780> I'm<00:01:50.930> going<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.350> draw<00:01:51.560> a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
difference so now I'm going to draw a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.870 
difference so now I'm going to draw a
few<00:01:51.680> lines<00:01:52.090> first<00:01:53.090> with<00:01:53.509> this<00:01:53.720> very<00:01:54.380> common

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
few lines first with this very common

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:05.469 
few lines first with this very common
stylus<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:57.490> will<00:01:58.490> try<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.210> draw<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.750> square

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.809 

and<00:02:05.930> as<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:06.380> can<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:08.679> it's<00:02:09.679> not<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.099> easy<00:02:10.459> to

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
and as you can see it's not that easy to

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.190 
and as you can see it's not that easy to
connect<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.690> lines<00:02:11.930> precisely<00:02:12.739> together

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
connect the lines precisely together

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.660 
connect the lines precisely together
because<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.379> this<00:02:15.530> very<00:02:16.459> big<00:02:16.989> top<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.670> cannot

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
because of this very big top I cannot

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.170 
because of this very big top I cannot
really<00:02:19.910> see<00:02:20.590> where<00:02:21.590> my<00:02:22.099> stylus<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.819> going<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
really see where my stylus is going to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.660 
really see where my stylus is going to
connect<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.690> iPad<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.160> makes<00:02:25.519> it

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
connect to the iPad so this makes it

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.089 
connect to the iPad so this makes it
kind<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.630> difficult<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.730> work<00:02:28.880> precisely<00:02:30.099> so

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
kind of difficult to work precisely so

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.180 
kind of difficult to work precisely so
now<00:02:31.250> in<00:02:31.459> comparison<00:02:32.110> I'll<00:02:33.110> try<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.470> Adonit

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
now in comparison I'll try the Adonit

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.630 
now in comparison I'll try the Adonit
jot<00:02:34.250> Pro

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.120 

as<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.930> see<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.850> way<00:02:47.240> more<00:02:47.270> easy<00:02:48.130> to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
as you can see it's way more easy to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.400 
as you can see it's way more easy to
connect<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:51.200> lines<00:02:52.270> because<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.510> can<00:02:54.050> see

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
connect the lines because I can see

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.330 
connect the lines because I can see
through<00:02:54.830> this<00:02:55.670> little<00:02:55.970> plastic<00:02:56.180> plate<00:02:57.340> which

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
through this little plastic plate which

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.790 
through this little plastic plate which
gives<00:02:58.610> me<00:02:58.760> the<00:03:00.100> possibility<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:02.780> work<00:03:03.500> way

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
gives me the possibility to to work way

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.270 
gives me the possibility to to work way
more<00:03:04.070> accurate<00:03:05.470> yeah<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:06.770> this<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
more accurate yeah so this is the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.840 
more accurate yeah so this is the
biggest<00:03:07.580> difference<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.750> guess<00:03:09.850> they're

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
biggest difference and I guess they're

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.910 
biggest difference and I guess they're
kind<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.330> right<00:03:11.510> when<00:03:11.810> they're<00:03:12.020> saying<00:03:12.260> it's

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
kind of right when they're saying it's

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.420 
kind of right when they're saying it's
the<00:03:13.070> most<00:03:13.340> precise<00:03:13.760> stylus<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.450> market<00:03:15.430> so

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
the most precise stylus on the market so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.690 
the most precise stylus on the market so
if<00:03:16.610> you're<00:03:16.850> into<00:03:17.150> drawing<00:03:17.450> into<00:03:17.780> sketching

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
if you're into drawing into sketching

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.640 
if you're into drawing into sketching
and<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:21.170> do<00:03:23.200> yeah

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
and to do yeah

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.000 
and to do yeah
very<00:03:24.920> detailed<00:03:25.550> drawings<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.959> guess<00:03:27.800> you're

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
very detailed drawings I guess you're

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.390
