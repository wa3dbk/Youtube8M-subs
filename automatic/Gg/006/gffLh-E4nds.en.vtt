00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.299
 so quiet from now on again what 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.320
 I tried a new one and wanted to have one 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.900
 from microscope 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.400
 on my 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.009
 Monitor appears 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.140
 I had such a little bear first 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.569
 But the artnet tries to low resolution because you see 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.159
 district 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.020
 and here I have it 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.510
 Son hand microscope 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.250
 I had always bought so out of curiosity the cost so 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.320
 just under 30 euros 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
 and then I just think that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.020
 c 2 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.620
 Kick off anyway today for the Lumix gf1 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.810
 taken and that may also stuffed one 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.070
 Tim foam rubber 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.310
 drum drum with it 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.310
 Faustus reasonably 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.380
 that's how it looks 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.800
 under the radar location 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.350
 Beagle then 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.240
 accept via USB world 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200
 to the computer 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 only one can 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.030
 the USB camera now here the movies can 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 watch and 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 new where the quality is natural 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 expected 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.770
 driven 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.970
 that's the wing 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.970
 the mosquito 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.010
 where can this software with that is by the way 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.860
 dino-lite 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.750
 Close Dan 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.750
 Photos can be downloaded for free 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.199
 Fulda also software with it as a partner camera 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
 I had fallen in love with my degrees 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.389
 Broadcom increased 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.389
 Formalities videos convenient pictures with 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.009
 there is still play now 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 So it's not even that way 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.119
 Of course, too, with the fear of the microscope 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.059
 experiment 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.769
 Meier can do that differently 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.769
 to adjust 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.709
 it will be more or less 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.669
 three-dimensional depending on 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:08.819
 the Beetle 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.819
 how the light comes in at an angle or directly 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.839
 so you can also do a lot 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.689
 achieve 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.029
 Zietsch peace obligation 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.519
 Do you pull these 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.949
 Spines something 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.949
 plastic 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.659
 I definitely think so 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.840
 somehow smarter than me I have to finish such a complex with Russ Viefhues 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.509
 COPD for less than 50 euros to buy is not better 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.029
 they also have a 2-megapixel camera 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:57.049
 for 30 euros to complete device with two megapixels costs about 200 euros 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.719
 if you're lucky not 250 anymore 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.169
 I want to go there 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.169
 to improvise a bit 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.999
 Binnewies works it could be synonymous times 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.749
 try out 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.120
 as I said 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.189
 By the way, you can also ride this bike here 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:22.189
 to adjust the focus 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.939
 that affects him 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.939
 image section 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.819
 supported 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.819
 ever before 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.520
 then I'm there Drill 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.240
 then it changes 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:44.749
 image section
