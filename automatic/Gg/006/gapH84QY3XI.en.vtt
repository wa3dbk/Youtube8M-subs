it's great it's like high rise tomorrow
for<00:00:22.859> two<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> bit<00:00:23.789> different<00:00:24.119> more<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
for two and a bit different more the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.349 
for two and a bit different more the
style<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.869> more<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.289> tree<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.920> good

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
style of more of a tree but it's good

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.630

plate<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.510> my<00:00:27.570> scar<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:29.130> don't<00:00:29.400> think

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
plate with my scar and I don't think

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.939 
plate with my scar and I don't think
it's<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> best<00:00:30.029> weapon<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.990> well<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.560> this

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
it's the best weapon to do well in this

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.440 
it's the best weapon to do well in this
map<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.880> doesn't<00:00:33.180> matter<00:00:33.210> because

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
map but now it doesn't matter because

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.110 
map but now it doesn't matter because
everybody<00:00:34.070> there<00:00:35.070> no<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.730> yet

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
everybody there no know what to do yet

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.780 
everybody there no know what to do yet
so<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> lot<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.739> guys<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.190> sniping

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so and not a lot of guys are sniping

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.610 
so and not a lot of guys are sniping
what<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> think<00:00:39.210> think<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> snipe<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
what I think think on a snipe in the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.049 
what I think think on a snipe in the
future<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.040> map<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.700> ruin<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
future in this map and that will ruin it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.180 
future in this map and that will ruin it
may<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.719> far<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.050> good<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.559> think

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
may be but so far it's good and I think

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.520 
may be but so far it's good and I think
you're<00:00:44.550> gonna<00:00:44.670> play<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> mp7<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:46.350> I'm

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
you're gonna play with the mp7 if I'm

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
you're gonna play with the mp7 if I'm
playing<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.950> map<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> future<00:00:47.940> will<00:00:48.090> be

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
playing this map in the future will be
