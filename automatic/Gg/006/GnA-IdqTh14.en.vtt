school well tennis is so important

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.119

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and that really piles up I have

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.340 
and that really piles up I have
accelerated<00:01:11.040> classes<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.140> we<00:01:13.140> go

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.179 
have they're all awesome because I'm a
good<00:01:53.610> kid<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.270> class<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.740> lot<00:01:55.950> better

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
good kid in class I like it a lot better

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.550 
good kid in class I like it a lot better
so<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.700> could<00:01:57.000> change<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.960> learning<00:01:58.290> style

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
so you could change the learning style

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.130 
so you could change the learning style
because<00:01:58.829> no<00:01:59.399> teacher<00:01:59.700> teaches<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> same<00:02:00.930> way

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
because no teacher teaches the same way

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.679 
because no teacher teaches the same way
yeah<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.979> having<00:02:02.340> more<00:02:02.640> tics<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
yeah I like having more tics because it

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.120 
yeah I like having more tics because it
gives<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.990> more<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.439> an<00:02:04.680> option<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.100> guess

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
gives you more of like an option I guess

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.340 
gives you more of like an option I guess
to<00:02:05.399> have<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.909> face

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
to have like a face

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.750 
to have like a face
a teacher<00:02:06.650> or<00:02:06.860> something<00:02:07.280> rather<00:02:07.520> than

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
a teacher or something rather than

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.730 
a teacher or something rather than
having<00:02:08.060> one<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> future<00:02:09.289> like<00:02:09.440> in<00:02:09.590> high

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
having one in the future like in high

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.230 
having one in the future like in high
school<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.130> college<00:02:10.190> you'll<00:02:10.759> have<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.150> many

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
school and college you'll have so many

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.030 
school and college you'll have so many
different<00:02:11.630> teachers<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.200> you'll<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.860> to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
adjust to their teaching styles I don't

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.970

more<00:04:38.409> people<00:04:38.650> it's<00:04:39.220> going<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.460> be<00:04:39.520> harder<00:04:40.050> but

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
more people it's going to be harder but

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.230
