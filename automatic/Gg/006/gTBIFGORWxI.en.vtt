00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.670
 in the incessant movement of the tail 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.609
 some are ready for speed 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.609
 others are calmer 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.609
 most are peculiar 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.409
 the dogs transmit a secret language with the tail 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.100
 decipher it would tell us a lot about the mind and emotional life of dogs 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.750
 upyd that's exactly what the university of bari in italy have done 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.670
 the experiment first they built a box 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 will install a camera on the normal ceiling 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.340
 They placed a dog in the box facing a hole through which they look 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
 they presented certain stimuli to the dog 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.250
 your owner 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 obvious reaction 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 A stranger 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.830
 and finally an unknown dog 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.480
 for our eyes it is difficult to understand 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.120
 but through mathematical analysis the scientists discovered something 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 surprising 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.130
 when a dog skirts positively 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 move the tail more to the right 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.280
 dog after dog 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 the angle to the right is greater when you see your owner 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.080
 when I go to the unknown dog tends more to the left 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.080
 as a sign of fear caution 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 It seems that dogs like us have cerebral asymmetry 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 in humans the right hemisphere control negative emotions 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.170
 that are evident on the left side of the face 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.709
 Cheerful emotions usually look better on the right side 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.499
 the same goes for the dog 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.499
 just with the tails 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.419
 the dog talks to the world with her 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.109
 while the world speaks to the dog in the face 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.109
 through the very advanced sensory receptors 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.339
 the ears of dogs are a standard surveillance system 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.969
 they are very mobile they want up to 180 degrees 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.299
 There are 20 muscles responsible for moving them 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.879
 helping at home will be sound source 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.879
 catching the waves and sending them to the brain 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.799
 the types of sounds that dogs perceive would leave us deaf 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.979
 frequencies 2 to 3 times higher than ours one dimension of sound 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
 that we miss 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.469
 to get to the highest note that a dog can go 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.319
 we should add 48 notes beyond 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.319
 and for humans the last 20 would be imperceptible 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.939
 but nothing like smell in terms of advanced senses 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.999
 sense hysÃ©n civility dogs have both dedicate 10 times more 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.999
 mental ability to smell that humans 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:44.059
 the good dogs separating the smells 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.059
 for us a stew of meat smells like a visa 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.269
 for a dog flies carrots meat onion and all the condiments 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.419
 Join each component separately 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.419
 by layers of honor 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.479
 and of all the hate lovers out there 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.479
 the hound is the one that takes the palm 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.849
 Ten times more sensitive than the average dog 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.399
 a thousand times more than people
