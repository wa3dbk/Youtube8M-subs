to<00:05:55.230> a<00:05:55.260> movie<00:05:55.530> that<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:55.740> my<00:05:55.890> opinion<00:05:56.040> isn't

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
to a movie that in my opinion isn't

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.550 
to a movie that in my opinion isn't
quite<00:05:57.240> as<00:05:57.390> good<00:05:57.510> as<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.780> first<00:05:57.900> one<00:05:58.050> but<00:05:58.500> I

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
quite as good as the first one but I

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.110 
quite as good as the first one but I
still<00:05:58.830> enjoy<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.310> film<00:05:59.460> quite<00:05:59.670> a<00:05:59.700> bit<00:05:59.910> there's

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
still enjoy the film quite a bit there's

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.430 
still enjoy the film quite a bit there's
times<00:06:00.390> when<00:06:00.540> I<00:06:00.600> watch<00:06:00.750> this<00:06:00.900> movie<00:06:01.230> where<00:06:01.380> you

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
times when I watch this movie where you

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.200 
times when I watch this movie where you
can<00:06:01.590> kind<00:06:01.860> of<00:06:01.980> see<00:06:02.280> different<00:06:02.850> opinions

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
can kind of see different opinions

can kind of see different opinions
clashing<00:06:03.720> which<00:06:04.140> is<00:06:04.290> obvious<00:06:04.650> because<00:06:04.860> the

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
clashing which is obvious because the

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
wanted to make it look as much like a

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.070 
wanted to make it look as much like a
comic<00:06:20.580> book<00:06:20.700> as<00:06:20.850> possible<00:06:21.390> and<00:06:21.510> since<00:06:21.660> comic

he<00:06:25.170> wanted<00:06:25.410> to<00:06:25.500> do<00:06:25.650> a<00:06:25.680> lot<00:06:25.920> of<00:06:25.980> that<00:06:26.250> without

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
he wanted to do a lot of that without

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.970 
he wanted to do a lot of that without
too<00:06:26.850> much<00:06:27.060> panning<00:06:27.600> without<00:06:27.840> too<00:06:27.990> much<00:06:28.140> movie

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
too much panning without too much movie

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.800 
too much panning without too much movie
shot<00:06:29.340> so<00:06:29.670> to<00:06:29.730> speak<00:06:30.030> that's<00:06:30.270> an<00:06:30.390> interesting

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
shot so to speak that's an interesting

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.870 
shot so to speak that's an interesting
idea<00:06:30.930> but<00:06:31.620> I<00:06:31.650> feel<00:06:31.950> like<00:06:32.100> maybe<00:06:32.370> he<00:06:32.520> could<00:06:32.820> have

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
idea but I feel like maybe he could have

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.130 
idea but I feel like maybe he could have
directed<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.360> with<00:06:33.479> some<00:06:33.630> more<00:06:33.750> Flair

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
directed it with some more Flair

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.530 
directed it with some more Flair
honestly<00:06:34.680> comic<00:06:35.160> book<00:06:35.310> movies<00:06:35.700> were<00:06:35.880> very<00:06:36.150> new

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
honestly comic book movies were very new

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.850 
honestly comic book movies were very new
that<00:06:36.660> time<00:06:36.930> Superman<00:06:37.440> in<00:06:37.500> the<00:06:37.530> movie<00:06:37.800> is

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
that time Superman in the movie is

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.590 
that time Superman in the movie is
really<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.190> first<00:06:38.430> one<00:06:38.610> to<00:06:38.760> do<00:06:38.910> it<00:06:39.060> really

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
really the first one to do it really

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.850 
really the first one to do it really
well<00:06:39.750> I<00:06:40.170> think<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.350> lot<00:06:40.470> of<00:06:40.560> people<00:06:40.740> were<00:06:40.800> still

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
well I think a lot of people were still

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.170 
well I think a lot of people were still
a<00:06:41.040> little<00:06:41.130> confused<00:06:41.580> about<00:06:41.700> how<00:06:41.940> they<00:06:42.060> could

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
a little confused about how they could

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.550 
a little confused about how they could
actually<00:06:42.210> make<00:06:42.630> one<00:06:42.780> of<00:06:42.870> these<00:06:42.960> movies<00:06:43.290> and<00:06:43.500> I

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
actually make one of these movies and I

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.750 
actually make one of these movies and I
think<00:06:43.770> it<00:06:43.860> would<00:06:43.980> have<00:06:44.040> been<00:06:44.100> a<00:06:44.220> better<00:06:44.490> film

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
think it would have been a better film

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.400 
think it would have been a better film
of<00:06:44.910> Richard<00:06:45.210> Donner<00:06:45.420> had<00:06:45.690> stayed<00:06:45.960> on<00:06:45.990> it<00:06:46.290> was

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
of Richard Donner had stayed on it was

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.320 
of Richard Donner had stayed on it was
allowed<00:06:46.620> to<00:06:46.650> do<00:06:46.890> his<00:06:47.100> full<00:06:47.370> ideas<00:06:47.850> which<00:06:48.150> by

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
allowed to do his full ideas which by

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.610 
allowed to do his full ideas which by
the<00:06:48.390> way<00:06:48.540> we<00:06:48.690> do<00:06:48.810> have<00:06:48.930> a<00:06:48.960> way<00:06:49.170> of<00:06:49.290> sort<00:06:49.530> of

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
the way we do have a way of sort of

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.470 
the way we do have a way of sort of
seeing<00:06:49.680> his<00:06:50.070> idea<00:06:50.400> and<00:06:50.580> the<00:06:50.940> Richard<00:06:51.270> Donner

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
seeing his idea and the Richard Donner

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.600 
seeing his idea and the Richard Donner
cut<00:06:51.660> of<00:06:52.020> Superman<00:06:52.440> -<00:06:52.650> which<00:06:52.890> in<00:06:53.040> my<00:06:53.160> opinion<00:06:53.280> is

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
cut of Superman - which in my opinion is

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.130 
cut of Superman - which in my opinion is
much<00:06:53.790> better<00:06:54.000> than<00:06:54.330> the<00:06:54.480> theatrical<00:06:54.960> cut

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140 
much better than the theatrical cut

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.930 
much better than the theatrical cut
Christopher<00:06:55.650> Reeve<00:06:55.830> is<00:06:55.860> still<00:06:56.160> fantastic<00:06:56.550> as

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
Christopher Reeve is still fantastic as

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.490 
Christopher Reeve is still fantastic as
Superman<00:06:57.450> here<00:06:57.720> and<00:06:57.840> one<00:06:57.960> of<00:06:58.050> the<00:06:58.110> best<00:06:58.260> parts

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
Superman here and one of the best parts

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.750 
Superman here and one of the best parts
of<00:06:58.620> his<00:06:58.770> character<00:06:59.100> in<00:06:59.220> this<00:06:59.310> movie<00:06:59.490> is<00:06:59.730> that

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
of his character in this movie is that

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.030 
of his character in this movie is that
conflict<00:07:00.510> between<00:07:00.870> wanting<00:07:01.290> to<00:07:01.410> be<00:07:01.500> human<00:07:01.860> and

conflict between wanting to be human and

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
really good job of portraying that

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.140 
really good job of portraying that
character<00:07:15.960> as<00:07:16.590> he<00:07:17.130> is<00:07:17.250> in<00:07:17.370> the<00:07:17.400> comics<00:07:17.640> but

also giving him a fun villain to fight

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.460 
also giving him a fun villain to fight
rather<00:07:20.040> than<00:07:20.310> some<00:07:20.640> wealthy<00:07:21.390> landowner<00:07:22.080> the

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
rather than some wealthy landowner the

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.080 
rather than some wealthy landowner the
movie<00:07:22.740> still<00:07:22.920> has<00:07:23.100> some<00:07:23.340> of<00:07:23.430> the<00:07:23.520> same<00:07:23.670> issues

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
movie still has some of the same issues

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.060 
movie still has some of the same issues
the<00:07:24.120> first<00:07:24.510> one<00:07:24.720> has<00:07:24.900> nowadays<00:07:25.170> which<00:07:25.770> really

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070 
the first one has nowadays which really

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.860 
the first one has nowadays which really
isn't<00:07:26.340> entirely<00:07:26.910> its<00:07:27.210> fault<00:07:27.480> and<00:07:27.630> that<00:07:27.660> is

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
isn't entirely its fault and that is

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.270 
isn't entirely its fault and that is
that<00:07:28.050> the<00:07:28.170> special<00:07:28.560> effects<00:07:28.800> appear<00:07:29.130> a<00:07:29.160> little

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
that the special effects appear a little

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.980 
that the special effects appear a little
bit<00:07:29.400> dated<00:07:29.850> some<00:07:30.330> of<00:07:30.420> the<00:07:30.510> humor<00:07:30.810> is<00:07:30.870> a<00:07:30.930> little

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
bit dated some of the humor is a little

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.540 
bit dated some of the humor is a little
dated<00:07:31.380> and<00:07:31.710> that's<00:07:32.040> just<00:07:32.220> going<00:07:32.310> to<00:07:32.370> happen

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:32.550 
dated and that's just going to happen

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.310 
dated and that's just going to happen
but<00:07:32.880> overall<00:07:33.210> I<00:07:33.240> do<00:07:33.390> feel<00:07:33.780> that<00:07:33.960> that<00:07:34.050> first

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
but overall I do feel that that first

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.720 
but overall I do feel that that first
film<00:07:34.590> is<00:07:34.740> slightly<00:07:35.010> better<00:07:35.250> than<00:07:35.340> this<00:07:35.550> one

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:35.730 
film is slightly better than this one

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.550 
film is slightly better than this one
because<00:07:35.910> that<00:07:36.090> origin<00:07:36.600> story<00:07:36.900> was<00:07:37.110> told<00:07:37.320> with

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
because that origin story was told with

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.140 
because that origin story was told with
so<00:07:37.710> much<00:07:37.860> care<00:07:38.160> and<00:07:38.430> because<00:07:38.700> it<00:07:38.790> was<00:07:38.850> great<00:07:39.000> to

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.150 
so much care and because it was great to

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.060 
so much care and because it was great to
have<00:07:39.240> John<00:07:39.510> Williams<00:07:39.870> actually<00:07:40.170> composing

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070 
have John Williams actually composing

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.560 
have John Williams actually composing
the<00:07:41.250> music<00:07:41.280> because<00:07:41.940> he<00:07:42.090> didn't<00:07:42.330> actually

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.570 
the music because he didn't actually

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.300 
the music because he didn't actually
compose<00:07:43.140> the<00:07:43.290> music<00:07:43.320> for<00:07:43.620> Superman<00:07:44.100> to

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310 
compose the music for Superman to

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.610 
compose the music for Superman to
someone<00:07:45.060> else<00:07:45.240> imitated<00:07:45.750> his<00:07:45.870> themes<00:07:46.110> all<00:07:46.410> in
