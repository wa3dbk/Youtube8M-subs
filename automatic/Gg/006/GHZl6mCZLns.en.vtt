00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.980
 earthy today we speak theories 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.910
 facts of the game five nights at freddy's 1 and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.779
 2 parts 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.789
 let's start I guess with the fact that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 many homes that brazier boy because 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.590
 what does the phone-guy say about him like he 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.560
 the third night they tried to remake 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.480
 foxy you probably know this but they 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 thought that the first one was too scary and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 did not recycle it did 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 new to be more like for 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.930
 baby and put him in kid cole 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.520
 entertain babies you know but kids in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.739
 these days just can't hold onto 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.840
 the place the staff had to put foxy 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.059
 again and again after each shift 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.340
 so in the end they stopped 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.510
 do it and left him now he 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.030
 just a set of parts 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.340
 I think that the staff called him Mangle 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 this is what the phone-guy tells us 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.129
 most likely he meant that mangle is 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.450
 new foxy replacement only feminine 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.979
 also mango is present in ladies night 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.080
 many have long been tormented by the question where 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.590
 go away beak learn when she leaves with 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.710
 scenes 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.750
 scott kauton game developer though where 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.210
 learn animation on cameras where she sort of 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.400
 how was supposed to shoot your beak but 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.189
 scott flew off the animation and he left 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.829
 a check without a beak and we would be so scared 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.659
 remember dizer on scott's website a couple of people 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.689
 were able to notice the violet killer 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.090
 change the game for the box if lighten 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.040
 photo there is something similar but 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.570
 maybe there is no violet there 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 dude 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.110
 another case, I will come back to this 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.270
 theories in mini-games there are only two 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.570
 the purple man is one of them 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.759
 phone-guy 2 killer children the most 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.549
 interesting that they are both purple 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.759
 it means they are somehow connected or is it 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.320
 the same person is most likely 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.899
 confirms once again that this purple 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.649
 man and there is a phone-guy that is 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.789
 phone-guy 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.789
 and there is a killer of children 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.799
 and now let's fast forward to the first 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.670
 part many wondered why 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.590
 Camera where the kitchen is located does not work 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.879
 it was rumored that on the seventh night if 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.069
 there to see three hours 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.860
 then you will see Bonnie take off his 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.569
 mask but it's not true to me something 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.090
 tells you exactly what is in the kitchen 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.580
 is the golden freddy its not on 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.590
 other cameras though if he is hallucinating 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.019
 then he can be detected directly from 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.670
 from nowhere especially in the second part of the game 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.510
 phone-guy says what's up 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.640
 golden freddy 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.670
 completely gone well, and finally, I want 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.390
 show you a pair of headphones namely 3 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.810
 we all remember ready them and pimen and here on 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.890
 change them came new fakie now you 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.230
 see the penguin and yes even 1 is the first 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.489
 picture with him but there is also 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.980
 the second here it is unlike the small 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.560
 penguin came to us more new cats 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.579
 That's how they look and maybe this one 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.169
 the same code again I repeat this fake 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.510
 well thank you all for watching 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.040
