00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
achieve the bordered nails the first way

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.800

is<00:00:40.130> by<00:00:40.160> painting<00:00:40.730> your<00:00:40.910> nails<00:00:41.120> two<00:00:41.510> thin<00:00:41.780> coats

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.170 

next<00:00:51.590> use<00:00:51.770> a<00:00:51.800> black<00:00:52.130> striper<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:52.670> outline<00:00:53.150> your

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
next use a black striper to outline your

nails<00:00:54.070> being<00:00:55.070> able<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.430> do<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.850> takes<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.330> bit

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
nails being able to do this takes a bit

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.570 
nails being able to do this takes a bit
of<00:00:56.480> practice<00:00:57.040> especially<00:00:58.040> if<00:00:58.220> you're<00:00:58.400> using

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
of practice especially if you're using

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:13.570 
of practice especially if you're using
your<00:00:58.790> non-dominant<00:00:59.060> hand

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.790 

an<00:01:13.670> easier<00:01:14.570> method<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.140> by<00:01:15.320> painting<00:01:15.770> your

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
nails black first and then painting two

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.700 
nails black first and then painting two
coats<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.890> pink<00:01:19.190> over<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.700> black<00:01:20.710> when

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
painting the pink leave a black border

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.620 

then<00:01:35.500> use<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:35.830> black<00:01:36.160> polish<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.970> add<00:01:37.000> outline

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
then use a black polish to add outline

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.890 
then use a black polish to add outline
to<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:37.930> tip<00:01:38.820> slowly<00:01:39.820> rotating<00:01:40.420> your<00:01:40.570> finger

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
allows this process to become even

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.640 
allows this process to become even
easier<00:01:43.110> especially<00:01:44.110> when<00:01:44.230> using<00:01:44.410> your

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650
