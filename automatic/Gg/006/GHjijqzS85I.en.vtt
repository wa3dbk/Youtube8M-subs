shuffle has a different type of

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.949 
shuffle has a different type of
connector<00:02:35.980> but<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.430> common<00:02:36.910> iPod<00:02:37.480> sync

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
connector but this is a common iPod sync

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.199 
connector but this is a common iPod sync
cable<00:02:38.079> connected<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.459> that's<00:02:39.639> kind<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:39.940> good

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
cable connected so that's kind of good

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.879 
cable connected so that's kind of good
that<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:40.480> has<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.840> because<00:02:41.139> it's<00:02:41.290> universal

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
that it has that because it's universal

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.009 
that it has that because it's universal
those<00:02:42.010> work<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.340> most<00:02:43.030> other<00:02:43.239> iPod<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:43.810> it'll
