00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
for 299 but as far as I know the price

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.700 
for 299 but as far as I know the price
may<00:00:11.969> be<00:00:12.030> 99<00:00:12.570> cents<00:00:12.929> by<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> time<00:00:13.349> this<00:00:13.469> video

may be 99 cents by the time this video
is<00:00:13.830> done<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.730> I'm<00:00:14.820> not<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.000> sure<00:00:15.210> three

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
is done so I'm not really sure three

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.140 
is done so I'm not really sure three
dollars<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.500> bit<00:00:16.650> pricey<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.970> use

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
dollars is a bit pricey but if you use

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.269 
dollars is a bit pricey but if you use
it<00:00:18.300> enough<00:00:18.510> i<00:00:18.840> guess<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.619> could<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.890> worth<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
it enough i guess it could be worth it

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.560

know<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.710> an<00:00:29.519> app<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.900> uses

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
know what it is is it's an app that uses

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.130 
know what it is is it's an app that uses
the<00:00:31.230> push<00:00:31.470> service<00:00:32.149> to<00:00:33.149> basically<00:00:33.270> update<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
on several different services i guess

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.299

to for instance at least half different

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090
