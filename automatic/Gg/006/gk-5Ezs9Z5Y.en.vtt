let's connect the first
I'll<00:02:23.030> wire<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.720> card<00:02:24.280> please<00:02:25.280> note<00:02:25.640> that

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
I'll wire to the card please note that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.000 
I'll wire to the card please note that
signal<00:02:26.810> pin<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.350> left

then<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.030> will<00:02:29.360> power<00:02:29.600> up<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.110> ESC<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:30.980> wait

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
then I will power up the ESC and wait

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.240 
then I will power up the ESC and wait
for<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.520> card<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.970> light<00:02:32.180> up

like I did for the first ESC it is

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.110 
like I did for the first ESC it is
important<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.830> set<00:02:48.130> exactly<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.850> same
