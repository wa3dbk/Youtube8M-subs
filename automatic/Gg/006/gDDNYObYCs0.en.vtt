through<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> build<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.890> well<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
through the build because well it's a

and I've got it maybe four and a half
five<00:01:37.770> inches<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.340> guess<00:01:38.520> off<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.060> top<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
five inches I guess off the top of the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.160 
five inches I guess off the top of the
glass<00:01:40.970> but<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> looks<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
glass but then that's what it looks like

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.450 
glass but then that's what it looks like
okay<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> what<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> look

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

okay so what I can do and if you look
over<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:48.000> I've<00:01:48.659> got<00:01:48.979> this<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> co2<00:01:50.430> reactor

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
over here I've got this is a co2 reactor

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.100 
over here I've got this is a co2 reactor
it's<00:01:51.210> unplugged<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:53.130> I've<00:01:53.220> got<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.610> up

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
it's unplugged but I've got it going up

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's unplugged but I've got it going up
the<00:01:55.110> front<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> tank<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.520> look

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the front of the tank and if you look

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.469 
the front of the tank and if you look
back<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:57.210> there's<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> gap

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
back here there's a gap

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.410 
back here there's a gap
that's<00:02:00.229> got<00:02:00.469> some<00:02:00.619> trim<00:02:01.009> on<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:02.210> gap

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
that's got some trim on it that gap

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.469 
that's got some trim on it that gap
allows<00:02:02.780> me<00:02:03.079> to<00:02:03.200> do<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.560> because<00:02:04.390> when<00:02:05.390> I

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
allows me to do that because when I

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.279 
allows me to do that because when I
close<00:02:05.719> it<00:02:06.340> boom<00:02:07.369> look<00:02:08.000> at<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.239> it's<00:02:09.019> right<00:02:09.170> up

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
close it boom look at that it's right up

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.199 
close it boom look at that it's right up
in<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.399> if<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.640> ever<00:02:10.789> need<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:10.970> run

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
in that so if I ever need to run

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.600 
in that so if I ever need to run
anything<00:02:11.480> or<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.890> know<00:02:12.980> one<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.129> my<00:02:13.220> homemade

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
anything or you know one of my homemade

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.690 
anything or you know one of my homemade
filters<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.690> can<00:02:14.930> do<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.230> without<00:02:15.580> keeping<00:02:16.580> it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
filters I can do it without keeping it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.830 
filters I can do it without keeping it
lit<00:02:17.060> up<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.870> there<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.730> closed<00:02:19.730> now<00:02:20.599> let<00:02:20.780> me

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
lit up so there it is closed now let me

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.160 
lit up so there it is closed now let me
reach<00:02:21.050> under<00:02:21.319> here<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:23.000> turn<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.360> on<00:02:29.170> there

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
reach under here and turn it on there

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.729 
reach under here and turn it on there
good<00:02:31.299> that's<00:02:32.299> turned<00:02:32.630> on<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:34.790> see

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
good that's turned on so as you can see

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.800 
good that's turned on so as you can see
that's<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.950> little<00:02:37.099> bit<00:02:37.280> more<00:02:37.670> light<00:02:37.940> than<00:02:38.360> here

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
that's a little bit more light than here

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.380 
that's a little bit more light than here
and<00:02:38.989> on<00:02:39.980> each<00:02:40.340> end<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.940> see<00:02:41.090> how<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.329> a

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
and on each end you see how it's a

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.559 
and on each end you see how it's a
little<00:02:41.690> bit<00:02:41.810> darker<00:02:42.790> that's<00:02:43.790> what<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.090> CFLs

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
little bit darker that's what the CFLs

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.160 
little bit darker that's what the CFLs
do<00:02:45.040> put<00:02:46.040> them<00:02:46.130> there<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.959> you're<00:02:47.959> in<00:02:48.049> good

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
do put them there and you're in good

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.150 
do put them there and you're in good
shape<00:02:48.410> now<00:02:48.849> one<00:02:49.849> thing<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:51.880> would<00:02:52.880> suggest<00:02:53.150> is

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
shape now one thing I I would suggest is

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.690 
shape now one thing I I would suggest is
forgo<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.540> 4-foot<00:02:56.540> chopped<00:02:57.290> light<00:02:57.700> because

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
forgo the 4-foot chopped light because

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.009 
forgo the 4-foot chopped light because
those<00:02:58.970> CFLs<00:02:59.510> put<00:02:59.870> off<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.500> much<00:03:00.739> light<00:03:01.069> you

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
those CFLs put off so much light you

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.830 
those CFLs put off so much light you
could<00:03:03.019> probably<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.180> same<00:03:05.450> amount<00:03:05.780> of

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
could probably get the same amount of

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.849 
could probably get the same amount of
light<00:03:06.019> if<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:07.280> have<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:08.810> CFLs<00:03:09.290> here<00:03:10.359> two<00:03:11.359> here

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
light if you have to CFLs here two here

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.240 
light if you have to CFLs here two here
and<00:03:12.859> two<00:03:13.310> here<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:14.030> two<00:03:14.090> on<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.019> end<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:16.040> ones

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
and two here and two on the end the ones

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.110 
and two here and two on the end the ones
on<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.549> end<00:03:16.579> facing<00:03:17.569> out<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.819> basically<00:03:19.819> the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
on the end facing out and basically the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.830 
on the end facing out and basically the
the<00:03:20.450> four<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:21.470> field<00:03:21.880> facing<00:03:22.880> down<00:03:23.120> now<00:03:23.600> if

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the four in the field facing down now if

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.890 
the four in the field facing down now if
you<00:03:23.989> did<00:03:24.260> face<00:03:24.560> them<00:03:24.769> out<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:26.329> would<00:03:26.510> probably

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
you did face them out you would probably

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.660 
you did face them out you would probably
get<00:03:26.989> more<00:03:27.230> light<00:03:27.470> only<00:03:27.799> because<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.639> way

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
get more light only because of the way

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.910 
get more light only because of the way
they're<00:03:29.030> they're<00:03:29.389> aligned<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:30.290> know<00:03:30.380> this

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
they're they're aligned you know this

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.780 
they're they're aligned you know this
way<00:03:31.160> or<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.459> way<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:33.370> that's<00:03:34.370> another<00:03:34.609> reason

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
way or that way so that's another reason

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.080 
way or that way so that's another reason
why<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.030> haven't<00:03:35.389> really<00:03:36.609> done<00:03:37.609> this<00:03:37.730> one<00:03:37.940> yet

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
why I haven't really done this one yet

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.099 
why I haven't really done this one yet
because<00:03:38.389> I<00:03:38.420> might<00:03:38.870> go<00:03:39.170> with<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.620> all<00:03:39.829> CFLs

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
because I might go with just all CFLs

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.190 
because I might go with just all CFLs
but<00:03:42.109> anyway<00:03:42.470> there<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:43.989> as<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.109> can

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
but anyway there it is and as you can

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.099 
but anyway there it is and as you can
see<00:03:45.290> with<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.680> CFL<00:03:46.130> there's<00:03:46.430> no<00:03:46.930> dead<00:03:47.930> spots

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
see with the CFL there's no dead spots

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.900 
see with the CFL there's no dead spots
on<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.739> end<00:03:48.920> like<00:03:49.519> like<00:03:49.790> there<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.090> a

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
on the end like like there is a

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.230 
on the end like like there is a
so<00:03:51.910> I'm<00:03:52.090> gonna<00:03:52.210> probably<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:54.610> know<00:03:54.700> finish

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
so I'm gonna probably you know finish

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.050 
so I'm gonna probably you know finish
this<00:03:55.360> off<00:03:55.890> sand<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.010> down<00:03:57.040> fill<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.700> holes<00:03:57.910> of

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
this off sand it down fill the holes of

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.850 
this off sand it down fill the holes of
course<00:03:58.300> send<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.570> down<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.020> then<00:03:59.560> probably

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
course send it down and then probably

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.070 
course send it down and then probably
just<00:04:00.370> paint<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:00.700> black<00:04:00.970> like<00:04:01.270> like<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.720> tanks

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
just paint it black like like the tanks

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.010 
just paint it black like like the tanks
and<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:03.100> just<00:04:03.490> got<00:04:03.640> done<00:04:03.850> cleaning<00:04:04.750> my<00:04:04.900> canister
