and<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.710> can<00:01:51.820> increase<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.119> decrease<00:01:53.180> that

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
and you can increase and decrease that

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.560 
and you can increase and decrease that
as<00:01:54.649> you're<00:01:55.310> moving<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.969> you've<00:01:56.149> got<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.359> same

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
as you're moving and you've got the same

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.690 
as you're moving and you've got the same
full<00:01:57.380> range<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.740> speed<00:01:57.979> in<00:01:58.130> forward<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
full range of speed in forward and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.550 
full range of speed in forward and
reverse<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.719> you<00:01:59.810> can<00:01:59.960> really<00:02:00.170> get<00:02:00.289> around<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
reverse so you can really get around the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.819 
reverse so you can really get around the
garden<00:02:00.829> quickly<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:02.210> we've<00:02:03.049> got<00:02:03.200> five

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
garden quickly and we've got five

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.849 
garden quickly and we've got five
different<00:02:04.159> heights<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.299> cut<00:02:05.509> on<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.960> deck<00:02:06.170> so

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
different heights of cut on the deck so

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.529 
different heights of cut on the deck so
this<00:02:07.310> raises<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.820> lowers<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.179> deck<00:02:08.330> there

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
this raises and lowers the deck there

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.590 
this raises and lowers the deck there
and<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.800> also<00:02:09.950> notice<00:02:10.460> this<00:02:10.610> very<00:02:10.820> large<00:02:11.120> tube

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
and you also notice this very large tube

it's<00:02:18.950> very<00:02:19.190> very<00:02:19.460> small<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:20.120> mean<00:02:20.600> they<00:02:20.750> tend<00:02:20.960> to

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
it's very very small I mean they tend to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.500 
it's very very small I mean they tend to
