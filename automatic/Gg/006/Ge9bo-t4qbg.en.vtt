00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.060
 Everyone in every corner of the country has 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.250
 a figure who kissed one of the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.980
 major intellectuals of that country 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.770
 best theater director is best friend

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.719
 Every day I see you, you're very 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.680
 Dear Datenão, nice and you do not 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.210
 Stay behind 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480
 I'll say something to you what the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.700
 is successful on Brazilian television and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.370
 also the cup success now that cqc 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.980
 set the tone, it was more or less 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.090
 kind of humor before cqc which is a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.140
 great show 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.059
 for me the best television show 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.859
 It's not because I'm Brazilian. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.239
 It's not no, it's not because I was already 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.460
 I have said this several times in using me 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.680
 not pulling instead I always 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.350
 I found this led by marcelo passion 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.020
 a cell raised a journalism 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 different from doing it already put in 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.340
 your different area make the globe of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 television long ago and the cqc 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 it was simply the fit of what 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.939
 marcelo did with some news is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
 of course but it is a wonderful program and 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.729
 It will be better on there thing today 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.979
 Hot earth're smoking the thing has 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.960
 a very sad coincidence that goes 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.000
 to happen tonight you were 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.509
 talking about something tragic that people 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 I was seeing on screen and cqc the main one 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.140
 today's cqc is a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.229
 People went to Japan to see what happened. 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.270
 one year after the tsunami and we 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.840
 region of rio de janeiro see the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.810
 happened two years later guess what? 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.509
 only what we have to show 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.880
 But that's when that's what we're talking about. 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.579
 there is a hurricane in the United States and I saw 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.080
 Another day everything is working here. 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.690
 happened the first tragedy in the river of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.750
 January was mobilized defense forces 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.580
 civil rights 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.070
 It was a fireman donation of hell 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.650
 Brazil, which was partly diverted from the 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.540
 donation here in são paulo they understood it is 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.100
 de itu and you're still seeing people 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.930
 dying in rio de janeiro 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.790
 in fact our reporter set up in the river 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.250
 January or continue who we are 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.080
 reporter we were talking to fernanda running 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.670
 The event was mentioned there because the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.250
 Marcelo remembers very well. 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.720
 is everyone knows that Japan is a country 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.090
 who survived disasters that will 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.790
 natural as of World War II 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.570
 is because of the tenacity of the players still 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.700
 have we asked for a Japanese 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.980
 it took too long for the authorities 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.000
 take action for society if 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.610
 organize 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.270
 the Japanese speak, it takes a while to talk 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.780
 How long has the guy been talking three weeks? 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.500
