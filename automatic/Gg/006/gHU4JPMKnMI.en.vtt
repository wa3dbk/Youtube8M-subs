00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.100 

it's<00:01:07.980> great<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.340> use<00:01:08.580> polishes<00:01:09.480> that<00:01:09.510> drive

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's great to use polishes that drive

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
it's great to use polishes that drive
fast<00:01:10.440> for<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.160> technique<00:01:11.550> that<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:12.300> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
fast for this technique that way you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.800 
fast for this technique that way you
don't<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.750> wait<00:01:13.020> too<00:01:13.200> long<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.479> touch

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
don't have to wait too long so I touch

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.760 
don't have to wait too long so I touch
it<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.979> ready<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.210> almost<00:01:18.510> is<00:01:18.900> just

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it see if it's ready it almost is just

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.609 
it see if it's ready it almost is just
going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> wait<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:21.119> bit<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.110> few

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
going to wait a little bit more a few

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.030 
going to wait a little bit more a few
seconds<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:24.110> but<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.229> design<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.680> very

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
seconds more but this design is very

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.790 
seconds more but this design is very
very<00:01:26.760> beautiful<00:01:27.090> isn't<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:30.440> ok<00:01:31.440> now<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:31.740> going

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
very beautiful isn't it ok now I'm going

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.120 
very beautiful isn't it ok now I'm going
to<00:01:31.950> try<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.310> what<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:36.619> hope<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.950> get

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
to try it on what see I hope I can get

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.050 
to try it on what see I hope I can get
the<00:01:38.430> littering<00:01:38.850> completely<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.720> nail<00:01:41.060> ok

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the littering completely on my nail ok

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
the littering completely on my nail ok
then<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.600> apply<00:01:42.930> pressure<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:46.009> we<00:01:47.009> start

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
then we apply pressure and we start

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.359 
then we apply pressure and we start
rolling<00:01:47.670> off<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:50.160> there<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.550> go<00:01:52.100> push<00:01:53.100> down

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
rolling off and there we go push down

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.130 
rolling off and there we go push down
anything<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.210> lifted<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:56.990> think<00:01:57.990> we're

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
anything that is lifted I think we're

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.350 
anything that is lifted I think we're
missing<00:01:58.380> something<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.820> i<00:02:00.030> am

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
missing something here right so i am

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389 
missing something here right so i am
going<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.720> add<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.380> lipstick<00:02:01.860> look<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.190> still

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399

going to add a lipstick look I still
have<00:02:02.550> a<00:02:02.580> lipstick<00:02:03.060> left<00:02:03.539> on<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.930> Stamper<00:02:04.350> so

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
have a lipstick left on my Stamper so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.670 
have a lipstick left on my Stamper so
I'm<00:02:05.160> going<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.430> try<00:02:05.580> my<00:02:06.030> best<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.200> whether

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
I'm going to try my best to see whether

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.080 
I'm going to try my best to see whether
or<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:09.590> put<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.760> apply

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
or not I can put that on so I apply

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.880 
or not I can put that on so I apply
pressure<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.910> can<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.840> filled<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
pressure and I can so I filled in that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.550 
pressure and I can so I filled in that
space<00:02:17.340> I'm<00:02:17.690> just<00:02:18.690> going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> clean<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.380> around

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
space I'm just going to clean up around

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.300 
space I'm just going to clean up around
the<00:02:19.769> edges<00:02:21.230> very<00:02:22.230> important<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.040> step

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the edges very important to do this step

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.220 
the edges very important to do this step
if<00:02:24.110> not<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.500> still<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:25.980> something<00:02:26.250> left

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
when you apply a topcoat it can fall

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.490 
when you apply a topcoat it can fall
over<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.350> ruin<00:02:31.980> your<00:02:32.160> whole<00:02:32.340> design<00:02:32.790> ok<00:02:33.500> come
