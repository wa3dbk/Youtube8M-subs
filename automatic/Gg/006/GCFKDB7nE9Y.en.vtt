00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
portraits we're going to start off with

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.480 
portraits we're going to start off with
blemishes<00:00:09.769> most<00:00:10.769> people<00:00:11.070> when<00:00:11.160> they<00:00:11.190> take

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
blemishes most people when they take

portraits<00:00:11.820> they<00:00:12.210> do<00:00:12.269> try<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.660> do<00:00:12.990> them<00:00:13.139> rack<00:00:13.349> up

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
portraits they do try to do them rack up

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.749 
portraits they do try to do them rack up
but<00:00:13.650> they'd<00:00:13.769> always<00:00:13.950> don't<00:00:14.250> get<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.549> perfect

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
but they'd always don't get it perfect

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.400 
but they'd always don't get it perfect
so<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.540> want<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.780> work<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.080> some<00:00:16.320> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
so you just want to work on some of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.200 
so you just want to work on some of
those<00:00:16.470> blemishes<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.640> make<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.000> little

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
those blemishes to make it a little

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.500 
those blemishes to make it a little
smoother<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:20.130> we're<00:00:20.279> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:21.000> start

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
smoother what we're going to do is start

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.750 
smoother what we're going to do is start
off<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:22.170> duplicating<00:00:23.070> your<00:00:23.100> background<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
off with duplicating your background I

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.790 
off with duplicating your background I
never<00:00:23.970> work<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> background<00:00:24.689> layer<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.769> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
never work on the background layer so I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.080 
never work on the background layer so I
make<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> copy<00:00:26.939> by<00:00:27.180> hitting<00:00:27.480> ctrl<00:00:27.930> J<00:00:28.939> next<00:00:29.939> we're

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
make a copy by hitting ctrl J next we're

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.060 
make a copy by hitting ctrl J next we're
going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.359> go<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.779> select<00:00:31.109> our<00:00:31.260> clone<00:00:31.650> tool

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
going to go up to select our clone tool

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.280 
going to go up to select our clone tool
and<00:00:32.669> you're<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> go<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.079> change

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and you're going to go up and change

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.150 
and you're going to go up and change
your<00:00:34.440> mode<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.010> light<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:36.680> once<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.829> select

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
your mode to light it once you select

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.950 
your mode to light it once you select
light<00:00:38.430> make<00:00:38.700> sure<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.030> pasty<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.570> set<00:00:39.780> around

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
light make sure your pasty is set around

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.670 
light make sure your pasty is set around
ten<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> twenty<00:00:40.950> percent<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.870> usually<00:00:42.870> zoom<00:00:43.469> in

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
ten to twenty percent I usually zoom in

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
ten to twenty percent I usually zoom in
so<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> better<00:00:44.520> idea<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.420> see

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
so I get a better idea so I can see

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.410 
so I get a better idea so I can see
exactly<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.410> areas<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.010> want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> work<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:48.000> and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
so just go through work around the face

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.749 
so just go through work around the face
until<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> desired<00:01:37.650> effect<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you want now I like to use blending

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.010 
you want now I like to use blending
modes<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> said<00:01:42.450> blending<00:01:42.869> mode

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
modes because like I said blending mode

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.950 
modes because like I said blending mode
is<00:01:43.229> only<00:01:43.649> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> change<00:01:44.520> those<00:01:44.960> darker

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
is only going to change those darker

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
is only going to change those darker
pixels<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> make<00:01:46.860> them<00:01:47.040> lighter<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
pixels to make them lighter to the

to show its roundness if you don't have
that<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:01.350> object<00:05:01.740> will<00:05:01.860> look<00:05:02.070> flat<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:02.850> you

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
that the object will look flat so you

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.370 
that the object will look flat so you
want<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.300> keep<00:05:03.480> some<00:05:03.720> of<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:03.960> but<00:05:04.170> sometimes

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
want to keep some of that but sometimes

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.310 
want to keep some of that but sometimes
tone<00:05:04.980> it<00:05:05.190> down<00:05:05.220> so<00:05:06.210> we<00:05:06.390> turned<00:05:06.570> out<00:05:06.810> down<00:05:07.110> the

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
bit this works sometimes good if you

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.810
