00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 away from home and comfort 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.710
 students face the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.450
 live three years in boarding school and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.360
 need to learn to deal with emotions 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.460
 which are already in full bloom because of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.770
 adolescence is a very good experience 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.160
 I love however the best part of the school 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.699
 with friendships everything is one for a longer time 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.350
 away from family is one by one if you have not 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.070
 a very good feeling here with your 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.990
 friends 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.400
 was very complicated in the beginning. 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.590
 issue of adapting 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 the dependence of parents on everything 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.640
 you have to be very responsible in 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.829
 at the right time take a shower if 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 feed nobody will come here to tell you 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 It 's time to do such a thing, but 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.090
 I think that gives you an independence 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.520
 quite strong is a little difficult you 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.610
 call so daily for home but 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.890
 then the consumption is very cool 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.199
 boarding is legal type people living 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.539
 of videogame the week my mother even came 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.460
 but then when she left on Wednesday 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.289
 Fair says no I do not want more than anything 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 well I'll be alone here I'll 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.700
 I feel calmer this year as it is 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.939
 more pressure is more matters the people 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.100
 has 28 subjects and it seems that the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.720
 was stronger in the hyacinth school but 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.400
 so I really miss my 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 Mother home like this. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.150
 This is what hurts the most is staying 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.890
 away from the family 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.960
 of the institute's students 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.360
 state education morning star 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 arrive here through the indication of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.619
 friends or relatives who already had the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.650
 opportunity to live in boarding school 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.780
 with people from different cities and 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.329
 think differently 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.930
 I hesitated to suggest that others do the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.759
 same 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.950
 sometimes he has an opinion because 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.259
 that person do not accept this thing of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.060
 have different opinions 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.130
 also change each one has to be 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.990
 respect in here because we are 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.030
 living in a whole even if you have these 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.189
 departments as the first year has the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.829
 We hear everything that another speech 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.040
 so understandings opinions are never 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.500
 the same beats very wise discussions 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.810
 but in the end it always manages to 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.880
 understand why you do not have to get used to it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.670
 and even good because I learned to live 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.400
 with other people and see others 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.740
 side of the stories and maybe even change a 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.450
 little how are we because 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.480
 each one lasts being a lot and in here 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.270
 we have a union a strengthening 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.440
 we become a different being 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.850
 I grew up very much as a person both anne 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.060
 responsibility knowledge question 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.980
 also because each teacher has the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.660
 its characteristic that brings something 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.190
 very good so add a lot in my 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.080
 Knowledge I think I'm leaving here. 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.600
 a person completely different from 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.430
 I entered those looking for iam 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.310
 in search of a dream 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.760
 TainÃ¡ wants to be a math teacher. 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.870
 I think it's a very very profession. 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.940
 inspirational 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.000
 for me it's a profession that demands a lot 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.290
 So it's not because I do not 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.760
 I'll be a teacher, I'll stop. 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.750
 to study not I think the teacher has 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.350
 What are you studying at all times? 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.050
 initial and want to study the routine a lot 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.700
 starts with 76 with the five classes on the turn 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.780
 morning and afternoon five classes 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.300
 discipline responsibility are 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.250
 requirements for any inmate is me 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.170
 I think it will be well pulled in the difficult 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.060
 but is everything has the schedules for which 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.010
 understand what it can not give that is 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.020
 that little escape for a second 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.030
 do not always have to be on time 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.640
 This is good because when we leave 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.640
 nor will those second 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.770
 Let's say let's say in a whole by these 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.960
 rules that have to follow these things 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.000
 of the congress because in life there are 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.040
 rules and things that are in 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.830
 fifth not toluca 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.670
 after class extra activity time 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.190
 class 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.040
 music is a constant companion 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.030
 especially the challenges 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.030
 growth and farewells 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.060
 just that tightness in the heart because 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.590
 You think that day will ever come to 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.540
 quito will always be in school that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.670
 get back with your friends but there's a 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.290
 time that realizes poxa is each one goes 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.940
 follow a path and maybe people 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.000
 you will not see yourself 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.820
 but it's a much better complicated question 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.370
 of yemen is the boarding school is the friendships is 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.830
 everything here with my friends who knows that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.100
 can count and wanting no link that 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.600
 creates here is very strong because we already 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.560
 I shudder to talk about what came 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.460
 yesterday that although there is the eviction 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.460
 stay barbie
