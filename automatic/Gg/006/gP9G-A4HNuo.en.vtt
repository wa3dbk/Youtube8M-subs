the front loop right here I'm going to
go<00:02:10.229> under<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.709> loop<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.640> I'm<00:02:12.569> going<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.810> yarn

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
go under that loop and I'm going to yarn

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.790 
go under that loop and I'm going to yarn
over

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
over

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.970 
over
draw<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.220> loop<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.600> then<00:02:16.110> draw<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
draw that loop out and then draw that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.890 
draw that loop out and then draw that
through<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.670> loop<00:02:17.820> that's<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.330> my<00:02:18.510> hook

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
through the loop that's on my hook

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.420 
through the loop that's on my hook
so<00:02:18.990> that's<00:02:19.200> joining<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.070> single

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
so that's joining what the single

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
so that's joining what the single
crochet<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> mean<00:02:21.690> joining<00:02:22.050> with<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> slip

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
crochet I mean joining with a slip

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.430 
crochet I mean joining with a slip
stitch<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.980> could<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:24.480> also<00:02:24.750> done<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.320> like

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
stitch I could have also done it like

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.010 
stitch I could have also done it like
this<00:02:25.500> sometimes<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.520> do<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.330> could

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
this sometimes I do it like this I could

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.830 
this sometimes I do it like this I could
have<00:02:28.110> put<00:02:28.290> my<00:02:28.380> hook<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.890> first<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.540> I'm<00:02:30.660> only

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
have put my hook in first and I'm only

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.420 
have put my hook in first and I'm only
using<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.350> front<00:02:31.650> loop<00:02:31.830> I'm<00:02:32.040> leaving<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
using the front loop I'm leaving the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.730 
using the front loop I'm leaving the
back<00:02:32.580> loop<00:02:32.820> alone<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> could<00:02:34.620> have

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
back loop alone and then I could have

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.600 
back loop alone and then I could have
picked<00:02:35.190> up<00:02:35.460> my<00:02:36.300> slipknot<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.490> could<00:02:38.490> have

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
picked up my slipknot I could have

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.340 
picked up my slipknot I could have
brought<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.090> through<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.990> and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
brought that through like this and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.160 
brought that through like this and
chained<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.820> that's<00:02:42.030> also<00:02:42.360> join<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.140> a

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
chained one and that's also join with a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.340 
chained one and that's also join with a
slip<00:02:43.350> stitch<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.670> anyway<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.690> make<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.170> little

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
slip stitch so anyway to make the little

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.560 
slip stitch so anyway to make the little
loop<00:02:46.710> round<00:02:47.160> right<00:02:47.460> here<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.850> can<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.030> this

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
loop round right here you can see this

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.010 
loop round right here you can see this
they're<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:50.060> loops<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.630> been<00:02:51.780> worked

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
they're just loops that have been worked

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.020 
they're just loops that have been worked
into<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.710> front<00:02:53.010> loops<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.640> double

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
into the front loops of the double

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.900 
into the front loops of the double
crochet<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:55.350> I'm<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.800> chain<00:02:56.430> two

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
crochet so I'm going to chain two

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.820 
crochet so I'm going to chain two
because<00:02:57.570> my<00:02:57.720> chain<00:02:58.020> one<00:02:58.260> I'm<00:02:58.440> going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> let

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
because my chain one I'm going to let

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.780 
because my chain one I'm going to let
that<00:02:58.860> count<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.640> one<00:03:01.100> chain<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> chain

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
that count is one chain of the chain

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.300 
that count is one chain of the chain
three<00:03:03.060> loop<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:04.050> I've<00:03:04.440> joined<00:03:04.710> with<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> slip

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
three loop so I've joined with a slip

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.670 
three loop so I've joined with a slip
stitch<00:03:05.340> then<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.970> have<00:03:06.180> chain<00:03:06.420> three<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.050> then

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
stitch then I have chain three and then

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.470 
stitch then I have chain three and then
I'm<00:03:07.830> just<00:03:08.100> going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.430> slip<00:03:08.700> stitch<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:09.300> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
I'm just going to slip stitch in the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.270 
I'm just going to slip stitch in the
front<00:03:09.780> loop<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.560> next<00:03:10.770> double<00:03:11.160> crochet

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
front loop of the next double crochet

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.900 
front loop of the next double crochet
like<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:13.310> then<00:03:14.310> I'm<00:03:14.430> going<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.640> chain

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
like this and then I'm going to chain

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.220 
like this and then I'm going to chain
three<00:03:15.270> again

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
three again

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.520 
three again
and<00:03:17.060> then<00:03:18.060> I'm<00:03:18.240> gonna<00:03:18.450> go<00:03:18.720> into<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.290> next

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
and then I'm gonna go into the next

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.710 
and then I'm gonna go into the next
double<00:03:20.040> crochet<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.910> loop<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> double

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
double crochet the loop of the double

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.260 
double crochet the loop of the double
crochet<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.950> see<00:03:23.310> right<00:03:23.550> there<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.820> have<00:03:23.910> two

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
crochet so see right there I have two

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.870 
crochet so see right there I have two
loops<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.590> I'm<00:03:25.860> going<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.040> chain<00:03:26.310> three

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
loops so that I'm going to chain three

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.580 
loops so that I'm going to chain three
and<00:03:28.100> then<00:03:29.100> I'm<00:03:29.490> gonna<00:03:29.760> skip<00:03:30.210> over<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:31.050> group

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and then I'm gonna skip over this group

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.760 
and then I'm gonna skip over this group
of<00:03:31.830> three<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.750> might<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.200> push<00:03:34.440> this

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
of three and you might have to push this

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.620 
of three and you might have to push this
group<00:03:35.100> of<00:03:35.250> three<00:03:35.490> back<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> little<00:03:36.060> bit<00:03:36.330> to

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
group of three back a little bit to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.540 
group of three back a little bit to
expose<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.470> three<00:03:37.710> doubles<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.310> are<00:03:38.400> right

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
expose the three doubles that are right

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.060 
expose the three doubles that are right
here<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.090> then<00:03:39.960> you<00:03:40.080> just<00:03:40.320> go<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.770> front

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
here and then you just go in the front

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.380 
here and then you just go in the front
loop<00:03:41.280> right<00:03:41.520> here<00:03:42.260> like<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.340> then<00:03:45.270> you

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
loop right here like that and then you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.770 
loop right here like that and then you
chain<00:03:45.750> three<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.190> all<00:03:47.400> about<00:03:47.430> chain<00:03:48.420> 3

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
chain three so it's all about chain 3

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.130 
chain three so it's all about chain 3
and<00:03:48.930> slip<00:03:49.050> stitch<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:51.240> you<00:03:51.480> slip<00:03:51.810> stitch

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and slip stitch and then you slip stitch

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.140 
and slip stitch and then you slip stitch
there<00:03:52.530> chain<00:03:53.400> three<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:56.340> if<00:03:56.520> you<00:03:56.670> wanted<00:03:56.970> it

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
there chain three and if you wanted it

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.330 
there chain three and if you wanted it
to<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.330> more<00:03:57.750> roughly<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.530> could<00:03:58.740> always<00:03:58.890> do

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
to be more roughly you could always do

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.450 
to be more roughly you could always do
two<00:03:59.820> loops<00:04:00.090> in<00:04:00.270> each<00:04:00.360> one

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
two loops in each one

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.850 
two loops in each one
or<00:04:02.460> you<00:04:02.670> could<00:04:02.850> chain<00:04:03.090> four<00:04:03.450> or<00:04:03.600> five<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.710> have

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
or you could chain four or five to have

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.400 
or you could chain four or five to have
longer<00:04:05.130> loops<00:04:05.520> okay<00:04:06.030> I'm<00:04:06.360> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> pass<00:04:07.020> over

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
longer loops okay I'm going to pass over

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.850 
longer loops okay I'm going to pass over

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
stitch in the same loop that I started

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.200 
stitch in the same loop that I started
in<00:05:59.230> with<00:05:59.620> my<00:05:59.860> where<00:06:00.400> I<00:06:00.430> join<00:06:00.730> with<00:06:00.970> a<00:06:01.000> slip

in with my where I join with a slip
stitch<00:06:01.360> so<00:06:02.320> that's<00:06:02.830> how<00:06:03.340> you<00:06:03.400> add<00:06:04.180> a<00:06:04.330> ruffle<00:06:05.200> to

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
stitch so that's how you add a ruffle to

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.160 
stitch so that's how you add a ruffle to
a<00:06:05.890> granny<00:06:06.250> square<00:06:06.400> or<00:06:07.030> it<00:06:07.180> might<00:06:07.360> be<00:06:07.570> something

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
else but that's the basic idea on how

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.460 
else but that's the basic idea on how
you<00:06:10.420> do<00:06:10.660> it<00:06:10.840> so<00:06:11.580> I<00:06:12.580> hope<00:06:13.450> this<00:06:13.660> helps<00:06:14.020> you<00:06:14.170> learn
