00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.070
 hello today we will be studying 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.470
 knit a convex column with one double crochet 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.320
 this element is indicated on the diagram here 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.110
 such a wand down and towards him 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.029
 such a semicircle is attached and here 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.309
 this one is a horizontal stick 1 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.770
 means that with one double crochet if 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:31.599
 few tricks then given bulging 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.520
 the column will be executed with several 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.100
 naquids by spider number 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.879
 horizontals in the diagram it denotes 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.879
 spelled as 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.370
 convex column and denoted here 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.089
 such an element as I have already told and 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.649
 so proceed to the implementation of this 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:53.800
 item here i have a row of 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:57.280
 single crochets now I'm 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.370
 turn over this row and execute 2 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.370
 lift air loops I insert a hook under 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.800
 thread and stretch again drive though 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.650
 hook and pull 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.680
 completed 2 air loops now 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.130
 I insert the hook under the thread that is 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.110
 Has completed 1 nakid on a hook now I enter 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.350
 hook between the first and second and column 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.340
 I enter 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.770
 there between them in this gap and further 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.079
 I wrapped around this second column 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.420
 and deduce between the second and third 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:35.619
 that is, I kind of captured the second 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.659
 double crochet i mean 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 you put forward a little here you can 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.670
 see now I grab the worker thread 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.350
 grab and stretch like that through 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.789
 this second column 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.750
 pulled out three loops on the hook 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.270
 Now I'm going to knit these three. 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.429
 loops like a regular double crochet 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.329
 there is a thread grabbed and bound 2 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.810
 the next loops again captured the thread 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.060
 and weaved the remaining 2 loops here 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.040
 turned out first 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.019
 bulging bar you can see why 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.069
 he is called you bye and because he 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.440
 how much it costs as much as closer than 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.319
 the remaining columns proceed to knitting 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.360
 the second convex column we do nakid 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.629
 that is, we enter the hook under the thread and 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.819
 now we will be this bulging column 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.549
 perform on the third column with one 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.730
 nakida here over this column that is, I 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:42.120
 I enter the hook between the second and third 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.430
 column as it were wrapped that is 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.519
 this whole third column and bring 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.019
 in front 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.230
 I would have turned out to be this column 3 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.109
 pushed forward now seized the thread and 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.810
 stretched scotch this third column 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:02.040
 around exactly got three loops 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.420
 I hook up the hook and grab the thread 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.510
 I pull through two loops 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.099
 I re- insert the hook 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.000
 grabbing and tying the two remaining 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.010
 Here I have completed 2 convex column 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.380
 we got two convex columns 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.769
 if you look from the wrong side then 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.810
 You can see that they are put forward 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.540
 forward 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.870
 This is due to the fact that we 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.580
 hook is introduced like this 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.550
 pushes forward slightly 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.140
 the previous row we are these columns of them 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.800
 simply 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.920
 we tie up and so we carry out nakid again 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.400
 enter the hook to the right of that column 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.170
 which we want to tie up and display on the left 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.780
 around this column that is, we like 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.150
 put the hook behind this post 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.989
 now we grab the worker thread 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.120
 pulling through this column neat 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.480
 and that's got three loops on the hook 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.040
 now we are grabbing the worker thread again 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.569
 and knit the next two loops again 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.269
 grab the thread and knit two 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.329
 the remaining loops here we are like this 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.090
 completed 3 convex columns 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.639
 that is, the convex columns fit 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.270
 similarly as regular posts with 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.560
 one offspring only they fit not here 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.600
 in the very loop 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:36.140
 and around the column is thereby created 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.270
 the effect of convex loops on this is our lesson 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.270
 finished thanks everyone for attention
