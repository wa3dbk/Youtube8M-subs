00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.770 
does its best to recreate that
particularly<00:02:47.609> when<00:02:48.180> played<00:02:48.599> with<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:49.139> iCade

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780

if<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:52.680> don't<00:02:52.859> have<00:02:53.129> an<00:02:53.249> IDE

but<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.659> most<00:02:57.930> games<00:02:58.409> which<00:02:58.709> were<00:02:58.889> designed

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
but like most games which were designed

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.939 
but like most games which were designed
with<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.609> joystick<00:02:59.969> in<00:03:00.480> mind<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.079> best<00:03:01.530> played

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:01.949 
with a joystick in mind it's best played

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.939 
with a joystick in mind it's best played
with<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.639> joystick<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.079> can<00:03:04.439> play<00:03:04.739> them

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:04.949 
with a joystick but you can play them

the<00:03:58.379> same<00:03:58.620> like<00:03:58.829> berserk<00:03:59.280> which<00:03:59.759> is<00:03:59.939> similar

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
the same like berserk which is similar

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.539
