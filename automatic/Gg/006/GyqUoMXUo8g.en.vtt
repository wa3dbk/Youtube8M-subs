00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
as I just did right here now it does

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.640 
as I just did right here now it does
take<00:01:29.939> some<00:01:29.970> practice<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.560> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
take some practice and a little bit of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
take some practice and a little bit of
luck<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.420> especially<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.750> Rainbow

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
luck because especially with Rainbow

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
luck because especially with Rainbow
Road<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.590> sometimes<00:01:34.979> you'll<00:01:35.750> understand

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
Road because sometimes you'll understand

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.569 
Road because sometimes you'll understand
then<00:01:36.840> sometimes<00:01:37.290> you'll<00:01:37.500> overshoot<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.800 

you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.270> long<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> hit<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you know just as long as you hit the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.389 
you know just as long as you hit the
road<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.290> hit<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> road<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.950> bounce<00:01:44.130> off

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
road if you hit the road and bounce off

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.149 
road if you hit the road and bounce off
because<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.240> bounce<00:01:45.540> sometimes<00:01:45.950> I<00:01:46.950> do

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
because you will bounce sometimes I do

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.639 
because you will bounce sometimes I do
believe<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.729> will<00:01:47.909> let<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.020> clear<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> jump

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
believe it will let you clear the jump

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.499 
believe it will let you clear the jump
that<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.920> will<00:01:50.220> start<00:01:50.939> from<00:01:51.270> where<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that you will start from where you

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
that you will start from where you
bounced<00:01:51.930> off<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> hope<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> guys<00:01:53.040> enjoy
