00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.620
 today we go with a great application 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.190
 for those who want to stop depending 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.950
 of the lock and unlock button and 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.260
 they want to do it automatically with this 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.489
 application can do it application 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.220
 called gravity screen and like its name what 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.590
 he says he's going to allow that through the 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.160
 phone or device sensors 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.800
 Android you can simply turn off or 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.989
 Unlock the phone automatically 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.780
 without having to press the button 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.150
 unlocking that is often hateful 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.579
 as they do we are going to download first 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.009
 that the whole application 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.830
 then once unloaded delaplace 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.380
 thor in the free version 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.210
 you go to every look there are several options 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.970
 the first option that appears is 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.070
 pocket censor and says he recognizes 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.680
 your phone when it 's in your pocket 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.560
 turn off the screen when you turn the phone 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.409
 within an angle fixed here says that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.049
 60 degrees since then after 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.549
 60 degrees will turn the screen off but 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.799
 I put it in better than everything in 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.380
 any direction that means turn off 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.170
 the screen of your device if it is in 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.819
 your pocket in any direction 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.789
 recommended if you keep your phone's 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.209
 side in your pocket only the 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.280
 proximity sensor with a delay of 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.039
 1.5 seconds is also the sensor 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.440
 table which means that if you are going to put the 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.289
 device so automatically the 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.229
 screen is going to unlock the same 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.420
 lying face up and if there are many 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.090
 many many options that are going to 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.310
 allow to pay this this simply 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.679
 it's spectacular for people who 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.050
 question whether they have the button 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.780
 lock unlock and have it 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.640
 here in the center like the samsung galaxy 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.220
 let say 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.390
 no longer works for them or since they see it 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.310
 loose or just as I want 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.580
 use it automatically 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.480
 download and we will activate it for 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.280
 that you see how it is going to 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.580
 run automatically then 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.570
 just when you put it on your mouth 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.790
 down let's say the team goes to aixÃ² no 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.620
 let's say to let us know what is 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.190
 blocked when we go back to 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.140
 to look at it here we make a small sand 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.010
 shake and there will be automatically 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:00.400
 as you can see without 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.470
 block or keep pressed this 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.000
 button now if we do it with an example 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.610
 from a pocket let's say we have the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.640
 smartphone so we are not going to block now 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.330
 here but we just have it like that 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.970
 and we are going to insert it in your pocket 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.890
 and as you can see there after 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.570
 a time completely extinguishes everything 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.700
 automatically and it's just that the 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.700
 let's take 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.370
 will automatically be the screen of 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.440
 active blocking is going to be a very very very 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.840
 excellent the same when you put it 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.209
 upside down 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.129
 and come back and the grapes will be fine by 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.680
 example if you have a flip cover 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.040
 it's going to be simply spectacular be 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.209
 the model of smartphone they have 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.269
 it will simply be automatically 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.460
 As not all smartphones are going to 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.250
 have or are 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.990
 let's say with the same characteristics 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.260
 then let's say in this that is the audio 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.390
 790 I have to use another flip cover in 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.120
 this case of the galaxy now 2 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.070
 so it was difficult for me to open it 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.050
 finish a gap soon and let everything be 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.750
 it was then that I downloaded this 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.720
 application as you can see there 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.830
 if I close it will close 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.620
 I'm automatically working in the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.780
 application that is working sometimes 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.329
 when it does not respond well, it's only with 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.400
 hit him a shake so the sensor 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.220
 movement is also activated then 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.800
 let's say if for example I'm on twitter 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.830
 but then I got bored then 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.390
 I just close it and when I go back to 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.180
 open it 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.970
 will open me automatically now I want 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.560
 look here let's say that for those who 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.120
 are concerned about the use of 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.700
 drums 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.870
 yes yes it will be automatically then 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.860
 that's why there's no problem then 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.599
 you can see there I'm going to close it 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.430
 after a time like you can 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.639
 see the screen will be completely 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.580
 ok now if I open it and use it 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.370
 to look there automatically then 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.250
 I recommend you leave the link 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.009
 of the application there are in the comments 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.840
 gravity screen to install it will 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.610
 be a very great application 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.650
 remember that if you like it and liked it 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.360

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.949
