00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
up my alley for being a really freaking

up my alley for being a really freaking
awesome<00:00:30.949> anime<00:00:31.580> but<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.239> lot<00:00:32.660> of<00:00:32.809> people<00:00:33.050> most

awesome anime but a lot of people most
likely<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:33.860> would<00:00:33.980> be<00:00:34.100> turned<00:00:34.430> off<00:00:34.730> by<00:00:34.760> the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
likely it would be turned off by the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.880 
likely it would be turned off by the
animation<00:00:35.690> style<00:00:35.930> or<00:00:36.110> think<00:00:36.350> it's<00:00:36.470> really

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
animation style or think it's really

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
weird for a romance animated the reason

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.960 
weird for a romance animated the reason
why<00:00:39.019> is<00:00:39.080> because<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.129> way<00:00:40.250> shaft<00:00:40.699> is

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
why is because the way shaft is

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.210 
why is because the way shaft is
animating<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.840> anime<00:00:42.350> it's<00:00:42.800> pretty<00:00:43.070> much

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
animating this anime it's pretty much

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.900 
tell the way they used panels and the
camera<00:00:48.620> angles<00:00:48.950> of<00:00:49.070> switching<00:00:49.460> from<00:00:49.610> scenes

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
camera angles of switching from scenes

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.850 
camera angles of switching from scenes
the<00:00:50.120> seeds<00:00:50.390> with<00:00:50.750> eyes<00:00:50.960> shots<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.559> facade

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
the seeds with eyes shots and a facade

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.889 
the seeds with eyes shots and a facade
based<00:00:52.190> on<00:00:52.340> that<00:00:52.460> remaining<00:00:53.180> ammo<00:00:53.360> Nagoya<00:00:53.660> tree

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
based on that remaining ammo Nagoya tree

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.420 
based on that remaining ammo Nagoya tree
the<00:00:54.020> way<00:00:54.140> they're<00:00:54.320> trying<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.649> do<00:00:54.829> that<00:00:55.040> which

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
the way they're trying to do that which

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.190 
the way they're trying to do that which
is<00:00:55.579> fine<00:00:55.820> in<00:00:56.030> my<00:00:56.090> opinion<00:00:56.510> or<00:00:56.570> a<00:00:56.600> Ludlow<00:00:56.930> Nagoya

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
is fine in my opinion or a Ludlow Nagoya

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.350 
is fine in my opinion or a Ludlow Nagoya
tree<00:00:57.440> but<00:00:57.980> it's<00:00:58.280> definitely<00:00:58.550> different<00:00:59.270> from

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
tree but it's definitely different from

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.750 
tree but it's definitely different from
the<00:00:59.570> manga<00:00:59.960> adaptation<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.340> pretty<00:01:01.550> much

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
the manga adaptation and so pretty much

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.150 
the manga adaptation and so pretty much
the<00:01:02.059> manga<00:01:02.660> feels<00:01:03.110> different<00:01:03.710> feels<00:01:04.009> like

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
the manga feels different feels like

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.350 
the manga feels different feels like
completely<00:01:04.580> almost<00:01:04.729> two<00:01:04.940> different<00:01:05.210> series

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
completely almost two different series

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.940 
completely almost two different series
even<00:01:05.630> though<00:01:05.720> they're<00:01:05.930> following<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.530> actual

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
even though they're following the actual

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.680 
even though they're following the actual
manga<00:01:07.759> really<00:01:08.180> good<00:01:08.390> they're<00:01:08.660> actually

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
manga really good they're actually

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.420 
manga really good they're actually
sticking<00:01:09.560> through<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:10.009> the<00:01:10.100> Hmong<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.280> they

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
sticking through to the Hmong and they

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.190 
sticking through to the Hmong and they
are<00:01:10.580> deleting<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.060> couple<00:01:11.360> scenes<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:12.080> it

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
are deleting a couple scenes but it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.330 
are deleting a couple scenes but it
doesn't<00:01:12.530> feel<00:01:12.619> like<00:01:12.860> it's<00:01:13.100> anything

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
doesn't feel like it's anything

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.060 
doesn't feel like it's anything
necessarily<00:01:14.119> important<00:01:14.780> no<00:01:15.020> I<00:01:15.320> really<00:01:15.860> do

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
necessarily important no I really do

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.650 
necessarily important no I really do
like<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.580> way<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:16.880> episode<00:01:17.240> pretty<00:01:17.479> much

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
like the way this episode pretty much

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.690 
like the way this episode pretty much
focused<00:01:17.930> on<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.590> fake<00:01:18.890> relationship<00:01:19.580> between

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
focused on the fake relationship between

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.060 
focused on the fake relationship between
Cheeto<00:01:20.119> gay<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.540> rocku<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.500> yet<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.740> see<00:01:21.890> how

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
Cheeto gay and rocku and yet to see how

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.740 
Cheeto gay and rocku and yet to see how
all<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.490> gangsters<00:01:22.700> had<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.450> freakin

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
all the gangsters had and the freakin

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.390 
all the gangsters had and the freakin
Maffeo<00:01:24.170> were<00:01:24.530> behind<00:01:24.799> him<00:01:24.950> trying<00:01:25.310> to

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
Maffeo were behind him trying to

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.609 
Maffeo were behind him trying to
probably<00:01:25.729> kill<00:01:26.000> them<00:01:26.210> if<00:01:26.510> they<00:01:26.930> did<00:01:27.200> not<00:01:27.350> do

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
probably kill them if they did not do

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.770 
probably kill them if they did not do
what<00:01:27.830> they<00:01:28.010> said<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.610> there<00:01:29.119> was<00:01:29.270> just<00:01:29.570> some

way<00:03:02.199> that<00:03:02.379> was<00:03:02.500> animated<00:03:03.129> and<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.579> really

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
way that was animated and it's really

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.030 
way that was animated and it's really
cool<00:03:04.449> to<00:03:04.659> get<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.810> see<00:03:05.049> an<00:03:05.290> animation<00:03:05.650> style

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
one chapter of the manga this pretty

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.439 
one chapter of the manga this pretty
much<00:04:15.250> when<00:04:15.459> it's<00:04:15.609> about<00:04:15.759> probably<00:04:16.060> almost

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
much when it's about probably almost

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.110 
much when it's about probably almost
three<00:04:16.719> chapters<00:04:17.259> in<00:04:17.469> this<00:04:17.680> actual<00:04:18.159> episode<00:04:18.669> so

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
three chapters in this actual episode so

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.060 
three chapters in this actual episode so
they're<00:04:19.449> going<00:04:19.780> at<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.930> decent<00:04:20.289> pace<00:04:20.739> and

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
they're going at a decent pace and

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.250 
they're going at a decent pace and
hopefully<00:04:21.969> they<00:04:22.120> don't<00:04:22.330> go<00:04:22.449> faster<00:04:22.990> than<00:04:23.110> this

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
hopefully they don't go faster than this

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.360 
hopefully they don't go faster than this
because<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.560> would<00:04:23.650> kind<00:04:23.830> of<00:04:23.949> ruin<00:04:24.099> the<00:04:24.310> story

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
because it would kind of ruin the story

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.970 
because it would kind of ruin the story
aspect<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.210> little<00:04:25.419> bit<00:04:25.539> but<00:04:26.050> if<00:04:26.229> they<00:04:26.349> take

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
aspect a little bit but if they take

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.100 
aspect a little bit but if they take
and<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.460> made<00:04:27.640> it<00:04:27.760> well<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.360> do<00:04:28.720> something
