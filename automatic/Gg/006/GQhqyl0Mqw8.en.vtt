4 still ran in 30 frames per second it
felt<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.340> lot<00:01:44.520> clunkier<00:01:45.149> than<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.930> 60<00:01:46.229> frames

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
felt a lot clunkier than the 60 frames

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
felt a lot clunkier than the 60 frames
per<00:01:46.590> second<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.280> surprised<00:01:47.790> what

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
per second you would be surprised what

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.380 
per second you would be surprised what
an<00:01:48.390> upgrade<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.460> versus<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> last

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
an upgrade this is versus the the last

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.969 
an upgrade this is versus the the last
generation<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.960> consoles<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
generation of consoles I think it's a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.429 
generation of consoles I think it's a
huge<00:01:53.640> step<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.210> direction<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.170> I'm

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
huge step in the right direction and I'm

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.749 
huge step in the right direction and I'm
actually<00:01:55.680> pretty<00:01:55.950> excited<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.549> now<00:01:56.700> you

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
actually pretty excited that now you

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.670 
actually pretty excited that now you
guys<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> experience<00:01:57.960> 60<00:01:58.409> frames<00:01:58.619> per

the ps4 version looks better and from

the ps4 version looks better and from
the<00:02:06.000> footage<00:02:06.240> I've<00:02:06.420> seen<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.840> think<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.079> can

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the footage I've seen I think I can

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.050 
the footage I've seen I think I can
agree<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
agree with that you can see the the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.699 
agree with that you can see the the
resolution<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> textures<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
resolution in just the textures of the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.130 
resolution in just the textures of the
whole<00:02:11.009> look<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.910> bit<00:02:12.030> better<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
whole look a little bit better on the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.800 
whole look a little bit better on the
yes<00:02:13.290> for<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:14.370> being<00:02:14.610> said<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.180> Xbox<00:02:15.600> one

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
yes for that being said the Xbox one

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.570 
yes for that being said the Xbox one
version<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.260> no<00:02:16.500> slouch<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.010> still<00:02:17.280> think<00:02:17.490> it

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
version is no slouch I still think it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.220 
version is no slouch I still think it
looks<00:02:17.730> really<00:02:18.000> good<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.540> comparable<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
looks really good it's comparable to a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.440 
looks really good it's comparable to a
lower<00:02:19.620> end<00:02:19.950> PC<00:02:20.400> version<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.060> which<00:02:21.240> i<00:02:21.390> think

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
lower end PC version of it which i think

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.600 
lower end PC version of it which i think
is<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.690> step<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.319> right<00:02:22.500> direction<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:23.340> not

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
is a step in the right direction I'm not

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.850 
is a step in the right direction I'm not

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
call for repair and the most useful

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.720 
call for repair and the most useful
thing<00:03:59.820> in<00:04:00.269> my<00:04:00.540> opinion<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:01.200> saying<00:04:01.829> hey<00:04:02.250> next

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
thing in my opinion is saying hey next

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.240 
thing in my opinion is saying hey next
time<00:04:02.880> spawn<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.600> as<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> soul<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.769> instead<00:04:05.190> of

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
time spawn in as a soul so instead of

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.979 
time spawn in as a soul so instead of
having<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.670> go<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.060> manually<00:04:06.390> manually

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
having to go in and manually manually

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.420 
having to go in and manually manually
change<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.560> next<00:04:07.829> time<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.100> spawn<00:04:08.400> in

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
change it the next time you spawn in

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.220 
change it the next time you spawn in
you'll<00:04:08.790> spawn<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.299> as<00:04:09.450> assault<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.079> you're

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
you'll spawn in as assault so if you're

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.960 
you'll spawn in as assault so if you're
an<00:04:10.290> NG<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.769> need<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.950> spawn<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.730> keep

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
an NG and you need to spawn in to keep

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.880 
an NG and you need to spawn in to keep
some<00:04:12.209> tickets<00:04:12.600> as<00:04:12.780> an<00:04:12.900> assault<00:04:13.200> player<00:04:13.440> you

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
some tickets as an assault player you

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.009 
some tickets as an assault player you
don't<00:04:13.920> have<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.370> waste<00:04:14.640> time<00:04:14.820> switching<00:04:15.780> your

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
don't have to waste time switching your

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.779 
don't have to waste time switching your
kits<00:04:16.229> out<00:04:16.410> it'll<00:04:16.650> automatically<00:04:17.250> be<00:04:17.430> set<00:04:17.700> to

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
kits out it'll automatically be set to

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.789 
kits out it'll automatically be set to
that<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.180> hit<00:04:18.479> spawn<00:04:18.810> spawn<00:04:19.410> right<00:04:19.620> it

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
that you just hit spawn spawn right it

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.620 
that you just hit spawn spawn right it
that's<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.340> cool<00:04:20.549> feature<00:04:20.579> of<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.120> Kinect<00:04:21.450> now

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
that's a cool feature of the Kinect now

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.940 
that's a cool feature of the Kinect now
one<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.019> other<00:04:22.049> features<00:04:22.410> is<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.919> ability

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
one of the other features is the ability

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.130 
one of the other features is the ability
to<00:04:23.340> lean<00:04:23.669> if<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.419> set<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.660> up<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.900> can

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
to lean if you set it up you can

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.900 
to lean if you set it up you can
actually<00:04:25.169> lean<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.919> can<00:04:26.039> see<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
actually lean you can see the

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.160 
actually lean you can see the
actually<00:04:27.150> me<00:04:27.330> right<00:04:27.570> there<00:04:27.750> doing<00:04:28.050> the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
actually me right there doing the

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.990 
actually me right there doing the
leaning<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.710> it'll<00:04:29.100> take<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.400> from<00:04:29.520> one<00:04:29.760> side

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
leaning and it'll take you from one side

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.760 
leaning and it'll take you from one side
to<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.180> next<00:04:30.450> depending<00:04:30.780> on<00:04:30.990> on<00:04:31.350> what<00:04:31.650> angle

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
to the next depending on on what angle

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.050 
to the next depending on on what angle
you're<00:04:32.010> sitting<00:04:32.340> at<00:04:32.460> you<00:04:32.610> have<00:04:32.730> to<00:04:32.790> have<00:04:32.940> your

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
you're sitting at you have to have your

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.700 
you're sitting at you have to have your
Kinect<00:04:33.360> pretty<00:04:33.600> centered<00:04:33.990> or<00:04:34.140> it<00:04:34.290> will<00:04:34.470> kind

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
Kinect pretty centered or it will kind

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.260 
Kinect pretty centered or it will kind
of<00:04:34.770> glitch<00:04:35.010> out<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:35.970> thought<00:04:36.090> it<00:04:36.180> was

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
of glitch out but I thought it was

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.460 
of glitch out but I thought it was
pretty<00:04:36.450> cool<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.960> could<00:04:37.080> actually<00:04:37.230> do

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
pretty cool that you could actually do

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.840 
pretty cool that you could actually do
you're<00:04:37.650> leaning<00:04:37.950> mechanics<00:04:38.370> based<00:04:38.580> on<00:04:38.760> your

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
you're leaning mechanics based on your

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.370 
you're leaning mechanics based on your
how<00:04:39.030> your<00:04:39.240> body<00:04:39.450> moves<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.990> fact<00:04:40.170> that<00:04:40.230> it

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
how your body moves and the fact that it

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.900 
how your body moves and the fact that it
actually<00:04:40.500> works<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.070> actually<00:04:41.220> does<00:04:41.700> work

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
actually works it actually does work

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.550 
actually works it actually does work
pretty<00:04:41.970> well<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.930> can<00:04:43.050> also<00:04:43.170> do<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.530> in

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
pretty well you can also do it in

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.140 
pretty well you can also do it in
choppers<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.160> if<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.370> want<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.610> look<00:04:44.760> left<00:04:45.030> and

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
choppers so if you want to look left and

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.790 
choppers so if you want to look left and
right<00:04:45.270> in<00:04:45.510> your<00:04:45.630> chopper<00:04:46.020> your<00:04:46.170> jet<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.680> can

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
right in your chopper your jet you can

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.170 
right in your chopper your jet you can
actually<00:04:46.950> make<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.430> motion<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.000> it'll

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
actually make the motion and it'll

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.550 
actually make the motion and it'll
actually<00:04:48.330> look<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.930> left<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.350> right

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
actually look to the left and the right

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.260 
actually look to the left and the right
which<00:04:49.950> is<00:04:49.980> actually<00:04:50.340> pretty<00:04:50.520> useful<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:51.060> would

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
which is actually pretty useful I would

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.660 
which is actually pretty useful I would
actually<00:04:51.540> enjoy<00:04:51.840> using<00:04:52.410> that<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:53.490> know<00:04:53.580> if

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
actually enjoy using that if you know if

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.040 
actually enjoy using that if you know if
they<00:04:53.730> had<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.090> feature<00:04:54.300> on<00:04:54.420> PC<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:54.900> think

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
they had that feature on PC I think

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.360 
they had that feature on PC I think
that'd<00:04:55.140> be<00:04:55.260> pretty<00:04:55.290> cool<00:04:55.530> because<00:04:55.920> now<00:04:56.310> you

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
that'd be pretty cool because now you

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.830 
that'd be pretty cool because now you
have<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.700> you<00:04:56.910> know<00:04:57.000> right-click<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.780> it

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
have to you know right-click and it

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.780 
have to you know right-click and it
sometimes<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.230> gets<00:04:58.350> kind<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.590> awkward<00:04:58.950> so

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
sometimes it gets kind of awkward so

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.760 
sometimes it gets kind of awkward so
that<00:04:59.910> is<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> nice<00:05:00.480> feature<00:05:00.810> of<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.110> Xbox<00:05:01.500> one

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
that is a nice feature of the Xbox one

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.260 
that is a nice feature of the Xbox one
which<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.130> think<00:05:02.310> kind<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.520> makes<00:05:02.730> it<00:05:02.880> unique

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
which I think kind of makes it unique

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.850 
which I think kind of makes it unique
from<00:05:03.510> all<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.750> other<00:05:03.870> ones<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.200> especially

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
from all the other ones I especially

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.440 
from all the other ones I especially
like<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.400> command<00:05:05.790> thing<00:05:06.060> where<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.300> can

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
like the command thing where you can

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.600 
like the command thing where you can
actually<00:05:06.570> say<00:05:06.900> hey<00:05:07.080> next<00:05:07.770> I'm<00:05:08.010> spawning<00:05:08.310> as<00:05:08.580> a

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
actually say hey next I'm spawning as a

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.760 
actually say hey next I'm spawning as a
sole<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:09.360> know<00:05:09.480> hey<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.750> need<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.110> medic<00:05:10.440> it

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
sole you know hey I need a medic it

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.550 
sole you know hey I need a medic it
saves<00:05:11.040> you<00:05:11.190> from<00:05:11.310> having<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.760> use<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:12.120> Comoros

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
saves you from having to use the Comoros

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
saves you from having to use the Comoros
and<00:05:13.560> it's<00:05:13.680> actually<00:05:13.950> pretty<00:05:14.100> useful<00:05:14.190> I've

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
and it's actually pretty useful I've

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.280 
and it's actually pretty useful I've
actually<00:05:14.760> used<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.330> on<00:05:15.390> multiple<00:05:15.810> occasions

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
actually used it on multiple occasions

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.860 
actually used it on multiple occasions
now<00:05:16.470> but<00:05:17.190> in<00:05:17.280> summary<00:05:17.640> of<00:05:17.730> all<00:05:18.030> my<00:05:18.090> experiences

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
now but in summary of all my experiences

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.500 
now but in summary of all my experiences
with<00:05:19.110> this<00:05:19.350> game<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:19.620> far<00:05:19.830> how<00:05:20.790> do<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:20.970> like<00:05:21.300> it

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
with this game so far how do I like it

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.480 
with this game so far how do I like it
well<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:21.930> put<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.200> like<00:05:22.350> this<00:05:22.590> what<00:05:22.920> I<00:05:22.950> went<00:05:23.310> to

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
well to put it like this what I went to

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.430 
well to put it like this what I went to
London<00:05:23.730> for<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.150> battlefield<00:05:24.570> 4<00:05:24.750> showdown<00:05:25.140> I

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
London for the battlefield 4 showdown I

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.220 
London for the battlefield 4 showdown I
had<00:05:25.830> no<00:05:26.010> intentions<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.820> ever<00:05:27.180> expecting<00:05:27.900> to

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
had no intentions of ever expecting to

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.920 
had no intentions of ever expecting to
leaving<00:05:28.560> there<00:05:29.060> positive<00:05:30.060> about<00:05:30.690> the

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
leaving there positive about the

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.240 
leaving there positive about the
next-generation<00:05:31.350> consoles<00:05:31.980> because<00:05:32.160> I

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
next-generation consoles because I

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.220 
next-generation consoles because I
didn't<00:05:32.550> pre-order<00:05:33.030> any<00:05:33.210> of<00:05:33.390> them<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.660> actually

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
didn't pre-order any of them I actually

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.500 
didn't pre-order any of them I actually
got<00:05:34.590> this<00:05:34.860> Xbox<00:05:35.310> in<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:35.670> very<00:05:36.000> last<00:05:36.210> minute

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
got this Xbox in the very last minute

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.500 
got this Xbox in the very last minute
possible<00:05:37.170> so<00:05:38.130> it<00:05:38.520> actually<00:05:38.820> convinced<00:05:39.420> me

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
possible so it actually convinced me

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.390 
possible so it actually convinced me
that<00:05:39.540> hey<00:05:39.900> you<00:05:39.960> know<00:05:40.140> I<00:05:40.440> can<00:05:40.680> play<00:05:40.890> battlefield

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
that hey you know I can play battlefield

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.550 
that hey you know I can play battlefield

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.900 
4 on the next-generation consoles and
feel<00:05:44.130> like<00:05:44.430> I'm<00:05:44.610> getting<00:05:44.880> the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
feel like I'm getting the

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.340 
feel like I'm getting the
next-generation<00:05:45.419> experience<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.169> know<00:05:46.260> I'm

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
next-generation experience you know I'm

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.990 
next-generation experience you know I'm
getting<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.710> same<00:05:46.890> experience<00:05:47.220> I<00:05:47.520> can<00:05:47.669> get<00:05:47.820> on

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
getting the same experience I can get on

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.450 
getting the same experience I can get on
my<00:05:48.120> gaming<00:05:48.330> PC<00:05:48.450> so<00:05:49.020> I<00:05:49.230> think<00:05:49.919> that's<00:05:50.220> that's

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
my gaming PC so I think that's that's

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.920 
my gaming PC so I think that's that's
really<00:05:50.700> important<00:05:51.240> because<00:05:51.300> I<00:05:51.510> don't<00:05:51.540> feel

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
really important because I don't feel

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.810 
really important because I don't feel
cheated<00:05:52.230> with<00:05:52.500> this<00:05:52.680> version<00:05:53.040> however<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.580> did

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
cheated with this version however I did

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.460 
cheated with this version however I did
feel<00:05:53.970> cheated<00:05:54.240> with<00:05:54.480> the<00:05:54.600> Xbox<00:05:54.960> 360<00:05:55.440> version

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
feel cheated with the Xbox 360 version

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.930 
feel cheated with the Xbox 360 version
so<00:05:55.890> I<00:05:55.919> definitely<00:05:56.160> think<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.669> next

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
so I definitely think the next

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.670 
so I definitely think the next
generation<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.450> consoles<00:05:57.900> if<00:05:58.140> you're<00:05:58.620> a

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
generation of consoles if you're a

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.080 
generation of consoles if you're a
console<00:05:59.100> player<00:05:59.280> if<00:05:59.400> you<00:05:59.490> don't<00:05:59.700> like<00:05:59.880> you

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090
