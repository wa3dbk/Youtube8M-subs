00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.970
 want to make the sauce and in this case 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.690

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.350

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.850
 piece of onion I will not let 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.670

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.680
 a little good here the good salsita 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.500

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.440
 three minutes serving let's leave a 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.920
 minute and good here we have the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.140
 tomatoes with him an extra minute four 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.140
 boiling minutes the only thing I'm going to 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.400
 to do is that I'm going to empty them of nothing 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.850
 water the blender the whole circuit what 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.530
 which means that you are Olympian after 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.900
 an epic appointment for some people 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.960
 because for others I know not suffice me 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.610
 it stung me in fact they did not teach me to 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.440
 they do nothing else they separate in giving 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 taste that this not for them to sting but 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.310
 already with time that that is not 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.130
 getting used to the spikes and coughs and these 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.670
 the smallest ones as I said that varies 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.340
 depending on characters 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.060
 I'm not missing the clove of garlic 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.200
 because we put the clove of garlic we put 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.200

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.070

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.570

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.030
 In addition to deceive people if you 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.190

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.290

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.190

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.190
 blender to the pan 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.010
