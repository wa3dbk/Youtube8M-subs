00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
right so I did first make a frame but

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.670 
right so I did first make a frame but
and<00:00:04.740> it<00:00:05.670> turned<00:00:05.970> out<00:00:06.120> it<00:00:06.180> it<00:00:06.660> wasn't<00:00:07.410> well

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
and it turned out it it wasn't well

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.180 
and it turned out it it wasn't well
enough<00:00:07.710> made<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:09.360> broke<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:10.980> see

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
enough made so it broke and you can see

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.289 
enough made so it broke and you can see
here<00:00:11.490> down<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.870> shattered<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:14.299> that

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
here down here it's it shattered in that

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.790 
here down here it's it shattered in that

as you just saw I got these for booms

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.350 
as you just saw I got these for booms
cut<00:01:56.230> off<00:01:56.410> so<00:01:56.650> they're<00:01:56.890> about<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.880> same<00:01:58.060> length

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
cut off so they're about the same length

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.210 
cut off so they're about the same length
so<00:01:58.450> I'm<00:01:58.570> just<00:01:58.720> going<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:58.960> take<00:01:59.830> some<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.190> that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
so I'm just going to take some of that

so I'm just going to take some of that
off<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.910> but<00:02:01.780> they<00:02:02.140> should<00:02:02.410> be<00:02:02.700> about<00:02:03.700> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
off and but they should be about the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
off and but they should be about the
same<00:02:04.210> length<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:07.150> next<00:02:07.450> thing<00:02:07.570> I'm<00:02:07.750> going<00:02:07.810> to

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
same length the next thing I'm going to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.460 
same length the next thing I'm going to
do<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.410> I'm<00:02:08.649> going<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.890> take<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.429> some<00:02:10.030> piece<00:02:10.270> of

do is I'm going to take in some piece of

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.370 
do is I'm going to take in some piece of
fried<00:02:11.470> thin<00:02:11.860> thin<00:02:12.550> wood<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.870> think<00:02:14.200> it's

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
fried thin thin wood and I think it's

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.900 
fried thin thin wood and I think it's
two<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.310> half<00:02:15.460> millimeters<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.470> thin<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
two and a half millimeters is thin and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.350 
two and a half millimeters is thin and
then<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.480> cut<00:02:19.720> out<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:21.010> frame<00:02:21.850> for<00:02:21.880> the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
then going to cut out a a frame for the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.440 
then going to cut out a a frame for the
other<00:02:22.570> side<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.320> that's<00:02:23.530> gonna<00:02:23.770> hold<00:02:23.980> up<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.730> up

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
other side and that's gonna hold up a up

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.410 
other side and that's gonna hold up a up
here<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.380> frame<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.209> bottom<00:02:28.209> side

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
here and a frame for the bottom side

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.850 
here and a frame for the bottom side
which<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.110> going<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.410> be<00:02:29.500> honored<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.530> just

and they are going to go five
centimeters<00:02:50.890> into<00:02:51.490> this<00:02:52.740> frame<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.209> can

centimeters into this frame what you can
call<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.320> little<00:02:56.890> be<00:02:57.850> held<00:02:58.090> by<00:02:58.390> f<00:02:59.130> it<00:03:00.130> will<00:03:00.280> be

call it a little be held by f it will be

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.830 
call it a little be held by f it will be
helped<00:03:00.730> by<00:03:01.019> two<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.620> bolts<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.580> two<00:03:04.450> volts

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
helped by two and bolts and two volts

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.150 
helped by two and bolts and two volts
like<00:03:05.880> these<00:03:06.880> bolts<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.320> I'm<00:03:08.470> not<00:03:08.620> even<00:03:08.650> seen

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
like these bolts and I'm not even seen

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.720 
like these bolts and I'm not even seen
them<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:10.690> one<00:03:11.320> of<00:03:11.350> them<00:03:11.620> will<00:03:12.220> be<00:03:12.400> very

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
them and then one of them will be very

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.640 
them and then one of them will be very
easy<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.420> screw<00:03:13.690> off<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.470> can<00:03:14.590> just

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
easy to just screw off so you can just

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.360 
easy to just screw off so you can just
bend<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.940> arm<00:03:16.150> round<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.350> other<00:03:17.530> arm<00:03:17.980> here

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
bend the arm round to the other arm here

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.030 
bend the arm round to the other arm here
so<00:03:18.489> it'll<00:03:18.670> be<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:19.000> much<00:03:19.360> much<00:03:19.690> easier<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
so it'll be a much much easier to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:05:04.260 
so it'll be a much much easier to
transport

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.689

I've<00:05:30.380> assembled<00:05:31.130> the<00:05:31.520> frame<00:05:31.760> now<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:33.550> I've

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
I've assembled the frame now and I've

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.219 
I've assembled the frame now and I've
got<00:05:34.910> it<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.740> with<00:05:36.740> all<00:05:36.889> these<00:05:37.360> screws<00:05:38.360> under

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
got it and with all these screws under

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:45.159 
got it and with all these screws under
and<00:05:39.500> bolts<00:05:40.400> nuts<00:05:40.699> and<00:05:41.889> with<00:05:42.889> exactly<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:44.419> 90

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
and bolts nuts and with exactly and 90

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.950 
and bolts nuts and with exactly and 90
degrees<00:05:45.590> of<00:05:45.919> each<00:05:46.099> arm<00:05:47.349> so<00:05:48.349> this<00:05:48.830> is<00:05:49.039> a<00:05:49.070> I<00:05:49.960> think

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
degrees of each arm so this is a I think

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.450 
degrees of each arm so this is a I think
it<00:05:51.080> turned<00:05:51.289> out<00:05:51.410> pretty<00:05:51.590> good<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.070> it's

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
it turned out pretty good and it's

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.290 
it turned out pretty good and it's
pretty<00:05:52.880> strong<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:53.300> durable<00:05:53.630> too<00:05:54.110> and<00:05:54.949> so<00:05:55.639> the

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
pretty strong and durable too and so the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.060 
pretty strong and durable too and so the
next<00:05:56.479> thing<00:05:56.630> I'm<00:05:56.840> going<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:57.110> do<00:05:57.289> is<00:05:57.470> mount<00:05:57.889> the
