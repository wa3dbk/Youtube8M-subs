00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
with the trick okay it could be any

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.880 
with the trick okay it could be any
tricky<00:04:24.000> wish<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.720> involves<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.380> card<00:04:25.650> force

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
tricky wish that involves a card force

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.550 
tricky wish that involves a card force
and<00:04:26.250> that's<00:04:27.060> basically<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.479> explanation<00:04:28.140> for

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
and that's basically the explanation for

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.740 
and that's basically the explanation for
the<00:04:28.680> spread<00:04:28.919> force

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
the spread force

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.840 
the spread force
and<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:30.110> think<00:04:30.170> it<00:04:30.500> would<00:04:30.710> be<00:04:30.890> battery<00:04:31.520> if<00:04:31.610> we<00:04:31.700> go

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
and I think it would be battery if we go

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.840 
and I think it would be battery if we go
for<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.180> one<00:04:32.420> last<00:04:32.630> time<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.830> spread<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.280> pack
