somewhat<00:02:26.130> interested<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
somewhat interested in this so this is a

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.380 
somewhat interested in this so this is a
big<00:02:28.530> deal<00:02:28.740> it's<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.400> big<00:02:29.610> deal<00:02:29.820> because<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.240> goes

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
big deal it's a big deal because it goes

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.160 
big deal it's a big deal because it goes
to<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.690> heart<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.290> how<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.750> really<00:02:33.750> regenerate

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170

I assume is a growth factor kind what do
you<00:03:00.780> think<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.410> mean<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.590> think<00:03:01.980> it's

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
you think it is I mean I think it's

you think it is I mean I think it's
growth<00:03:02.400> factors<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:02.850> stimulators<00:03:03.540> they're

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
gonna make the stem cells start to grow

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.120 
gonna make the stem cells start to grow

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
but they grow into the hair follicle and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.830 
but they grow into the hair follicle and
once<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.460> have<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.580> hair<00:03:08.760> follicle<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.660> can

once you have a hair follicle you can

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.050

is that in human skin where there is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.430 
is that in human skin where there is
pigment<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.240> would<00:03:27.420> get<00:03:27.660> normal<00:03:28.110> colored

hair<00:03:28.710> worst<00:03:29.220> case<00:03:29.430> scenario<00:03:29.490> what<00:03:30.090> if<00:03:30.150> it

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
hair worst case scenario what if it

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.940 
hair worst case scenario what if it
doesn't<00:03:30.570> come<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.810> same<00:03:31.020> color<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.770> die

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
doesn't come in the same color you die

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.070 
doesn't come in the same color you die
and<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.550> one<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.850> at<00:03:32.970> 11<00:03:33.390> weeks<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:33.930> can

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
and so this one is at 11 weeks so we can

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.690 
and so this one is at 11 weeks so we can
see<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.320> coming<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.710> right<00:03:34.890> pretty<00:03:35.190> fully<00:03:35.400> did

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
see it coming in right pretty fully did

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.540 
see it coming in right pretty fully did

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.120 
it work every time or is there like some
of<00:03:38.670> these<00:03:38.730> other<00:03:39.140> medications<00:03:40.140> or<00:03:40.350> things<00:03:41.010> you

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
of these other medications or things you

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.370 
of these other medications or things you
apply<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.460> your<00:03:41.640> scalp<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.090> large<00:03:42.930> percentage

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
apply to your scalp a large percentage

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.830 
apply to your scalp a large percentage
of<00:03:43.410> people<00:03:43.470> who<00:03:43.710> don't

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
of people who don't

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.660 
of people who don't
this<00:03:45.840> works<00:03:46.140> consistently<00:03:46.680> enough<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.550> they

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
this works consistently enough that they

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.800 
this works consistently enough that they
are<00:03:47.820> convinced<00:03:48.240> they<00:03:48.360> have<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> breakthrough

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
are convinced they have a breakthrough

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.090 
are convinced they have a breakthrough
and<00:03:49.140> they<00:03:49.200> plan<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.470> bring<00:03:49.710> this<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.980> market

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
and they plan to bring this to market

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.310 
and they plan to bring this to market
and<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:50.850> how<00:03:51.120> soon<00:03:51.390> could<00:03:51.630> we<00:03:51.780> see<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.020> product

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
and so how soon could we see a product

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.170 
and so how soon could we see a product
we're<00:03:52.860> gonna<00:03:52.980> have<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.220> see<00:03:53.370> human<00:03:53.700> trials

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
we're gonna have to see human trials

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.240 
we're gonna have to see human trials
which<00:03:54.480> will<00:03:54.630> be<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.050> next<00:03:55.290> year<00:03:55.500> or<00:03:55.590> two<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.070> I

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
which will be the next year or two and I

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.340 
which will be the next year or two and I
wouldn't<00:03:56.610> be<00:03:56.730> surprised<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.330> this<00:03:57.540> would

wouldn't be surprised that this would

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.170 
wouldn't be surprised that this would
turn<00:03:58.590> out<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.830> be<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.040> market<00:03:59.370> next<00:03:59.580> 3-4
