00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
i felt like i was playing online the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.530 
i felt like i was playing online the
goalkeeper<00:02:38.950> took<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.280> penalty<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.060> AFC

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
wimbledon and he scores it so it's one
