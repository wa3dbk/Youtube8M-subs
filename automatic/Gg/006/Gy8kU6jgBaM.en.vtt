00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hey people today there is a new one 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.259
 girl monday on a theme 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.029
 what I have you for a long time 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.950
 have promised and now it finally 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.690
 do because I've researched it enough 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.849
 have tried enough on me or one 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.290
 other person and that is the topic 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.099
 which eyeshadow suits which 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.450
 eye color 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.100
 I have already noticed myself 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.600
 that if you have any of them 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.430
 have a make- up or paint with 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.960
 which always uses that your sometimes 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.820
 eyes radiate more and sometimes even 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.039
 not so and there are so many 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
 regulate what exactly which eye color emphasizes 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 I now have the eyes colors 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.769
 brown gray green and blue i took 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 Hope there is no other eye color 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.309
 I do not know, do not believe what 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.450
 should there be anything else in general? 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.430
 you can say that the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.170
 have complementary from the eye color the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.910
 eye color emphasizes you know certainly 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.340
 from art class the color circle 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.840
 that's just all the colors are drawn 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.730
 and the colors that face each other 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.020
 are the complementary colors that are 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.600
 So the colors are usually 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.430
 Bite but achieve the level effect 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.739
 that totally stings the eye parades 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 For example, the color green has the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.309
 complementary color red that is if 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 the green eyes should have you red 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.210
 Eyeshadow , that was all 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 I have something and is suitable for everyday use 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.150
 tried it a bit more 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.280
 and I show just in this video 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.110
 of course allowed is what pleases 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.460
 you can harm all the song colors 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 wear as you want this is only 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.299
 such a small one was and we catch 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.009
 just with brown if you have one 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.200
 brown eyes then has color 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.030
 Cool sounds but also very strong 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.479
 sounds very well suited for example 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.880
 I like blue turquoise purple very well 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.409
 but also a bit plumy colors 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.659
 khaki and if you still have something 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.790
 everyday use sh want then 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.170
 I also you so gray or anthracite 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.030
 recommend in the morning if I too 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.009
 beautiful with brown eyes they leave 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.630
 really beautiful on what you really radiate 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.030
 should abstain are red 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.130
 or yellowish tones for me 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.869
 especially when Braunau seen the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.939
 eyes then look very tired and sickly 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.950
 but if you play with this effect 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.600
 want something with those sickly eyes 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.380
 yes a little bit in cash or always 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 Red purple eyeshadow is still in guess 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.860
 which is a very high proportion of this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.259
 then we continue with blue 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 Blue is one of the most beautiful eye colors 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.619
 like most i find one have 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.119
 other favorite eye color but that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.429
 I'll tell you right away and the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.660
 complementary colors of blue is yellow and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.929
 which has now first a bit 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.760
 funny because I mean 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.459
 he makes himself neon yellow eyeshadow like that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.989
 I do not know about money 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.310
 or orange the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.989
 Eyeshadow is just not quite like that 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.609
 suitable for everyday use but there I have 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.560
 of course, a tip for you me 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.349
 you would be very delicate apricot 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.120
 or raisins recommend it that way 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.609
 a bit of choral sting are over 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.400
 general pink rose and you very much 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.650
 delicate light nuances that also leaves blue 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.389
 eyes radiate wonderfully and in blue 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.250
 Eyes are beautiful too 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.469
 Classic brown and beige tones 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.879
 if you have something for everyday use 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.590
 want to have you so a bit 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.909
 she wants gold too 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.069
 wonderful and a bit too 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.599
 what bronze colors and if you smokie 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.689
 I would like you to make up 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.299
 greyish ratner so black grays 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.980
 I would call you blue or green 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.750
 really guess and if you really are 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.400
 I would like to wear blue 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.560
 definitely a real strong 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.299
 Navy blue recommend as hot as to 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.400
 example up here in this palette 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.439
 that he was not so blue and so not what 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.969
 blue eyes makes this look pale 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.650
 amt still the only shade of blue which I 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.269
 would recommend you with blue eyes 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.979
 then we continue with gray 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.510
 kraushaar really a very nice one 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.139
 However, eye color does not come like that either 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.780
 often before 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.729
 I would be very silver based on that 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.379
 Eyeshadows recommend so once 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.519
 which are already silvery and in 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.590
 which maybe a bit too 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.479
 in the turquoise direction or something 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.040
 a bit in the pink direction that 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.599
 she really is very much with gray eyes 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.250
 nice and then we come already 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.019
 to the last eye color and that is 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.359
 the green and that's my favorite 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.669
 Eye color and the complementary color 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.349
 Green is red or purple 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.000
 but the whole thing goes on too 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.859
 a bit more suitable for everyday use and indeed 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.569
 suitable for everyday use are 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:51.310
 same rosÃ© tones also a bit 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.109
 What copper engraving iges can in green 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.000
 eyes look very nice and it is yes 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.060
 often so that you can still have such speckles in 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.370
 so eyes have such smaller color 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.720
 things and that's the case with green eyes 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.819
 but also so synonymous with blue.de 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.579
 Otherwise, which for example 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.409
 green eyes that are a bit yellow 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.509
 speckled I would you on 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.430
 any case he recommend to gold nice 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:14.799
 if you have the same speckles in 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.810
 such blue gray tones I would rather 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.849
 to silver tones wheel lot eye make-up 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.099
 but completely without color would like 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.690
 So without a flashy color then would 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.780
 I turn you to gray or to 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.820
 brew guessing 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.520
 and above all, I will add the motivation 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.170
 green eyes best thus act as the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.490
 I want to sting out the best too 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.960
 Definitely recommend it 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.220
 try out if the green eyes 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.720
 and what I really want you to do 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.090
 would advise against is once 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.910
 turquoise song states then yellow 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.440
 eyeshadows and general blues are 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.180
 not really that in the case of green eyes 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.130
 Best of all, which I have myself 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.410
 had to admit white blue actually 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.360
 pretty much ice eyeshadow color ever 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.530
 after how to combine them and yes 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.540
 that just does not bring mine 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.350
 eye color so really out left one 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.970
 a bit difficult 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.530
 my current eye make-up I 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.060
 also made very appropriate make-up with it 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.160
 you see what kind of effect that is 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.020
 Eyeshadow colors have on eye colors 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.850
 so i have green eyes if you have it 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.320
 I do not know yet and there I am 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.090
 just a bit too red today 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.919
 flame make-up I once made 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.470
 this kajal used here is from 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.900
 safe harbor that is just as dark 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.610
 purple tone which is also very red based 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.650
 is and I once have as one 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.270
 dashed quasi used and as 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.160
 eyeshadow I once have a whole 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.320
 neutral in my eyes not given 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.240
 then again a completely neutral in 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.250
 the crease and the whole then again 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.220
 reinforced with this sound here is 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.240
 just very similar again kajal so red 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.650
 purple tone 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.390
 I am here then my mean 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.740
 eyes world so a little one of you 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.360
 You see, what an effect that 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.789
 So that's because I have such red 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.320
 Violet tones have been used 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.270
 really that my green eyes a lot 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.100
 I like it better 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.450
 effect itself very well and me 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.160
 think the combination really synonymous 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.390
 suitable for everyday life so I would be like that 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.060
 go out and do not think so now 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.500
 especially blatant or noticeable that me 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.570
 I just like to tint with such red violet 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.000
 makeup has something quite normal not so 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.800
 usual is already my comments what 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.300
 for an eye color you would have me 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.770
 something interesting so what's the most common 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.390
 eye color is on you have one 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.680
 Eye make-up just after the makeup 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.900
 colors that I choose the right one 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.820
 Eye color would have liked to tell me 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.620
 Send this image to instagram 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.720
