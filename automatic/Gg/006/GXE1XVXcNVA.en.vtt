this is a demonstration of a htw piping
cable<00:00:07.799> locator<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.309> Model<00:00:08.670> T<00:00:10.099> 16/8<00:00:11.099> level<00:00:11.400> 19

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
cable locator of Model T 16/8 level 19

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.060 
cable locator of Model T 16/8 level 19
this<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.830> audio<00:00:14.519> locator<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:16.259> power<00:00:16.770> line

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
this is a audio locator and a power line

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790 
this is a audio locator and a power line
frequency<00:00:17.099> locator<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.930> it'll<00:00:19.349> pick<00:00:19.649> up

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
frequency locator so it'll pick up

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.859 
frequency locator so it'll pick up
either<00:00:20.009> the<00:00:21.050> signal<00:00:22.050> off<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.739> energized<00:00:23.869> 60

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
either the signal off the energized 60

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.780 
either the signal off the energized 60
Hertz<00:00:25.110> line<00:00:25.919> or<00:00:26.489> 50<00:00:26.790> Hertz<00:00:27.000> line<00:00:27.239> or<00:00:28.790> signal

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
Hertz line or 50 Hertz line or signal

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.200 
Hertz line or 50 Hertz line or signal
from<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.029> nine<00:00:30.180> ninety<00:00:30.720> point<00:00:30.930> 8<00:00:31.079> kilohertz

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
from a nine ninety point 8 kilohertz

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.650 
from a nine ninety point 8 kilohertz
converter<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.490> this<00:00:35.640> does<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.270> when<00:00:36.480> you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
converter so what this does is when you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.530 
converter so what this does is when you
plug<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:39.140> powers<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.620> device<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
plug it in it powers the device and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.130 
plug it in it powers the device and
decouples<00:00:43.610> 9.8<00:00:44.610> kilohertz<00:00:44.940> signal<00:00:45.300> down<00:00:45.900> on

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
decouples 9.8 kilohertz signal down on

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.760 
decouples 9.8 kilohertz signal down on
an<00:00:46.290> energized<00:00:46.980> line<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> big<00:00:49.380> advantage

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
an energized line now the big advantage

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.840 
an energized line now the big advantage
of<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.040> is<00:00:51.440> you'll<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.620> able<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.160> trace

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
of this is you'll be able to trace

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
of this is you'll be able to trace
energized<00:00:54.510> lines<00:00:54.870> rather<00:00:55.290> than<00:00:55.560> having<00:00:55.920> to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
energized lines rather than having to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.080 
energized lines rather than having to
power<00:00:56.310> them<00:00:56.550> off<00:00:57.290> so<00:00:58.290> what<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> do

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
power them off so what I'm going to do

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.510 
power them off so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.890> trace<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.040> cable<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
is I'm going to trace the cable that I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.010 
is I'm going to trace the cable that I
have<00:01:02.760> underground<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.900> an

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
have underground here so I have an

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510 
have underground here so I have an
outlet<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.620> a<00:01:07.650> cable<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.040> runs<00:01:08.100> under

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
outlet here and a cable that runs under

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
outlet here and a cable that runs under
the<00:01:08.550> ground<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> load<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the ground to a load so I'm going to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.450 
the ground to a load so I'm going to
trace<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.950> cable<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> load<00:01:13.460> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
trace the cable from here to the load so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.649 
trace the cable from here to the load so
all<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> plug<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> eat<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
all we do is plug this in and eat in a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.840 
all we do is plug this in and eat in a
unit<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.049> buzz<00:01:19.260> when<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> let

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
unit will buzz when it's on just to let

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.350 
unit will buzz when it's on just to let
you<00:01:20.940> know<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.240> turn<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.060> now<00:01:24.180> we're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you know that a turn so right now we're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.510 
you know that a turn so right now we're
sending<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.750> signal<00:01:25.440> down<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> line<00:01:28.460> this<00:01:29.460> is

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
sending a signal down the line this is

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
sending a signal down the line this is
the<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.420> receiver<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:32.130> receiver<00:01:33.560> has

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the the receiver and the receiver has

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.210 
the the receiver and the receiver has
three<00:01:34.860> modes<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.340> operation<00:01:37.010> one<00:01:38.010> for

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
three modes of operation one for

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.780 
three modes of operation one for
energized<00:01:38.640> lines<00:01:39.830> two<00:01:40.830> for<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:43.170> very<00:01:43.530> long

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
energized lines two for a very long

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.240 
energized lines two for a very long
frequency<00:01:44.790> line<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:46.229> third<00:01:46.890> option

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
frequency line and and a third option

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.550 
frequency line and and a third option
for<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.119> nine<00:01:48.270> point<00:01:48.510> eight<00:01:48.600> kilohertz<00:01:49.049> so

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
for the nine point eight kilohertz so

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.859 
for the nine point eight kilohertz so
we're<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> leave<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.130> three<00:01:50.869> because

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
we're going to leave it on three because

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.300 
we're going to leave it on three because
we're<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.290> tracing<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> 9<00:01:52.890> point<00:01:53.100> 8

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
we're going to be tracing a 9 point 8

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.319 
we're going to be tracing a 9 point 8
kilohertz

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.730 

so<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.450> first<00:01:58.659> thing<00:01:58.780> we<00:01:58.899> do<00:01:59.079> is<00:01:59.289> a<00:01:59.320> button

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
so the first thing we do is a button

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.370 
so the first thing we do is a button
underneath<00:02:00.280> here<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:01.869> going<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.079> press<00:02:02.229> the

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
underneath here we're going to press the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.289 
underneath here we're going to press the
button<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.460> hold<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.030> weight<00:02:04.179> of

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
button and you hold it and the weight of

00:02:04.299 --> 00:04:19.300 
button and you hold it and the weight of
the<00:02:04.420> unit<00:02:04.750> keep<00:02:05.679> seeing<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:10.680> signal

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.379 

put<00:04:20.310> this<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.579> one<00:04:20.759> and<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:22.910> 50<00:04:23.910> or<00:04:24.030> 60

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
put this in one and this is the 50 or 60

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.279 
put this in one and this is the 50 or 60
Hertz<00:04:24.419> mode<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:26.720> don't<00:04:27.720> have<00:04:27.810> an<00:04:27.930> underground

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
Hertz mode I don't have an underground

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.730 
Hertz mode I don't have an underground
cable<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:29.160> we<00:04:29.280> can<00:04:29.460> see<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.110> on<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.530> mains
