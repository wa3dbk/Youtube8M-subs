 10 I'm just putting together the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.960
 secrets that to my point of view that to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.149
 my opinion are the best there is in 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.940
 every game I was watching your comments 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.059

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.230
 to be going up and I'll be 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 showing secrets not only of gta 5 as 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.010
 I commented on the last video but already I already 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.589
 I'm going to shut up let's start with the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.859
 secrets that are great they have 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.769
 all double references rainbow bears 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.019
 giants blah blah blah blah we started 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.269
 the first secret we're going to see is a 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.519
 reference to the viral video called dabul 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.620
 rainbow translated as double rainbow 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 where this guy who sees an arch leaves 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.070
 double iris which is very strange and it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.770
 starts orgasm and arlo starts screaming 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.119
 all rainbows shit do not shit because 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.930
 I would also shit has been a double 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.340
 rainbow 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.620
 below I'll leave the video link 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 viral if you have not seen it since 2011 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.300
 what happens here is that they make a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.950
 reference only that instead of it being a 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.950
 weyes claptrap listen to it 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.090
 two 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 do not tell me that there is no file 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.040
 this secret because it is of eggs the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.830
 next secret we have is a 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.650
 reference to our favorite bat 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.380
 the flying ali is a dick Batman 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.330
 batman a batman no habar hand no beard 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.480
 do not batman here we are seeing that this 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.430
 character is called rack man is not batman 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.650
 literally that's why it's a reference 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.100
 the first time you come across it says 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.720
 rahman begins not batman begins and if you 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.420
 you bump it again after passing the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.330
 game is called rock man forever and batman 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.220
 forever it makes me super cool that 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.470
 the people who develop the games go 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.630
 putting references then to superheroes 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.160
 famous mostly to batman that for me 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.050
 is one of the best superheroes that 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.030
 I do not know if you do not like comments 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.160

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.810

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.550
 you tell me down which one you like me 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.709
 like batman talking about references 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.540
 now let's see one addressed to 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.220
 game so that you know that I 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.769
 I'm a fan of this game to me 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.810
 fascinates and in borderlands 2 we find 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.300
 these two characters that is the lord 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.220
 bubbles so they say the tirol sisters 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.180
 for those who have already played and here 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.829
 call mister 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.709
 what is a reference that in English 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.049
 good is the big daddy and we also see the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.359
 alirón sister who is called lille sis that 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.950
 it's like a little pirate the boy of 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.719
 this in addition to that makes a clear 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.879
 reference if references do not go 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:20.159
 because you moron I miss 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.590

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.750

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.180
 daddy or Mr. pon step Mr. 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.250
 balls without touching alirón sister is going to 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.450
 give a weapon that is legendary good not 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.609
 it's so legendary but it's a weapon 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.530
 special that hurt is quite 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.299
 good the next secret probably 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.980
 You already saw it in my 50,000 special 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.769
 subs but I want to put it back 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.629

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.939
 to the minecraft game how are you watching 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.889

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.540
 the stone blocks appear and 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.459
 end you will run into a few 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.010
 clippers that kill you will leave you 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.079
 weapons related to the game skins and 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.000

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.379

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.010
 story but it's cool and here's a 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.660
 reference in borderlands 2 and finally 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.480

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.050
