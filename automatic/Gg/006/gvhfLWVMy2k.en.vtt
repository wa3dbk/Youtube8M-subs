 It's all mixed up in the flour. Now we 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.949
 Let's put a tablespoon of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.949

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 full of riches and milk brigadier 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.479
 So it's very little then. 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.430
 that it will work is a canoe 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.430
 had with the farofa a bass 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.110
 did a little digging now you're going to put 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.039
 about four medium bananas chopped 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.990
 OK 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.390
 hands that you can stay the way you 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.790

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.660
 It can not be painful. 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:31.520

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.580

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.330
