like that so when you're not gaming but

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.619 
like that so when you're not gaming but
then<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> falls<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:44.579> back<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
then it falls right back and then it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.490 
then it falls right back and then it
folds<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.910> adjust<00:00:48.500> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
folds like this to to just adjust and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.610 
folds like this to to just adjust and
then<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:49.800> also<00:00:50.570> expand<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.260> both

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620

know
two<00:02:12.860> feet<00:02:13.129> this<00:02:13.909> is<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> controls<00:02:14.569> for<00:02:14.689> it<00:02:15.010> um

let me just walk you through all these

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.839 
let me just walk you through all these
controls<00:02:18.079> this<00:02:18.799> is<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.040> base<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.579> can<00:02:19.700> adjust

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
controls this is the base you can adjust

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.410 
controls this is the base you can adjust
that<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.659> that<00:02:21.319> makes<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:22.489> bigger<00:02:22.909> base<00:02:23.180> for

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
that and that makes a bigger base for

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.660 
that and that makes a bigger base for
the<00:02:23.480> explosions<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.500> other<00:02:24.980> stuff<00:02:25.459> like<00:02:25.640> that

the explosions and other stuff like that
so<00:02:26.599> that's<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.840> base<00:02:27.049> as<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.129> it<00:02:28.430> has

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
so that's the base as that and it has

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.660 
so that's the base as that and it has
game<00:02:29.090> was<00:02:29.930> just<00:02:29.959> adjust<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> volume<00:02:30.799> on<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.599 
so you can't hear them over the game
sound<00:02:59.599> and<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.900> does<00:03:00.079> have<00:03:00.260> chat<00:03:00.560> boost<00:03:00.829> so<00:03:01.519> it

sound and it does have chat boost so it

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:02.979 
sound and it does have chat boost so it
automatically<00:03:02.180> as<00:03:02.389> the<00:03:02.569> game<00:03:02.810> brought

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
automatically as the game brought

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.800 
automatically as the game brought
fluctuates<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.549> chat<00:03:05.150> volume<00:03:05.599> also

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810

fluctuates the chat volume also
fluctuates<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.920> up<00:03:07.099> with<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.549> stuff<00:03:07.849> so

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
fluctuates like up with it and stuff so

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.509 
fluctuates like up with it and stuff so

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
that's good we can also adjust it and

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.190 
that's good we can also adjust it and
then<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:10.879> expander<00:03:11.750> off<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.109> on

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
then this is the expander off and on

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.990 
then this is the expander off and on
don't<00:03:12.829> know<00:03:13.010> what<00:03:13.099> that<00:03:13.129> does<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:13.639> I<00:03:13.700> keep<00:03:13.879> it

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
don't know what that does but I keep it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.319 
don't know what that does but I keep it
on<00:03:14.150> they<00:03:14.569> kind<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.840> get<00:03:14.959> some<00:03:15.170> staticky<00:03:15.769> way

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
on they kind of get some staticky way

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.530 
on they kind of get some staticky way
static<00:03:17.329> miss<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:18.230> then<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.980> has<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.970> mic<00:03:20.209> mute

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
static miss and then it has the mic mute

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.119 
static miss and then it has the mic mute
so<00:03:20.870> if<00:03:21.109> you<00:03:21.260> don't<00:03:21.410> be<00:03:21.590> talking<00:03:21.949> to<00:03:22.010> anybody

controller<00:03:48.199> but<00:03:49.099> on<00:03:49.190> ps3<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:49.909> I<00:03:49.940> don't<00:03:50.359> need

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
controller but on ps3 so I don't need

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.199 
controller but on ps3 so I don't need
that<00:03:50.659> and<00:03:51.349> then<00:03:52.069> this<00:03:52.159> all<00:03:52.370> sizes<00:03:52.579> of<00:03:52.819> the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
that and then this all sizes of the

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.589 
that and then this all sizes of the

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
decay bhakta tickle and as a 16 foot

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.589 
decay bhakta tickle and as a 16 foot
cable<00:03:57.139> so<00:03:57.319> it's<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.560> very<00:03:57.590> generous<00:03:58.400> as<00:03:58.729> you<00:03:59.329> can

see I said then after that 16 feet of
cable<00:04:03.199> well<00:04:04.190> mine<00:04:04.459> goes<00:04:04.639> a<00:04:04.669> little<00:04:04.790> bit<00:04:04.909> long

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
cable well mine goes a little bit long

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.659 
cable well mine goes a little bit long
ago<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.479> then<00:04:05.569> to<00:04:05.690> split<00:04:06.549> into<00:04:07.549> USB<00:04:08.180> um<00:04:09.669> to

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
ago and then to split into USB um to

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.659 
ago and then to split into USB um to
plug<00:04:10.879> into<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.090> game<00:04:11.329> console<00:04:11.810> pc<00:04:12.139> or<00:04:12.409> mac<00:04:12.669> so

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
plug into a game console pc or mac so

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.879 
plug into a game console pc or mac so
not<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.299> plug<00:04:14.479> in<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:14.930> then<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.590> goes<00:04:15.769> the

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
not so you plug in and then it goes the

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.909 
not so you plug in and then it goes the
headphone<00:04:16.280> jack<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:17.709> before<00:04:18.709> i<00:04:18.739> get<00:04:18.889> into

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
headphone jack and before i get into

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.390 
headphone jack and before i get into
that<00:04:19.130> this<00:04:19.489> is<00:04:19.669> one<00:04:19.970> more<00:04:20.150> while<00:04:20.329> comes<00:04:20.659> with

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
that this is one more while comes with

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.420 
that this is one more while comes with
its<00:04:22.719> headphone<00:04:23.719> jack<00:04:24.020> as<00:04:24.349> you<00:04:25.279> can

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
its headphone jack as you can

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.189 
its headphone jack as you can
see<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:26.150> you<00:04:26.210> would<00:04:26.360> plug<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.870> headphone<00:04:27.169> jack

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
see so you would plug the headphone jack

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.909 
see so you would plug the headphone jack
into<00:04:27.710> this<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:29.050> then<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.229> other<00:04:30.259> end<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.800> this

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
into this and then the other end of this

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.279 
into this and then the other end of this
is<00:04:31.449> component<00:04:32.449> cables<00:04:32.900> but<00:04:33.050> it's<00:04:33.169> like<00:04:33.259> a

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
is component cables but it's like a

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.719 
is component cables but it's like a
bypass<00:04:33.889> so<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:34.940> plug<00:04:35.210> this<00:04:35.479> even<00:04:36.460> if<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.610> use

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
bypass so you plug this even if you use

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.659 
bypass so you plug this even if you use
some<00:04:37.880> component<00:04:38.360> cables<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:38.750> plug<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.669> from

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
some component cables you plug this from

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.029 
some component cables you plug this from
your<00:04:40.789> ps3<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.509> do<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.080> then<00:04:42.289> the<00:04:42.470> TV<00:04:42.800> and

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
your ps3 and do this and then the TV and

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.730 
your ps3 and do this and then the TV and
it<00:04:43.789> gets<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.120> sound<00:04:44.419> or<00:04:44.780> if<00:04:45.259> you're<00:04:45.380> not<00:04:45.500> using

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
it gets the sound or if you're not using

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.560 
it gets the sound or if you're not using
component<00:04:46.370> cables<00:04:46.729> there's<00:04:47.090> two<00:04:47.270> things<00:04:47.419> you

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
component cables there's two things you

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.510 
component cables there's two things you
can<00:04:47.720> do<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:48.050> can<00:04:48.470> just<00:04:48.770> plug<00:04:48.979> this<00:04:49.100> into<00:04:49.310> the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
can do you can just plug this into the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.270 
can do you can just plug this into the
audio<00:04:49.850> out<00:04:50.090> on<00:04:50.479> your<00:04:50.660> TV<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:51.139> then<00:04:51.830> go<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.009> this

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
audio out on your TV and then go to this

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.659 
audio out on your TV and then go to this
which<00:04:52.580> I<00:04:52.820> would<00:04:53.060> use<00:04:53.270> my<00:04:53.300> TB<00:04:53.780> hat<00:04:53.930> had<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:55.009> but

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
which I would use my TB hat had that but

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.689 
which I would use my TB hat had that but
what<00:04:55.820> I<00:04:55.850> found<00:04:56.090> out<00:04:56.419> is<00:04:56.600> that<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:57.199> use<00:04:57.949> hdmi<00:04:58.460> so

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
what I found out is that I use hdmi so

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.820 
what I found out is that I use hdmi so
this<00:04:59.000> would<00:04:59.150> be<00:04:59.180> only<00:04:59.389> for<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.810> audio<00:05:00.320> out<00:05:00.500> and

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
this would be only for the audio out and

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.999 
this would be only for the audio out and
audio<00:05:01.130> in<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:02.690> i<00:05:02.720> use<00:05:03.050> hdmi<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.800> can<00:05:03.919> do

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
audio in so i use hdmi so you can do

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.129 
audio in so i use hdmi so you can do
that<00:05:04.190> or<00:05:04.639> what<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.150> can<00:05:05.270> do<00:05:05.389> is<00:05:05.539> just<00:05:05.570> unplug

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
what i do and now the built quality of

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.839 
what i do and now the built quality of
these<00:05:24.349> headsets<00:05:24.710> are<00:05:24.860> very<00:05:25.070> nice<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:25.639> when<00:05:25.820> i

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
these headsets are very nice like when i

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.850 
these headsets are very nice like when i
picked<00:05:26.330> them<00:05:26.479> up<00:05:26.599> the<00:05:26.810> first<00:05:27.050> time<00:05:27.320> I<00:05:27.590> thought

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
picked them up the first time I thought

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.010 
picked them up the first time I thought
the<00:05:28.099> very<00:05:28.610> lightweight<00:05:28.849> and<00:05:29.630> I<00:05:29.750> thought<00:05:29.900> that

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
the very lightweight and I thought that

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.719 
the very lightweight and I thought that
