to<00:00:47.190> say<00:00:47.399> you're<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> fast<00:00:48.000> because

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
to say you're on a fast because

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.869 
to say you're on a fast because
traditionally<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.079> means<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.410> go<00:00:49.590> without

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
traditionally that means you go without

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.920 
traditionally that means you go without
whereas<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.390> we're<00:00:51.510> doing<00:00:51.780> with

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
whereas I think what we're doing with

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
whereas I think what we're doing with
the<00:00:52.020> juice<00:00:52.230> fast<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.190> giving<00:00:53.399> your

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the juice fast is actually giving your

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
the juice fast is actually giving your
body<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.090> nutrients<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.629> needs<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.620> gonna

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
body the nutrients it needs so I'm gonna

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.720 
body the nutrients it needs so I'm gonna
have<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.610> come<00:00:56.670> up

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
have a think of see if I can come up

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.130 
have a think of see if I can come up
with<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.940> better<00:00:57.059> phrase<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> say<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:57.989> get

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
