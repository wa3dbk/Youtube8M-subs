coming<00:02:41.110> through<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.500> hood<00:02:41.620> because<00:02:42.010> it's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
coming through the hood because it's

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.100 
coming through the hood because it's

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
can to go fast but in the case of the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.940 
can to go fast but in the case of the
Ranchero<00:02:57.780> although<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.840> did<00:02:59.140> remove<00:02:59.560> the

rear seat the rear decklid
the<00:03:02.590> rear<00:03:02.769> glass<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.640> all<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.360> extra<00:03:05.049> weight

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
the rear glass and all that extra weight

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.949 
the rear glass and all that extra weight
that<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.560> Torino<00:03:05.980> had<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:07.239> didn't<00:03:07.569> benefit

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
that the Torino had it didn't benefit

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.990 
that the Torino had it didn't benefit
quite<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.410> much<00:03:08.590> because<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.489> lost<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.880> lot

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
quite that much because you lost a lot

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.210 
quite that much because you lost a lot
of<00:03:10.030> traction<00:03:10.590> these<00:03:11.590> things<00:03:11.799> made<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> whole

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
of traction these things made a whole

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.449 
of traction these things made a whole
bunch<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.610> torque<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.920> 428<00:03:14.920> Cobra<00:03:15.280> Jet

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
bunch of torque that 428 Cobra Jet

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.070 
bunch of torque that 428 Cobra Jet
engine<00:03:16.030> made<00:03:16.290> 335<00:03:17.290> horsepower<00:03:17.560> at<00:03:18.660> 5200<00:03:19.660> rpm

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
engine made 335 horsepower at 5200 rpm

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.539 
engine made 335 horsepower at 5200 rpm
and<00:03:21.269> 440<00:03:22.269> foot-pounds<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.900> torque<00:03:22.959> at<00:03:23.560> 3400

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
and 440 foot-pounds of torque at 3400

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.979 
and 440 foot-pounds of torque at 3400
rpm<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.140> was<00:03:26.319> enough<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.680> smoke<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.340> tires

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
rpm so it was enough to smoke the tires

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.420 
rpm so it was enough to smoke the tires
completely<00:03:28.989> off<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.320> rims<00:03:29.560> if<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:29.890> wanted<00:03:30.220> to

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
completely off the rims if you wanted to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.390 
completely off the rims if you wanted to
because<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.180> rear<00:03:32.049> bed<00:03:32.350> just<00:03:33.100> didn't

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
because that rear bed just didn't

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.940 
because that rear bed just didn't
provide<00:03:33.670> any<00:03:33.730> weight<00:03:34.209> attraction<00:03:35.140> but<00:03:35.590> what

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
provide any weight attraction but what

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.349 
provide any weight attraction but what
you<00:03:36.070> gained<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.579> something<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.180> could

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
you gained is something that you could

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.660 
you gained is something that you could
actually<00:03:37.390> use

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.520
