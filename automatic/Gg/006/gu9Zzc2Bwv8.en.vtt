00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
at the bottom to unlock it and then turn

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.729 
at the bottom to unlock it and then turn
back<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.850> lock<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.840> what<00:02:28.230> I'll<00:02:28.470> show<00:02:28.680> you

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
back to lock it so what I'll show you

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.720 
back to lock it so what I'll show you
how<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.250> works<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.690> grab<00:02:31.260> your<00:02:31.620> DSLR<00:02:32.459> it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
how it works you just grab your DSLR it

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.840 
how it works you just grab your DSLR it
gets<00:02:32.940> hot<00:02:33.180> shoe<00:02:33.480> right<00:02:33.720> here<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.950> place<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.670> in

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.150 

first<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.030> unscrew<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.750> course<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.590> then

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
first you unscrew it of course and then

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.280 
first you unscrew it of course and then
you<00:02:41.280> place<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.090> then<00:02:42.569> use<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> screw<00:02:43.230> it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
you place it in and then use a screw it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.650 
you place it in and then use a screw it
back<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:44.220> you're<00:02:44.610> set<00:02:44.880> what<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.510> do

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
back and you're set what you have to do

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.930 
back and you're set what you have to do
of<00:02:45.810> course<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.170> charge<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.980> battery<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.519> an

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
of course is charge a battery is an

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.720 
of course is charge a battery is an
on/off<00:02:48.660> switch<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.230> side<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:51.080> also<00:02:52.080> a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
on/off switch on the side and also a

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.970 
on/off switch on the side and also a
dimmer<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.870> strongest<00:02:55.500> lighting

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
dimmer so this is the strongest lighting

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.130 
dimmer so this is the strongest lighting
and<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> lowest<00:02:57.269> lighting<00:02:57.810> which<00:02:57.989> is

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
and this is the lowest lighting which is

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.870 
and this is the lowest lighting which is
a<00:02:58.170> really<00:02:58.410> little<00:02:58.620> option<00:02:59.070> pretty<00:02:59.370> much<00:02:59.610> here

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
a really little option pretty much here

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.170 
a really little option pretty much here
so<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.570> quite<00:03:00.750> easy<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.140> shake<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.790> open

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
so it's quite easy to shake you open

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.960 
so it's quite easy to shake you open
these<00:03:03.360> barn<00:03:03.750> doors<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:05.160> get<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.489> initial

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
these barn doors and you get the initial

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.940 
these barn doors and you get the initial
lighting<00:03:06.360> straight<00:03:06.630> away<00:03:06.930> which<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.739> going<00:03:07.890> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
lighting straight away which is going to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.380 
lighting straight away which is going to
be<00:03:08.010> bright<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.610> I'm<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.880> going<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.120> turn<00:03:09.269> it

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
be bright so I'm just going to turn it

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.120 
be bright so I'm just going to turn it
this<00:03:09.510> way<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:10.280> yeah<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:12.530> that's<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.709> initial

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
this way and yeah so that's the initial

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.729 
this way and yeah so that's the initial
lighting<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.480> at<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.290> strongest

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
lighting and this is at the strongest

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.280 
lighting and this is at the strongest
level<00:03:16.950> I'm<00:03:17.820> not<00:03:18.060> facing<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.630> at<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> camera

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
level I'm not facing it at the camera

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.050 
level I'm not facing it at the camera
because<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.859> a<00:03:20.010> bit<00:03:20.220> too<00:03:20.400> bright<00:03:20.670> for<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
because it's a bit too bright for the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.340 
because it's a bit too bright for the
camera<00:03:21.480> don't<00:03:22.140> want<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.590> die<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.549> then

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
camera don't want it to die and then

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.509 
camera don't want it to die and then
yeah<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.590> use<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.100> bundles

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
yeah you can just use the bundles

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.580 
yeah you can just use the bundles
whatever<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.269> want<00:03:27.510> with<00:03:27.959> them<00:03:28.140> these<00:03:28.440> are

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590

yeah they have this orange colored one

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.930 
yeah they have this orange colored one
which<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.230> initially<00:03:35.800> thought<00:03:35.830> was<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.730> why

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
which I initially thought was like why

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.940 
which I initially thought was like why
would<00:03:37.120> anyone<00:03:37.330> use<00:03:37.450> an<00:03:37.750> are<00:03:37.900> each<00:03:38.110> one<00:03:38.350> but<00:03:38.860> it

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
would anyone use an are each one but it

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.070 
would anyone use an are each one but it
actually<00:03:39.190> gives<00:03:39.670> off<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> nice<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.600> skin<00:03:40.840> tone

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
actually gives off a nice and skin tone

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.100 
actually gives off a nice and skin tone
so<00:03:41.680> i'll<00:03:42.670> just<00:03:42.730> show<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.210> guys<00:03:43.450> how<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.900> looks

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
so what I've done is set the ISO to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.140 
so what I've done is set the ISO to
order<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:49.180> closed<00:03:49.990> on<00:03:50.200> my<00:03:50.320> cones<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.250> it

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
order and it's closed on my cones and it

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.870 
order and it's closed on my cones and it
has<00:03:52.690> actually<00:03:53.260> automatically<00:03:53.890> gone<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.460> so

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
has actually automatically gone to I so

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.150 
has actually automatically gone to I so

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
I'll show you guys how it looks with the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.310 
I'll show you guys how it looks with the
lights<00:03:57.640> this<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.210> with<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.660> light<00:03:58.870> fully

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
lights this is with the light fully

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.670 
lights this is with the light fully
powered<00:04:00.040> on<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.180> really<00:04:01.630> bright<00:04:02.200> I<00:04:02.470> can

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
powered on it is really bright I can

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.730 
powered on it is really bright I can
barely<00:04:02.830> see<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.670> camera<00:04:03.940> right<00:04:04.330> now<00:04:04.390> so<00:04:05.230> I'm

barely see the camera right now so I'm

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.890 
barely see the camera right now so I'm
sure<00:04:06.130> I'm<00:04:06.280> really<00:04:06.700> washed<00:04:06.940> out<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:07.630> it's<00:04:07.750> too

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
sure I'm really washed out and it's too

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.410 
sure I'm really washed out and it's too
bad<00:04:08.080> this<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.500> really<00:04:08.530> great<00:04:09.100> lighting<00:04:09.520> for<00:04:10.000> if

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
bad this is really great lighting for if

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
at night it will actually try it with

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.170 
at night it will actually try it with
the<00:04:16.780> diffuses<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:17.739> is<00:04:17.890> with<00:04:18.130> both<00:04:18.700> red<00:04:19.150> and

orange and white diffuses a highest

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.840 
orange and white diffuses a highest
brightness<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:24.910> saw<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.900> hundred<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:27.190> I

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
brightness and I saw a hundred so I

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.510 
brightness and I saw a hundred so I
can't<00:04:28.690> really<00:04:28.900> tell<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:29.980> what<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.250> looks<00:04:30.400> like

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
can't really tell you what it looks like

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.960 
can't really tell you what it looks like
right<00:04:30.580> now<00:04:30.970> but<00:04:31.500> I'm<00:04:32.500> sure<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.950> looks<00:04:33.130> good<00:04:33.460> it

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
right now but I'm sure it looks good it

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.660 
right now but I'm sure it looks good it
may<00:04:34.240> have<00:04:34.300> make<00:04:34.630> my<00:04:34.840> skin<00:04:35.110> look<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.380> bit<00:04:35.670> oily

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
may have make my skin look a bit oily

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.090 
may have make my skin look a bit oily
because<00:04:37.090> it's<00:04:37.300> like<00:04:37.480> really<00:04:37.660> bright<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.710> what

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
because it's like really bright so what

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.590 
because it's like really bright so what
I<00:04:39.130> recommend<00:04:39.280> is<00:04:39.820> like<00:04:39.970> they're<00:04:40.150> turning<00:04:40.480> down

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
I recommend is like they're turning down

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.390 
I recommend is like they're turning down
the<00:04:40.810> place<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.200> you'll<00:04:41.440> have<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.650> find<00:04:41.980> wish

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
the place so you'll have to find wish

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.210 
the place so you'll have to find wish
setting<00:04:42.880> suits<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.990> best<00:04:44.020> but<00:04:44.890> at<00:04:45.040> the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
setting suits you the best but at the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.100 
setting suits you the best but at the
moment<00:04:45.370> i<00:04:45.640> think<00:04:45.880> this<00:04:46.120> setting<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.900> best

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
moment i think this setting is the best

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.550 
moment i think this setting is the best
for<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.500> iso<00:04:48.010> is<00:04:48.190> at<00:04:48.370> 100<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.540> lighting<00:04:50.440> is

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
for the iso is at 100 the lighting is

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.320 
for the iso is at 100 the lighting is
turned<00:04:50.860> out<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.280> about<00:04:51.340> me<00:04:51.760> going<00:04:52.090> but<00:04:52.210> the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
turned out to about me going but the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.500 
turned out to about me going but the
orange<00:04:52.720> diffuser

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
orange diffuser

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.430 
orange diffuser
as<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.800> give<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.310> Warner<00:04:57.030> feel<00:04:57.270> because<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
as to give a Warner feel because the

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.010 
as to give a Warner feel because the
LEDs<00:04:58.950> do<00:04:59.280> give<00:04:59.490> up<00:04:59.640> a<00:04:59.820> bluish<00:05:00.300> tinge<00:05:02.960> yeah<00:05:03.960> you

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
LEDs do give up a bluish tinge yeah you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.900 
LEDs do give up a bluish tinge yeah you
can<00:05:04.260> just<00:05:04.290> use<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.830> wipe<00:05:05.100> it<00:05:05.370> really<00:05:05.580> depends

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
can just use the wipe it really depends

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.730

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
just filmed with no lighting in this

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
lighting so if you do want an even more

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.990 
lighting so if you do want an even more
natural<00:05:19.710> color<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.220> would<00:05:20.310> definitely<00:05:20.610> have

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
natural color you would definitely have

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
natural color you would definitely have
to<00:05:21.150> get<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.360> few<00:05:21.810> more<00:05:22.400> Lighting's<00:05:23.400> like

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
to get a few more Lighting's like

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.290 
to get a few more Lighting's like
surroundings<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.470> because<00:05:26.340> because<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.210> the

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
surroundings and because because of the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.410 
surroundings and because because of the
front<00:05:27.600> on<00:05:27.980> lie<00:05:28.980> you<00:05:29.340> always<00:05:29.790> get<00:05:29.970> shadows

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
front on lie you always get shadows

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.030 
front on lie you always get shadows
behind<00:05:30.660> you<00:05:31.050> so<00:05:32.420> that's<00:05:33.420> fine<00:05:33.660> in<00:05:33.810> most

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
behind you so that's fine in most

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
situations I'm so most of you don't even

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.390
