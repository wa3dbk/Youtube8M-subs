 the church of santiago apostol viva 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.760
 sample of the Valencian baroque 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.530
 the orchard park combines waterfalls 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.530
 and gardens 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.470
 At the entrance to the park, the

 bust of miguel hernÃ¡ndez 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.579
 reminds us that we are in a stage of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.759
 the path of the poet cultural path that 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.280
 unites the populations of orihuela and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.280
 Albatera Albacete and Alicante

 in the park of the garden also 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.810
 we will find the modern auditorium on the air 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.790
 free of the people capable of welcoming even 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.880
 three thousand people 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.710
 its unique cover is designed to 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.710
 enhance the voice of the declaimers 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.090
 but dail is more in its term a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.260
 irrigated agriculture combines the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.319
 vegetables with fruit farms 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.780
 pomegranate 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.780
 citrus figs 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.799
 this agricultural activity alternates with 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.799
 trade and services 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.380
 water from irrigation is contributed to 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.780
 the fields by a branch of the transfer 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.780
 chop-sure that crosses the term 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.489
 the channeled water does not hide an environment 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.489
 original arid 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:18.239
 this semi-desert ecosystem is ideal 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.239
 for the proliferation of esparto 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.470
 the plant is manipulated since ancient times by 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:32.970
 the alba terence is for the elaboration 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.970
 of alpargatas baskets and ropes 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.290
 this traditional trade is maintained in 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.290
 the hands of a few artisans 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.790
 in the middle of the apparent desert is 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.790
 the salty rambla 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.010
 it is a set of puddles 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.270
 communicated between them with a very high 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.270
 concentration of salts in the water 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.400
 a journey marked with aid in the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.889
 more complicated steps indicates the path 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.280
 to continue to evolve by this 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.389
 so unique landscape of ravines and 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.389
 ramblas to men
