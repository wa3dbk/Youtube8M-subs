answer them in a clear concise way so
let's<00:00:18.449> stop<00:00:18.869> yapping<00:00:19.380> let's<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:19.980> down

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
let's stop yapping let's get right down

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.290 
let's stop yapping let's get right down
to<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.490> nitty-gritty

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
to the nitty-gritty

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.370 
to the nitty-gritty
yo<00:00:22.880> how<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.150> know<00:00:24.330> how<00:00:24.660> much<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.900> each

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
yo how do you know how much of each

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.230 
yo how do you know how much of each
macro<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.939> largely

macro is right for you is it largely

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.939 
macro is right for you is it largely
trial<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.779> error<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.260> good<00:00:28.410> question

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
trial and error this is a good question

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.820 
trial and error this is a good question
because<00:00:29.310> mainly<00:00:29.580> referring<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> energy

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
because mainly referring to the energy

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.389 
because mainly referring to the energy
macro<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:31.949> we're<00:00:32.070> talking<00:00:32.309> about

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
macro so we're talking about

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.520 
macro so we're talking about
carbohydrates<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.390> fat<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:34.050> ratios<00:00:34.500> should

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
carbohydrates and fat what ratios should

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.709 
carbohydrates and fat what ratios should
you<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> both/and<00:00:35.790> anyone<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.540> says

you have a both/and anyone that says

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
you have a both/and anyone that says
there<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> some<00:00:37.230> sort<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> golden<00:00:37.860> ratio<00:00:38.129> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
there is some sort of golden ratio that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
there is some sort of golden ratio that
works<00:00:38.430> right<00:00:38.610> everyone<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.270> lying<00:00:39.629> what

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
works right everyone is lying what

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.569 
works right everyone is lying what
you'll<00:00:40.410> notice<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.829> time<00:00:41.040> there's<00:00:41.250> certain

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you'll notice with time there's certain

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.400 
you'll notice with time there's certain
individuals<00:00:42.090> those<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.450> better<00:00:42.870> genetics

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
individuals those with better genetics

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
individuals those with better genetics
they<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.649> handle<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.309> carbohydrates<00:00:45.149> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
they can handle more carbohydrates in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.299 
they can handle more carbohydrates in
their<00:00:45.390> total<00:00:45.750> diet<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.100> are

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
their total diet and so when they are

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
their total diet and so when they are
dieting<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.090> when<00:00:48.239> they're<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> lean<00:00:49.020> mass

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
dieting or when they're on the lean mass

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.779 
dieting or when they're on the lean mass
pace<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.680> consume<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
pace they can consume more if on the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.790 
pace they can consume more if on the
other<00:00:50.910> hand<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.329> find<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.930> yourself<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
other hand you find for yourself and it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470 
other hand you find for yourself and it
doesn't<00:00:52.829> work<00:00:53.309> right<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.329> lay

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
doesn't work right for you you can lay

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
doesn't work right for you you can lay
too<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:54.899> fat<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.949> tweak<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> slowly

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
too much fat you have to tweak it slowly

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
too much fat you have to tweak it slowly
over<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.719> said<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.170> compare

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
over time and like I said if we compare

the person it's something that over time
as<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.520> body<00:01:11.790> develops<00:01:12.420> you'll<00:01:12.780> notice

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
as your body develops you'll notice

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
as your body develops you'll notice
changes<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.189> what<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> will<00:01:14.520> say<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.299> build

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
changes and what I will say as you build

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.749 
changes and what I will say as you build
more<00:01:15.689> muscle<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.740> activity<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
more muscle as you do more activity the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.429 
more muscle as you do more activity the
split<00:01:18.090> between<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.479> two<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:19.110> favour

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
split between the two will favour

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
split between the two will favour
carbohydrates<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.790> let's<00:01:21.180> say<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.450> kind

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
carbohydrates so if let's say it's kind

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.969 
carbohydrates so if let's say it's kind
of<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:22.350> time<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> build

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of like this over time as you build

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
of like this over time as you build
muscle<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> become<00:01:23.970> fitter<00:01:24.420> you'll

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
muscle and if you become fitter you'll

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
muscle and if you become fitter you'll
notice<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.409> you'll<00:01:25.530> probably<00:01:25.799> use<00:01:25.979> more

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
notice that you'll probably use more

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.840 
notice that you'll probably use more
carbohydrates<00:01:27.299> need<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.840> carbohydrates

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
carbohydrates need more carbohydrates

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.060

strength<00:01:44.009> from<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.549> working<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
strength from that is working on that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.270 
strength from that is working on that
pattern<00:01:45.630> English<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> recommend<00:01:46.860> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
pattern English so what I recommend is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
pattern English so what I recommend is
the<00:01:47.549> Bradford<00:01:48.299> press<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.840> exercise

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the Bradford press and exercise

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
the Bradford press and exercise
developed<00:01:49.680> specifically<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.579> purpose

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
developed specifically for that purpose

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
developed specifically for that purpose
I'm<00:01:51.360> gonna<00:01:51.570> link<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> description<00:01:52.530> how

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
I'm gonna link it in the description how

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160 
I'm gonna link it in the description how
to<00:01:53.070> do<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.490> essentially<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.240> bring<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> up

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
to do it but essentially you bring it up

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.080 
to do it but essentially you bring it up
above<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> head<00:01:55.890> behind<00:01:56.280> your<00:01:56.610> head<00:01:56.700> back

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
above the head behind your head back

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.929 
above the head behind your head back
down<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> over<00:01:57.990> again<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> Bradford<00:01:59.310> press

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
down and over again the Bradford press

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.840 
down and over again the Bradford press
works<00:02:00.479> specifically<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:02.130> pattern<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
works specifically on that pattern and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.459 
works specifically on that pattern and
what<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> essentially<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.049> learn<00:02:04.290> how

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
what you essentially have to learn how

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.039 
what you essentially have to learn how
to<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.040> properly<00:02:05.549> coordinate<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:06.630> traps

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
to do is properly coordinate your traps

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
to do is properly coordinate your traps
and<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.500> deltoids<00:02:07.950> firing<00:02:08.280> at<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> same

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
and your deltoids firing at the same

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.669 
and your deltoids firing at the same
time<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> Bradford<00:02:09.599> press<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:10.289> help<00:02:10.560> you

two three my key factors when looking
for<00:02:26.400> protein<00:02:26.760> powder<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.120> following

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
for protein powder and then following

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.000 
for protein powder and then following
one<00:02:27.810> how<00:02:28.050> does<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.260> react<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:28.650> body<00:02:28.860> if

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
one how does it react to your body if

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.920 
one how does it react to your body if
you<00:02:29.100> get<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> spanking<00:02:29.940> protein<00:02:30.390> thought<00:02:30.570> son

actually<00:02:40.560> fucking<00:02:41.130> protein<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.120> mean<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:42.630> you

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
actually fucking protein I mean if you

look at the breakdown if it's a 30 gram

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.060 
look at the breakdown if it's a 30 gram

paying<00:02:55.560> not<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.370> pure<00:02:56.580> protein<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.060> I

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
paying not for the pure protein so I

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.350 
paying not for the pure protein so I
like<00:02:57.570> pure<00:02:57.900> protein<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.040> last<00:02:59.400> one<00:02:59.730> then<00:03:00.150> has

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
like pure protein the last one then has

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.630 
like pure protein the last one then has
to<00:03:00.570> do<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:00.840> price<00:03:01.170> for<00:03:01.830> what<00:03:02.040> you're<00:03:02.220> getting

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
to do with price for what you're getting

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.910 
to do with price for what you're getting
is<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.120> worth<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.140> those<00:03:04.440> are<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.710> three

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
is it worth it so those are the three

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.430 
is it worth it so those are the three
factors<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.520> like<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.240> look<00:03:06.480> into<00:03:06.810> what<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.260> do

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
factors I like to look into what I do

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.950 
factors I like to look into what I do
per<00:03:07.860> see<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.160> get<00:03:08.400> pure<00:03:08.670> protein<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.420> fits<00:03:09.810> right

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
per see I get pure protein it fits right

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.300 
per see I get pure protein it fits right
for<00:03:10.140> my<00:03:10.200> stomach<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:10.740> also<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.100> good

really<00:03:41.070> helps<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.090> change<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.840> benchpress

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
really helps to change the benchpress

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.600 
really helps to change the benchpress

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
better kinesthetic awareness how you

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.730 
better kinesthetic awareness how you
utilize<00:04:20.400> your<00:04:20.790> body<00:04:21.080> when<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.230> take<00:04:22.560> an

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
athlete and then you allow them to start

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.300 
athlete and then you allow them to start
weight<00:04:25.410> training<00:04:25.800> so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
weight training so

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.280 
weight training so
their<00:04:26.430> goal<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.730> now<00:04:27.090> hypertrophy<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.990> build

their goal is now hypertrophy to build

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.020 
their goal is now hypertrophy to build
muscle<00:04:28.710> you'll<00:04:29.010> notice<00:04:29.460> they're<00:04:29.669> able<00:04:29.940> to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
muscle you'll notice they're able to

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.560 
muscle you'll notice they're able to
lift<00:04:30.210> more<00:04:30.419> weight<00:04:30.600> faster<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.530> build<00:04:31.889> muscle

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
lift more weight faster and build muscle

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.879 
lift more weight faster and build muscle
quicker<00:04:33.570> why<00:04:33.960> because<00:04:34.350> they're<00:04:34.500> used<00:04:34.770> to

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
quicker why because they're used to

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:35.960 
quicker why because they're used to
using<00:04:35.130> their<00:04:35.400> body<00:04:35.580> they<00:04:35.730> have<00:04:35.820> that

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
using their body they have that

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.450 
using their body they have that
efficient<00:04:36.570> neuromuscular<00:04:37.290> patterning<00:04:37.860> so

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
efficient neuromuscular patterning so

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.000 
efficient neuromuscular patterning so

arching<00:05:40.700> you<00:05:41.700> know<00:05:41.789> there's<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.270> lot<00:05:42.450> of

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
arching you know there's a lot of

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.550 
arching you know there's a lot of
different<00:05:42.900> ones<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.260> that's<00:05:43.380> actually

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
different ones and that's actually

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.080 
different ones and that's actually
pretty<00:05:43.860> normal<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.460> concept<00:05:44.850> that<00:05:44.910> you<00:05:45.000> can

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
pretty normal the concept that you can

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.460 
pretty normal the concept that you can
lift<00:05:45.270> more<00:05:45.450> weight<00:05:45.720> when<00:05:45.930> you<00:05:46.050> have<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.200> little

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
lift more weight when you have a little

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.230 
lift more weight when you have a little
bit<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.680> thoracic<00:05:46.800> rounding<00:05:47.550> what<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:47.910> would

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
bit of thoracic rounding what I would

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.880 
bit of thoracic rounding what I would
recommend<00:05:48.750> in<00:05:48.870> order<00:05:49.169> to<00:05:49.530> build<00:05:49.680> that

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
recommend in order to build that

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.409 
recommend in order to build that
tightness<00:05:50.160> that<00:05:50.460> arch<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:50.940> number<00:05:51.210> one

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
tightness that arch the number one

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.120 
tightness that arch the number one
assistance<00:05:51.870> exercise<00:05:52.260> would<00:05:52.470> be<00:05:52.530> the<00:05:52.860> good

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
assistance exercise would be the good

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.900 
assistance exercise would be the good
morning

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
morning

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.580 
morning
the<00:05:54.120> reason<00:05:54.390> why<00:05:54.479> because<00:05:54.630> the<00:05:54.930> loading<00:05:55.260> is<00:05:55.380> up

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
the reason why because the loading is up

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.879 
the reason why because the loading is up
here<00:05:56.100> it<00:05:56.280> really<00:05:56.639> forces<00:05:57.180> you<00:05:57.600> to<00:05:57.630> retain<00:05:58.470> that

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
here it really forces you to retain that

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.250 
here it really forces you to retain that
tight<00:05:59.370> arch<00:05:59.729> and<00:06:00.180> what<00:06:00.330> you'll<00:06:00.479> notice<00:06:00.570> it's

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
tight arch and what you'll notice it's

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.810 
tight arch and what you'll notice it's
from<00:06:01.470> working<00:06:01.889> on<00:06:02.010> this<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.520> same

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
from working on this to the same

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.279 
from working on this to the same
mechanism<00:06:03.389> of<00:06:03.450> keeping<00:06:03.780> that<00:06:03.870> tighter<00:06:04.110> so

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
mechanism of keeping that tighter so

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.990 
mechanism of keeping that tighter so
when<00:06:04.410> you<00:06:04.500> move<00:06:04.620> on<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.130> devil<00:06:05.520> I'll<00:06:05.729> feel

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
when you move on to the devil I'll feel

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000 
when you move on to the devil I'll feel
a<00:06:06.030> lot<00:06:06.090> easier<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:07.110> not<00:06:07.260> be<00:06:07.380> pulled<00:06:07.710> from<00:06:07.889> the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
a lot easier to not be pulled from the

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.310 
a lot easier to not be pulled from the
tight<00:06:08.220> arch<00:06:08.400> into<00:06:09.180> that<00:06:09.389> rounded<00:06:09.780> position<00:06:09.900> so

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
tight arch into that rounded position so

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.620 
tight arch into that rounded position so
I'll<00:06:10.410> say<00:06:10.530> the<00:06:10.560> good<00:06:10.740> morning<00:06:11.100> yo<00:06:11.760> Omar<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.360> want
