00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 and hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.070
 live games channel hook and i'm mr frost 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.470
 today we continue to pass the map 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.230
 Robinson Crusoe and strictly speaking 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.820
 more than a week has passed since the recording 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 the first part of fishing just today 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.279
 well actually we stopped at 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.070
 the volume that watermelon firms have done 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.610
 we will do the first house started Norman 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.420
 tree 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.420
 I think that at least half a stack is enough 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.990
 and so we continue to me a little bit 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.710
 I made a noise 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.750
 re-write me again in the sense 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.050
 start another one record something not on you 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.600
 I'm dumb now so we are a tree and 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.869
 chopped up quite a lot and let's 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.200
 build 1 little house she strives over 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.630
 water somehow our do not want to feel 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.630
 the terrain on the island we will proceed 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:24.329
 ok guys mega file 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.299
 and so with the pipe this is all 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.129
 and finish building a normal house I 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.379
 I doubt at all what is 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:36.840
 materials because they are also looking for 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:41.250
 it remains too little for the sake of women science 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.569
 left the ceiling from this frame itself so 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.370
 the contour itself we completed here we 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.920
 We do a little bit and then a tree 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.340
 while I want to ask glass and shovel 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:00.989
 we are not there as I understand it with nothing to fry 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:05.819
 meat for everything will have to chop a lot more 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:12.290
 wood because you need coal and 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:18.599
 building materials and all at once where 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:23.579
 all we take the heat back we eat means 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:25.849
 You are a little Pokrovsky commenting so 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.010
 you are assets of a scraft spade 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.519
 done and oh its on iron we go 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.989
 let's make a stone there too 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.989
 what are my and her 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:47.200
 yes he was provide guys through everything 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:50.120
 Do not burn the second day must be burned 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:58.660
 so okay we break a few cobblestones in 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.660
 I already have enough to offer myself 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.650
 I donâ€™t think so 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:28.310
 the top do not know what 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:32.169
 use sand do not want it, they 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.169
 somehow you can climb try 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:41.979
 she used to be going boards 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.979
 now the elephant and the tree and fields 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.650
 so guys but the price is not conquered 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.470
 own i vertex card data i 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:14.230
 send lags so nothing interesting here 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.930
 I won't see you like that 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.000
 yakokka knew maza would be here 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.750
 but all the winners find diamonds 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.440
 Follow the remaining extract just 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.080
 climbed down 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.080
 let's make ourselves an iron pick we will get them 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.760
 so I do not even know how to go down 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:46.710
 better let's do something like this 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:52.890
 little by little 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:58.140
 so everything okay craft iron pickaxe from 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:02.130
 Examined need to buy more 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.790
 By the way, I completely forgot the pictures 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.050
 warcraft 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:11.840
 all and partially missing so here not 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:17.000
 know the loss back under it make 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.000
 somehow damn molasses 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.710
 ok so here 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:49.920
 now quietly break it and that's it 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:54.330
 mined and for how many times two three 4 5 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.330
 six like a diamond found 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:03.280
 Japanese policeman so that's burned 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.140
 the guys didn't have to do the source there 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:12.940
 lava hour understands me all 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:14.560
 quick put out even put out there 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.000
 already here we will not be in time but somehow 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.000
 try to let the fire spread 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.650
 no trees so close 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:29.590
 let's squeeze 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:31.260
 diamond you pick and we will get this 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:37.930
 obsidian which we have turned out 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:43.180
 quite spontaneously finish it 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:46.240
 part of this we finish there without 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:50.440
 records remelted glass do everything 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:53.290
 in an amicable way but on this all bye swami
