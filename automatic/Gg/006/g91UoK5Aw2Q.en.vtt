00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
years and I think it's because of the

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.580 
years and I think it's because of the
church<00:01:28.469> discipline<00:01:29.039> really<00:01:29.909> absolutely<00:01:30.719> make

your case well true church growth is

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:36.949 
your case well true church growth is
connected<00:01:35.429> to<00:01:35.520> purity<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.149> pure<00:01:36.689> bride

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.379 
well I understand that trend we've been
working<00:05:46.800> on<00:05:47.099> that<00:05:47.129> for<00:05:47.309> a<00:05:47.519> long<00:05:47.669> time<00:05:47.729> we

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
working on that for a long time we

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.969 
working on that for a long time we
actually<00:05:48.809> think<00:05:49.019> that<00:05:49.139> will<00:05:49.409> be<00:05:49.529> more<00:05:49.740> healthy

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
actually think that will be more healthy

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.829 
actually think that will be more healthy
when<00:05:50.309> we<00:05:50.430> have<00:05:50.579> far<00:05:50.819> more<00:05:50.849> tenders<00:05:51.509> than<00:05:51.689> we

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
when we have far more tenders than we

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.359 
when we have far more tenders than we
have<00:05:52.019> members<00:05:52.259> but<00:05:52.619> we're<00:05:52.800> working<00:05:53.009> on<00:05:53.309> that

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:53.369 
have members but we're working on that

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:56.629 
have members but we're working on that
it's<00:05:54.059> already<00:05:54.329> sir
