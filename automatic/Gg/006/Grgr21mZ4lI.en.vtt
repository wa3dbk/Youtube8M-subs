00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 well this is an optics computer 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.570
 6 x 6 20 in the way you go in 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.170
 the bios is as follows 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.570
 turn on the power button 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170
 when it appears on the screen according to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.170
 f2 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.480
 when- according to lf2 I'm going to remove the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.660
 flash 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.020
 why 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.760
 well I think help can be seen 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.520
 when it enters the bios this is the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 font that appears appears 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.750
 bios information shows what kind of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.750
 computers appears 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.210
 The information appears on the left side 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.360
 of the system and the way it is navigated 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.380
 in this video is as follows 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.660
 the arrows are used to go up for 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.290
 go down to the right side by the side 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.260
 left and those who do the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:15.890
 changes with the tab bar 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:17.750
 space with the enter key and 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.909
 and that will tell you in the part of 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.150
 down where it says pressures up or 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.820
 down the arrows to select a 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.640
 different field and in this one 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.910
 at this point we go to where we where 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.860
 it concerns us and it is with the 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:40.190
 down arrow labor sinking and this 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.740
 I'm going down to the different ones to these 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.909
 different parties in this case to 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.610
 processor information in this bass 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.740
 low case to memory information of 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.080
 memory tells you exactly how much 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.380
 memory has what kind of memory is what 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.630
 speeds 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.969
 and if the memory has any problem you 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.250
 they will inform you and then you will be off with the 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:06.490
 arrow to the point where it says drives 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.929
 which means the hard drives and they look 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 you can see next to drives a 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:14.170
 symbol of more means that you have a 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.140
 submenu in this case tells you that that is 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.860
 the hard drives that there are and it tells you if 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.380
 what kind of hard drive is 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.380
 and then to enter that one goes up what 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.120
 has second the enter 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.850
 and you can say to the disk for example 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.330
 to disk zero then i great disk 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.620
 zero and it tells me shows me everything says what 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:45.130
 disk type are you how much capacity in 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.900
 this case this hard disk is this disk 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.650
 one of the hard drives in this 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.980
 computer is 80 gigabytes there 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.880
 you can see the value of 80 gigabytes and the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.100
 speed are 3.0 gigabytes per x per 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.870
 second 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.710
 this is the interface that is inside 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.710
 of the system 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.740
 at the top shows a submenu 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.770
 where it is put on off and that is achieved with 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.680
 the arrows and there you see how it is changing 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.600
 on off and if I am the world- between there already 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.750
 stays or stays like that goes for each 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.410
 that can not be done when there is a 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.330
 new disk that gets into the computer 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:36.330
 there it will come out in the bottom 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:40.470
 you'll get the details of that from that 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.620
 hard drive in this other case there are two there 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.129
 come out 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.760
 the cd-rom finally the irises and the disc 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.760
 hard 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:59.590
 ok now we return to the screen 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.270
 sinking enter and leaving this on 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.240
 nothing what I am showing you is 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.800
 basically to show you how it's done 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.440
 this 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.690
 here he tells you that he is another this other 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.310
 that I chose with drive 1 and that 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:21.830
 corresponds to the east corresponds to the 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:24.790
 hike and rum here says it's a cdr w rip 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.800
 ride divide it 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.230
 if you leave, come back if you want to go back 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.560
 one of people and that brings you back to this 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.689
 this other type d 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.199
 of menu 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.199
 in the 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:47.379
 in the sequence of all this 

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:49.930
 this is basically what controls the 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.780
 computer 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.240
 for example in this case of security not 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.270
 there is no password of any kind 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.400
 been put here the same example in 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.340
 this computer did not put itself they say do 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.100
 the password at this time is not 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.590
 in doing and you can put step now 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.050
 everything one wants if one if one 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.569
 he wants there is a 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.690
 so in all this, all this 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.310
 information is what is relevant to 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:24.370
 when in this case of this computer 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.810
 does not show a how to do the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.199
 format the disk because obviously 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.849
 this disk is already formatted 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.629
 because it has an installation of 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.990
 windows but in here where it says drive 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.410
 zero 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.080
 is where it would appear in the information of 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.470
 that this hard drive has not been 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.950
 formatted then there would appear a 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.280
 submenu that says format the disk 1 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.700
 format the disk then when one 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.430
 want 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.110
 get out of here and come back so that 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.460
 the computer starts normally 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:08.380
 sorry the key sinks is that of 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.900
 escape and when you sink that escape key 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.830
 he asks me if I want to stay in 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:19.300
 the in the cerÃ¡ or if I want to leave in 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:22.410
 this case if I go out then then 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.360
 I'm basically going to leave the 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.230
 video if he's going to start the 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.340
 configuration 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.530
 if I do not move the keys this is 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.440
 stay in the will be with the arrow to 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.630
 have made a teacher come out and already 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.000
 basically the computer 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.070
 boot in windows in this case as already 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.450
 is installed windows boots windows 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.120
 windows 7 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.400
 then the key that sinks before 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.260
 that the computer loads some system 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.420
 operative if you have it or if you do not have it 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.320
 It's the f2 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.540
 you can also press the f2 and 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.370
 so I hope this clarifies a 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.770
 little because the computer did not get 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.650
 for envelopes plus the computer 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:10.190
 just as we received the computer 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.530
 was sent since there was no according to I have 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.050
 understood it was not you want to be 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:19.520
 put a password then I hope that 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:21.199
 this will help you and we will try to 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.759
 do it whatever it takes to 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:26.800
 that you can have your computer and you 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.800
 work well chau god bless you
