00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you can't cut any of these four are

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.200 
you can't cut any of these four are
these<00:00:58.770> four<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.309> select<00:00:59.699> any<00:00:59.940> one<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
start and card number 24 took the time

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
start and card number 24 took the time
and<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> cut<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.430> deck<00:01:08.670> no<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.210> doesn't

if you're ready to cut it that's the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.520 
if you're ready to cut it that's the
only<00:01:11.400> delay<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.760> there's<00:01:12.000> any<00:01:12.270> delay<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.320> how

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
only delay if there's any delay it's how

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.130 
only delay if there's any delay it's how
long<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.100> person<00:01:14.670> takes<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.299> execute<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.930> cut

long a person takes to execute the cut
budgets<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:17.009> give<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.310> 10<00:01:17.610> seconds<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.720> they

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
budgets we give them 10 seconds if they

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.899 
budgets we give them 10 seconds if they
don't<00:01:19.229> execute<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> 10<00:01:20.220> seconds<00:01:20.700> then

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
don't execute it in 10 seconds then

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.609 
don't execute it in 10 seconds then
they'll<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.479> sat<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> game<00:01:22.409> and

just want to make sure that it's not a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.429 
just want to make sure that it's not a
robotic<00:01:28.950> program<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:30.119> notice<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.540> not<00:01:30.780> the

robotic program you notice or not the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.980 
robotic program you notice or not the
cut<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.250> actually<00:01:32.790> something<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
cut is actually something that that the

utica yeah you're not going to see that
the<00:01:42.810> representation<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.220> saw<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the representation that we just saw that

the dealer the because it's an
interactive<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.630> an<00:01:48.810> executable<00:01:49.500> program

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
interactive it's an executable program

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.700 
interactive it's an executable program
if<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.790> put<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> tin<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.869> want<00:01:52.049> nine

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
if you put on the tin we don't want nine

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.370 
if you put on the tin we don't want nine
ten<00:01:52.979> people<00:01:53.189> trying<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> cut<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> debt<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.020> it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
layers of security yeah it does a couple

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.310 
layers of security yeah it does a couple
of<00:02:42.940> things<00:02:43.030> besides<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.870> putting<00:02:44.200> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
of things besides you putting the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
players in control it also adds another

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.990 
players in control it also adds another
level<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:47.110> security<00:02:47.770> because<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.760> basically

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
level of security because you basically

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.600 
level of security because you basically
a<00:02:49.420> cut<00:02:49.720> as<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> Reese<00:02:50.200> cram<00:02:50.650> Belov<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.100> debt<00:02:51.340> and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
if you can do that right before the game

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.460 
if you can do that right before the game
begins<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:55.060> make<00:02:55.210> it<00:02:55.360> even<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.720> harder<00:02:56.230> for

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
begins you make it even that harder for
