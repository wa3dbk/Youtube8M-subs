as<00:01:47.390> possible<00:01:47.540> like<00:01:48.200> from<00:01:48.590> my<00:01:48.740> own<00:01:48.950> area<00:01:49.790> but

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
as possible like from my own area but

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.330 
as possible like from my own area but
there<00:01:51.320> was<00:01:51.439> really<00:01:51.470> no<00:01:51.740> where<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.130> go<00:01:52.159> on

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
there was really no where to go on

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.580 
there was really no where to go on
invasion<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.689> limited<00:01:54.140> amount<00:01:54.320> of

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
invasion you have a limited amount of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.800 
invasion you have a limited amount of
spot<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.460> go<00:01:55.610> through<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.090> middle<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.420> map<00:01:56.600> you

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
spot to go through the middle of map you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.929 
spot to go through the middle of map you
have<00:01:56.960> pretty<00:01:57.530> much<00:01:57.560> three<00:01:58.100> ways<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.430> it's

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
have pretty much three ways and it's

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.399 
have pretty much three ways and it's
kind<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.210> tough<00:01:59.420> map<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.810> get<00:01:59.990> through<00:02:00.229> if

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
kind of a tough map to get through if

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.130 
kind of a tough map to get through if
the<00:02:00.710> enemy<00:02:01.009> team<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.659> locking<00:02:02.659> it<00:02:02.750> down<00:02:02.780> and

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
the enemy team is locking it down and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.330 
the enemy team is locking it down and
you<00:02:03.170> can't<00:02:03.439> do<00:02:03.560> anything<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.979> that's<00:02:04.159> why<00:02:04.280> I

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
you can't do anything so that's why I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.450 
you can't do anything so that's why I
like<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:05.080> be<00:02:06.080> more<00:02:06.320> patient<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.950> wait<00:02:07.189> for<00:02:07.369> the

people to come to me and that buildings
are<00:02:09.530> really<00:02:09.739> popular<00:02:09.950> spot<00:02:10.399> there's<00:02:10.579> a<00:02:10.639> few

easy kills out of
and<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:17.510> why<00:02:17.659> like<00:02:17.840> sit<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.049> that

shouldn't have it on for this map i
didn't<00:02:42.859> get<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.040> set<00:02:43.519> up<00:02:43.549> properly<00:02:43.909> but<00:02:44.719> i

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
didn't explain how i switch out my third

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.330 
didn't explain how i switch out my third
/<00:02:47.420> cuz<00:02:47.629> that's<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.959> only<00:02:48.260> part<00:02:48.500> i<00:02:48.680> do<00:02:48.769> switch

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
/ cuz that's the only part i do switch

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.470 
/ cuz that's the only part i do switch
out<00:02:49.579> so<00:02:49.970> when<00:02:50.959> i'm<00:02:51.079> playing<00:02:51.400> any<00:02:52.400> map<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.030> that

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
out so when i'm playing any map and that

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.729 
out so when i'm playing any map and that
guy<00:02:53.659> I<00:02:53.689> can't<00:02:54.139> believe<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.409> didn't<00:02:54.590> kill<00:02:54.709> that

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
guy I can't believe I didn't kill that

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.559 
guy I can't believe I didn't kill that
guy<00:02:55.010> was<00:02:55.250> kind<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.579> tweaked<00:02:55.879> after<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.329> one

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
guy was kind of tweaked after that one

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.629 
guy was kind of tweaked after that one
he<00:02:57.109> kind<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.290> like<00:02:57.439> super<00:02:57.829> lunged<00:02:58.220> across<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
he kind of like super lunged across the

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.940 
he kind of like super lunged across the
map<00:02:58.790> at<00:02:58.970> me<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.569> anyway<00:03:00.079> so<00:03:00.139> how<00:03:00.469> I<00:03:00.500> picked<00:03:00.829> my

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
map at me but anyway so how I picked my

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.819 
map at me but anyway so how I picked my
third<00:03:01.219> perk<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:01.849> is<00:03:02.000> how<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.359> okay

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
third perk and this is how I do it okay

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.800 
third perk and this is how I do it okay
so<00:03:03.829> I<00:03:03.859> only<00:03:04.310> pick<00:03:04.730> between<00:03:04.939> two<00:03:05.359> perks

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
so I only pick between two perks

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.440 
so I only pick between two perks
actually<00:03:06.349> three<00:03:06.919> but<00:03:07.219> very<00:03:07.700> rarely<00:03:08.000> steady

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
actually three but very rarely steady

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.199 
actually three but very rarely steady
aim<00:03:08.629> I<00:03:08.870> don't<00:03:09.019> use<00:03:09.169> that<00:03:09.230> one<00:03:09.469> very<00:03:09.769> often<00:03:10.209> I

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
aim I don't use that one very often I

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.199 
aim I don't use that one very often I
use<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.230> either<00:03:12.650> pick<00:03:12.950> between<00:03:13.129> ninja<00:03:13.639> pro<00:03:13.909> or

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209

use it either pick between ninja pro or
commando<00:03:15.109> pro<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:16.209> ninja<00:03:17.209> pro<00:03:17.419> I<00:03:17.629> would<00:03:18.290> have

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
commando pro and ninja pro I would have

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.050 
commando pro and ninja pro I would have
picked<00:03:18.590> for<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.859> map<00:03:19.129> like<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:19.370> there's<00:03:19.819> not

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
picked for a map like this there's not

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.599 
picked for a map like this there's not

our map say like high-rise it's a little
bit<00:03:37.370> more<00:03:37.609> closer<00:03:37.849> quarters<00:03:38.209> except<00:03:38.659> for<00:03:39.290> of

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
bit more closer quarters except for of

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.059 
bit more closer quarters except for of
course<00:03:40.010> like<00:03:40.159> the<00:03:40.280> soccer<00:03:40.519> field<00:03:40.879> and<00:03:42.069> if

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
course like the soccer field and if

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.770 
course like the soccer field and if

right down without committing suicide

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.280 
right down without committing suicide
because<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.970> really<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.329> useful<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.049> love

because that really is useful and I love

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.319 
because that really is useful and I love
commando<00:03:51.709> for<00:03:51.889> that<00:03:52.040> especially<00:03:52.370> since<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:53.180> is

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
commando for that especially since it is

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.300 
commando for that especially since it is
so<00:03:53.569> close<00:03:53.840> quarters<00:03:54.439> if<00:03:54.680> people<00:03:54.919> are<00:03:55.009> just<00:03:55.189> a

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
so close quarters if people are just a

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.369 
so close quarters if people are just a
little<00:03:55.609> bit<00:03:55.759> too<00:03:56.389> far<00:03:56.569> away<00:03:56.720> from<00:03:57.019> you<00:03:57.139> the
