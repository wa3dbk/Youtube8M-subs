00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.899 

they<00:01:36.860> also<00:01:37.039> trickle<00:01:37.610> up<00:01:39.220> into<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.310> brain

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.419 

let's<00:01:43.909> look<00:01:44.060> at<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.270> spinal<00:01:44.569> cord<00:01:44.929> first<00:01:45.429> if

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
let's look at the spinal cord first if

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.450 
let's look at the spinal cord first if
these<00:01:46.759> painkillers<00:01:47.590> are<00:01:48.590> tripping<00:01:48.979> down<00:01:49.130> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
these painkillers are tripping down the

these painkillers are tripping down the
spinal<00:01:49.759> cord

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
spinal cord

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.810 
spinal cord
then<00:01:51.170> impulses<00:01:51.979> coming<00:01:52.250> in<00:01:52.549> from<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.030> body

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
then impulses coming in from the body

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.740 
then impulses coming in from the body
telling<00:01:55.820> your<00:01:56.060> brain<00:01:56.299> of<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.540> warmth<00:01:57.520> cold

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
telling your brain of that warmth cold

spinal cord it can stop any impulse
coming<00:02:08.420> up<00:02:08.829> now<00:02:09.829> that's<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.130> great<00:02:10.340> system

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
coming up now that's a great system

that's<00:02:11.329> a<00:02:11.450> great<00:02:11.660> system<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:13.250> how<00:02:13.400> do<00:02:13.459> we<00:02:13.579> open

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
that's a great system so how do we open

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.140 
that's a great system so how do we open
in<00:02:14.120> how<00:02:14.450> we<00:02:14.510> close<00:02:14.930> escrow<00:02:15.560> account

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
in how we close escrow account

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.110 
in how we close escrow account

eyes from the nose and from the ears but
the<00:02:58.720> key<00:02:58.989> question<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.980> brain<00:03:00.250> has<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.610> answer

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
the key question the brain has to answer

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.150 
the key question the brain has to answer
to<00:03:01.480> work<00:03:01.690> out<00:03:01.959> whether<00:03:02.200> it's<00:03:02.410> opening<00:03:02.830> up<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
making honey is it worth having pain is

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.509 
making honey is it worth having pain is
it<00:03:12.390> worth<00:03:14.250> pain<00:03:16.799> so<00:03:17.799> let<00:03:17.950> me<00:03:18.069> give<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.310> some

have to get out of the way of a car

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.400 
have to get out of the way of a car
rather<00:03:27.190> that's<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.610> fit<00:03:27.849> if<00:03:28.660> my<00:03:28.900> coat<00:03:29.140> will<00:03:29.290> you

get<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.769> other<00:03:29.950> side<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.090> brains

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
get to the other side but the brains

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.300 
get to the other side but the brains
made<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> decision<00:03:32.110> it's<00:03:32.590> not<00:03:32.739> worth<00:03:33.099> having

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
made a decision it's not worth having

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.390 
made a decision it's not worth having
pain<00:03:33.700> now<00:03:34.000> how<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.780> can<00:03:35.019> wait<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:36.130> what<00:03:36.310> it

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
pain now how you can wait and what it

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.819 
pain now how you can wait and what it
will<00:03:36.519> do<00:03:36.700> will<00:03:37.299> be<00:03:37.420> simply<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.260> flow<00:03:38.530> and

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
will do will be simply to flow and

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.160 
will do will be simply to flow and
there'll<00:03:39.160> be<00:03:39.190> no<00:03:39.400> pain<00:03:39.700> or<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.900> may<00:03:41.049> have

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
there'll be no pain or you may have

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.199 
there'll be no pain or you may have
heard<00:03:41.319> of<00:03:41.379> people<00:03:41.500> finishing<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.700> sports<00:03:43.030> event

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
heard of people finishing a sports event

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.080 
heard of people finishing a sports event
with<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:43.989> severe<00:03:44.440> injury<00:03:44.739> but<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.670> person

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
with a severe injury but that person

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.960 
with a severe injury but that person
decided<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:47.019> important<00:03:47.769> for<00:03:47.950> me<00:03:48.129> to<00:03:48.370> finish

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
decided it's important for me to finish

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.509 
decided it's important for me to finish
this<00:03:49.209> game<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.840> therefore<00:03:50.739> it's<00:03:51.099> not<00:03:51.190> worth

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
this game and therefore it's not worth

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.839 
this game and therefore it's not worth
having<00:03:51.790> pain<00:03:52.180> right<00:03:52.450> now<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.709> example<00:03:54.370> in

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
having pain right now in that example in

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.750 
having pain right now in that example in
that<00:03:55.000> example<00:03:55.420> open<00:03:56.200> up<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.410> cabinet<00:03:56.760> flooded

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
that example open up the cabinet flooded

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.000 
that example open up the cabinet flooded
and<00:03:57.989> impulses<00:03:58.989> get<00:03:59.170> no<00:03:59.319> further<00:03:59.650> than<00:03:59.889> the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
and impulses get no further than the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.729 
and impulses get no further than the
spinal<00:04:00.459> cord<00:04:01.019> but<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.109> can<00:04:02.260> go<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.560> other<00:04:02.650> way

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
spinal cord but it can go the other way

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.759 
spinal cord but it can go the other way
too<00:04:02.970> if<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.180> put<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.450> pin<00:04:04.840> in<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:05.109> violinists

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
too if you put a pin in a violinists

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.309 
too if you put a pin in a violinists
finger<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.670> hurts<00:04:07.000> more<00:04:07.389> than<00:04:07.750> if<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.079> put<00:04:08.290> a

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
finger it hurts more than if you put a

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.490 
finger it hurts more than if you put a
pin<00:04:08.650> in<00:04:08.859> a<00:04:08.980> non-violent<00:04:09.609> finger<00:04:10.500> obviously

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
pin in a non-violent finger obviously

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.080 
pin in a non-violent finger obviously
there's<00:04:11.709> much<00:04:11.889> more<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.370> threat<00:04:12.489> or

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
there's much more of a threat or

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.910 
there's much more of a threat or
challenge<00:04:13.150> if<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:13.900> put<00:04:14.170> in<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.440> violin<00:04:14.799> a

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
challenge if you put in the violin a
