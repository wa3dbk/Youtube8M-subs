00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.089 
puppet yes I use hop it sometimes
honestly<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.900> don't<00:02:38.829> find<00:02:39.549> much<00:02:39.909> use<00:02:40.359> for<00:02:40.389> it

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
honestly I don't find much use for it

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.550 
honestly I don't find much use for it
cuz<00:02:42.099> there's<00:02:42.939> not<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> lot<00:02:43.389> of<00:02:43.419> people<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:44.349> are

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
cuz there's not a lot of people that are

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.819 
cuz there's not a lot of people that are
good<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:44.980> that's<00:02:45.579> why<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:45.939> didn't<00:02:46.209> have<00:02:46.540> it

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
good and that's why they didn't have it

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.710 
good and that's why they didn't have it
so<00:02:47.829> I<00:02:47.859> mean<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.430> did<00:02:48.760> find<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.239> couple

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
so I mean I did find like a couple

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.530 
so I mean I did find like a couple
people<00:02:50.220> but<00:02:51.220> they're<00:02:51.639> all<00:02:51.700> right<00:02:51.970> they're<00:02:52.419> all

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
people but they're all right they're all

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.369 
people but they're all right they're all
right<00:02:53.310> I'd<00:02:54.310> rather<00:02:54.489> roll<00:02:54.819> without<00:02:55.150> anthrax<00:02:56.049> or

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
right I'd rather roll without anthrax or

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.069 
right I'd rather roll without anthrax or
Tabasco<00:02:56.980> ski<00:02:57.549> or<00:02:57.819> somebody<00:02:58.329> that<00:02:58.389> I<00:02:58.540> know

Tabasco ski or somebody that I know

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.589 
Tabasco ski or somebody that I know
that's<00:02:59.349> good<00:02:59.650> but<00:03:00.609> something<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.180> hard<00:03:01.389> to

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
that's good but something is hard to

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.740 
that's good but something is hard to
like<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.469> know<00:03:02.790> sync<00:03:03.790> up<00:03:03.939> schedules<00:03:04.540> or
