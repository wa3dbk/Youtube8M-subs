00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
their best shot for a win would be at

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.420 
their best shot for a win would be at
home<00:03:56.690> well<00:03:57.350> they've<00:03:57.799> only<00:03:57.980> got<00:03:58.220> one<00:03:58.400> other

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.500 
ball but I'm looking at this as catching
a<00:05:03.710> motivated<00:05:04.400> home<00:05:04.640> dog<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.180> nearly<00:05:05.390> a

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
a motivated home dog of nearly a

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.810 
a motivated home dog of nearly a
touchdown<00:05:06.290> who<00:05:06.890> could<00:05:07.100> be<00:05:07.220> in<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.400> very

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
touchdown who could be in a very

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.690 
touchdown who could be in a very
favorable<00:05:08.210> quarterback<00:05:09.110> situation<00:05:09.740> compared

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700

to<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:10.910> other<00:05:11.090> team<00:05:11.390> it's<00:05:11.870> not<00:05:12.050> very<00:05:12.110> often

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
to the other team it's not very often

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.170

that<00:05:12.740> you'd<00:05:12.950> say<00:05:13.100> down<00:05:13.310> or<00:05:13.490> loss<00:05:13.670> and<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.090> would

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
that you'd say down or loss and it would

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.510 
that you'd say down or loss and it would
be<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.330> favorable<00:05:14.840> quarter<00:05:15.140> of<00:05:15.200> exit<00:05:15.530> exactly

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520
