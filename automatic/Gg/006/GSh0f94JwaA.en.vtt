what<00:00:26.020> you<00:00:26.170> see<00:00:26.439> in<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.650> picture<00:00:27.040> is<00:00:27.310> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
what you see in the picture is the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.220 
what you see in the picture is the
cross-section<00:00:28.689> view<00:00:29.140> of<00:00:29.349> a<00:00:29.800> circuit<00:00:30.310> breaker

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
cross-section view of a circuit breaker

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.380 
cross-section view of a circuit breaker
in<00:00:32.230> this<00:00:32.500> video<00:00:32.860> we'll<00:00:33.190> understand<00:00:33.940> exactly

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
in this video we'll understand exactly

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.520 
in this video we'll understand exactly
how<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:36.220> circuit<00:00:36.610> breaker<00:00:36.940> works<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.750> how

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
how the circuit breaker works and how

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.370 
how the circuit breaker works and how
the<00:00:38.590> tripping<00:00:39.220> mechanism<00:00:39.870> cuts<00:00:40.870> off<00:00:41.110> the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
the tripping mechanism cuts off the

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.700 
the tripping mechanism cuts off the
supply<00:00:41.800> in<00:00:42.130> case<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.910> fault<00:00:43.690> current<00:00:43.990> or

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
supply in case of fault current or

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.790 
supply in case of fault current or
faulty<00:00:45.190> circuit<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.960> red<00:00:47.080> wire<00:00:47.380> what<00:00:47.650> you

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
faulty circuit so the red wire what you

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.970 
faulty circuit so the red wire what you
see<00:00:48.070> is<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.520> supply<00:00:48.940> let's<00:00:49.270> say<00:00:49.570> that<00:00:50.290> the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
see is the supply let's say that the

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.300 
see is the supply let's say that the
current<00:00:51.310> comes<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.270> then<00:00:52.450> it's<00:00:53.230> with<00:00:54.190> the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
current comes and then it's with the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.890 
current comes and then it's with the
help<00:00:54.490> of<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.790> screw<00:00:55.060> bolted<00:00:55.630> to<00:00:55.750> this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
help of the screw bolted to this

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.340 
help of the screw bolted to this
terminal<00:00:56.200> of<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.650> circuit<00:00:57.010> breaker<00:00:57.310> and<00:00:58.350> here

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
terminal of the circuit breaker and here

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.820 
terminal of the circuit breaker and here
it<00:00:59.500> goes

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
it goes

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.039 
it goes
and<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:01.300> is<00:01:01.450> a<00:01:01.480> bimetallic<00:01:02.050> strip<00:01:02.740> and<00:01:04.049> here

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
and this is a bimetallic strip and here

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.399 
and this is a bimetallic strip and here
is<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.379> spring-loaded<00:01:06.009> arm<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:07.079> here<00:01:08.079> is<00:01:08.229> the

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
is the spring-loaded arm and here is the

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.940 
is the spring-loaded arm and here is the
linkages<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:10.090> this<00:01:10.780> is<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> link<00:01:11.229> here<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.920> a

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
linkages so this is a link here is a

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.120 
linkages so this is a link here is a
link<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.520> then<00:01:12.729> this<00:01:12.939> is<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.360> conductor<00:01:14.229> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
link and then this is the conductor the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.580 
link and then this is the conductor the
current<00:01:15.700> comes<00:01:16.149> through<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:16.600> blue<00:01:16.929> wire<00:01:17.229> and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
current comes through this blue wire and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.130 
current comes through this blue wire and
then<00:01:18.069> it<00:01:18.219> goes<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.819> bimetallic<00:01:19.240> strip<00:01:19.840> and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
then it goes to the bimetallic strip and

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.219 
then it goes to the bimetallic strip and
here<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.039> can<00:01:21.249> see<00:01:21.490> behind<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:22.299> there's<00:01:22.840> one

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
here you can see behind the there's one

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.389 
here you can see behind the there's one
more<00:01:23.490> conductor<00:01:24.490> or<00:01:24.700> any<00:01:25.119> metal<00:01:25.810> piece<00:01:26.399> which

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
more conductor or any metal piece which

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.559 
more conductor or any metal piece which
goes<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:28.899> link<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.439> here<00:01:30.090> when<00:01:31.090> whenever

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
goes to this link and here when whenever

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.169 
goes to this link and here when whenever
the<00:01:31.719> circuit<00:01:31.869> breaker<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:33.039> this<00:01:33.789> will<00:01:33.969> go

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
the circuit breaker is on this will go

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.410 
the circuit breaker is on this will go
on<00:01:34.359> hit<00:01:34.659> or<00:01:34.899> make<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.770> contact<00:01:36.340> here<00:01:36.670> thus<00:01:37.149> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
on hit or make a contact here thus the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.419 
on hit or make a contact here thus the
current<00:01:37.600> supply<00:01:38.079> is<00:01:38.139> taken<00:01:38.649> out<00:01:38.829> through<00:01:39.249> this

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
current supply is taken out through this

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.330 
current supply is taken out through this
terminal<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.959> is<00:01:41.109> the<00:01:41.289> input<00:01:41.530> terminal

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
terminal so this is the input terminal

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.459 
terminal so this is the input terminal
and<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.819> is<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.119> output<00:01:43.689> terminal<00:01:44.229> our

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
and this is the output terminal our

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.709 
and this is the output terminal our
outlet<00:01:45.100> simply<00:01:45.639> we<00:01:45.789> can<00:01:45.969> say<00:01:46.179> in<00:01:46.270> layman's

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
outlet simply we can say in layman's

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.389 
outlet simply we can say in layman's
term<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.189> now<00:01:48.850> let's<00:01:49.299> see<00:01:49.569> what<00:01:49.709> happens<00:01:50.709> when

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
term so now let's see what happens when

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.739 
term so now let's see what happens when
it<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.759> walking<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:52.749> know<00:01:52.959> like<00:01:53.350> all<00:01:54.569> right<00:01:55.569> so

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
it is walking you know like all right so

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.719 
it is walking you know like all right so
these<00:01:55.990> contacts<00:01:56.529> are<00:01:56.709> open<00:01:57.100> now<00:01:57.249> the<00:01:57.310> breaker

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
these contacts are open now the breaker

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.789 
these contacts are open now the breaker
is<00:01:57.909> an<00:01:58.029> off<00:01:58.179> portion<00:01:58.630> now<00:01:58.990> it's<00:01:59.200> on<00:01:59.439> the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
is an off portion now it's on the

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.539 
is an off portion now it's on the
current<00:02:00.279> starts<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.509> flow<00:02:02.399> through<00:02:03.399> the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
current starts to flow through the

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.219 
current starts to flow through the
supply<00:02:03.909> line<00:02:04.149> that's<00:02:04.389> the<00:02:04.450> red<00:02:04.749> line<00:02:04.990> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
supply line that's the red line the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.240 
supply line that's the red line the
current<00:02:05.560> flows<00:02:05.889> through<00:02:06.279> this<00:02:06.429> terminal<00:02:07.359> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
current flows through this terminal and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.440 
current flows through this terminal and
here<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.399> have<00:02:09.520> screwed<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.149> remember

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
here you have screwed it so remember

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.870 
here you have screwed it so remember
that<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.990> flows<00:02:11.319> through<00:02:11.349> this<00:02:11.950> if<00:02:12.190> it's<00:02:12.550> loose

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
that it flows through this if it's loose

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.940 
that it flows through this if it's loose
then<00:02:13.480> definitely<00:02:14.080> there's<00:02:14.590> going<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.800> be<00:02:14.860> a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
then definitely there's going to be a

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.830 
then definitely there's going to be a
problem<00:02:15.190> at<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.520> circuit<00:02:15.819> breaker<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.330> arcing

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
problem at a circuit breaker like arcing

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.480 
problem at a circuit breaker like arcing
or<00:02:16.959> even<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.500> circuit<00:02:17.770> breaker<00:02:18.010> might<00:02:18.250> rip

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
or even the circuit breaker might rip

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.470 
or even the circuit breaker might rip
any<00:02:19.230> fault<00:02:20.230> may<00:02:20.440> occur<00:02:20.680> over<00:02:20.920> here<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:22.030> through

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
any fault may occur over here so through

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.220 
any fault may occur over here so through
this<00:02:22.690> it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
this it

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.040 
this it
to<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.340> enters<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.120> bimetallic<00:02:25.510> strip

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
to this and enters the bimetallic strip

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.039 
to this and enters the bimetallic strip
so<00:02:27.010> as<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.580> current<00:02:27.760> flows<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.540> bimetallic

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
so as the current flows the bimetallic

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.550 
so as the current flows the bimetallic
strip<00:02:29.620> gets<00:02:29.980> heated<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> let's<00:02:32.230> say<00:02:32.379> the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
strip gets heated up so let's say the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.330 
strip gets heated up so let's say the
circuit<00:02:33.010> breaker<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.549> rated<00:02:33.940> for<00:02:34.120> 20<00:02:34.450> amps

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
circuit breaker is rated for 20 amps

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.610 
circuit breaker is rated for 20 amps
till<00:02:36.340> 20<00:02:36.730> amps<00:02:37.180> nothing<00:02:37.900> will<00:02:38.049> happen<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.409> the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
till 20 amps nothing will happen to the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.110 
till 20 amps nothing will happen to the
bimetallic<00:02:38.980> strip<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.610> course<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.030> will

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
bimetallic strip of course it will

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.509 
bimetallic strip of course it will
expand<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.019> expansion<00:02:41.920> will<00:02:42.160> be<00:02:42.280> within

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
expand but the expansion will be within

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.940 
expand but the expansion will be within
the<00:02:42.760> limit<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.239> will<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.599> trip<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.349> operating

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
the limit it will not trip the operating

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.610 
the limit it will not trip the operating
links<00:02:45.360> however<00:02:46.360> let's<00:02:46.750> say<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.200> circuit

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
links however let's say the circuit

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.789 
links however let's say the circuit
breaker<00:02:48.129> or<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.610> bimetallic<00:02:49.090> strip<00:02:49.799> is

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
breaker or the bimetallic strip is

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.580 
breaker or the bimetallic strip is
heated<00:02:51.430> up<00:02:51.579> more<00:02:52.030> than<00:02:52.180> 20<00:02:52.510> amps<00:02:52.690> let's<00:02:52.900> say<00:02:53.110> 40

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.350 
heated up more than 20 amps let's say 40
amps<00:02:53.920> or<00:02:54.010> 50<00:02:54.340> amps<00:02:54.640> depending<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
amps or 50 amps depending on the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.910 
amps or 50 amps depending on the

overload or the thermal expansion
setting<00:02:57.910> let's<00:02:58.540> say<00:02:58.690> for<00:02:58.870> example<00:02:58.930> 40<00:02:59.620> amps

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
setting let's say for example 40 amps

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.140 
setting let's say for example 40 amps
what<00:03:00.129> happens<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.640> this<00:03:01.239> expands<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.319> then

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
what happens is this expands and then

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.830 
what happens is this expands and then
the<00:03:04.150> leak<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.629> taken<00:03:05.590> or<00:03:06.120> pull<00:03:07.120> back<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.690> that

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the leak is taken or pull back so that

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.680 
the leak is taken or pull back so that
the<00:03:07.959> contact<00:03:08.349> is<00:03:08.650> open<00:03:08.799> no<00:03:09.730> more<00:03:09.940> current

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
the contact is open no more current

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.309 
the contact is open no more current
supply<00:03:11.200> passes<00:03:11.739> through<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.910> now<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.989> current

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
supply passes through so now the current

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.869 
supply passes through so now the current
flows<00:03:14.590> through<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:15.069> link<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.519> through<00:03:15.730> this

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
flows through this link and through this

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.000 
flows through this link and through this
wire<00:03:16.150> through<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:16.870> contact<00:03:17.379> goes<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.920> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
wire through this contact goes to the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.309 
wire through this contact goes to the
output<00:03:18.129> terminal<00:03:18.760> now<00:03:19.390> let's<00:03:19.690> see<00:03:19.930> what

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
output terminal now let's see what

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.369 
output terminal now let's see what
happens<00:03:20.709> when<00:03:21.010> we<00:03:21.310> when<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.209> overload<00:03:22.750> gets

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
happens when we when the overload gets

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.629 
happens when we when the overload gets
so<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:25.989> how<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.290> works<00:03:26.530> I'll<00:03:27.190> show<00:03:27.579> it

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
so this is how it works I'll show it

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.759 
so this is how it works I'll show it
once<00:03:27.970> again<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.989> current<00:03:32.290> flows<00:03:32.560> it

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
once again so the current flows it

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.460 
once again so the current flows it
starts<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.340> expand<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.209> as<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.780> expand<00:03:35.230> if

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
starts to expand and as it expand if

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.240 
starts to expand and as it expand if
it's<00:03:36.459> above<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:37.000> limit<00:03:37.440> this<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.650> sliding

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
it's above the limit this is sliding

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.629 
it's above the limit this is sliding
down<00:03:39.599> thus<00:03:40.599> releasing<00:03:41.169> this<00:03:41.650> link<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.160> then

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
down thus releasing this link and then

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.909 
down thus releasing this link and then
the<00:03:43.090> link<00:03:43.329> is<00:03:43.540> open<00:03:44.049> due<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.410> spring<00:03:44.769> the

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
the link is open due to the spring the

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.640 
the link is open due to the spring the
spring<00:03:45.040> pulls<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.669> back<00:03:45.989> let's<00:03:46.989> watch<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.440> once

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
spring pulls it back let's watch it once

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.400 
spring pulls it back let's watch it once
again<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:49.269> can<00:03:49.450> see<00:03:49.630> it's<00:03:49.750> coming<00:03:49.959> back<00:03:50.230> this

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
again you can see it's coming back this

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.650 
again you can see it's coming back this
link<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.889> released<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.549> thus<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.389> being

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
link is released and thus this is being

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.539 
link is released and thus this is being
pulled<00:03:52.930> back<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.470> contacts<00:03:54.069> are<00:03:54.250> open

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
pulled back and the contacts are open

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.870 
pulled back and the contacts are open
now<00:03:54.790> now<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:59.349> breaker<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.769> in<00:04:00.069> trip<00:04:00.340> position

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
now now the breaker is in trip position

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.150 
now now the breaker is in trip position
after<00:04:01.060> it's<00:04:01.630> slipping<00:04:02.079> it's<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.620> center

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
after it's slipping it's in a center

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.270 
after it's slipping it's in a center
position<00:04:03.609> on<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:04.510> towards<00:04:05.049> this<00:04:05.319> off<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:06.040> this

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
position on is towards this off is this

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.550 
position on is towards this off is this
and<00:04:06.519> when<00:04:06.940> it's<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.299> centre<00:04:07.720> position<00:04:07.900> it's<00:04:08.410> in

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
and when it's in centre position it's in

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.069 
and when it's in centre position it's in
a<00:04:08.620> trip<00:04:08.889> position<00:04:09.400> you've<00:04:10.000> got<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.389> reset<00:04:10.900> it

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
a trip position you've got to reset it

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.449 
a trip position you've got to reset it
and<00:04:12.120> resetting<00:04:13.120> depends<00:04:13.629> upon<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:14.680> time<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
and resetting depends upon the time the

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.479 
and resetting depends upon the time the
bimetallic<00:04:15.819> strip<00:04:16.269> comes<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.489> normal

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
bimetallic strip comes to normal

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.539 
bimetallic strip comes to normal
position<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:19.180> has<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.750> bend<00:04:20.169> back<00:04:20.380> when<00:04:21.340> the

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
position it has to bend back when the

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.640 
position it has to bend back when the
current<00:04:21.880> flows<00:04:21.940> through<00:04:22.180> it<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:23.229> bimetallic

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
current flows through it the bimetallic

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.790 
current flows through it the bimetallic
strip<00:04:24.160> gets<00:04:24.639> heated<00:04:24.910> up<00:04:25.120> when<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.289> supply<00:04:26.740> is

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
strip gets heated up when the supply is

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.400 
strip gets heated up when the supply is
interrupted<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:28.180> bimetallic<00:04:28.599> strip<00:04:29.080> cools

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
interrupted the bimetallic strip cools

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.380 
interrupted the bimetallic strip cools
down<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.830> comebacks<00:04:30.250> comes<00:04:30.789> back<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.240> its

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
down and comebacks comes back to its

down and comebacks comes back to its
original<00:04:31.570> position<00:04:32.289> and<00:04:32.740> thus<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:33.250> cools

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
original position and thus it's cools

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.779 
original position and thus it's cools
down<00:04:33.780> allowing<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.590> put<00:04:36.190> off<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.520> breaker

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
down allowing you to put off the breaker

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:37.090 
down allowing you to put off the breaker
in

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
in

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.800 
in
reset<00:04:37.460> up<00:04:37.610> let's<00:04:37.970> see<00:04:38.150> now<00:04:38.300> what<00:04:38.510> happens<00:04:40.810> so

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
reset up let's see now what happens so

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.410 
reset up let's see now what happens so
after<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.680> bimetallic<00:04:43.100> strip<00:04:43.640> cools<00:04:44.270> down

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
after the bimetallic strip cools down

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.800 
after the bimetallic strip cools down
and<00:04:44.750> comes<00:04:45.110> back<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.710> its<00:04:45.860> original<00:04:46.010> position

and comes back to its original position

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.540 
and comes back to its original position
you'll<00:04:47.810> be<00:04:48.080> able<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.710> reset<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.280> circuit

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
you'll be able to reset the circuit

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.570 
you'll be able to reset the circuit
breaker<00:04:50.060> from<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.720> trip<00:04:50.960> position<00:04:51.440> as<00:04:51.920> I<00:04:52.310> said

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
breaker from the trip position as I said

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.690 
breaker from the trip position as I said
earlier<00:04:53.000> on<00:04:53.530> position<00:04:54.530> is<00:04:54.710> towards<00:04:55.100> like<00:04:55.490> this

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
earlier on position is towards like this

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.610 
earlier on position is towards like this
which<00:04:55.940> I've<00:04:56.090> shown<00:04:56.120> in<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.900> arrow<00:04:57.110> mark<00:04:57.410> off

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
which I've shown in the arrow mark off

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.580 
which I've shown in the arrow mark off
position<00:04:58.160> is<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.720> center<00:05:00.110> position

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
position is this and the center position

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.300 
position is this and the center position
will<00:05:00.800> be<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:00.980> tripped<00:05:01.400> condition<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:06.310> now

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
will be the tripped condition and now

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.630 
will be the tripped condition and now
I've<00:05:07.580> pulled<00:05:08.480> this<00:05:08.600> lever<00:05:08.930> back<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.560> let's<00:05:10.460> say

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
I've pulled this lever back to let's say

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.600 
I've pulled this lever back to let's say
I'll<00:05:10.730> show<00:05:10.910> you<00:05:10.970> once<00:05:11.240> again<00:05:12.160> now<00:05:13.160> it's<00:05:13.340> an<00:05:13.460> off

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
I'll show you once again now it's an off

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.780 
I'll show you once again now it's an off
position<00:05:13.640> and<00:05:14.540> the<00:05:14.600> contacts<00:05:15.050> are<00:05:15.260> open<00:05:15.790> now

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
position and the contacts are open now

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.950 
position and the contacts are open now
you<00:05:17.210> can<00:05:18.430> rectify<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.730> fault<00:05:20.030> and<00:05:20.240> put<00:05:20.570> it<00:05:20.720> on

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
you can rectify the fault and put it on

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.830 
you can rectify the fault and put it on
so<00:05:21.830> that<00:05:22.010> again<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.730> circuit<00:05:23.360> is<00:05:23.540> connected

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
so that again the circuit is connected

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.340 
so that again the circuit is connected
and<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.320> supply<00:05:24.740> flows<00:05:25.190> through<00:05:25.780> so<00:05:26.780> this<00:05:27.200> is

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
and the supply flows through so this is

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.990 
and the supply flows through so this is
how<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.800> circuit<00:05:28.100> breaker<00:05:28.460> works<00:05:29.450> basically<00:05:31.000> in
