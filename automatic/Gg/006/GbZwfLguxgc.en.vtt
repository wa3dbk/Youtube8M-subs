00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.930
 but who was of course very important 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.670
 game 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.830
 in view of our goal that we ourselves 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.459
 qualify for the europe league 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.260
 of course, there at home 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.840
 continue where we last game in 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.570
 wiener neustadt have stopped again 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.859
 we delivered a very good game 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.000
 of course we want that right away 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.470
 Do not just repeat tomorrow 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.939
 but we play at home and me 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.790
 think with the support again 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.530
 our great fans in the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.540
 Last play really great 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.970
 have supported and I think that that 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.700
 then tomorrow it will be like this again and 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.630
 then hope that we make these points 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.300
 while blanket dad I have the way it was 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.880
 if you then she is translated now 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.970
 think quite openly and then with that 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.770
 first and second need at the latest 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.380
 exhibitors again and drinks 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.930
 Salzburger time as they use this 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:08.170
 then as very good and and then you get 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:10.149
 66 goals is not pleasant but she 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.679
 feel Saturday morning starts again at 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.609
 0 0 and they will do everything in the 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.310
 toss the balance 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:19.170
 that they take something from tron us 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.170
 of course want to prevent the matter 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.250
 stevenson 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:42.280
 then he has very well occupied with such a thing 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.590
 wise the story was not to be expected 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.080
 you have to say honestly as you can already 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.509
 satisfied with that, too 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.190
 last nine games but as I said 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.470
 to make sure we have four more 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.390
 important games and there we want 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.060
 continue to work as successfully as 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.450
 so far and then our goals are warmer 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.450
 to reach
