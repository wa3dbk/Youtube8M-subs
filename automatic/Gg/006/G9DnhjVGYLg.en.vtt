monster<00:00:50.670> from<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:50.879> hand<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.750> pretty

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
monster from your hand so that's pretty

cool<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.250> it's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
cool and the one I really like it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.510 
cool and the one I really like it's
blurred<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.969> sheffer<00:00:54.420> which<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:56.160> uses<00:00:56.370> a

blurred to sheffer which it uses a
synchro<00:00:56.760> monster<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:58.140> might

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430

tell the wording that really great on
the<00:01:29.820> effect<00:01:30.090> yeah<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.329> guess<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.630> considered

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the effect yeah I guess it's considered

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.859 
the effect yeah I guess it's considered
just<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.380> rough<00:01:31.890> translation<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.869> liberation

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
just a rough translation and liberation

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.450 
just a rough translation and liberation
is<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> trap<00:01:34.920> card<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.310> going

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
is going to be a trap card that's going

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
is going to be a trap card that's going
to<00:01:35.549> come<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.479> activate<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> one

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to come with it you activate it one

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
to come with it you activate it one
opponent<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.009> when<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> monster<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.150> side
