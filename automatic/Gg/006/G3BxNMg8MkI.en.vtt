gonna<00:01:42.479> come<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.960> little<00:01:43.290> bit<00:01:43.470> quicker<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
gonna come in a little bit quicker a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920 
gonna come in a little bit quicker a
little<00:01:44.100> bit<00:01:44.310> faster<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.030> give<00:01:45.570> me<00:01:45.720> more

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
little bit faster to give me more

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.130 
little bit faster to give me more
rotations<00:01:46.500> around<00:01:46.700> now<00:01:47.700> when<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> turn<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.570> must

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
rotations around now when I turn I must

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.569 
rotations around now when I turn I must
spot<00:01:49.470> something<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.009> front<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.310> me

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
spot something in front of me

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.670 
spot something in front of me
so<00:01:50.939> keep<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.360> spot<00:01:51.659> until<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.350> no<00:01:52.380> longer
