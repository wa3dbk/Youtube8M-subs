00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:12.130
 Every year, about 30,000 people live in rural areas of the country. 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:15.550
 It 's relatively inexpensive and you can move the house later 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.330
 More and more people are looking for a mobile home 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.330
 I am a journalist. 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.759
 I put the finished house on the truck in the workshop. 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.289
 The place where the truck carrying the house arrived was the empty land 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:38.040
 Carefully drop the imported house and connect the electricity to the piping 2 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:41.699
 Pensions have been completed in a single day is the recent increase in demand for removable wooden houses 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.229
 The money I entered at 1 o'clock is about 1.5 million won 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:50.550
 Mobile homes that appeared 10 years ago had a steady increase in the market 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:55.259
 In 2013, it reached a size of 14 billion won . 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:00.030
 When I was a farmer, I used it as a power house or a garden farm . 

00:00:55.259 --> 00:01:05.369
 This is because of the increasing number of people who use it as a weekend house 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:10.860
 Mobile homes are mass-produced in the workplace, so they save human rights 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:14.909
 The advantage is that it is about 30% cheaper than building 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 You can also move the house to another location as needed 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.970
 There is 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.890
 And here's the arteries. There's nothing here in the morning. 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.700

 It will warm up again soon. 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 In recent years to increase the insulation effect is good durability and ux to burn out 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.960
 There are also cases where you are using an 80 form 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.440
 Firstly, it has good thermal insulation, and next time it is eco-friendly, 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:01.200
 Without such harmfulness, such insulation 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:07.229
 I have been writing heunhideul inde insulation purposes, rather than go Insulation g 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:11.730
 If you lose 1 8, you can see 1 10 times better insulation.
