00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.520
 ah 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.990
 hello will have a pure welcome from 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.469
 new friendship with today is from a recipe 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.509
 cooking is a very rich recipe and the 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.460
 very fashionable mind day I'm 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.009
 referring to students for whom not 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.840
 know it is a chickpea cream is a 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.609
 incoming cold but it's also true that 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.830
 who does it or with white beans 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.449
 or with lentils 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.369
 I 'm going to pass the recipe on how I 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.590
 I can also do other ways 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.269
 I think clearly in a very simple way 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.330
 and that for my taste it is very delicious 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:37.339
 I do not expect you to like the video that I 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.229
 comment as I always tell you that I 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.019
 put a comment down here below 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.360
 subscribe wherever you are 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.000
 the little button to subscribe and eat 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.760
 and it's up or down to you 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.390
 election and nothing else we see in the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.390
 next video 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.440
 we will need the pot of chickpeas 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.660
 cooked area of ​​lemon oil a tooth 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.619
 of garlic sesame sweet paprika and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.440
 spicy paprika will start grinding 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.150
 teeny garlic as possible 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.409
 although later we will pass the blender but 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 so that we do not have any pieces left and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.790
 every lunch we do not find it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.280
 It would be unpleasant to add the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.140
 chickpeas with the juice that you have 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.149
 that the mass is not too thick 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.580
 because it is very thick it would not end 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.500
 be rich think that you eat then 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.899
 accompanied by the pita and according to is as 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.790
 If it were a pâté then it would be 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.740
 soft 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.270
 if we say that it is thicker and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.600
 we add a little water once 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.580
 be beaten we would arrive to our liking 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 we add the lemon in this case it's 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.970
 boat because I do not get any lemon 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.760
 natural but if it were a natural lemon 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.100
 that would be his thing would be half of a 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.010
 lemon in this case to continue to pot is 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.260
 the more concentrated we are the less we add a 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.630
 chicken a handful or in my case 2 wii 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.220
 is very small hand of sesame that 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.520
 sesame would be what he called me 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.990
 tiny time is the pasta already made but 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.509
 well I already told you that my recent 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.430
 It was very easy for him to know how to make 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.900
 many ways but I do that is 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.000
 rich and simple 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.520
 also salt to taste because we have 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.950
 beaten everything well and the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.900
 pasta and soft paste that does not remain is not left 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.370
 foggy and you're done 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.980
 then we have to do is serve it in 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.270
 a fountain if it is mud very much 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.370
 best 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.250
 and we just seasoned it with the paprika 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.130
 sweet and spicy I mix it so that it does not 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.540
 is too strong happens that if 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.580
 We put only spicy for my taste is 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.190
 better but it came back depending on the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.470
 stomach how tough it is so 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.530
 always for some chickpeas without 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.050
 crush at the time of decorating but to me 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.200
 I like it better so I also put it now 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.900
 parsley a little more salt the oil 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.500
 that was for decorating and sesame and already 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.150
 is 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.070
 I hope you liked it I encourage you to 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.140
 that you prove it is very easy to do 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.480
 super economical because to measure myself and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.090
 how much a boat garbanzos 80 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.500
 cents a euro still super cheap is 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.060
 an entree that looks good 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.260
 and that is very rich I hope that I have 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.730
 liked and see you in the next 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.730
