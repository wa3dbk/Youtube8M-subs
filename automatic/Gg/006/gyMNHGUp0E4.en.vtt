 hello girls try as bial said 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.390
 We are here I have my comb 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.570
 brush we would have bought in the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 Disney to make this stylish braid 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 super fast easy and beautiful you go 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.119
 separate a strand of your split hair 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.450
 in three parts and make a normal stroke 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.000
 now you're going to add so much of the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.190
 front and back 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.250
 You get a marchinha together with the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.459
 and passes under the wick of the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.000
 half the same on top of you 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:44.670
 takes a piece of jewelry together with the side and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.970
 passes under the middle strand 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.940
 You'll do this until the end of the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.429
 hair because you can both share the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.190
 your hair in the middle as the side I left 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:00.479
 kind of on the side there then we go 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.340
 make two braids starting with this 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.009
 on the other side we'll do the same 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.530
 thing just as I taught in the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.869
 At first you're going to get the marches. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.720
 joining the side and passing through 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.890
 down from the middle wick because actually 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.410
 is an inverted braid as already 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.860
 I explained in several videos but for whom 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.959
 Do not know yet the technique is this you. 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.080
 never caught with the lateral and marches 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.890
 passes under the middle wick the same 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.290
 thing 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.840
 on the other side and when you 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.420
 hair for you to add you will 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.969
 finish with a normal twisted 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.709
 end of your hair and fasten with 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.910
 silicone rubber 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.040
 this is a simple hairstyle 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.110
 a hairstyle that does not require much 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.480
 skill you just need to know the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.060
 braid technique and france 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.700
 inverted inlay which I have already taught 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.400
 times on the channel and you 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.550
 tranquility now and ending you 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.370
 put the elastic of the color of your hair and 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.320
 will do the same thing on the other side 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.890
 You get a stir in the front. 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.050
 divided into three parts and makes a 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.480
 braided and adds the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.760
 both front and rear 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.710
 from behind picks up a messy side joint 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.720
 and passes under the middle wick to 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.820
 same thing on top 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.220
 take a marchinha together with the side and 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.770
 passes under the middle strand 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.830
 the great secret the great difference of 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.090
 inlay braid for inlay braid 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.700
 inverted is that 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.520
 In the square you pick up you move the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.060
 and goes over the goal of the 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.030
 medium 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.490
 the inverted inlay braid you pick up 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.690
 moves on the sides and passes under the 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.600
 middle wick 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.550
 This is the big big secret difference. 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.860
 in my opinion the braid 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.540
 invested ever more beautiful because she 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.420
 stands in high relief 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.680
 the other one gets smaller then you 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:03.730
 ends there with a normal braid and 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.860
 Now we'll make the hairstyle itself is 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.790
 Good, you have two transfers and 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.530
 pass 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.690
 each of these parts to the side 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.610
 opposite and fasten with color grampines 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.130
 your hair is I always say that because 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.799
 the little details that make a house 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.049
 beautiful and ugly finish a grapinho 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.510
 Yellow in large dark hair and dark 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.160
 in blond hair then to stay with 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.830
 very beautiful finish you have to 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.150
 pay attention and be capricious with 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.010
 these details 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.710
 This is the end, there's no way 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.810
 sex you hide and go putting 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.510

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.130
