my brush to be fairly dry to do this I'm

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.760 
my brush to be fairly dry to do this I'm
going<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:56.970> first<00:02:57.240> for<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.810> are<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.230> stems

or the bamboo leaves and to do that

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.040 
or the bamboo leaves and to do that
you're<00:03:02.760> going<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> little<00:03:03.810> bit<00:03:03.900> of

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
you're going to have a little bit of

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.740 
you're going to have a little bit of
hesitation<00:03:04.650> at<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.250> beginning<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.540> end

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
hesitation at the beginning and the end

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.820 
hesitation at the beginning and the end
of<00:03:07.050> each<00:03:07.230> stroke<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:09.600> angles<00:03:10.140> are<00:03:10.350> very

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
of each stroke and the angles are very

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.160 
of each stroke and the angles are very
narrow<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:12.030> see<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> angle

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
narrow you can see that the angle

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.710 
narrow you can see that the angle
between<00:03:13.200> each<00:03:13.890> stroke<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.580> very<00:03:14.610> very<00:03:15.390> narrow

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
between each stroke is very very narrow

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.560 
between each stroke is very very narrow
and<00:03:16.440> sorry<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.910> go<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.209> another<00:03:18.480> direction

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
like so and this is really the framework

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.990 
like so and this is really the framework
if<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.200> think<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.680> building<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.370> house<00:03:26.610> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
wood and the framework that's what this

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.520 
wood and the framework that's what this
is<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.820> going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.209> tell<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.630> where<00:03:31.290> your

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
is this is going to tell you where your

leaves are going to be placed and after

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.410 
leaves are going to be placed and after
you<00:03:34.620> do<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:35.280> would<00:03:35.459> go<00:03:35.640> back<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.239> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
you do that you would go back to the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.270 
you do that you would go back to the
orchid<00:03:36.780> bamboo<00:03:37.200> brush<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.980> showed<00:03:38.250> you

initially and really get it noted

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.140 
initially and really get it noted
saturated<00:03:42.660> with<00:03:42.900> me<00:03:43.140> now<00:03:43.890> my<00:03:44.280> brush<00:03:44.550> had<00:03:44.910> been

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
saturated with me now my brush had been

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.070 
saturated with me now my brush had been
wet<00:03:45.480> i<00:03:45.870> removed

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
wet i removed

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.280 
wet i removed
went<00:03:47.950> into<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.520> ink<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.420> now<00:03:49.660> I'm<00:03:49.960> going<00:03:50.170> to

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
went into the ink and now I'm going to

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.220 
went into the ink and now I'm going to
take<00:03:50.560> out<00:03:50.800> as<00:03:51.130> much<00:03:51.460> of<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:51.880> moisture<00:03:52.750> as<00:03:52.960> I

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
take out as much of that moisture as I

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.910 
take out as much of that moisture as I
can

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
can

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.400 
can
the<00:03:54.220> reason<00:03:54.730> being<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.690> more<00:03:55.720> water

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
the reason being that the more water

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.320 
the reason being that the more water
that<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:57.040> have<00:03:57.310> on<00:03:57.490> your<00:03:57.640> brush<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.120> more

start and then it's going to taper off
at<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:32.080> end<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.950> it's<00:04:33.070> very<00:04:33.370> important<00:04:33.940> that

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
your question split at the end that's

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.760 
your question split at the end that's
just<00:05:09.669> fine<00:05:09.910> don't<00:05:10.270> worry<00:05:10.390> about<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:11.080> and

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
just fine don't worry about that and

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.770 
just fine don't worry about that and
we're<00:05:12.370> going<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.610> do<00:05:12.760> one<00:05:12.940> more<00:05:13.150> stroke<00:05:13.450> and

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
we're going to do one more stroke and

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.260 
we're going to do one more stroke and
you<00:05:14.050> can<00:05:14.230> see<00:05:14.560> let's<00:05:15.220> do<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.490> couple<00:05:15.730> at<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.240> end

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
you can see let's do a couple at the end

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.340 
you can see let's do a couple at the end
this<00:05:17.260> is<00:05:17.440> called<00:05:17.680> rainy-day<00:05:17.980> bamboo<00:05:18.850> so<00:05:19.720> all

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
this is called rainy-day bamboo so all

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.400 
this is called rainy-day bamboo so all
the<00:05:21.340> brushes<00:05:21.669> and<00:05:22.240> all<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.690> subjects<00:05:23.260> have

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
the brushes and all the subjects have

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.890 
the brushes and all the subjects have
such<00:05:23.650> beautiful<00:05:24.040> names<00:05:24.220> in<00:05:24.580> which<00:05:24.820> rainy<00:05:25.450> day

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
such beautiful names in which rainy day

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.860 
such beautiful names in which rainy day
bamboo<00:05:26.410> all<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.580> leaves<00:05:27.820> would<00:05:28.090> go<00:05:28.330> down<00:05:28.600> I

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
bamboo all the leaves would go down I

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.980 
bamboo all the leaves would go down I
think<00:05:29.530> I<00:05:29.680> like<00:05:29.890> painting

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
think I like painting

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.290 
think I like painting
the<00:05:31.990> most<00:05:32.350> because<00:05:33.040> it<00:05:33.250> just<00:05:33.460> seems<00:05:33.700> to<00:05:33.970> flow

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
the most because it just seems to flow

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.900 
the most because it just seems to flow
and<00:05:34.630> of<00:05:34.990> course<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:35.380> young<00:05:35.590> is<00:05:35.950> always<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.670> go

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
and of course the young is always to go

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.830 
and of course the young is always to go
up<00:05:37.440> so<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.920> is<00:05:39.130> how<00:05:39.340> we<00:05:39.850> do<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.210> bamboo<00:05:40.600> leaf

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
up so that is how we do the bamboo leaf

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.680 
up so that is how we do the bamboo leaf
stroke<00:05:41.230> and
