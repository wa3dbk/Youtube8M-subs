00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:15.470
 goodbye to attempts at the extremes 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.420
 rumors rumors of pesos one thousand fifteen 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.760
 these rumors I am not commented on 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.150
 the past the stream but if you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.500
 you lost the ice cream or you could not be 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:33.420
 here I'll tell you again, it's not that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 according to the rumors in 2015 friends not 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.829
 will go to pc so is the according to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 rumors why this situation is 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.680
 because if they do not remember in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 previous videos had commented that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 the date of departure had already been filtered 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.230
 of this forgiveness and 15 and also on what 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.949
 platforms would be and they say that in 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.920
 no store dedicated to the video game has 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.510
 come out the pc platform does not seem 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.689
 2015 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.240
 and there also arises where this rumor 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.299
 it says why it will not go for pc 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.570
 because the team despite the team 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.420
 of fish and the team of konami is made 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.360
 difficult to make data packets and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.020
 some things for pc friends 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.750
 remember we started a 14 having a 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.509
 little delay in a matter of months not 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.299
 of data packets hopefully the 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.820
 truth that this rumor is not true anymore 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.179
 that many people use the game in 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.770
 pc to make option files hopefully and not 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.380
 let this rumor be true 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.679
 let's hope news in June the news 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.780
 konami officers and good hope and not 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.819
