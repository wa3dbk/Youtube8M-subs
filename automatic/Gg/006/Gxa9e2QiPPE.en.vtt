00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.949
 it's time to inspire creativity that's why 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.080
 we do this super nail tutorial 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.730
 innovative and versatile from a time here 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.460
 the nails have become a canvas 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.990
 to create what we want, a pair ends 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.030
 of examples of what we can get 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.090
 if we are inspired by the sprints of 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.090
 new catalog of 6 points and squares 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.839
 in our house there is always of these 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.489
 wooden sticks if the only thing you're going to 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.489
 need to create these designs 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.300
 start by applying a layer of tattoo 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.300
 seen as a fortification base 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.000
 ah 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.350
 ah 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.750
 Have your favorite colors on hand 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.800
 niles in and choose a color to be 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.800
 the basis of the design 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.160
 I chose the night in white enamel that 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.500
 It is a white base 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.400
 and I'm going to apply a first coat on 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.400
 all my men 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.920
 I'll wait for it to dry a little to 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.920
 apply a second layer 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.560
 ah 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.369
 then we must wait for 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.960
 dry these two layers very well for 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.960
 start creating our designs 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.320
 I'm back with my glazes knife 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.130
 in and now I'm going to choose the ones I'm going to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.130
 use for the video 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.070
 Let's start by making the first streaks 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.150
 to achieve some squares and I'm going to 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.150
 do with violet color 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.730
 just applied a little color on the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.410
 stick and I carefully create 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.410
 vertical hairlines 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.010
 be a prudent time to dry 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.740
 those first streaks for later 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.570
 make them horizontal and meanwhile 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.090
 I'm going to take the time to start 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.780
 to make a spike of colors in some 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 of missions 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.320
 I'm going to take the colors that I chose and I'm going 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.430
 to make little dots of colors so that 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.430
 be more fun 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.410
 That's up to everyone's taste but 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.620
 I like the little dots that look like that 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.959
 as a high relief because in addition to the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.190
 design is also on the nails with a 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.400
 little texture 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.400
 ah 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.080
 and while that first nail dries with 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.850
 little dots we are going to make the stripes that 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.370
 you need to complete the squares 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.050
 horizontal stripes so that we 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.570
 to do exactly the same way 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.750
 that the first one with a lot of care 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.290
 so that they are straight and do not damage 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.290
 design 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.960
 Ready get my first squares now 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.770
 I'm going to keep doing dots in 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.770
 some of the others 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.840
 I decided to make the design interspersed like this 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.489
 that in this new and also make some 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.579
 picture 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.579
 ah 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.419
 lots of patience to dry 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.060
 completely our design and not 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.780
 ruin it then let's apply now 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.540
 like shine another layer of sap flush this 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.250
 shine works perfect because 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.850
 any mistake we have made 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.590
 any imperfection or any point 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.930
 or crooked line that looks and 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.020
 apparently the brightness is going to order 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.210
 to solve everything I do not know why but 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.940
 it's miraculous so perfect the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.940
 lines and the design is much cuter 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.730
 ah 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.170
 dare to create different designs and 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.810
 unique in your dreams who said stickers 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.690
 when you can make yourself designs 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.240
 amazing super fast and easy with the 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.580
 nail enamels end I hope you have them 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.580
 liked and see you at the next level
