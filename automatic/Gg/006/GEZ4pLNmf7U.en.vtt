found so far is the Xbox controller
which<00:01:10.010> runs<00:01:10.340> via<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.850> script<00:01:11.570> in<00:01:11.960> Mar<00:01:12.470> 3<00:01:12.680> you

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
which runs via a script in Mar 3 you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.860 
which runs via a script in Mar 3 you
don't<00:01:13.130> need<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.550> setup<00:01:13.909> that<00:01:14.180> much<00:01:14.390> at<00:01:14.570> all<00:01:14.690> you

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
don't need to setup that much at all you

don't need to setup that much at all you
just<00:01:15.340> install<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.520> script<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.030> then<00:01:17.510> you<00:01:17.659> can

no I did actually switch off the vacuum
clamping<00:03:07.500> system<00:03:07.920> because<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.490> think<00:03:08.790> you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
clamping system because I think you

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.000 
clamping system because I think you
can't<00:03:09.180> really<00:03:09.390> hear<00:03:09.690> me<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.830> not

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
can't really hear me if it's on it's not

that<00:03:11.190> loud<00:03:11.400> actually<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> don't<00:03:12.420> know<00:03:12.600> how

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that loud actually but I don't know how

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.650 
that loud actually but I don't know how
the<00:03:12.870> camera<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.800> gonna<00:03:14.010> pick<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:15.240> we

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the camera is gonna pick it up so we

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.240 
the camera is gonna pick it up so we
have<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.020> router<00:03:16.290> bit<00:03:16.500> sitting<00:03:16.830> right<00:03:17.010> above

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
have the router bit sitting right above

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.870 
have the router bit sitting right above
the<00:03:17.430> edge<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> part<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.739> now<00:03:19.739> we're<00:03:20.730> gonna

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
the edge of the part and now we're gonna

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.330 
the edge of the part and now we're gonna
find<00:03:21.810> zero<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.800> edge<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:25.800> find<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> path

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
find zero on the edge to find the path

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.340 
find zero on the edge to find the path
zero<00:03:26.760> i<00:03:26.850> used<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.510> i've<00:03:27.750> made<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.200> myself

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
zero i used this i've made it myself

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.470 
zero i used this i've made it myself
it's<00:03:28.709> quite<00:03:29.340> simple<00:03:29.730> actually<00:03:29.819> it's<00:03:30.150> just<00:03:30.360> a

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
it's quite simple actually it's just a

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.740 
it's quite simple actually it's just a
piece<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> plastic<00:03:30.930> i<00:03:31.650> routed<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:33.209> put<00:03:33.630> on

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
piece of plastic i routed and put on

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.770 
piece of plastic i routed and put on
this<00:03:33.950> metal<00:03:34.950> piece<00:03:35.130> there<00:03:35.630> don't<00:03:36.630> actually

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
this metal piece there don't actually

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.259 
this metal piece there don't actually
know<00:03:37.050> what<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.380> was<00:03:37.560> was<00:03:37.920> some<00:03:38.250> kind<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.090> power

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
know what it was was some kind of power

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.580 
know what it was was some kind of power
you<00:03:39.390> can<00:03:39.540> make<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.780> by<00:03:39.900> yourself<00:03:40.260> out<00:03:40.410> of

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you can make it by yourself out of

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.910 
you can make it by yourself out of
aluminium<00:03:40.830> or<00:03:41.370> whatever<00:03:42.230> this<00:03:43.230> works<00:03:43.560> quite

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
aluminium or whatever this works quite

00:03:43.920 --> 00:04:01.720 
aluminium or whatever this works quite
good<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.760> now<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.510> part<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.959> gary's

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
good and now this is part of gary's

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.309 
good and now this is part of gary's
screen<00:04:02.730> sight<00:04:02.970> i<00:04:03.120> can<00:04:03.390> just<00:04:03.540> push<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> button<00:04:03.959> on

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
screen sight i can just push a button on

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.930 
screen sight i can just push a button on
the<00:04:04.470> xbox<00:04:04.800> controller<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.519> finds<00:04:05.819> the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
the xbox controller and it finds the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:37.900 
the xbox controller and it finds the
center<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.989> world<00:04:07.530> cut<00:04:07.829> out

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.700 

if<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.060> ever<00:04:39.180> look<00:04:39.660> back<00:04:39.720> at<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.259> computer

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
if you ever look back at the computer

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.279 
if you ever look back at the computer
running<00:04:40.889> math<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.490> can<00:04:41.669> already<00:04:41.970> see<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.690> said

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
running math you can already see it said

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.790 
running math you can already see it said
X<00:04:43.680> &amp;<00:04:43.949> Y<00:04:43.979> by<00:04:44.430> itself<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:45.000> zero<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:46.110> now<00:04:46.470> we<00:04:46.530> know

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
X &amp; Y by itself to zero so now we know

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.469 
X &amp; Y by itself to zero so now we know
exactly<00:04:47.220> where<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.669> edge<00:04:47.789> of<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.120> part<00:04:48.389> is

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
exactly where the edge of the part is

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.529 
exactly where the edge of the part is
this<00:04:48.780> is<00:04:49.009> even<00:04:50.009> if<00:04:50.129> it<00:04:50.250> doesn't<00:04:50.490> look<00:04:51.090> like<00:04:51.360> it

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
this is even if it doesn't look like it

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.240 
this is even if it doesn't look like it
but<00:04:51.690> it's<00:04:51.870> pretty<00:04:52.259> accurate<00:04:52.500> down<00:04:53.009> to<00:04:53.220> a

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
but it's pretty accurate down to a

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.360 
but it's pretty accurate down to a
hundred<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.449> a<00:04:54.659> millimeter<00:04:57.800> know<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:59.220> we

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
hundred of a millimeter know that we

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.050 
hundred of a millimeter know that we
found<00:04:59.699> X<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.449> y<00:05:00.569> we<00:05:01.020> need<00:05:01.169> that<00:05:01.669> that<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:02.819> also

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
found X and y we need that that is also

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.230 
found X and y we need that that is also
found<00:05:03.889> by<00:05:04.889> a<00:05:04.919> strip<00:05:05.280> from<00:05:05.430> Gary<00:05:05.729> screen<00:05:06.060> set

again we have my touch probe we're gonna
run<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.610> router<00:05:12.120> bit<00:05:12.389> down<00:05:12.810> close<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:17.960> know

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
run the router bit down close to it know

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.350 
run the router bit down close to it know
that<00:05:19.229> it<00:05:19.380> sits<00:05:19.650> right<00:05:19.860> above<00:05:20.159> it<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.550> gonna

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
that it sits right above it and gonna

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.680 
that it sits right above it and gonna
execute<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.990> script<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.620> finding<00:05:23.009> Z<00:05:29.659> so<00:05:30.659> now
