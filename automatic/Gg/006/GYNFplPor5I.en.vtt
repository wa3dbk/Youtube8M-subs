 in knowing the daily life of the Greeks 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.530

 in the upper part and in the handles 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.850
 we find an intense scroll decoration that almost prevents 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.720
 contemplate the background 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.560

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.630
 before the armed fire while another standing centaur prepares to launch his 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.360
 weapon 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.070

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.930

 when representing the amazons the world of barbarism the disorder in front of the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.920
 orderly Hellenic civilization had to be fought and overcome
