00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.290
 here is how those who do not feel 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.259
 they paid the bill in the middle of the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.510
 dark they see nothing they buy things but 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 they know that without electricity they cannot 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.009
 not even use them 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.929
 and then the time has come to pay a 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.940
 the time has come to buy a generator 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 electrical what a generator is 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.800
 electric with what with 50 euros of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.320
 green gas or diesel allows you 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.080
 to turn on the fantastic magic is not 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.180
 certainly true apart from the noise it does not 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.829
 What is negligible waking my 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.210
 son sleeping behind me but the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.520
 message that I want to launch today is 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 much deeper than stonex one not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.290
 produces generators we will be the first 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.539
 company in the world of technology a 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.280
 tell what the costs are 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.129
 production of all smartphones 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.989
 storex one account that pierino must 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.320
 to buy a high-end cell phone the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:02.160
 mom says how much child it costs 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.860
 and he answers 700 pope 109 100 ma 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.170
 according to you the mother who takes it indeed 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.210
 let's take the case that pierino has 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.780
 only a part of the money 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.880
 serve 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.970
 I will give him the chance to buy 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.790
 our technology almost at the price of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.490
 production in pierino in the last ones 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.689
 weeks I received phone calls 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.490
 nice called me superpippo 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.780
 because he wanted to be my bodyguard 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.850
 but I told him there was no need 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.100
 for this project because this 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 fortunately it's not my project not 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.210
 this is the largest project 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.220
 advertising without having a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 project we do not see projects but 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.740
 solid reality is very important to us 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.150
 and go immediately immediately to www.no 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.579
 I remember point com 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.490
 sign up because they will soon start 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.340
 North and some of you ask me 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.869
 because I wear these glasses 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.520
 these glasses are called spec 3 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.649
 spectra is an Italian start up of a 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.670
 guy who made himself from scratch and is 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.079
 conquering the world 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.630
 every time I wear these glasses 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.700
 magically i only see 0 someone i am 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.250

 ipad by steve jobs steve jobs 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.080
 surely he invented a lot of 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.330
 things but he was not the first a 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.500
 put these glasses because the first one 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.210
 to put these glasses on 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.390
