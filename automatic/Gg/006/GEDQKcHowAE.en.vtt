00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.040
 every human being has the instinct 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.710
 primary to help others if a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.139
 hiker is lost in the mountain the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.070
 people organize their search 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.630
 if an earthquake ravages a city 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.690
 people from all over the world send help 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.000
 humanitarian 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.250
 this instinct is found in all 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.250
 cultures without exception 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.730
 towards 4:30 to the satellites 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:38.920
 they detected a storm that was approaching 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.309
 to the mission camp to stress in 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.309
 Tuesday 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.859
 it was growing in intensity 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.870
 and we had to suspend the mission 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.239
 during the evacuation 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.250
 the astronaut mark one and he died 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.870
 or not 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:12.049
 I have decided to record this diary 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.170
 I am marwat and I continue with life as it is 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.380
 you can check 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.240
 I can not contact the nasa and with me 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.040
 crew and even if I got it 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.500
 it would take four years to send another 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.229
 manned mission in my search and I'm 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.119
 in a habitat designed for a month before 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.399
 this perspective is not hopeful either 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.720
 I only have one option to resort to 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.720
 science to get ahead 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.230
 very good we go with the calculations should I 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.270
 discover how to grow food for 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.730
 four years on a planet where it does not grow 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.500
 nothing 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.270
 although if he could not establish contact 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.270
 with nasa nothing of these reserves 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.530
 houston we received a message from 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.480
 video directed at the crew give the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.230
 play 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.230
 my god 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.170
 marwan and still alive 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.539
 taken in amsterdam 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.730
 we leave you behind let's save this 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.370
 it's something that NASA has rejected so 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.260
 we talk about a reason a failure in the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.450
 collection of supplies in orbit and 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.210
 we mold a failure in the assistance 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.780
 gravitational terrestrial 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.780
 and we will die 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:41.569
 is the space here nothing is fascinating 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.950
 or be sure you have some time 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.950
 everything can go to hell 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.230
 and you are going to say it is already 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.319
 it's over 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.150
 it is possible that he is still alive
