and<00:00:37.100> if<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.250> open<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:42.320> right<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.710> just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and if we open it up right here we just

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.940 
and if we open it up right here we just
have<00:00:44.100> foam<00:00:45.030> nerf<00:00:45.780> pieces<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
have foam nerf pieces and that's just to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.470 
have foam nerf pieces and that's just to
help<00:00:46.980> brace<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.660> battery<00:00:49.250> inside<00:00:50.480> the

help brace the battery inside the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.860 
help brace the battery inside the
container<00:00:52.730> we<00:00:53.730> remove<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.270> foam<00:00:54.570> pieces

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
container we remove these foam pieces

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
container we remove these foam pieces
we'll<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> better<00:00:55.829> look<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.730> makes<00:00:56.940> up

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
we'll get a better look at what makes up

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.819 
we'll get a better look at what makes up
this<00:00:57.420> container<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> here<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.440> using

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
this container here so here we are using

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.740 
this container here so here we are using
a<00:01:03.769> u<00:01:04.769> PG<00:01:05.220> brand<00:01:05.580> battery<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.510> we've

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
a u PG brand battery which we've

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.929 
a u PG brand battery which we've
actually<00:01:06.990> had<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> lot<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.650> good<00:01:07.830> luck<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:10.939> we

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
actually had a lot of good luck with we

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.060 
actually had a lot of good luck with we
had<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.420> connectors<00:01:13.080> right<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.979> got

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
had those connectors right there we got

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
had those connectors right there we got
the<00:01:14.250> SAE<00:01:14.670> connector<00:01:15.680> coming<00:01:16.680> off<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.869> coming

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the SAE connector coming off of coming

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.990 
the SAE connector coming off of coming
off<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.200> terminals<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
off the terminals and then we have it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.960 
off the terminals and then we have it
going<00:01:21.299> into<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> switch<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.610> out<00:01:26.610> into

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
going into a switch and then out into

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.050 
going into a switch and then out into
here<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.439> only<00:01:28.500> part<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.490> captured

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
here so the only part that's captured

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.280 
here so the only part that's captured
into<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> switch<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> positive<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
into the switch is the positive the

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.640 
into the switch is the positive the
positive<00:01:34.290> wire<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:36.030> white<00:01:36.240> wire<00:01:36.650> doesn't

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
positive wire the white wire doesn't

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
positive wire the white wire doesn't
even<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.920> through<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> switch<00:01:38.509> just<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
even go through the switch just so you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.390 
even go through the switch just so you
guys<00:01:40.079> are<00:01:40.290> familiar<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.860> how<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> switch

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
guys are familiar with how the switch

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.370 
guys are familiar with how the switch
works<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.450> switch<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.720> has<00:01:43.140> two

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
works the switch just has two

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.389 
works the switch just has two
connections<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.259> opened<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.890> closes

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
connections so it just opened and closes

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.710 
connections so it just opened and closes
the<00:01:47.759> circuit<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.869> red<00:01:49.799> positive<00:01:50.399> wire<00:01:50.720> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the circuit of the red positive wire and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.200 
the circuit of the red positive wire and
this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> waterproof<00:01:52.500> switch<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.369> will<00:01:54.090> have

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this is a waterproof switch I will have

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.280 
this is a waterproof switch I will have
that<00:01:54.450> linked<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> video<00:01:55.110> description

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that linked in the video description

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.609 
that linked in the video description
below<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.280> well<00:01:56.930> then<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.439> into

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
below as well then we have it go into

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.580 
below as well then we have it go into
what's<00:01:59.070> called<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.729> planned<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:00.840> cable<00:02:01.350> gland

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
what's called a planned here cable gland

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.910 
what's called a planned here cable gland
and<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.310> allows<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.119> watertight<00:02:03.540> seal<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.799> be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and this allows a watertight seal to be

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
and this allows a watertight seal to be
made<00:02:05.159> around<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:06.210> cable<00:02:07.280> so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
made around a cable so

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.599 
made around a cable so
very<00:02:10.929> very<00:02:11.170> handy<00:02:11.560> you'll<00:02:11.799> see<00:02:12.010> us<00:02:12.159> use<00:02:12.400> these

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.609 
very very handy you'll see us use these

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.179 
very very handy you'll see us use these
in<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.939> lot<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.150> other<00:02:13.389> videos<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.069> get

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
in a lot of other videos you can get

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.619 
in a lot of other videos you can get
them<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.370> stainless<00:02:15.639> steel<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.359> can<00:02:16.510> get

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
them in stainless steel and you can get

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.220 
them in stainless steel and you can get
them<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.930> plastic<00:02:18.719> composite<00:02:19.719> material

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
them in a plastic composite material

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.589 
them in a plastic composite material
here<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.799> example<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.540> plastic<00:02:24.719> water<00:02:25.719> gland

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
here is example of a plastic water gland

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.789 
here is example of a plastic water gland
so<00:02:28.599> that's<00:02:29.260> plastic<00:02:29.790> water<00:02:30.790> cable<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:32.680> are

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
so that's plastic water cable and we are

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.209 
so that's plastic water cable and we are
using<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.159> PG<00:02:33.730> seven<00:02:34.480> one<00:02:34.689> and<00:02:35.040> those<00:02:36.040> are

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.360 
well just to make it easy for you then
we<00:02:40.329> have<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.599> going<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:41.079> an<00:02:41.230> SAE<00:02:41.680> connector

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
we have it going to an SAE connector

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.690 
we have it going to an SAE connector
again<00:02:43.200> now<00:02:44.200> you're<00:02:44.530> thinking<00:02:44.859> well<00:02:45.040> what<00:02:45.459> if<00:02:45.579> I

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
again now you're thinking well what if I

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.909 
again now you're thinking well what if I
have<00:02:45.909> more<00:02:46.389> than<00:02:46.569> one<00:02:46.900> item<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.620> want<00:02:47.829> to

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
have more than one item I want to

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:52.259 
have more than one item I want to
connect<00:02:48.389> to<00:02:49.389> you<00:02:50.079> know<00:02:50.169> the<00:02:50.349> battery<00:02:50.530> or<00:02:51.400> what

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
connect to you know the battery or what

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.569 
connect to you know the battery or what
I<00:02:52.299> do<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.109> we<00:02:53.769> have<00:02:53.889> a<00:02:53.919> good<00:02:54.099> solution<00:02:54.370> for

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
I do and we have a good solution for

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.720 
I do and we have a good solution for
that<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.299> what<00:02:56.169> we<00:02:56.319> did<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:56.949> actually<00:02:57.280> ended

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
that so what we did is we actually ended

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.970 
that so what we did is we actually ended
up<00:02:57.879> getting<00:02:58.150> one<00:02:58.299> of<00:02:58.329> these<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:05.620> allows

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
up getting one of these so this allows

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.659 
up getting one of these so this allows
you<00:03:06.159> to<00:03:06.280> plug<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.290> into<00:03:08.290> here<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.859> then

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
you to plug this and into here and then

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.369 
you to plug this and into here and then
you<00:03:09.879> end<00:03:10.000> up<00:03:10.209> with<00:03:10.480> four<00:03:10.900> more<00:03:11.139> connections

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
you end up with four more connections

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.429 
you end up with four more connections
and<00:03:15.299> you're<00:03:16.299> thinking<00:03:16.509> well<00:03:16.780> these<00:03:17.079> probably

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
and you're thinking well these probably

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.210 
and you're thinking well these probably
are<00:03:17.620> incredibly<00:03:18.220> water<00:03:18.549> resistant<00:03:19.359> well<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
are incredibly water resistant well the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.309 
are incredibly water resistant well the
12-volt<00:03:21.970> battery<00:03:22.449> is<00:03:22.569> not<00:03:22.750> inherently

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
12-volt battery is not inherently

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.280 
12-volt battery is not inherently
dangerous<00:03:24.069> it's<00:03:24.609> not<00:03:24.699> like<00:03:25.049> your<00:03:26.049> wall

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
dangerous it's not like your wall

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.189 
dangerous it's not like your wall
outlets<00:03:26.769> when<00:03:27.040> water<00:03:27.280> comes<00:03:27.729> in<00:03:27.849> contact<00:03:28.199> it's

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
outlets when water comes in contact it's

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.420 
outlets when water comes in contact it's
not<00:03:29.470> going<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:30.959> electrocute<00:03:31.959> anything<00:03:32.439> it's

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
not going to electrocute anything it's

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.979 
not going to electrocute anything it's
going<00:03:33.639> to<00:03:33.699> take<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.000> path<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.509> the<00:03:34.780> least

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
going to take the path of the least

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.719 
going to take the path of the least
resistance<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.859> stuff<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.220> it's<00:03:36.340> going<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.519> go

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
resistance and stuff so it's going to go

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.699 
resistance and stuff so it's going to go
through<00:03:36.939> these<00:03:37.030> cables<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.750> mean<00:03:38.409> these<00:03:38.530> are

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
through these cables I mean these are

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.890 
through these cables I mean these are
the<00:03:38.799> same<00:03:39.009> style<00:03:39.459> cables<00:03:39.970> kind<00:03:40.449> of<00:03:40.599> that<00:03:40.750> you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
the same style cables kind of that you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.369 
the same style cables kind of that you
would<00:03:41.049> expect<00:03:41.349> on<00:03:41.590> trailer<00:03:42.040> hitches<00:03:42.959> which<00:03:43.959> I

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
would expect on trailer hitches which I

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.059 
would expect on trailer hitches which I
mean<00:03:44.680> get<00:03:45.009> a<00:03:45.430> lot<00:03:45.609> of<00:03:45.879> a<00:03:46.259> lot<00:03:47.259> of<00:03:47.290> moisture<00:03:47.889> and

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
mean get a lot of a lot of moisture and

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.629 
mean get a lot of a lot of moisture and
stuff<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.669> them<00:03:49.259> so<00:03:50.259> these<00:03:51.159> are<00:03:51.340> these<00:03:51.579> are

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
stuff to them so these are these are

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.719 
stuff to them so these are these are
pretty<00:03:51.909> good<00:03:52.120> connections<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.840> be<00:03:52.930> using

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
pretty good connections to be using

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:57.270 
pretty good connections to be using
there<00:03:54.729> are<00:03:54.909> ones<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.719> are<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:56.680> know<00:03:56.799> they

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
there are ones that are you know they

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.339 
there are ones that are you know they
have<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.430> seal<00:03:57.759> around<00:03:57.969> them<00:03:58.329> so<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.900> mean<00:03:59.079> you

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
have a seal around them so I mean you

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.499 
have a seal around them so I mean you
can<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.949> can<00:04:00.189> find<00:04:00.519> ones<00:04:00.759> that<00:04:00.879> are<00:04:01.000> truly

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:01.509 
can you can find ones that are truly

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.179 
can you can find ones that are truly
waterproof<00:04:01.719> but<00:04:02.560> we<00:04:02.709> have<00:04:02.829> had<00:04:03.009> no<00:04:03.159> issues

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
waterproof but we have had no issues

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.270 
waterproof but we have had no issues
with<00:04:03.729> this<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.590> we'll<00:04:05.590> have<00:04:05.829> this<00:04:06.009> in<00:04:06.189> the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
with this and we'll have this in the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.369 
with this and we'll have this in the
video<00:04:06.519> description<00:04:06.669> below<00:04:07.120> as<00:04:07.479> well<00:04:07.840> for<00:04:08.229> you

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:12.039 
just to make this an easy build but

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.039 
just to make this an easy build but
there<00:04:12.639> you<00:04:12.789> have<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.150> that's<00:04:13.359> kind<00:04:13.689> of<00:04:13.719> just<00:04:13.900> a

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
there you have it that's kind of just a

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.219 
there you have it that's kind of just a
look<00:04:14.229> at<00:04:14.609> how<00:04:15.609> to<00:04:15.669> have<00:04:15.939> power<00:04:16.209> flow<00:04:16.719> on<00:04:16.900> water

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
look at how to have power flow on water

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.930 
look at how to have power flow on water
