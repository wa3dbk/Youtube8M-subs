00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
armor all over them but you can choose

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.280 
armor all over them but you can choose
how<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:25.980> take<00:02:26.280> them<00:02:26.489> out<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.660> instance<00:02:28.050> if

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
how to take them out so for instance if

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.890 
how to take them out so for instance if
you<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.370> there's<00:02:29.580> too<00:02:29.879> many<00:02:30.030> robots<00:02:30.480> for

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
you want if there's too many robots for

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.630 
you want if there's too many robots for
you<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.080> take<00:02:31.260> down<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.129> shoot<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.459> head

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
you to take down you can shoot the head

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.360 
you to take down you can shoot the head
off<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.819> one<00:02:33.150> robot<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.379> they<00:02:34.830> can't<00:02:35.099> see

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
off of one robot and then they can't see

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.160 
off of one robot and then they can't see
so<00:02:35.940> they'll<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.299> keep<00:02:36.450> shooting<00:02:36.810> blindly

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
so they'll just keep shooting blindly

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.750 
so they'll just keep shooting blindly
and<00:02:37.349> they<00:02:37.440> can<00:02:37.590> take<00:02:37.769> out<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.069> enemies<00:02:38.430> with

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760

you or you can shoot out their legs and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.430 
you or you can shoot out their legs and
slow<00:02:41.910> their<00:02:42.150> approach<00:02:42.599> but<00:02:43.019> they're<00:02:43.200> still

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
slow their approach but they're still

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.020 
slow their approach but they're still
alive<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.980> they<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.190> still<00:02:44.400> crawl<00:02:44.640> towards

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that was an interesting perspective

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.949 
that was an interesting perspective
because<00:02:47.730> there<00:02:48.150> was<00:02:48.299> one<00:02:48.420> part<00:02:48.690> where<00:02:48.870> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
ways because the bosses have that

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.080 
ways because the bosses have that
procedural<00:03:10.230> damage<00:03:10.620> effect<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.700> course

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
procedural damage effect and of course

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.759 
procedural damage effect and of course
action<00:03:12.510> shooter<00:03:12.810> but<00:03:12.959> there<00:03:13.110> are<00:03:13.260> what<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> like
