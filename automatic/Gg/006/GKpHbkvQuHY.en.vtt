00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.730
 together 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.549
 principal and therefore 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.180
 the images of this first period and 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.450
 the occases 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.220
 signed or soul we see together so 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.760
 the mouloudia who returned very early 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.560
 in this match against nigeria and the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.740
 jsm the internet first to the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.810
 first minute with this head there 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 always had the rosea player who was 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.330
 present and zerara which demonstrates that he is 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.489
 the strong man of the jsm bejaia him who has 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.800
 been often at the origin of the passes 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.920
 decisive but there have been a lot of 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.540
 clumsiness that allowed the mouloudia to 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.540
 get back quickly from this match and 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.660
 to gain confidence as we go 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.640
 go together the images there so this 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.149
 missed opportunity of these hot after this 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.190
 hot yachir job that does not have 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.870
 still found his cruising speed and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.329
 besides the question also that remain 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.830
 asked well we can say that this is where the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 question to which specialists 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.229
 will answer these days will this all 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 was the ideal man to go to vote this 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.830
 penalty we know is hot to is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.369
 gone through a period a little bit 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.070
 difficult 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.670
 it was not incorporated by djamel 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.210
 menad 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.710
 the player was unhappy considering his place 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.780
 of international so today is this 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.420
 that was really the right man 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.280
 for special beauty on one side 6h woods 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.210
 had scored the goal would be was 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.970
 maybe the click 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 but there we see a little bit of a jude 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.060
 so little to everything that is after missing 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.380
 this penalty that has not returned 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.939
 directly in this match that was 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.140
 affected going there I was looking for the word 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.049
 affected after this failure is what you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.189
 think that adding will find it 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.530
 found in the second period in a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.659
 better shape or finally menad 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.979
 preferred our player to his place I think 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.509
 that I wish it is a player who has 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.220
 talent is the only back side 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.890
 very fast at a time it is very fast 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.090
 he dribbles he defends he scores on ball 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.040
 stopped this is the best currently 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.600
 on the free kicks remembers with 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.650
 the sporting agreement of sÃ©tif is a 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.299
 question of confidence and especially 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.180
 matter of time and English only purpose 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.989
 the big days and radu wind it's a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.220
 slump 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.410
 let's look at his eyes we see the expression 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.030
 they seek each other they do not arrive 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.560
 still to find but you do not have to 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.739
 forget that today there is another 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.120
 will sell ride for the dams 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.190
 frankly it's the man of the first 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.220
 half time I am and severed by his 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.480
 performance and during this procession 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.210
 true rejoice alain michel 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.270
 since today he can be proud of 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.790
 the jsm bejaia has to see together 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.450
 the goals scored during this 1st 2nd 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.600
 period 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.530
 first of all boussaha the 68th minute on 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.990
 penalty opens the scoring for the jsmb dia 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.450
 on this boussaha penalty that came 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.300
 to be incorporated by alain michel 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.320
 we can say coach so winning coaching 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.840
 from alain michel 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.280
 and then I live the providential man of 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.880
 mouloudia d'alger who sets the record straight 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.459
 on time in the 81st minute dalit who 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.410
 thus marks his eighth goal of the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.390
 season and already said that they confirm 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.730
 especially his summoning as a team 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.890
 national is the man fit for 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.500
 the moment from the side of Mouloudia d'Algiers 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.750
 a second period where we saw a lot 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.230
 commitment from both teams 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.970
 with in particular his two achievements and 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.000
 this tie youssef as said 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.640
 week in izia the girl we go together 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.190
 the images we see elsewhere 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.920
 penalty shoot well intercepted by 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.250
 janet who followed the trajectory of the 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.730
 ball 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.730
 jobs
