00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.759
 today we are going to prepare some delicious 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.799
 we need a glass 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.570
 of milk a trickle of konya or rum 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.670
 large spoonful of butter one 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.500
 spoonful of sugar three tablespoons alright 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.470
 filled with flour a sachet of yeast 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.110
 powder three or four eggs sugar and 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.770
 cinnamon to coat them and oil 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.930
 sunflower to fry them 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.820
 first we will mix the flour with the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.820
 yeast and so we will have it ready 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.560
 and we will do the same with sugar and 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.560
 cinnamon to coat the end 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.289
 we take more or less cinnamon according to 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.289
 like 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 in a pan or saucepan 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.540
 pour a glass of milk the trickle of 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.010
 rum or cognac there are people who are zest 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.590
 of lemon or lemon peel and then the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.630
 set aside a large spoonful of 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.620
 butter we're going to go 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.620
 undoing in that milk 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.740
 and as now it is the pride the sweets 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.820
 we are going to add a spoonful of 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.820
 sugar too 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.830
 we mix it until everything is undone 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.830
 the butter 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.670
 once it has been undone 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.340
 we tossed the flour that we had mixed 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.850
 with the yeast they call this 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.350
 it means that we miss it all the time 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.930
 not little by little and we started 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.970
 remove it to make a mass 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.440
 that does not have to be stuck in the pan or 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.440
 in the pot where you are preparing 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.580
 you will see how it thickens 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.460
 a kind of ball is created 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.250
 we could say that as you can see 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.120
 it moves as if by the pan it does not stay 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.120
 nothing stuck to it 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.630
 once we have it 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.290
 we're going to put it in a bowl so that it 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.290
 cool a little 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.380
 when it's warm , we 'll go 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.730
 throwing the eggs one by one 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.160
 we wait for it to be warm so that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.200
 eggs do not set in when you throw them 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.780
 and we go one at a time until 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.400
 mixing the well 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.190
 and we will not throw the next one until 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.200
 is well absorbed by the dough 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.200
 now it's time to do a little arm 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.610
 to mix life 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.780
 you see that you can not see anything even the 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.040
 shine of the egg then when we already have 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.450
 the mass well 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.770
 that has incorporated the first egg well 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.770
 we add the second 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:16.440
 and we do the same mix 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.129
 well mixed until it has 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.129
 absorbed whole 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.620
 so the mass is lightening 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.680
 until we get the point that 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.170
 we need to throw the third egg and 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.950
 depending on how we see maybe we need 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.950
 another one 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.490
 the dough has to be more or less like this 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.490
 neither liquid nor thick the good ones 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.420
 Cooks say that it falls like a tie 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.300
 then if you see that you have not stayed 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.640
 so you need another egg or half 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.130
 egg just add jce and if not then 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.830
 It's enough 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.460
 in the pan pour a good amount 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.460
 of sunflower oil 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.340
 and we put it to heat 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.530
 and a little trick so that it does not stick 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.510
 the mass would be 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.200
 and put the spoons in that oil that 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.440
 now it 's cold 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.330
 we wet them well with oil and so on 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.310
 time to take the dough to prepare the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.310
 models will not stick 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.229
 you see take the dough perfectly another 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.390
 trick a little bit of dough in that 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.870
 oil 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.340
 and as you see according to day it stays still and 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.630
 when kneading starts to float it is 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.680
 when the oil is at its point to 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.410
 start frying them very fast 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.150
 we are taking small balls because 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.150
 remember that the fritters are small 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.540
 and so we are going to prepare them with 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.540
 little amount every time 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.460
 you see how they are inflating 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.870
 and they are taking the round shape or 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.870
 practically round 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.530
 well they say when the donuts 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.530
 they are alone they turn around 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.530
 and you are going to see that it is true but of all 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.960
 ways I would recommend that you help them 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.160
 it's a little bit because mainly because 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.949
 at the end when the oil is more 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.419
 hot we do not want to cost us 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.820
 too much because the donuts must 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.199
 Be golden but not brown when 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.230
 the oil is hotter 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.210
 we run that danger 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.980
 when we're getting yellow 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.640
 you see they're golden brown that are not 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.250
 still brown we are taking them out 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.000
 absorbent paper to remove the 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.000
 excess fat 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.629
 it is leaving a gold golden color 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.810
 then let the catching and re 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.940
 we enjoyed in that mixture that we had 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.080
 made of sugar with cinnamon 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.080
 good bañaditos 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.010
 You see why they call Wind 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:47.080
 well and so we go frying all up 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:47.080
 that we finish the dough 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:53.100
 and then reviewing the of course in the 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:54.630
 sugar and cinnamon 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.520
 now let's open them so you can see 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.340
 how they are inside because they are 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.060
 called buñuelos de viento see you are left 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.060
 like a hole 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.610
 they are super light and that's why there is 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.680
 where they can be filled with cream 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.550
 cream jam chocolate what more you 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:16.590
 like it but anyway just 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.590
 well with a good chocolate bowl 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:23.250
 we would not need anything else to 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.430
 enjoy the delicious donuts of 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.430
 wind 

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:35.129
 I hope you liked it and that the 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:35.129
 prepare jce
