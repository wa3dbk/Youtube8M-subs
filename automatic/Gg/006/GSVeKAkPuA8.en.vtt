00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 two 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.950
 i 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.520
 or the chemistry of laferrere again 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 we are going to use flower to make a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.950
 flower stamps set card of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.220
 latina craft that I designed first we go 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.370
 to grab a paper from solar mine white 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 which is pre-cut to the extent of 11 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.390
 inches by 4 inches and a quarter and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.070
 We bend to the extent of 5 inches and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.650
 mean in this way we generate a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.300
 card that opens up if 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.520
 you want to know how the bases are made 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.590
 Card clicks on the link 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.680
 appears on the screen we also grab a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.530
 piece of paper colored girl being 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.720
 shelf is kraft color that is cut 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.880
 on average 5 inches and 4 inches 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.340
 and a quarter exactly like the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.890
 size of the card we are going to Sara 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.020
 flogger to plan a bit the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.330
 card to achieve is going to be saying a 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 message for that let's use these what 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.030
 what about mom elephant who are called 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.640
 pitch and I are going to use the one that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.850
 it looks like a line 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.560
 simple dialog bubble once you already 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.870
 we have more or less thought how is it going to 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.810
 be the card are we going to emerge 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.090
 talk mark king before we passed the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.640
 unsightly pillow 2 taken to be 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.800
 stamped so it does not stick 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.530
 less dust we want and are we going to 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.840
 flower placing from below the line 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 of the dialogue balloon doing pressure 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.090
 constant sprinkle with powders to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 white engravings of ward and 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.560
 we melted everything with the heat gun 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.960
 Now that we have a flower 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.450
 perfectly stamped and engraved let's go 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.810
 to color it using colored pencils 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.229
 of grand h pink for the ears and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.090
 white for all the rest of your hairs 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.959
 I recommend that when coloring with pencils 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.940
 of colors the pencil stroke continue in the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.010
 flower hair trajectory of that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.130
 way they will achieve a much more coloring 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.930
 real that coloring in another way for 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.630
 Give black color to eyes and nose 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.819
 we use kopic multi lainer color black 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.349
 number 0 3 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.420
 we dry ourselves with the heat gun 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.670
 because if you do not fall wounds 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.920
 stain the fingers 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.290
 now we place the panel where it is 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.480
 colored flogger exactly in the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.730
 center of the card we adhere with a 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.360
 little bit of post-it tape and we place the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.430
 die on the two papers also what 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.410
 we say with post-it tape and die-cut 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.300
 with the notice in this way we are going to 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.459
 cut the two papers with the shape of the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.100
 die the white that is in the background and the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.230
 kraft color that is up once 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.989
 we already have everything die-cut we're going to 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.300
 make the craft paper continue the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.400
 white paper then the bubble of 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.330
 flogger dialog will be white and 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.459
 the background actually brown and when 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.110
 let's raise the dialogue bubble by 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.019
 below is the message that each 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.120
 one is going to write to the person who 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.940
 send this card that is also going to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.250
 continue to be a dialogue bubble 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.380
 Inside we stick to flower paper clear 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.269
 with double-sided tape we apply a lot 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.610
 tape for good at the edges so that 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.410
 do not take off before pasting 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.630
 a little covenant also with pencils 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.640
 of colors so that flower is not 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.890
 floating and have a surface where 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.940
 is supported we remove all the paper that 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.880
 protect the tape 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.000
 we expose the glue and apply 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.890
 this panel on the card helping us 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.810
 that is well right with your hands and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.930
 the work surface has to 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.390
 stay super flush with the card in the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.270
 part that we could consider inferior 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.160
 to help us with that also what 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.890
 we locate following the die of the 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.270
 bubble this way see what it's going to 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.670
 be saying something with a bubble 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.070
 white with the card will be going to 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.230
 be your message that also seems that 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.900
 it's going to be said with the pop bubble 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.810
 of the dialogue in this dialog bubble 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.620
 let's generate the phrase happy to be 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.330
 with you 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.070
 let's use the stamp set of my 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.410
 favorite sing called happy 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.110
 everything to use the phrase to be with 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.870
 you that we are going to record with powders for 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.000
 blue prints was this is a card 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.590
 to give a man first step 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.780
 in the antistatic pad by the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.350
 white bubble then I charge the stamp 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.200
 Conversation Marking Uncovering We use a 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.990
 white paper so that the powder falls on 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.310
 that surface and then we can return it 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.310
 to collect we use 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.340
 powder for engravings color with flower 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.080
 blue the wendy be king of rangers and 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.210
 we melted with the heat gun now 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.270
 other than die love happy 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.850
 birthday simon says stamp on green paper 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.830
 only the word happy we cut a 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.220
 piece of paper we went through the vision 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.320
 and retreated word paper will 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.960
 we are going to apply over and in the same 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.180
 line of the line between quotation marks a 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.050
 post-it tape the only thing we're going to 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.030
 Remove the bubbles from the die 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.770
 inside of the letters to do it me 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.420
 helped with the 'twitter' clips 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.670
 once we only remove the 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.650
 inner bubbles of the letters you 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.800
 we stick a piece of tape over 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.890
 postÃ­n and then from the other side we remove 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.650
 all around the word so that 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.410
 I do this so that when he removed the 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.270
 word of the piece of paper is not 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.790
 deformed as it is so finite and so 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.150
 Little girl usually deforms losing a 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.120
 little form typography spacing 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.460
 especially 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.370
 in this way he put the post-it tape of 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.919
 guide and it does not deform anything even I use it 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.040
 to apply the glue in this case 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.590
 let's use multiple glue of 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.570
 Reinier matt color that does not shine when 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.750
 it gives the light I apply it with a bit 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.389
 of paper all in about the whole word 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.750
 in the back and I use the same 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:18.260
 post-it tape to locate the word in 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.479
 the front on the card designs I think that 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.880
 I learned it from jennifer mcguire 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.310
 the word where we want to finally 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.340
 remains stuck in the dialogue bubble 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.830
 and carefully remove the post-it tape 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.990
 and this is the card I had 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.500
 prepared for you today for 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.419
