00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
size of this body of the scope it just

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.920 
size of this body of the scope it just
really<00:02:33.420> shakes<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:35.190> what<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> found<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.330> I'm

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
really shakes so what I found is if I'm

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.660 
really shakes so what I found is if I'm
how<00:02:37.320> do<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.560> put<00:02:37.740> on<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> tripod<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.460> actually

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
how do I put on the tripod I actually

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.600 
how do I put on the tripod I actually
jamma<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.540> good<00:02:40.440> sized<00:02:40.710> stick<00:02:41.220> right<00:02:41.490> in

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
jamma a good sized stick right in

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.520 
jamma a good sized stick right in
between<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.480> really<00:02:42.660> cuts<00:02:43.290> down<00:02:43.380> on

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
between there and it really cuts down on

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.550 
between there and it really cuts down on
the<00:02:43.740> vibration<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.530> know<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:46.950> 200<00:02:47.880> bucks

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
the vibration but you know for 200 bucks

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.990 
the vibration but you know for 200 bucks
you<00:02:49.560> really<00:02:49.770> can't<00:02:50.010> beat<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.400> scope<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.820> don't

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
you really can't beat this scope I don't

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.430 
you really can't beat this scope I don't
think<00:02:51.300> I've<00:02:51.890> looked<00:02:52.890> through<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.190> next<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.120> a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
think I've looked through it next to a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.500 
think I've looked through it next to a
Swarovski<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:56.010> obviously<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.670> not<00:02:56.820> as<00:02:57.090> good

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
Swarovski and obviously it's not as good

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.290 
Swarovski and obviously it's not as good
as<00:02:57.630> Swarovski<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.710> definitely<00:02:59.370> isn't<00:02:59.970> too

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
as Swarovski but it definitely isn't too

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.830 
as Swarovski but it definitely isn't too
bad

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
bad

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.470 
bad
it<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.740> looks<00:03:02.010> pretty<00:03:02.100> clear<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.300> see

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
it really looks pretty clear you can see

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.860 
it really looks pretty clear you can see
quite<00:03:04.260> far<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.390> over<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.480> think<00:03:06.510> it's

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
quite far with it and over I think it's

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.550 
quite far with it and over I think it's
a<00:03:06.900> great<00:03:07.050> scope<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:08.990> yeah<00:03:09.990> it's<00:03:10.260> my<00:03:10.350> first
