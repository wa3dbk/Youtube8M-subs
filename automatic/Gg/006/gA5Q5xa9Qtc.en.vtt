00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.750
 Dynamo Dresden vs VfL Bochum Bundesliga Twelfth September 2011 they lower 

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:11.309
 strange but they know TUI strange Kenzie my tip victory for Dresden im 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.830
 Derby of the lower part of the table hit two teams so far 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.090
 each have a win on the account each other 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:24.249
 for the newcomer from Dresden is not a big surprise but that 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.289
 Game and the placement of the booking usually very disappointing if you 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 Consider that they have big ambitions this season 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.920
 in the direct duels Bochum is much better because the Dresdenerin new 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.020
 Clashes have not recorded a victory 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.610
 the last time they played against each other in the year 2007 and in the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.320
 Frame of the cape 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.260
 At that time Bochum celebrated a 1 2 0 victory in Dresden 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.620
 Twelfth September 2011 until 8 pm 15 Dynamos from Dresden started in this 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.810
 Season with ups and downs 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.290
 Currently they are in a negative series because they are in the last 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.830
 lost two matches 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.000
 but this season they also had two very good games 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.250
 first in the basket 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.060
 as they have in an incredible when the Bayer Leverkusen have defeated 4 to 3 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.320
 although they were three to zero behind 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.960
 then they have a four-to-zero victory in the league match against Union Berlin 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.990
 celebrates 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.549
 it should be said that they are in the two difficult guest appearances against 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.899
 Cottbus and Fürth where they were minimally defeated are very well kept 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.090
 to have 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.460
 however, the last two games show us that they are in a mild crisis 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.470
 stick 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.540
 At first they lost at home to Paderborn 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.430
 On the last day they were literally taken apart in Duisburg 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.240
 three to zero 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.450
 at the moment they are in the table space 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.880
 which leads to the relegation 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.329
 the guest appearances cause them bigger problems because they are one of 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.380
 Two teams have not gotten a point in the distance while they're at it 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.739
 Do not play home so badly 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.000
 midfielder Knowle and striker Koch deliver very good games 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:16.839
 from 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:17.650
 Knoll has 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.040
 so far scored a goal and assisted twice 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.839
 while Koch has scored two goals 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:28.540
 It is interesting that coach Loius II after the defeat against Paderborn 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.569
 made some changes in the lineup 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.919
 against Duisburg, among other things, he even let ball on the bench 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.629
 that was not a good decision and in the second half he became 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.139
 but it was too late 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.739
 this time he will be there from the first minute, just like the Greek 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.739
 Papadopoulos the most expensive player in the club 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.759

 award-winning bookmaker 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.199
 the Bochum have not found the right shape 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.739
 one of the strongest and most valuable teams in the second Bundesliga 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.029
 plays flat2flat and at the moment they are on the penultimate place in the 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.079
 table 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.489
 not even the biggest pessimists could have predicted that 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.680
 but that is reality and there is no end in sight 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:38.219
 maybe this game could usher after everything for the better 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.259
 against 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:43.739
 You can hear something like that on the last matchday, but they were in 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.229
 own stadium of Fürth humbled with 1 to 4 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.490
 many were surprised 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.020
 why after this defeat coach Sparkle did not give up his post 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.409
 Has 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.689
 but another defeat in this encounter will certainly be his dismissal 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:59.759
 mean 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.139
 if you look at the statistics 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.509
 you can see that the Bochum after Union Berlin the most goals 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.979
 have seen a total of see 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.790
 at home they have conceded six goals and worse are only the 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.019
 Karlsruhe and Cottbus 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.970
 It is also interesting to note that Bochum has suffered two defeats 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.330
 after being in the lead 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.259
 it is even more interesting the fact that they are in all six previous ones 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.910
 played in the half-time draw 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.289
 that means that they will be worse in the second half especially in the 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.819
 Game finish 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.319
 Coach Funkel countries despite bad game nothing unless he is to 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.590
 forced 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.380
 Captain Dabrowski is injured and did not play against Fürth and sparkle 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.610
 had made only one change in the course of these matches just like in the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.879
 Game against Union Berlin 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:54.960
 that means 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.960
 that he will not experiment in Dresden 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.550
 expected statement book rum

 Aldingen Game Cilic 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.310
 Bochum played weak and inefficient 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.680
 especially abroad but this may be a good opportunity and 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.889
 for coach sparkle probably the last chance 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.759
 Dynamo is not a better team and Dresdner are 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.180
 which are in no better shape than Bochum 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.060
 We believe that the Bochum remain at least unbeaten in this encounter 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.990
 become 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.819
 maybe the hosts will be happy with a draw as well 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.220
 Basically, Bochum has started to deliver good games and we are 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.009
 the opinion 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.079
 that the guests are more in a win
