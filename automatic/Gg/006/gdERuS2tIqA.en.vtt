your frappuccinos to eat to add some
extra<00:00:25.590> detail<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.310> used<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.910> green<00:00:27.150> sharpie<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
extra detail I used a green sharpie to

have to make the whipped cream topping
I<00:00:33.780> used<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.440> lightweight<00:00:34.950> polymer<00:00:35.370> clay<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.850> I

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
I used a lightweight polymer clay and I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.750 
I used a lightweight polymer clay and I
push<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.540> through<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.230> star<00:00:37.950> shaped<00:00:38.280> icing

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.330 
push that through a star shaped icing
tip

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.430 

this<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.879> top<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.270> a<00:00:49.510> bead<00:00:49.690> container<00:00:50.140> and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
this is the top of a bead container and

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.560 
this is the top of a bead container and
this<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.770> what's<00:00:51.010> gonna<00:00:51.219> basically<00:00:51.850> enclose

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
this is what's gonna basically enclose

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.569 
this is what's gonna basically enclose
the<00:00:52.870> lip-balm<00:00:53.260> so<00:00:53.860> I'm<00:00:53.949> going<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.190> take<00:00:54.399> the

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
the lip-balm so I'm going to take the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.420 
the lip-balm so I'm going to take the
whip<00:00:54.820> cream<00:00:55.140> topping<00:00:56.140> that<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.620> push<00:00:57.219> through

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
whip cream topping that I push through

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.189 
whip cream topping that I push through
the<00:00:57.550> star<00:00:57.790> tip<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.300> I'm<00:00:58.719> going<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.930> wrap<00:00:59.170> it

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
the star tip and I'm going to wrap it

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.319 
the star tip and I'm going to wrap it
around<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.680> top<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.250> then<00:01:00.789> once<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.149> have<00:01:01.300> a

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
around the top and then once I have a

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.180 
around the top and then once I have a
whipped<00:01:01.600> cream<00:01:01.690> shape<00:01:02.110> I'm<00:01:02.350> going<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.649> take<00:01:02.979> it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
whipped cream shape I'm going to take it

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.790 
whipped cream shape I'm going to take it
off<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:04.269> top<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.750> bake<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.350> in<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.619> oven

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
off of the top and bake it in the oven

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.060 
off of the top and bake it in the oven
so<00:01:06.159> that<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.640> polymer<00:01:07.600> clay<00:01:07.750> becomes<00:01:08.440> hard

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
so that the polymer clay becomes hard

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.240 
so that the polymer clay becomes hard
and<00:01:09.430> then<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.580> can<00:01:09.759> glue<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.210> back<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.690> top

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.929 
your bead container fits in it perfectly
just<00:01:49.390> like<00:01:49.569> that<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.380> then<00:01:51.100> hot<00:01:51.460> glue<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.850> in

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
just like that and then hot glue it in

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
place and then once the hot glue dries

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.700 
place and then once the hot glue dries
add<00:01:54.520> some<00:01:55.180> white<00:01:55.479> paint<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.049> top<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:56.590> it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
add some white paint to the top so it

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.260 
add some white paint to the top so it
looks<00:01:56.890> like<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.369> Frappuccino<00:01:58.890> and<00:02:00.090> now<00:02:01.090> it's

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
looks like the Frappuccino and now it's

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.719 
looks like the Frappuccino and now it's
time<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.479> make<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.020> lip<00:02:02.289> balm<00:02:02.590> yay<00:02:03.100> which<00:02:03.549> is

beeswax<00:02:08.049> so<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.860> just<00:02:09.299> mix<00:02:10.299> together<00:02:10.660> 1<00:02:11.320> tbsp<00:02:12.010> of

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
and then I microwaved it and dropped it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.530 
and then I microwaved it and dropped it
into<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> little<00:02:20.560> bead<00:02:20.799> container<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.540> after

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
into the little bead container and after

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.569 
into the little bead container and after
it's<00:02:22.690> solidified<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.829> refrigerator<00:02:24.400> for

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
it's solidified and the refrigerator for

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.430 
it's solidified and the refrigerator for
a<00:02:24.640> little<00:02:24.700> bit<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.180> looks<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:28.440> I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
a little bit it looks like that and I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.170 
a little bit it looks like that and I
also<00:02:29.680> thought<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.070> would<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:30.640> cute<00:02:30.940> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
also thought it would be really cute and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.460 
also thought it would be really cute and
slightly<00:02:31.950> impractical<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:32.980> add<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> straw

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.160 

and<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:37.370> last<00:02:37.640> step<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.390> just<00:02:38.540> glue<00:02:38.810> on<00:02:39.020> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
and the last step is to just glue on the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.010 
and the last step is to just glue on the
top<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.770> bead<00:02:39.920> container<00:02:40.370> yay

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
top to the bead container yay

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.970 
top to the bead container yay
