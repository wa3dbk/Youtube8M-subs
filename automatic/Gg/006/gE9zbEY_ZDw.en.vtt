primary<00:02:27.840> clutch<00:02:28.380> off<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:31.080> hold<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
primary clutch off that you hold the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.300 
primary clutch off that you hold the
rollers<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.680> then<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.770> got<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.040> put<00:02:38.190> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
rollers in and then you got to put the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.650 
rollers in and then you got to put the
bolts<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:40.500> separate<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.730> secondary

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
bolts in to separate the secondary

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.270 
bolts in to separate the secondary
clutch<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:44.520> pull<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> belt<00:02:44.970> off<00:02:46.100> makes<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.220> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
clutch to pull the belt off makes it a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.270 
clutch to pull the belt off makes it a
lot<00:02:47.460> easier<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:49.620> pick<00:02:50.130> these

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
lot easier you can just pick these

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.870 
lot easier you can just pick these
standard<00:02:50.940> bolts<00:02:51.180> up<00:02:51.330> at<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:52.020> local<00:02:52.880> hardware

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
standard bolts up at a local hardware

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.990 
standard bolts up at a local hardware
store<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:56.100> separates<00:02:56.580> them<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
store and that just separates them to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:16.460 
store and that just separates them to
lighten<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.450> up<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:15.600> also<00:03:15.750> kind<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.260> want<00:03:16.410> to
