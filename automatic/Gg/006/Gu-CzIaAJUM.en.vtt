recognize sometimes that small levels

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.280 
recognize sometimes that small levels
actually<00:02:31.549> taking<00:02:32.000> place<00:02:32.030> from<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.540> slice<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.019> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290

larger complex level and that is

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.289 
larger complex level and that is
definitely<00:02:35.930> an<00:02:36.680> awesome<00:02:37.130> aspect<00:02:37.640> now<00:02:37.940> it's

like pushing the envelope as far as the
graphics<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> engine<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.820> concerned<00:03:05.210> it

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
graphics and the engine is concerned it

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.120 
graphics and the engine is concerned it
all<00:03:05.840> starts<00:03:06.140> with<00:03:06.230> frostbite<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.890> man<00:03:07.100> that

fresh<00:03:12.860> off<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.340> plate<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.820> little<00:03:14.000> difficult

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
fresh off the plate a little difficult

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.910 
fresh off the plate a little difficult
to<00:03:14.570> work<00:03:14.690> with<00:03:14.750> obviously<00:03:15.350> but<00:03:15.620> we<00:03:15.770> are

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
to work with obviously but we are

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.840 
to work with obviously but we are
producing<00:03:16.340> an<00:03:16.520> amazing<00:03:18.670> there's<00:03:19.670> kind<00:03:19.820> of

producing an amazing there's kind of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.460 
producing an amazing there's kind of
five<00:03:20.060> pillars<00:03:20.390> we<00:03:20.600> like<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.840> talk<00:03:20.990> about<00:03:21.170> for

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
five pillars we like to talk about for

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.850 
five pillars we like to talk about for
it<00:03:21.590> which<00:03:21.950> animation<00:03:22.520> destruction<00:03:23.209> scale

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
it which animation destruction scale

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.230 
it which animation destruction scale
rendering<00:03:24.860> basic<00:03:25.160> graphics<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.670> audio<00:03:25.790> and

rendering basic graphics and audio and
that<00:03:26.540> combination<00:03:26.840> those<00:03:27.230> five<00:03:27.470> key<00:03:27.980> things

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
that combination those five key things

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.699 
that combination those five key things
I'm<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.580> cross-buy<00:03:29.270> to<00:03:29.330> Purdue<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.440> what<00:03:30.560> you

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
I'm a cross-buy to Purdue so what you

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.410 
I'm a cross-buy to Purdue so what you
see<00:03:30.890> on<00:03:31.040> screen<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.550> don't<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.880> won't<00:03:32.000> really

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
see on screen you don't you won't really

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.510 
see on screen you don't you won't really
pick<00:03:32.750> them<00:03:32.870> out<00:03:32.959> individually<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.709> much<00:03:33.920> but

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
pick them out individually so much but

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.430 
pick them out individually so much but
that<00:03:34.550> just<00:03:34.730> produces<00:03:35.390> an<00:03:35.510> incredible<00:03:36.260> game

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
that just produces an incredible game

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.290 
that just produces an incredible game
and<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:37.130> tech<00:03:37.340> bed<00:03:37.550> for<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:37.970> just<00:03:38.180> unreal

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
and the tech bed for it is just unreal

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.600 
and the tech bed for it is just unreal
you<00:03:39.140> mentioned<00:03:39.590> destruction<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.430> course

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
you mentioned destruction and of course

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.400 
you mentioned destruction and of course
that<00:03:40.820> was<00:03:40.970> something<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.360> was<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.630> big<00:03:42.260> deal

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410
