00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
that they for whatever reason rolled the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.189 
that they for whatever reason rolled the
 window<00:00:26.340> down<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.019> then<00:00:28.019> I'm<00:00:28.109> going

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
 window down and then I'm going

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.380 
 window down and then I'm going
to<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:28.380> back<00:00:28.590> up<00:00:29.510> so<00:00:31.070> that's<00:00:32.070> fine<00:00:32.309> whatever<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
to go back up so that's fine whatever I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.920 
to go back up so that's fine whatever I
assume<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.380> there<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.930> problem

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
assume that there was just a problem

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.110 
assume that there was just a problem
with<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> switch<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.920> they<00:00:38.070> said<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
with the switch and they said that it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400 
with the switch and they said that it
would<00:00:39.270> roll<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.510> fine<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.079> wouldn't<00:00:40.320> roll

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
would roll down fine just wouldn't roll

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
would roll down fine just wouldn't roll
up<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.710> get<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> car<00:00:43.980> back<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.899> now<00:00:46.430> for

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.360 
up so I get the car back and now for
whatever<00:00:47.610> reason<00:00:48.530> windows<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.680> rolling<00:00:50.129> down

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
3 we tried up to switch with the with

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
3 we tried up to switch with the with
his<00:01:27.360> car<00:01:27.630> switch<00:01:28.020> would<00:01:28.170> work<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.439> his<00:01:28.590> car

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
his car switch would work with his car

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.920 
his car switch would work with his car
we<00:01:28.890> try<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> his<00:01:29.340> switch<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.750> worked

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
we try to his switch and it worked

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.660 
we try to his switch and it worked
perfectly<00:01:31.380> fine<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.799> mine<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:34.470> took<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
perfectly fine with mine so I took the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
perfectly fine with mine so I took the
switch<00:01:35.909> apart<00:01:36.240> there's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> little<00:01:36.840> bit<00:01:36.930> of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
switch apart there's a little bit of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.100 
switch apart there's a little bit of
burning<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.880> on<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> copper

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
burning on the on one of the copper

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.830 
burning on the on one of the copper
connectors<00:01:41.000> within<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.119> little<00:01:42.479> rubbery

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
connectors within that little rubbery

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.730 
connectors within that little rubbery
bit<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.540> cleaned<00:01:45.540> everything<00:01:45.780> off<00:01:46.049> everything

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
bit so cleaned everything off everything

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.230 
bit so cleaned everything off everything
look<00:01:46.890> brand<00:01:47.159> new<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.369> thought<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
look brand new I thought that's going to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.170 
look brand new I thought that's going to
fix<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.689> shoe<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:50.000> yeah<00:01:51.000> nothing<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.180> not

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
fix my shoe but yeah nothing so not

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.469 
fix my shoe but yeah nothing so not
going<00:01:54.509> down<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:55.110> all

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
going down at all

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.480 
going down at all
and<00:01:57.049> basically<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.710> dealership<00:01:58.130> said<00:01:58.340> that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
and basically the dealership said that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.529 
and basically the dealership said that
I'll<00:01:58.610> cover<00:01:58.880> me<00:01:59.180> because<00:02:00.369> it's<00:02:01.509> common<00:02:02.509> for

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
I'll cover me because it's common for

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.560 
I'll cover me because it's common for
cars<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.049> stage<00:02:03.350> for<00:02:03.799> it<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.979> happen

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
cars a stage for it to happen

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.199 
cars a stage for it to happen
so<00:02:06.469> either<00:02:06.649> not<00:02:06.890> cover<00:02:07.189> me<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.670> got<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.000> pay<00:02:08.119> out

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
so either not cover me I got to pay out

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.710 
so either not cover me I got to pay out
of<00:02:08.239> my<00:02:08.360> own<00:02:08.420> pocket<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:10.090> junker<00:02:11.090> wants<00:02:11.510> 80

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
of my own pocket so junker wants 80

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.970 
of my own pocket so junker wants 80
bucks<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:13.660> dealership<00:02:14.660> well<00:02:14.840> it's<00:02:14.930> 160<00:02:15.709> bucks

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.830 

so<00:02:18.980> I'd<00:02:19.130> rather<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.700> go<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.239> option<00:02:20.690> just

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
so I'd rather not go that option just

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.320 
so I'd rather not go that option just
because<00:02:21.349> I<00:02:21.739> know<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.670> was<00:02:22.790> working<00:02:23.120> fine

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
because I know it was working fine

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.930 
because I know it was working fine
beforehand<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:25.010> feel<00:02:25.489> like<00:02:25.760> it's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
beforehand and I feel like it's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.539 
beforehand and I feel like it's
something<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.870> should<00:02:27.110> be<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.950> know<00:02:28.010> fairly

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
something that should be you know fairly

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.960 
something that should be you know fairly
easy<00:02:28.700> fix<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:30.230> those<00:02:30.739> who<00:02:30.890> are<00:02:31.190> asking<00:02:31.340> how

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
easy fix for those who are asking how

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.490
