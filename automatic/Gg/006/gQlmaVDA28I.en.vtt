we're<00:01:48.719> going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> use<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.139> wood<00:01:49.289> for<00:01:49.499> we're

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
we're going to use the wood for we're

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.219 
we're going to use the wood for we're
gonna<00:01:49.709> put<00:01:50.009> markings<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:51.329> wood<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
gonna put markings on the wood as you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.639 
gonna put markings on the wood as you
can<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:54.090> various<00:01:54.630> sizes<00:01:54.929> for

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
can see here of various sizes for

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.969 
can see here of various sizes for
cutting<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.039> rubber<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.499> to<00:01:58.499> get<00:01:58.739> those

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
cutting the rubber down and to get those

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.620 
cutting the rubber down and to get those
sizes<00:01:59.279> we're<00:01:59.639> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.819> take<00:01:59.999> your<00:02:00.149> channels

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
sizes we're going to take your channels

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.449 
sizes we're going to take your channels
and<00:02:00.869> you're<00:02:01.499> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.709> measure<00:02:01.889> them<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
and you're going to measure them and

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.519 
and you're going to measure them and
you're<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.729> want<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.029> make<00:02:03.209> the<00:02:04.139> marks

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:04.529 
you're going to want to make the marks

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:06.589 
you're going to want to make the marks
on<00:02:04.739> the<00:02:04.799> board<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.819> be<00:02:05.849> approximately<00:02:06.419> a

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
on the board to be approximately a

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.240 
on the board to be approximately a
quarter<00:02:06.840> inch<00:02:07.109> larger<00:02:07.709> than<00:02:07.739> the<00:02:07.950> actual

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
quarter inch larger than the actual

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.999 
quarter inch larger than the actual
channel<00:02:08.429> size<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:09.509> one<00:02:09.690> thing<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.009> channel

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
channel size now one thing is channel

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.310 
channel size now one thing is channel
sizes<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.640> actually<00:02:12.020> really<00:02:13.020> there<00:02:13.170> in

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
sizes are actually really there in

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.080 
sizes are actually really there in
metric<00:02:13.710> but<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.460> call<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.880> ten

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
metric but you know we call it a ten

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.450 
metric but you know we call it a ten
inch

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
inch

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.820 
inch
it's<00:02:15.550> really<00:02:15.730> not<00:02:15.880> ten<00:02:16.120> inch<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:17.170> fact<00:02:17.410> if<00:02:17.680> you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
it's really not ten inch in fact if you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.640 
it's really not ten inch in fact if you
measure<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.310> channel<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.870> 10<00:02:20.080> inch<00:02:20.290> it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
measure the channel of a 10 inch it

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.130 
measure the channel of a 10 inch it
actually<00:02:20.980> works<00:02:21.130> out<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.370> be<00:02:21.460> nine<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.850> half

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
actually works out to be nine and a half

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.290 
actually works out to be nine and a half
so<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.620> nine<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> half<00:02:24.130> inch<00:02:24.640> channel

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
so on a nine and a half inch channel

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.790 
so on a nine and a half inch channel
you're<00:02:25.600> gonna<00:02:25.690> want<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.050> rubber<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.470> be<00:02:26.590> about

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
you're gonna want the rubber to be about

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.210 
you're gonna want the rubber to be about
nine<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.060> three-quarters<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:29.740> will<00:02:29.920> allow

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
nine and three-quarters that will allow

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.430 
nine and three-quarters that will allow
you<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.610> rubber<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.450> about<00:02:31.960> an<00:02:32.170> eighth<00:02:32.290> of

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
you to have rubber at about an eighth of

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.140 
you to have rubber at about an eighth of
an<00:02:32.560> inch<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:32.860> either<00:02:33.040> side<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.940> channel

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
an inch on either side of the channel

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.940 
an inch on either side of the channel
something<00:02:34.960> like<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> little<00:02:35.350> bit<00:02:35.530> less<00:02:35.680> I'm

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
something like a little bit less I'm

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.430 
something like a little bit less I'm
like<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.160> little<00:02:36.250> bit<00:02:36.370> more<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:37.840> mark<00:02:38.200> your

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
like a little bit more you can mark your

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.290 
like a little bit more you can mark your
markings<00:02:39.250> according<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> your<00:02:39.880> preference

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
markings according to your preference

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.180 
markings according to your preference
but<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:40.990> say<00:02:41.170> as<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.320> general<00:02:41.740> rule<00:02:41.770> a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
but like I say as a general rule a

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.210 
but like I say as a general rule a
quarter<00:02:42.820> inch<00:02:42.970> larger<00:02:43.300> than<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.600> channel<00:02:44.220> so

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
quarter inch larger than the channel so

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.590 
quarter inch larger than the channel so
on<00:02:45.340> my<00:02:45.550> stick<00:02:45.940> here<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:48.040> my<00:02:48.220> markings<00:02:48.760> so

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
on my stick here I have my markings so

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.470 
on my stick here I have my markings so
first<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.960> measured<00:02:50.290> off<00:02:50.820> four<00:02:51.820> six<00:02:52.030> inch<00:02:52.270> eight

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
first I measured off four six inch eight

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.500 
first I measured off four six inch eight
inch<00:02:52.950> 10<00:02:53.950> inch<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.610> on<00:02:54.760> all<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.090> way<00:02:55.210> up<00:02:55.300> to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
inch 10 inch and so on all the way up to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.480 
inch 10 inch and so on all the way up to
about<00:02:55.600> twenty<00:02:55.930> four<00:02:56.080> inches<00:02:56.500> those<00:02:57.250> are<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
about twenty four inches those are the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.210 
about twenty four inches those are the
rubber<00:02:57.640> sizes<00:02:58.210> and<00:02:58.470> saw<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> six<00:02:59.830> inch<00:03:00.010> where<00:03:00.160> I

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
rubber sizes and saw a six inch where I

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.310 
rubber sizes and saw a six inch where I
have<00:03:00.370> marked<00:03:00.550> 6<00:03:00.940> inch<00:03:01.150> technically<00:03:02.050> speaking

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
have marked 6 inch technically speaking

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.960 
have marked 6 inch technically speaking
it's<00:03:03.040> actually<00:03:03.400> only<00:03:03.520> five<00:03:03.730> and

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
it's actually only five and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.950 
it's actually only five and
three-quarters<00:03:04.480> because<00:03:04.660> that's<00:03:04.780> what<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
three-quarters because that's what the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.510 
three-quarters because that's what the
rubber<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.260> going<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.470> be<00:03:05.590> but<00:03:06.040> that's<00:03:06.130> just<00:03:06.370> as

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
rubber is going to be but that's just as

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.720 
rubber is going to be but that's just as
a<00:03:06.550> representation<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.480> put<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> sizes<00:03:08.730> so

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
a representation to put the sizes so

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.360 
a representation to put the sizes so
once<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.210> those<00:03:10.420> in<00:03:10.480> place<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:12.100> make

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
once you have those in place you make

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.950 
once you have those in place you make
your<00:03:12.520> marks<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.090> draw<00:03:13.300> your<00:03:13.450> nice<00:03:13.630> straight

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
your marks you draw your nice straight

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.680 
your marks you draw your nice straight
lines<00:03:14.230> along<00:03:15.100> there<00:03:15.370> now<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.090> can<00:03:16.270> take<00:03:16.420> any

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
lines along there now you can take any

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.980 
lines along there now you can take any
rubber<00:03:16.960> that<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.260> want<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.680> cut<00:03:18.370> down<00:03:18.610> and

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
rubber that you want to cut down and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.030 
rubber that you want to cut down and
this<00:03:19.990> particular<00:03:20.230> case<00:03:20.560> I'm<00:03:20.680> not<00:03:20.830> just<00:03:20.950> going

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
this particular case I'm not just going

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.700 
this particular case I'm not just going
to<00:03:21.130> take<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.250> brand<00:03:21.580> new<00:03:21.790> piece<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.060> rubber<00:03:22.710> 36

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
to take a brand new piece of rubber 36

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.770 
to take a brand new piece of rubber 36
inch<00:03:24.180> but<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.210> want<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.540> cut<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:27.630> let's<00:03:28.630> say

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
inch but I want to cut it to let's say

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.180 
inch but I want to cut it to let's say
16<00:03:29.320> inches<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.670> what<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.910> basically<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:32.190> it's

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
16 inches so what you basically do it's

scraper holding right on top I'm looking
right<00:04:23.560> on<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:23.830> line

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
right on that line

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.570 
right on that line
and<00:04:26.389> I<00:04:26.540> pushed<00:04:26.840> down<00:04:26.930> now<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.010> reason<00:04:28.280> why<00:04:28.370> I'm

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
and I pushed down now the reason why I'm

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.520

using<00:04:28.910> MDF<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.930> reason<00:04:30.169> why<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.290> say

either<00:04:30.860> use<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.220> or<00:04:31.430> use<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.730> softwood

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
either use that or use the softwood

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.210 
either use that or use the softwood
because<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.840> actually<00:04:32.990> wanted<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.770> play<00:04:34.160> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
go through the rubber and into the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
material you want it to go beyond if

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040 
material you want it to go beyond if

be able to go right through the rubber
nice<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.669> smooth<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:48.320> anyway<00:04:48.560> here<00:04:48.770> is<00:04:48.860> our

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
nice and smooth so anyway here is our

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.310 
nice and smooth so anyway here is our
cut<00:04:49.840> it's<00:04:50.840> nice<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.320> straight<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:53.080> of<00:04:54.080> course

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
cut it's nice and straight and of course

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.480 
cut it's nice and straight and of course
that<00:04:54.500> leaves<00:04:54.650> us<00:04:54.860> with<00:04:55.210> 20<00:04:56.210> inches<00:04:56.889> so<00:04:57.889> 20

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
that leaves us with 20 inches so 20

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.940 
that leaves us with 20 inches so 20
inches<00:04:58.790> I<00:04:58.910> can<00:04:59.150> hang<00:05:00.110> on<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.410> that<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.590> can<00:05:00.830> use

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
inches I can hang on to that I can use

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.150 
inches I can hang on to that I can use
it<00:05:01.130> maybe<00:05:01.700> make<00:05:02.030> 2<00:05:02.630> 10<00:05:02.900> inch<00:05:03.110> pieces<00:05:03.440> or<00:05:03.919> I<00:05:03.950> can

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
it maybe make 2 10 inch pieces or I can

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.330 
it maybe make 2 10 inch pieces or I can
make<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.669> leave<00:05:04.940> it<00:05:05.060> at<00:05:05.120> 20<00:05:05.419> inch<00:05:06.070> cut<00:05:07.070> in<00:05:07.160> any

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
make that leave it at 20 inch cut in any

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.450 
make that leave it at 20 inch cut in any
variation<00:05:08.060> like<00:05:08.210> an<00:05:08.360> 8-inch<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.080> 12-inch<00:05:09.460> so

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
variation like an 8-inch to 12-inch so

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.920 
variation like an 8-inch to 12-inch so
there's<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.729> lot<00:05:10.820> I<00:05:10.850> can<00:05:11.090> do<00:05:11.210> with<00:05:11.840> this

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
there's a lot I can do with this

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.140 
there's a lot I can do with this
leftover<00:05:12.320> piece<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:13.400> like<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.669> said<00:05:13.850> if<00:05:14.030> you've
