00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
bringing that to Australian to Melbourne

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.590 
bringing that to Australian to Melbourne
I<00:00:34.160> feel<00:00:34.460> like<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:34.790> have<00:00:35.000> something<00:00:35.210> that<00:00:35.480> I<00:00:35.540> can

one<00:00:44.239> of<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.390> reasons<00:00:44.690> why<00:00:44.900> I<00:00:44.930> like<00:00:45.170> doing<00:00:45.470> this

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
one of the reasons why I like doing this

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.210 
one of the reasons why I like doing this
is<00:00:45.860> because<00:00:46.280> I've<00:00:47.030> been<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:47.620> fortunate<00:00:48.620> to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.569 

it's<00:01:08.110> just<00:01:08.259> great<00:01:08.649> hearing<00:01:08.950> it<00:01:09.009> someone<00:01:09.460> that

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
it's just great hearing it someone that

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.370 
it's just great hearing it someone that
had<00:01:09.729> so<00:01:09.759> much<00:01:10.090> experience<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.899> made<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.229> seem

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
had so much experience and made it seem

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.350 
had so much experience and made it seem
more<00:01:11.560> real<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:12.070> think<00:01:12.430> hearing<00:01:12.759> from<00:01:13.000> someone

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
more real I think hearing from someone

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.350 
more real I think hearing from someone
who<00:01:13.509> had<00:01:13.720> worked<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.619> I<00:01:14.890> guess<00:01:15.180> things<00:01:16.180> that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
who had worked on I guess things that

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.749 
who had worked on I guess things that
we've<00:01:16.780> grown<00:01:16.930> up<00:01:17.020> grown<00:01:17.979> up<00:01:18.100> with<00:01:18.310> thing<00:01:18.580> grown

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
we've grown up grown up with thing grown

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.609 
we've grown up grown up with thing grown
up<00:01:18.880> watching<00:01:19.000> I'm<00:01:19.479> from<00:01:19.810> Brisbane<00:01:20.140> studying

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
up watching I'm from Brisbane studying

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.859 
up watching I'm from Brisbane studying
animation<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.399> yeah<00:01:22.180> this<00:01:22.360> just<00:01:22.570> seemed<00:01:22.750> like

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
animation and yeah this just seemed like

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.300 
animation and yeah this just seemed like
an<00:01:23.020> amazing<00:01:23.289> opportunity<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:23.950> hopefully<00:01:24.189> down

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
an amazing opportunity so hopefully down

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.550

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
once so taking a plane over I came to

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.960 
once so taking a plane over I came to
Melbourne<00:01:30.970> from<00:01:31.420> adlai's<00:01:32.110> good<00:01:32.920> Adelaide

I'm from stole stole as well Ceylan
Gibson<00:01:37.720> as<00:01:38.049> soon<00:01:38.289> as<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:38.440> saw<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.679> the<00:01:39.549> lab<00:01:39.759> I

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
Gibson as soon as I saw the the lab I

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.880 
Gibson as soon as I saw the the lab I
decided<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.959> had<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.200> go<00:01:41.380> Daisy<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:41.830> I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
decided that I had to go Daisy and I

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.249 
decided that I had to go Daisy and I
couldn't<00:01:42.159> hear<00:01:42.640> anywhere<00:01:42.970> else<00:01:43.270> over<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:43.750> sir

couldn't hear anywhere else over it sir
oh<00:01:44.289> I've<00:01:44.830> been<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:45.069> the<00:01:45.250> motion<00:01:45.549> lab<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:46.209> it<00:01:46.659> was

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
oh I've been to the motion lab is it was

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.840 
oh I've been to the motion lab is it was
amazing<00:01:47.200> but<00:01:47.429> you<00:01:48.429> know<00:01:48.520> what's<00:01:48.700> ahead

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
amazing but you know what's ahead

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.880 
amazing but you know what's ahead
technology<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.509> today<00:01:49.659> they<00:01:50.259> put<00:01:50.619> all<00:01:50.740> the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
technology is today they put all the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.029 
technology is today they put all the
emotion<00:01:51.670> dots<00:01:52.149> on<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:52.780> can<00:01:53.039> transmit

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
emotion dots on you and you can transmit

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.350 
emotion dots on you and you can transmit
into<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.369> computer<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:54.850> then<00:01:54.940> from<00:01:55.179> there

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
into the computer and then from there

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.630 
into the computer and then from there
you<00:01:55.509> can<00:01:55.539> animate<00:01:55.959> I<00:01:56.409> suppose<00:01:57.069> more

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
you can animate I suppose more

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.779 
you can animate I suppose more
specifically<00:01:58.209> about<00:01:58.569> movement<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.530> how<00:02:00.159> I

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
specifically about movement and how I

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.850 
specifically about movement and how I
suppose<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.209> human<00:02:01.450> body<00:02:01.600> works<00:02:01.840> all<00:02:02.409> emotion

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
suppose the human body works all emotion

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.399 
suppose the human body works all emotion
I<00:02:02.950> was<00:02:03.130> amazing<00:02:03.729> it's<00:02:04.060> just<00:02:04.270> I've<00:02:04.840> never<00:02:04.899> seen

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
I was amazing it's just I've never seen

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.990 
I was amazing it's just I've never seen
one<00:02:05.590> before

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.240 

reflector<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.900> Dickens<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.890> only

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
reflector like that Dickens the only

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.950 
reflector like that Dickens the only
place<00:02:13.550> that<00:02:13.910> has<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.270> access<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.660> kind

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
place that has the access to that kind

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.740 
place that has the access to that kind
of<00:02:14.990> technology<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:17.090> great<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.300> we<00:02:17.480> get

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
of technology so it's great that we get

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.270 
of technology so it's great that we get
that<00:02:17.900> chance<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.320> be<00:02:18.710> able<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.890> use<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
that chance to be able to use the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.780 
that chance to be able to use the
infrared<00:02:20.150> cameras<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:22.100> work<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.610> we've

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
infrared cameras the work that we've

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.610 
infrared cameras the work that we've
done<00:02:22.820> you've<00:02:23.180> probably<00:02:23.390> all<00:02:23.870> seen<00:02:23.900> they<00:02:24.350> said

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
done you've probably all seen they said

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.410 
done you've probably all seen they said
we<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.790> fact<00:02:26.090> Pepsi<00:02:26.690> bhatia<00:02:27.020> here

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.150 

and<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.660> definitely<00:02:32.230> recommend<00:02:32.500> people<00:02:32.890> to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
and I definitely recommend people to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.100
