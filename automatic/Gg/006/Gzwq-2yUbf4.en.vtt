00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:09.549
 Yes, it is a tower tower It is here to introduce this time 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:15.070
 xt It is not a universal mini figure but xt is here 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:17.600
 Now that we hire for a period and tried a little taken the video will be a still image 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:23.180
 Please see the example of that 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:27.170
 I really like xt . I especially like this design 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:32.599
 I don't like the classic design personally, though 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.950
 Especially the color of the cat's graphite , the guy that came out after this is very cool and cares 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.590
 I have entered 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 There is a guy with a sharp finder part in this, but it is a classic 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.910
 Oh, I don't like it, but it is quite trapezoidal in this case, so I personally 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.470
 And I hope 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.900
 The dial operation and the first one was quite lost 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.930
 But I got used to using it while I thought it was easy to use 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:01.300
 I It was part finder easy very look of the viewfinder 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:04.420
 After all the back of the liquid crystal is moving For low angle and I often take me 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.840
 Very movable back of this LCD 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:15.890
 The lens I tried this time after I was saved 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.790
 I tried 56mm single focus lens, but one is an apossession filter 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.300
 is it 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:27.480
 One See Deployment filter lucky guy to Pota 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:31.590
 Since then the differences that had been the guy two placed not about is I was very subtle 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:36.330
 And it contains the ze Activation filter want it security was a show in Artie 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.650
 f Value is a bit darker than it actually is . Where the place is dark 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.920
 There was memory properly 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.840
 Actual f values since have been nice specified properly in the lens that Tteyuu'm this side 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.679
 I thought it was easy to understand 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.820
 In fact he said the wind that and are equipped with the filter clock of the contour is very smooth 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.149
 You are welcome 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:59.700
 I think it looks like that even if you look at the maker's example 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.549
 But honestly, I used it personally and I couldn't realize the difference so far 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.530
 is not it 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:09.880
 &amp; After all things that can be said to both lenses f 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:16.090
 It 's very good to say that you can shoot from f 1.2 to medium telephoto . 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:19.690
 So I felt like it could be used many times without having to use camera shake correction 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.660
 I would like to say it again, but after all this body design 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.060
 I love you 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.720
 It especially also the color of graphite is really nice 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.860
 Operability is 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.660
 Though I'm not good also there's I mean honestly so much or accustomed Nai' 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.660
 It is a camera I want to bring 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.270
 n I think I have come 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.990
 I can not do this machine either 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.990
 me 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.760
 me 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.760
 me 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.790
 That 's why I introduced this time 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:20.980
 I used to rent a Fuji Building xt 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:25.160
 Aps c is the city's best depiction power 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:30.080
 I think the image quality performance is not what 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.950
 So if you buy aps c ne This is a single 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.950
 xt did is
