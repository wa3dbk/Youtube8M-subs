possible<00:01:54.799> fight<00:01:55.219> between<00:01:55.399> Lamu<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:57.009> Canelo<00:01:58.009> I

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279 
possible fight between Lamu and Canelo I

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:01.149 
possible fight between Lamu and Canelo I
think<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:58.850> be<00:01:58.969> an<00:01:58.999> interest<00:01:59.389> in<00:01:59.509> one<00:01:59.719> I<00:02:00.159> would

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
think that be an interest in one I would

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.519 
think that be an interest in one I would
probably<00:02:01.579> pick<00:02:01.789> Canelo<00:02:02.209> I<00:02:02.479> think<00:02:03.139> Canelo's

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
probably pick Canelo I think Canelo's

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.330 
probably pick Canelo I think Canelo's
got<00:02:04.029> better<00:02:05.029> around<00:02:05.479> skills<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.409> think<00:02:07.219> he's

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
got better around skills I think he's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.820 
got better around skills I think he's
got<00:02:07.549> better<00:02:07.939> ring<00:02:08.240> generalship<00:02:08.830> although

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
got better ring generalship although

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.089 
got better ring generalship although
Lemieux<00:02:10.220> might<00:02:10.519> be<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:12.019> heavier<00:02:12.439> puncher<00:02:12.950> he

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
Lemieux might be the heavier puncher he

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.240 
Lemieux might be the heavier puncher he
might<00:02:13.280> have<00:02:13.430> more<00:02:13.670> one

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
might have more one

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.400 
might have more one
power<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:15.150> Canelo<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.750> terms<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.320> the

power then Canelo in terms of the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.980 
power then Canelo in terms of the
physical<00:02:16.560> size<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.340> both<00:02:17.460> men<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.970> think<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
physical size of both men I think the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.910 
physical size of both men I think the
muse<00:02:19.200> taller<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:21.200> Canelo's<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> nice-sized

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
muse taller but Canelo's a nice-sized

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.800 
muse taller but Canelo's a nice-sized
lat<00:02:23.340> min<00:02:23.520> away<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.850> means<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.090> very<00:02:24.360> big<00:02:24.600> light

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
lat min away it means a very big light

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.720 
lat min away it means a very big light
middleweight<00:02:25.230> he'd<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.770> decent<00:02:26.220> size

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
middleweight he'd be a decent size

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.040 
middleweight he'd be a decent size
middleweight<00:02:27.270> probably<00:02:27.660> around<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.990> same

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
middleweight probably around the same

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.840 
middleweight probably around the same
size<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:28.620> Lemieux<00:02:28.920> I'm<00:02:29.070> guessing<00:02:29.460> maybe<00:02:29.580> let

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
size as Lemieux I'm guessing maybe let

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.300 
size as Lemieux I'm guessing maybe let
me<00:02:29.940> use<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> slightly<00:02:30.510> bigger<00:02:30.810> man<00:02:31.140> but<00:02:32.010> let<00:02:32.280> me

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
me use a slightly bigger man but let me

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.300 
me use a slightly bigger man but let me
is<00:02:32.459> not<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.670> massive<00:02:33.860> particularly<00:02:34.860> massive

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
is not a massive particularly massive

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.699 
is not a massive particularly massive
middle<00:02:35.610> way<00:02:35.730> he's<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> decent<00:02:36.270> size<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.020> not

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
middle way he's a decent size but not

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.620 
middle way he's a decent size but not
that<00:02:37.860> big<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.190> not<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.459> Chavez<00:02:38.910> Jr<00:02:39.150> or

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that big it's not like Chavez Jr or

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.350 
that big it's not like Chavez Jr or
anything<00:02:39.959> like<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> yeah<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:41.940> think<00:02:42.240> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
anything like that so yeah I think the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.470 
anything like that so yeah I think the
mule<00:02:42.570> vs<00:02:42.930> Canelo<00:02:43.520> could<00:02:44.520> be<00:02:44.700> an<00:02:44.790> interest<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.270> 1

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
mule vs Canelo could be an interest in 1

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.280 
mule vs Canelo could be an interest in 1
i'd<00:02:45.870> go<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.380> Canelo<00:02:46.739> bought<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.880> good

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
i'd go with Canelo bought it be good

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.890 
i'd go with Canelo bought it be good
exciting<00:02:49.290> fight<00:02:49.560> action<00:02:50.370> fight<00:02:50.630> lamu<00:02:51.630> going

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
exciting fight action fight lamu going

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.960 
exciting fight action fight lamu going
for<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.110> knockout<00:02:52.310> Canelo<00:02:53.310> doing<00:02:53.640> his<00:02:53.730> thing

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
for the knockout Canelo doing his thing

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.520 
for the knockout Canelo doing his thing
yeah<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.630> think<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.230> would<00:02:55.320> be<00:02:55.350> all<00:02:55.500> right

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
yeah I think it would be all right

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.400 
yeah I think it would be all right
although<00:02:56.600> would<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> middle<00:02:58.170> way<00:02:58.200> or

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
although would it be a middle way or

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.440 
although would it be a middle way or
would<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.560> be<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.739> light<00:02:58.980> middleweight<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.580> don't

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
would it be a light middleweight I don't

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.060 
would it be a light middleweight I don't
