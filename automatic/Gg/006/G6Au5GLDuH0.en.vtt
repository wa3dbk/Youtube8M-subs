through a game and then you finish off
of<00:04:11.140> that<00:04:11.200> game<00:04:11.410> even<00:04:11.739> if<00:04:11.800> it's<00:04:11.950> got<00:04:12.070> about

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
of that game even if it's got about

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.850 
of that game even if it's got about
three<00:04:12.489> seconds<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.030> go<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.870> if<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.380> have<00:04:14.739> to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
three seconds to go so if I you have to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.349 
three seconds to go so if I you have to
have<00:04:14.950> three<00:04:15.190> letters<00:04:15.489> minimum<00:04:15.910> in<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.150> word

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
have three letters minimum in a word

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.539 
have three letters minimum in a word
just<00:04:16.600> do<00:04:17.169> poor<00:04:17.440> highlight<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.130> if<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.400> did

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
just do poor highlight it and if I did

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.670 
just do poor highlight it and if I did
it<00:04:18.640> again<00:04:18.780> yellow<00:04:19.780> show<00:04:20.109> that<00:04:20.320> you've<00:04:20.410> done<00:04:20.560> it

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
it again yellow show that you've done it

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.270 
it again yellow show that you've done it
and<00:04:20.799> if<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:21.040> make<00:04:21.220> up<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.430> word<00:04:21.520> like<00:04:22.050> PTL<00:04:23.280> goes

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
and if I make up a word like PTL goes

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.240 
and if I make up a word like PTL goes
red<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.630> idea<00:04:25.750> is<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.229> find<00:04:26.560> as<00:04:26.650> many<00:04:26.770> words

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
red so the idea is to find as many words

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.820 
red so the idea is to find as many words
possible<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:27.940> then<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:29.020> get<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.500> longest

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
possible and then to get the longest

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.500 
possible and then to get the longest
words<00:04:30.010> as<00:04:30.160> well<00:04:30.340> from<00:04:30.460> all<00:04:30.550> points<00:04:30.760> so<00:04:31.270> I've

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
words as well from all points so I've

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.260 
words as well from all points so I've
got<00:04:31.690> 16<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:33.030> 4,000<00:04:34.710> 4154<00:04:35.710> points<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.250> two<00:04:37.030> of

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
got 16 of 4,000 4154 points and two of

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.840 
got 16 of 4,000 4154 points and two of
two<00:04:37.510> hundred<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:38.050> ninety<00:04:38.380> six<00:04:38.710> words<00:04:39.100> and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
two hundred and ninety six words and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.310 
two hundred and ninety six words and
then<00:04:39.940> you've<00:04:40.030> got<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.180> time<00:04:40.420> at<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.780> top

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
then you've got the time at the top

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.800 
then you've got the time at the top
saying<00:04:41.800> how<00:04:41.980> long<00:04:42.190> you've<00:04:42.370> got<00:04:42.580> left<00:04:42.880> that's

now<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.190> game<00:05:06.400> is<00:05:06.840> very<00:05:07.840> very<00:05:08.410> good<00:05:08.680> game

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
now this game is very very good game

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.830 
now this game is very very good game
actually<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:10.000> Polly<00:05:10.270> seen<00:05:10.450> it<00:05:10.570> on<00:05:10.660> other

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
actually you Polly seen it on other

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.159 
actually you Polly seen it on other
platforms<00:05:11.110> so<00:05:11.950> where<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.580> just<00:05:12.820> go<00:05:13.480> join<00:05:13.840> the

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
platforms so where you just go join the

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.800 
platforms so where you just go join the
dots<00:05:14.410> up<00:05:14.740> without<00:05:15.340> going<00:05:15.580> over<00:05:16.200> another<00:05:17.370> line

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
dots up without going over another line

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.630 
dots up without going over another line
which<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.890> obviously<00:05:20.890> this<00:05:20.980> is<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.370> first

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
which is obviously this is the first

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.570 
which is obviously this is the first
level<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.840> it's<00:05:22.930> going<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.110> be<00:05:23.169> pretty<00:05:23.320> easy

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
level so it's going to be pretty easy

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.570 
level so it's going to be pretty easy
before<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.730> just<00:05:24.910> show<00:05:25.120> you<00:05:25.560> if<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.860> do<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.400> go

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
before I just show you if you do the go

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.370 
before I just show you if you do the go
without<00:05:27.910> any<00:05:28.180> flaws<00:05:28.480> you<00:05:28.720> have<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:28.990> change

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
without any flaws you have to change

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.030 
without any flaws you have to change
anything<00:05:29.590> you<00:05:30.310> get<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.520> star<00:05:31.330> on<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:32.140> right

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
anything you get a star on the right

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.460 
anything you get a star on the right
number<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.520> what<00:05:33.760> level<00:05:34.060> is<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.300> if<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.080> like

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
number of what level is and if you like

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.550 
number of what level is and if you like
for<00:05:35.950> example<00:05:36.100> here<00:05:36.580> if<00:05:36.760> I<00:05:37.300> did<00:05:37.810> this<00:05:37.960> line<00:05:38.260> here

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
for example here if I did this line here

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.950 
for example here if I did this line here
like<00:05:38.890> that<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.820> then<00:05:40.180> actually<00:05:40.570> no<00:05:40.660> change

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
like that and then actually no change

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.830 
like that and then actually no change
our<00:05:41.110> mind<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.410> do<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.590> like<00:05:41.740> that<00:05:41.979> then<00:05:42.840> I

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
our mind to do it like that then I

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.690 
our mind to do it like that then I
probably<00:05:44.260> only<00:05:44.500> get<00:05:44.680> tick<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.190> not<00:05:45.310> start

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
probably only get tick and not start

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.450 
probably only get tick and not start
because<00:05:45.910> I<00:05:46.360> didn't<00:05:47.320> do<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.470> and<00:05:47.650> like<00:05:47.800> one<00:05:48.130> or

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
because I didn't do it and like one or

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.320 
because I didn't do it and like one or
two<00:05:48.490> goes<00:05:50.190> now<00:05:51.190> the<00:05:51.250> game<00:05:51.520> does<00:05:51.760> get<00:05:51.940> harder

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
two goes now the game does get harder

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.130 
two goes now the game does get harder
and<00:05:52.510> goes<00:05:53.440> up<00:05:53.470> to<00:05:53.650> nine<00:05:54.070> by<00:05:54.370> nine<00:05:54.729> grids<00:05:55.210> so<00:05:55.840> it

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
and goes up to nine by nine grids so it

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.370 
and goes up to nine by nine grids so it
does<00:05:56.350> get<00:05:56.979> very<00:05:57.040> tricky<00:05:58.080> but<00:05:59.080> other<00:05:59.200> than<00:05:59.320> that

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
does get very tricky but other than that

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.330 
does get very tricky but other than that
it<00:05:59.740> is<00:05:59.979> very<00:06:00.340> fun<00:06:00.640> game<00:06:00.669> and<00:06:01.570> this<00:06:01.780> definitely

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
it is very fun game and this definitely
