00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 it's him at all we find ourselves on the 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.460
 cp count german of buc version 3.1 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.529
 for the discovery of the hall of the S &amp; P 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 106 so I remind you that this is the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.190
 s &amp; p 106 it's the black guy who 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.960
 crosses the walls which is not 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.280
 materially physical that can pass 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.080
 from one floor to another that is to say it 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.710
 can you catch even if you're in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.080
 the elevator and it's also a video 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.930
 or what the fuck total 1 I address myself to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.730
 all those who videos to tell you 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.109
 that there is a fucking big bug 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.939
 dot graphs I do not know if it's 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.830
 planned in fact but there is a new and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.239
 cp i think that's your cpu or 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.120
 maybe mutilation 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.489
 I will tell you this our friend so there we 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.710
 can already see three crank crank 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.980
 is on which we can interact 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.970
 so how did he have that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.410
 the four they could not 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.660
 interact from the temper you can 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.500
 interact have little broken the femur of 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.470
 our colleague 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.720
 tonight not much except heard 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.460
 noises very very very well and we 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.970
 also has the transmission sound which 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.970
 does not allow oil are actually 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.970
 consensus 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.440
 finally interesting so far so 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.130
 then we continue because it 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.940
 still continues and quite a lot of choice 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.440
 especially you have a bank gate 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.550
 using a map but I do not know 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.140
 is it exactly level is in 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.280
 excellent omnicast before any 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.600
 portable 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.799
 you have kinds of backstage 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.080
 it would be without a shot and there you 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.890
 arrive 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.630
 you arrive in front of the building that 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.760
 present the version could steal the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.080
 little and here we go there I'll go 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.500
 show something awesome 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.729
 look good there is going to be a 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.860
 appearance the hand here is just not so 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.570
 you saw him past fox 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.100
 next to the building towards the full window 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.320
 middle there were soldiers were trying 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.590
 that noah did not understand what 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.960
 it was 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.150
 at first I thought I was fucking new 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.810
 super s &amp; p after I said to myself 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.290
 luckily maybe it's a 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.420
 hallucination of the game to scare 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.009
 it's not because we will continue 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.479
 the way back and it's on the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.800
 way back that I have 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.569
 really the big bug it's really 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.670
 impressive and it's especially very 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.190
 scary because then unfortunately 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.510
 I'm not going with his passing on 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.170
 what she can not people and 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.239
 could hear 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.940
 if the little creature that we're going 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.810
 cross it makes a noise I do not know 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.370
 and I have not dug since then 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.660
 memories the cushioning you'll see it get 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.990
 really goes very very quickly to 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.950
 from now on look 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.340
 very impressive that I like to return 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.650
 I turn around and look good 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.390
 it's the big stuff there that apart from a 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.240
 fraction of a second that disappeared by the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.390
 it's still very very very 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.560
 very impressive because I know 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.210
 it's the graphics pad because 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.670
 it's still the fourth time 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.810
 it makes me in the game on the same site 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.710
 recession even if 104 th time it's me 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.490
 do the other three times we'll say on 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.340
 is going to say it's a mantis 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.630
 religious passes between the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.930
 young people did not have the same shape she 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.260
 was so much smaller so that's it 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.630
 it's really very very strange I 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:19.970
 respect I put you a little slow motion 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.950
 to recy show you this video on the 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.300
 mutual do not know if that shows you what 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.940
 group e that I was waiting for them 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.090
 explanations of realism and creator of 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.290
 cp precisely because there I will be more 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.930
 there I am totally lost in his 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.160
 thoughts so has it here thanks to all 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.210
 to have created this video I you 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.210
 wish a good day
