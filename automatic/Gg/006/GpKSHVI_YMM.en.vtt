lot of inexpensive pens and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.310 
lot of inexpensive pens and
unfortunately<00:00:37.090> they<00:00:37.270> are<00:00:37.300> quite<00:00:37.690> prone<00:00:38.020> to

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
unfortunately they are quite prone to

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.709 
unfortunately they are quite prone to
breaking<00:00:38.770> and<00:00:38.860> once<00:00:39.039> they<00:00:39.280> crack<00:00:39.670> that<00:00:40.570> can

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
breaking and once they crack that can

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.239 
breaking and once they crack that can
happen<00:00:40.870> for<00:00:41.109> example<00:00:41.199> when<00:00:41.589> you<00:00:41.649> post<00:00:41.920> them<00:00:42.159> a

happen for example when you post them a

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:45.509 
happen for example when you post them a
bit<00:00:42.399> aggressively<00:00:43.059> they<00:00:43.989> lose<00:00:44.260> purchase<00:00:44.980> so

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
bit aggressively they lose purchase so

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.970 
bit aggressively they lose purchase so
when<00:00:45.760> you<00:00:45.850> do<00:00:45.969> this<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.559> cap<00:00:47.739> just

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.479 
when you do this see that the cap just
flies<00:00:48.280> off<00:00:48.609> it's<00:00:49.359> very<00:00:49.870> insecure<00:00:50.350> on<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.280> pen

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
flies off it's very insecure on the pen

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.669 
flies off it's very insecure on the pen
and<00:00:51.699> that<00:00:51.819> that<00:00:52.059> really<00:00:52.329> annoys<00:00:52.569> me<00:00:52.600> so<00:00:52.989> today

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679

thought<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.680> this<00:01:53.860> was<00:01:54.100> part<00:01:54.430> of<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.610> cap

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
thought that this was part of the cap

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.660 
thought that this was part of the cap
these<00:01:55.840> threads<00:01:56.230> and<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.680> plastic<00:01:57.280> inner<00:01:57.460> cap

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
these threads and the plastic inner cap

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.490 
these threads and the plastic inner cap
was<00:01:57.940> was<00:01:58.300> in<00:01:58.480> there<00:01:58.660> but<00:01:58.810> that's<00:01:58.930> not<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.320> case

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
was was in there but that's not the case

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.100 
was was in there but that's not the case
this<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.280> attached<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.270> white<00:02:01.510> inner<00:02:01.870> cap

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
this is attached to that white inner cap

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.720 
this is attached to that white inner cap
so<00:02:02.320> what<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.560> can<00:02:02.710> do<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:02.980> just<00:02:03.100> push<00:02:03.430> down<00:02:03.460> on

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
so what you can do is just push down on

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.030 
so what you can do is just push down on
it<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.020> should<00:02:05.050> be<00:02:05.320> able<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.560> push<00:02:05.860> it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
it and you should be able to push it

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.699 
it and you should be able to push it
into<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.580> pen<00:02:06.970> now<00:02:07.510> if<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:07.840> does<00:02:08.080> not<00:02:08.379> work

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
into the pen now if that does not work

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.589 
into the pen now if that does not work
and<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.550> first<00:02:09.789> time<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.149> can<00:02:10.269> be<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.420> little

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
and the first time it can be a little

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.199 
and the first time it can be a little
tight<00:02:10.959> what<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.860> need<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.129> do<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.459> grab<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> cute

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
tight what you need to do is grab a cute

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.930 
tight what you need to do is grab a cute
little<00:02:13.300> hammer<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.959> just<00:02:14.550> knock<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.730> that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
little hammer and just knock on that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.870 
little hammer and just knock on that
gently<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.980> should<00:02:18.190> be<00:02:18.280> able<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.460> pull<00:02:18.700> this

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
gently you should be able to pull this

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.040 
gently you should be able to pull this
out<00:02:19.090> now<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.840> don't<00:02:20.140> want<00:02:20.470> to

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
out now you don't want to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.770 
out now you don't want to
parade<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:21.710> bit<00:02:22.100> from<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.030> plastic<00:02:23.540> pop

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
parade this bit from the plastic pop

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.540 
parade this bit from the plastic pop
because<00:02:24.110> that's<00:02:24.590> not<00:02:25.340> necessary<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:28.190> I'm<00:02:28.370> not

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
because that's not necessary and I'm not

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.980 
because that's not necessary and I'm not
sure<00:02:28.700> whether<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.120> get<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.480> back<00:02:29.720> in

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
sure whether you can get that back in

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.810 
sure whether you can get that back in
there<00:02:30.020> it's<00:02:30.620> pretty<00:02:30.860> hard<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.160> get<00:02:31.310> out<00:02:31.460> anyway

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
there it's pretty hard to get out anyway

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.210 
there it's pretty hard to get out anyway
so<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.630> leave<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.990> now<00:02:33.860> what

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
so I just I just leave that now what

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.100 
so I just I just leave that now what
we've<00:02:34.400> got<00:02:34.640> us<00:02:34.790> here<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.330> crack<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.840> see

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
we've got us here is the crack you see

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.200 
we've got us here is the crack you see
that<00:02:36.260> that's<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.280> problem<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:37.880> as<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.090> can

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
that that's the problem and as you can

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.780 
that that's the problem and as you can
see<00:02:38.270> it's<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.600> pretty<00:02:38.630> wide<00:02:39.260> crack<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:39.980> now<00:02:40.640> it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
see it's a pretty wide crack so now it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.030 
see it's a pretty wide crack so now it
goes<00:02:40.910> all<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.270> way<00:02:41.390> up<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.810> there<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.920> of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
goes all the way up to there and of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.890 
goes all the way up to there and of
course<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.490> could<00:02:43.610> try<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.880> glue<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.600> but

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
course you could try to glue this but

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.110 
course you could try to glue this but
that's<00:02:45.170> most<00:02:45.950> likely<00:02:46.190> not<00:02:46.550> really<00:02:46.820> going<00:02:46.970> to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
that's most likely not really going to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.390 
that's most likely not really going to
be<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.600> lot<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.960> help<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:48.860> what<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.100> do<00:02:49.250> is

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
be of a lot of help so what you do is

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.070 
be of a lot of help so what you do is
you<00:02:49.520> just<00:02:49.580> take<00:02:49.850> some<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.240> this<00:02:50.330> tape<00:02:50.780> now<00:02:51.020> we

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
you just take some of this tape now we

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.140 
you just take some of this tape now we
call<00:02:51.710> this<00:02:51.920> electrical<00:02:52.430> tape<00:02:52.700> I'm<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:53.030> sure

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
call this electrical tape I'm not sure

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.520 
call this electrical tape I'm not sure
whether<00:02:53.270> that's<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.630> correct<00:02:53.900> English<00:02:54.050> term

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
whether that's the correct English term

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.920 
whether that's the correct English term
well<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.520> guess<00:02:55.970> suppose<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.420> can<00:02:56.570> use<00:02:56.690> any

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
well I guess suppose you can use any

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.540 
well I guess suppose you can use any
type<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.200> tape<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:57.710> I<00:02:57.800> like<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.280> because

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
type of tape but I like this because

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.780 
type of tape but I like this because
it's<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.780> little<00:03:00.020> elastic<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.280> what<00:03:01.640> you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
it's it's a little elastic so what you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.530 
it's it's a little elastic so what you
do<00:03:02.000> quite<00:03:02.840> simply<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.850> at<00:03:04.850> least<00:03:05.030> that's<00:03:05.270> what

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
do quite simply is at least that's what

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.920 
do quite simply is at least that's what
I<00:03:05.570> do

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
I do

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.430 
I do
first<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.800> try<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.100> cover<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.720> actual<00:03:09.020> crack

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
first I try to cover the actual crack

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.070 
first I try to cover the actual crack
which<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:09.980> right<00:03:10.340> there<00:03:10.640> just<00:03:11.630> put<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.020> on

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
which is right there just put that on

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.240 
which is right there just put that on
there<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:13.810> I'm<00:03:14.810> just<00:03:15.050> as<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.590> pair<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:15.980> scissors

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
there and I'm just as a pair of scissors

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.580 
there and I'm just as a pair of scissors
I'm<00:03:16.520> using<00:03:16.730> my<00:03:17.030> my<00:03:17.270> Swiss<00:03:17.630> Army<00:03:17.780> knife<00:03:18.140> because

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
I'm using my my Swiss Army knife because

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.860 
I'm using my my Swiss Army knife because
that<00:03:18.770> has<00:03:18.950> these<00:03:19.130> nice<00:03:19.430> very<00:03:19.730> sharp<00:03:20.090> scissors

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
that has these nice very sharp scissors

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.860 
that has these nice very sharp scissors
which<00:03:21.200> are<00:03:21.350> useful<00:03:21.560> for<00:03:22.330> cutting<00:03:23.330> off<00:03:23.510> this

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
which are useful for cutting off this

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.270 
which are useful for cutting off this
you<00:03:24.530> don't<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:24.890> do<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.100> completely

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
you don't have to do it completely

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.310 
you don't have to do it completely
straightly<00:03:26.150> we'll<00:03:26.360> we'll<00:03:26.570> come<00:03:26.810> back<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.170> that

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
straightly we'll we'll come back to that

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:35.740 
straightly we'll we'll come back to that
in<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.530> second<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:31.370> size<00:03:33.790> I'm<00:03:34.790> covering<00:03:35.570> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
in a second the size I'm covering the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:44.020 
in a second the size I'm covering the
whole<00:03:35.989> cap<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:38.390> this<00:03:39.140> tape<00:03:42.610> just<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.790> make<00:03:44.000> sure

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
whole cap in this tape just to make sure

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.580 
whole cap in this tape just to make sure
there<00:03:44.540> will<00:03:44.630> not<00:03:44.750> be<00:03:44.780> any<00:03:45.050> other<00:03:45.140> cracks

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
there will not be any other cracks

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.140 
there will not be any other cracks
because<00:03:46.130> you<00:03:46.430> know<00:03:46.550> that<00:03:47.480> might<00:03:47.750> just<00:03:48.020> happen

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
because you know that might just happen

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.070 
because you know that might just happen
third<00:03:50.150> bit

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.170 

if<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.920> want<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.190> do<00:03:57.280> this<00:03:57.460> really<00:03:57.730> accurately

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
if you want to do this really accurately

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.450 
if you want to do this really accurately
I<00:03:58.300> guess<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.140> can<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.320> measure<00:04:00.190> the

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
I guess you can just measure the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.370 
I guess you can just measure the
distance<00:04:00.970> from<00:04:01.060> one<00:04:01.390> hand<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.780> other<00:04:01.930> and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
distance from one hand to the other and

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.890 
distance from one hand to the other and
cut<00:04:03.130> off<00:04:03.340> bits<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.090> tape<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.450> are<00:04:04.510> exactly

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
cut off bits of tape that are exactly

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.840 
cut off bits of tape that are exactly
that<00:04:05.170> length<00:04:05.470> but<00:04:05.770> for<00:04:06.010> me<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.160> mean<00:04:06.400> this<00:04:06.580> this

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
that length but for me I mean this this

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.090 
that length but for me I mean this this
is<00:04:06.910> good<00:04:07.180> enough<00:04:07.270> for<00:04:07.420> me<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:07.870> now<00:04:08.620> what<00:04:09.070> I

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
is good enough for me and now what I

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.090 
is good enough for me and now what I
want<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.400> do<00:04:09.640> is<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.910> just<00:04:09.940> put<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.830> inner<00:04:11.830> cap

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
want to do is I just put the inner cap

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.289 
want to do is I just put the inner cap
back<00:04:12.520> into<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.060> actual<00:04:13.300> cap<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.490> I<00:04:15.490> put<00:04:16.120> the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
back into the actual cap and I put the

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.190 
back into the actual cap and I put the
cap<00:04:16.540> on<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:17.260> pen<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:18.510> this<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.720> actually<00:04:20.080> you

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
cap on the pen and this is actually you

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.940 
cap on the pen and this is actually you
hear<00:04:20.410> that<00:04:20.560> click<00:04:20.860> in<00:04:20.980> place<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.880> was<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.420> lot

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
hear that click in place that was a lot

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.990 
hear that click in place that was a lot
better<00:04:23.950> than<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:25.270> used<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.600> be<00:04:26.820> I'll<00:04:27.820> just

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
better than it used to be I'll just

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.550 
better than it used to be I'll just
screw<00:04:28.210> this<00:04:28.390> in<00:04:28.600> place<00:04:28.840> so<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.350> cap

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
screw this in place so that the cap

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.940 
screw this in place so that the cap
actually<00:04:30.420> in<00:04:31.420> a<00:04:31.540> cap<00:04:31.750> stays<00:04:32.050> in<00:04:32.260> there<00:04:34.950> it's

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
actually in a cap stays in there it's

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.760 
actually in a cap stays in there it's
good<00:04:36.280> but<00:04:36.460> it's<00:04:36.670> still<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:37.030> bit<00:04:37.270> loose<00:04:37.540> so<00:04:37.930> what

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
good but it's still a bit loose so what

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
good but it's still a bit loose so what
I<00:04:38.800> do<00:04:38.950> now<00:04:42.180> take<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.240> out<00:04:43.570> again<00:04:44.700> going<00:04:45.700> to

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
I do now take that out again going to

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.430 
I do now take that out again going to
take<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.060> bit<00:04:46.300> of<00:04:46.330> tape<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.840> I'm<00:04:46.900> going<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.200> put

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
take a bit of tape and I'm going to put

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.650 
take a bit of tape and I'm going to put
it<00:04:47.560> right<00:04:48.010> there<00:04:48.070> near<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.820> bottom<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.630> see

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
it right there near the bottom you see

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.180 
it right there near the bottom you see
that<00:04:49.990> so<00:04:50.170> this<00:04:50.290> is<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.500> end<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:50.740> goes<00:04:51.010> into

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
that so this is the end that goes into

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.600 
that so this is the end that goes into
the<00:04:51.400> cap<00:04:51.610> but<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.330> screw<00:04:52.600> that<00:04:52.780> thing<00:04:52.840> onto

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
the cap but you screw that thing onto

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.420 
the cap but you screw that thing onto
just<00:04:54.610> going<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:54.910> take<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:57.510> go<00:04:58.510> around

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
just going to take this go around

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:14.310 
just going to take this go around
carefully<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.900> gently<00:05:12.660> I've<00:05:13.660> come<00:05:13.990> full

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
carefully and gently I've come full

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.670 
carefully and gently I've come full
circle<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:15.400> once<00:05:15.900> when<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.020> put<00:05:17.260> that<00:05:17.290> in

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
circle just once when I put that in

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.200 
circle just once when I put that in
there<00:05:17.950> again<00:05:22.440> just<00:05:23.440> using<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:24.160> back<00:05:24.850> end<00:05:25.120> of

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
there again just using the back end of

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.409 
there again just using the back end of
the<00:05:25.330> pen<00:05:25.510> to<00:05:25.690> push<00:05:25.870> it<00:05:26.050> in<00:05:26.200> it's<00:05:26.890> going<00:05:27.310> in<00:05:27.520> with

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
the pen to push it in it's going in with

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.000 
the pen to push it in it's going in with
a<00:05:28.450> bit<00:05:28.660> more<00:05:28.810> difficulty<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:29.560> that's<00:05:29.710> good

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
a bit more difficulty and that's good

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.890 
a bit more difficulty and that's good
because<00:05:30.400> that<00:05:30.580> means<00:05:30.760> I've<00:05:31.180> created<00:05:31.450> that<00:05:31.870> the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
because that means I've created that the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.720 
because that means I've created that the
you<00:05:32.530> know<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.680> tighter<00:05:33.220> fit<00:05:33.640> of<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.940> cap<00:05:35.730> and

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
you know a tighter fit of the cap and

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.310 
you know a tighter fit of the cap and
now<00:05:37.590> it's<00:05:38.590> on<00:05:38.860> there<00:05:39.100> nice<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.430> tightly<00:05:39.880> I<00:05:40.320> can

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
now it's on there nice and tightly I can

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.570 
now it's on there nice and tightly I can
really<00:05:41.500> apply<00:05:41.770> some<00:05:42.040> pressure<00:05:42.130> you<00:05:42.400> see<00:05:42.460> I

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
really apply some pressure you see I

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.280 
really apply some pressure you see I
pull<00:05:42.880> off<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.180> cap<00:05:43.360> but<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.600> inner<00:05:43.750> cap<00:05:43.990> stays

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
pull off the cap but the inner cap stays

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.680 
pull off the cap but the inner cap stays
on<00:05:44.500> there<00:05:44.710> that's<00:05:44.919> what<00:05:45.040> I<00:05:45.100> want<00:05:45.340> okay<00:05:46.270> so<00:05:46.480> now
