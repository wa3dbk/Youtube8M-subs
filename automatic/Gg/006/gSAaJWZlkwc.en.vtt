series of these i'll probably do why i'm
only<00:01:01.309> going<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.550> do<00:01:01.640> one<00:01:01.670> plane<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:02.510> time

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
only going to do one plane this time

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.660 
only going to do one plane this time
around<00:01:02.839> and<00:01:03.140> probably<00:01:04.009> do<00:01:04.159> two<00:01:04.339> or<00:01:04.489> three

around and probably do two or three

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.090 
around and probably do two or three
planes<00:01:04.940> each<00:01:05.180> time<00:01:05.479> till<00:01:05.960> i<00:01:05.990> get<00:01:06.229> through<00:01:06.530> most

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
planes each time till i get through most

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.649 
planes each time till i get through most
all<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.310> planes<00:01:07.640> except<00:01:08.030> for<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.270> kids<00:01:08.450> that

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
all the planes except for the kids that

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.590 
all the planes except for the kids that
haven't<00:01:08.840> built<00:01:09.080> me<00:01:09.289> stuff<00:01:09.789> so<00:01:10.789> this<00:01:11.060> comes<00:01:11.330> as

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
starting with this is because I'm going

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.410 
starting with this is because I'm going
to<00:02:18.890> be<00:02:19.010> upgrading<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:19.579> to<00:02:19.730> brushless<00:02:19.970> this

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
to be upgrading this to brushless this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.569 
to be upgrading this to brushless this
actually<00:02:20.870> still<00:02:21.079> has<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.590> brush<00:02:21.920> motors<00:02:22.340> they

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
actually still has the brush motors they

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.000 
actually still has the brush motors they
were<00:02:22.870> grabner<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.230> hundreds<00:02:24.620> i<00:02:24.739> believe

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
were grabner for hundreds i believe

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.880 
were grabner for hundreds i believe
thats<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.519> this<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.390> we're<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.930> convert

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
thats in this so we're going to convert

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.210 
thats in this so we're going to convert
this<00:02:28.070> at<00:02:28.280> some<00:02:28.489> point<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.000> take<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.329> off

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
this at some point and you take this off

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.340 
this at some point and you take this off
going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.310> convert<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.760> fairly<00:02:32.720> soon<00:02:33.049> here

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
going to convert this fairly soon here

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.650 
going to convert this fairly soon here
going<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.590> put<00:02:33.769> bigger<00:02:34.400> battery<00:02:34.880> pack<00:02:35.090> in<00:02:35.329> it<00:02:35.450> i

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
going to put bigger battery pack in it i

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.440 
going to put bigger battery pack in it i
was<00:02:36.109> running<00:02:36.290> on<00:02:36.500> 2200<00:02:37.340> milliamp<00:02:38.090> lipo

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
was running on 2200 milliamp lipo

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.500 
was running on 2200 milliamp lipo
probably<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.440> go<00:02:39.500> with<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.680> 3300<00:02:40.510> and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
probably going to go with a 3300 and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.170 
probably going to go with a 3300 and
governments<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.560> single<00:02:42.950> brush<00:02:43.190> esc<00:02:43.790> with

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
governments the single brush esc with

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.199 
governments the single brush esc with
dual<00:02:44.510> brushless<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.489> might<00:02:46.489> go<00:02:46.519> with<00:02:46.819> larger

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
dual brushless and might go with larger

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.350 
dual brushless and might go with larger
props<00:02:47.540> looks<00:02:48.319> like<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.650> profit<00:02:49.129> we're<00:02:49.879> up

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
props looks like this profit we're up

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.760 
props looks like this profit we're up
it's<00:02:50.510> not<00:02:50.630> broken<00:02:50.870> just<00:02:51.080> got<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.320> little<00:02:51.410> mud<00:02:51.650> on

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
it's not broken just got a little mud on

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.060 
it's not broken just got a little mud on
it<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:53.150> anyways<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.930> thought<00:02:54.560> I'd<00:02:54.680> start<00:02:54.920> with

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
it so anyways I thought I'd start with

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.910 
it so anyways I thought I'd start with
that<00:02:55.160> plane<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:57.080> really<00:02:57.590> smooth

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
that plane this is a really smooth

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.280 
that plane this is a really smooth
flying<00:02:58.310> plane<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.790> would<00:02:58.880> think<00:02:59.030> with<00:02:59.300> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
flying plane you would think with the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.810 
flying plane you would think with the
canards<00:03:00.710> and<00:03:00.890> stuff<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.460> really

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
canards and stuff that it really

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.580 
canards and stuff that it really
wouldn't<00:03:02.120> be<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.600> really<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:03.110> it's<00:03:03.380> really

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
wouldn't be but it really is it's really

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.950 
wouldn't be but it really is it's really
a<00:03:03.740> nice<00:03:03.950> plane<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.430> fly<00:03:04.610> had<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> lot<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.750> fun

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
a nice plane to fly had a lot of fun

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.340 
a nice plane to fly had a lot of fun
with<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.350> probably<00:03:06.770> got<00:03:07.780> at<00:03:08.780> least<00:03:08.810> 70

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
with it I probably got at least 70

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.650 
with it I probably got at least 70
flights<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:09.860> would<00:03:10.160> say<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.640> those<00:03:11.480> are<00:03:11.510> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
flights on I would say and those are the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.170 
flights on I would say and those are the
original<00:03:12.170> brushed<00:03:12.440> motors<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.190> hopefully

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
original brushed motors so hopefully

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.240 
original brushed motors so hopefully
they'll<00:03:14.390> last<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.810> little<00:03:14.960> bit<00:03:15.080> longer<00:03:15.440> until<00:03:15.590> I

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
they'll last a little bit longer until I

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.120 
they'll last a little bit longer until I
can<00:03:16.550> swap<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.300> out<00:03:17.450> for<00:03:17.660> brushless<00:03:17.900> but<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
can swap this out for brushless but the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.410 
can swap this out for brushless but the
way<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.370> weather's<00:03:19.610> been<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:19.880> probably<00:03:20.209> won't

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
way the weather's been I probably won't

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.850 
way the weather's been I probably won't
even<00:03:20.570> have<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.810> chance<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:21.200> fly<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.410> before<00:03:21.709> then

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
even have a chance to fly it before then

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.110 
even have a chance to fly it before then
so<00:03:22.780> next<00:03:23.780> episode<00:03:24.640> probably<00:03:25.640> next<00:03:25.790> week<00:03:26.000> or

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
so next episode probably next week or

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.610 
so next episode probably next week or
whatever<00:03:26.240> we'll<00:03:26.570> hit<00:03:26.780> another<00:03:26.990> plane<00:03:27.290> or<00:03:27.470> two

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
whatever we'll hit another plane or two

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.900 
whatever we'll hit another plane or two
and<00:03:27.860> just<00:03:27.950> take<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> look<00:03:28.580> at<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.760> couple

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
and just take a look at a couple

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.140 
and just take a look at a couple
different<00:03:29.060> things<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:30.790> hopefully<00:03:31.790> I'll<00:03:32.120> be

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
different things and hopefully I'll be

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.600 
different things and hopefully I'll be
able<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.450> get<00:03:32.600> out<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.810> fly<00:03:33.050> and<00:03:33.440> take<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.459> look

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
able to get out and fly and take a look

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.750 
able to get out and fly and take a look
at<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.390> p51<00:03:36.050> here<00:03:36.830> now<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.100> that's<00:03:37.280> all

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
at the the p51 here now that that's all

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.780 
at the the p51 here now that that's all
fixed<00:03:38.180> up<00:03:39.040> hopefully<00:03:40.040> we'll<00:03:40.220> be<00:03:40.340> able<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.610> fly

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
fixed up hopefully we'll be able to fly

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.450 
fixed up hopefully we'll be able to fly
that<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:41.330> you
