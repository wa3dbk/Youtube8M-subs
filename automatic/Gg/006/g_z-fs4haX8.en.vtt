00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
like this and like that because that way

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.760 
like this and like that because that way
you<00:02:17.420> don't<00:02:17.660> want<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:17.930> putting<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> folder

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
you don't want to be putting the folder

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.980 
you don't want to be putting the folder
in<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.760> with<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> folder<00:02:20.510> inside<00:02:20.750> that

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
in there with the folder inside that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.320 
in there with the folder inside that
folder<00:02:21.170> because<00:02:21.500> then<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.010> won't<00:02:22.190> work<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:23.270> you

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
folder because then it won't work so you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.390 
folder because then it won't work so you
want<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.780> extract<00:02:24.170> those<00:02:24.380> drag<00:02:24.980> them<00:02:25.130> all<00:02:25.250> in

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
want to extract those drag them all in

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.590 
want to extract those drag them all in
here<00:02:25.610> which<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.970> already<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.240> them<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.450> there

there drag this over here and then let

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.319 
there drag this over here and then let
me<00:03:50.510> just<00:03:50.690> move<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:51.760> quick<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.239> way

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
me just move this quick so that way

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.720 
me just move this quick so that way
that's<00:03:53.780> not<00:03:54.049> in<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.260> way<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.980> have<00:03:55.130> this<00:03:55.400> you

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
that's not in the way you have this you

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.009 
that's not in the way you have this you
can<00:03:56.120> move<00:03:56.269> that<00:03:56.450> out<00:03:56.510> of<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.750> way<00:03:56.780> because

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
can move that out of the way because

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.360 
can move that out of the way because
that's<00:03:57.319> probably<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.769> way<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.099> action

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that's probably in the way of the action

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.650 
that's probably in the way of the action
bar<00:03:59.560> and<00:04:00.940> just<00:04:01.940> trying<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.269> figure<00:04:02.420> out<00:04:02.510> where

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
bar and just trying to figure out where

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.080 
bar and just trying to figure out where
my<00:04:02.720> thing<00:04:03.079> was<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.739> am<00:04:04.160> going<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.519> put<00:04:04.700> this<00:04:04.849> one

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
my thing was I am going to put this one

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.010 
my thing was I am going to put this one
right<00:04:05.120> here<00:04:06.730> bar<00:04:07.730> six<00:04:08.209> can<00:04:08.629> go<00:04:08.870> right<00:04:10.810> there

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.320 

so<00:04:14.740> this<00:04:15.070> is<00:04:15.190> pretty<00:04:15.370> much<00:04:15.490> it<00:04:15.610> how<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.090> make

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
so this is pretty much it how you make

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.909 
so this is pretty much it how you make
it<00:04:16.450> look<00:04:16.570> like<00:04:16.720> that

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.290 

pretty<00:04:20.919> much<00:04:21.070> turn<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.459> off<00:04:21.579> like<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:21.970> or

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
pretty much turn it off like that or

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.400 
pretty much turn it off like that or
actually<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.050> think<00:04:23.139> I<00:04:23.440> headed<00:04:24.690> 6<00:04:25.690> first<00:04:26.080> and

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
actually I think I headed 6 first and

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.719 
actually I think I headed 6 first and
then<00:04:27.070> five<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:28.710> mounter<00:04:29.710> up<00:04:29.860> on<00:04:30.040> top<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.610> this

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
then five so I mounter up on top on this

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.180 
then five so I mounter up on top on this
bar<00:04:31.199> so<00:04:32.199> I<00:04:32.229> go<00:04:32.440> 15<00:04:33.540> already<00:04:34.540> confused<00:04:34.870> 165<00:04:35.620> for

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190
