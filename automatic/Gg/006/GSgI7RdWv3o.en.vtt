00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.390 
okay I have yours well I tried um check
the<00:00:04.049> connection<00:00:04.470> on<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.620> side<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.069> know<00:00:05.130> this

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
the connection on the side I know this

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.560 
the connection on the side I know this
car<00:00:06.560> say<00:00:07.560> yes<00:00:07.859> right<00:00:08.340> Leone<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.090> manifold

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
car say yes right Leone and the manifold

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.150 
car say yes right Leone and the manifold
below<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.080> manifold<00:00:10.530> there<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.800> can<00:00:10.950> just

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
below the manifold there you can just

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.820 
below the manifold there you can just
sit<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.519> connects<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.969> there<00:00:12.469> let's<00:00:13.469> check

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
sit it connects in there let's check

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010 
sit it connects in there let's check
that<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.160> box<00:00:14.370> tight<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.179> cleaning<00:00:15.660> if<00:00:15.780> need

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
that that box tight and cleaning if need

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
that that box tight and cleaning if need
be<00:00:16.910> because<00:00:17.910> here<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.390> bit<00:00:18.570> um<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:20.640> batch

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
be because here it's a bit um the batch

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.590 
be because here it's a bit um the batch
is<00:00:20.910> fine

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
is fine

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.090 
is fine
let's<00:00:21.960> check<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> battery<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:22.619> new

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
let's check the battery that's new

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.279 
let's check the battery that's new
basically<00:00:23.730> new<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> yeah<00:00:26.189> chime<00:00:27.289> clearly

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
basically new so yeah chime clearly

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.390 
basically new so yeah chime clearly
connects<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> not<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> right<00:00:29.189> sized

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
connects to not get the right sized

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.510 
connects to not get the right sized
spinner<00:00:30.800> well<00:00:31.800> I'll<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
spinner well I'll do that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760 
spinner well I'll do that
yeah<00:00:33.090> manifold<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.870> great<00:00:34.110> if<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.530> touch<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
yeah manifold is great if I touch that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.500 
yeah manifold is great if I touch that
much<00:00:35.160> stuff<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.579> arm<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> don't<00:00:36.239> disconnect

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
much stuff at arm so I don't disconnect

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.420 
much stuff at arm so I don't disconnect
this<00:00:36.809> first<00:00:37.739> head<00:00:38.070> before<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.719> yeah

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
this first head before I do that so yeah

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.560 
this first head before I do that so yeah
we're<00:00:41.430> gonna<00:00:41.520> get<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.910> better<00:00:42.120> city<00:00:42.360> out<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we're gonna get it's better city out and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.130 
we're gonna get it's better city out and
we'll<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.750> that

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
we'll do that

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.139 
we'll do that
okay<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:44.100> always<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.520> I've<00:00:44.610> managed<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.030> get

okay be always what I've managed to get
that<00:00:45.329> bolt<00:00:45.660> tightened<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.620> that'd<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.850> yeah

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that bolt tightened up I that'd be yeah

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.410 
that bolt tightened up I that'd be yeah
red<00:00:49.020> car<00:00:49.320> over<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.940> difficult

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
red car over there it's very difficult

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.830 
red car over there it's very difficult
to<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:54.360> connected

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
to get then that little that connected

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.959 
to get then that little that connected
also<00:00:55.199> check<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.219> that's<00:00:56.370> fine

offset joints the universe was what was
you<00:02:29.989> gonna<00:02:30.080> bet<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.500> got<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.799> bit<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.040> an<00:02:31.130> angle<00:02:31.220> to

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
you gonna bet I got a bit of an angle to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.960 
you gonna bet I got a bit of an angle to
push<00:02:31.610> under<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.910> boat<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.360> via<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:33.819> slot<00:02:34.819> in

push under the boat so via the slot in
an<00:02:35.060> angle<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.560> pushed<00:02:36.830> up<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.100> up<00:02:37.190> first

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
an angle so you pushed up it up first

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.090 
an angle so you pushed up it up first
another<00:02:37.910> bolt<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:39.290> then<00:02:39.560> I'll<00:02:39.680> be<00:02:39.769> hanging

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
another bolt and then I'll be hanging

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.360 
another bolt and then I'll be hanging
behind<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:42.290> heater<00:02:42.560> hose<00:02:42.769> here<00:02:43.040> which<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.310> I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
behind this heater hose here which is I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.460 
behind this heater hose here which is I
have<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.670> very<00:02:44.090> hard<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.600> push<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.019> back<00:02:45.049> and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
that extension which this will end up up

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.690 
that extension which this will end up up
here<00:02:50.750> let's<00:02:50.989> just<00:02:51.049> see<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.380> lower<00:02:52.250> out<00:02:52.430> hard

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
here let's just see it lower out hard

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.280 
here let's just see it lower out hard
against<00:02:53.030> our<00:02:53.209> radiator<00:02:53.600> hose<00:02:53.810> but<00:02:54.080> yeah

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
against our radiator hose but yeah

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.839 
against our radiator hose but yeah
that's<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.130> only<00:02:55.430> way<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:55.580> get<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.209> bolt

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
that's the only way I get to that bolt

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.280 
that's the only way I get to that bolt
get<00:02:58.849> as<00:02:58.970> much<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.599> breeze<00:02:59.810> as<00:02:59.959> I<00:03:00.049> kind<00:03:00.170> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
get as much of a breeze as I kind of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.650 
get as much of a breeze as I kind of
tighten<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.769> so<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.549> need<00:03:01.760> two<00:03:02.359> little

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
tighten it so you need two little

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.680 
tighten it so you need two little
extensions<00:03:03.370> because<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.519> said<00:03:04.730> only<00:03:04.850> Aziz<00:03:05.239> -<00:03:05.269> I

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690
