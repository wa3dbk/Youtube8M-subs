illustration purposes were

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.330 
illustration purposes were
over-exercising<00:02:31.230> them<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.010> gives<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
over-exercising them but it gives you a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.830 
over-exercising them but it gives you a
good<00:02:32.519> idea<00:02:32.549> of<00:02:33.000> what's<00:02:33.209> going<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.720> that
