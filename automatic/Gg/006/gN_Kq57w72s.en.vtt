00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.660
 We recently discovered this colorful Chocolate Bomb on the paintiest and was just trying it. 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.120
 The optical illusion of sweets falling out of their own floating packages makes this cake so special. 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.920
 The recipe and list of ingredients are linked in the box below the video or can be found at http://amerikanisch--kochen.de 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 As a rule, you can simply use almost any cake you want. 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.640
 The only important thing is that it is covered in cannash. 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.040
 We are already ready cake for this video. 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.000
 This cake was made with the basic recipe of our dessert cake. 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.080
 If you want to know how to make this cake, I have a recipe link for you in our infobox. 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.400
 It is important that the cake is slightly shifted when placed on the cake plate. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 The first step is to put pieces of chocolate around the cake. Leave the gap around for 14cm. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.960
 The chocolate bars should stick to the cake thanks to cannash. 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.960
 Instead of chocolates, you can use long cookies, ladyfingers or chips. 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 Everything you want and basically works. 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.040
 Cutting of a small angle of confectionery ... 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.280
 ... pour the contents into a container and fill the empty wrap with a Saran wrap. 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.800
 This way, it will look as if it is still filled with candy later. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.200
 When all the bars stick evenly, you can spread candies on the cake. 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.600
 Again, feel free to use whatever dessert you want. 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.640
 Finally, the dessert is used to fill the blank and "paste" cake plate with some cannash. 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.360
 When that step is done, all that remains is to put the packaging on the cake. 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.440
 Now for the last and most detailed step. 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.640
 In order to simulate the "floating" effect, you stick wooden skewers in the cake ... 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.320
 .. and "glue" chocolate and candy them. 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.760
 Unfortunately, you have to take a break every now and then between these steps. 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.440
 Chocolate must harden before you can move forward. 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.440
 In order to keep molten chocolate, simply place the pot in warm water. 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.440
 Finally, add the packaging to the spinach and our cake is ready. 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.800
