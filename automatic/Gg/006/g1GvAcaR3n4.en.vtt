00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.880
 this car or this 1938 neon car 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.639
 presented a fault that is this takes in 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.759
 start this for the moment we saw that 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.519
 the car as it keeps good requires 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.220
 of service here we can notice his 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.050
 air filter is already very dirty wants 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.090
 yes, if this one has not been given a good 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.980
 service what spark plugs are 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.140
 We also took out the device 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.170
 somewhat worn and oil also 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.820
 find yourself burned but also in 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.370
 this case we are noticing that there is a 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.829
 electronic failure apart from those failures 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.659
 that has the car we are going to see another 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.809
 electronic failure what is this fault 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:43.420
 electronic that we notice or that or 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.729
 that we verify good we have in this 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.460
 case here the cmp sensor here is 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.050
 finished the head are sensors mp is 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.269
 a hall effect type sensor has 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.190
 three wires one of them receives from 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.350
 8-bag voltage one of them receives 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.769
 one earth another of them receives the signal 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.750
 of return to the computer in this 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.660
 case goes out 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.120
 us to verify it we are going to 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.970
 check both sensors in cmp and the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.100
 secap in I already have previously the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.290
 multimeter in 20 volt scale 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.410
 direct current already connect to ground 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.420
 and I have in this case my voltage line 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.860
 which I will direct to the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:28.869
 terminals 32 so that we first see 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.280
 what happens with the sensor leak it 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.710
 I'm going to drive the car, it 's not going to 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.450
 start because the fuel pump 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.570
 because the relay is not present it is not going to 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.180
 start I must verify a cut 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.670
 for example here is our marking 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.190
 4.8 should I verify a cut to a 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.580
 fall and a voltage rise when giving it 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.580
 March 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.849
 and had a cut of the signal wants 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.800
 indicate that that sensor is working 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.530
 the Belgian being the sensor escapes 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.530
 now I'm going to pass the terminal number 33 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.819
 that would be in this case cmp 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.469
 I'm going to give it a march and it must be 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.000
 the same effect are both effects 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.319
 game effects both receive our 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.530
 bag on the ground and a signal of 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.530
 return
