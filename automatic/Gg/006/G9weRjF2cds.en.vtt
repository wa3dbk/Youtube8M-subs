00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.210
 Cherry Applique 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.779
 and scam thanks to the internet 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.880
 divorced plurality amount fungus 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.680
 the waters among them are not only honest 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.439
 but there are dishonest people who 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.930
 are engaged in this field scam 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.349
 the easiest way for them to do what they are 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.510
 raised take a picture of it 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.820
 some videos are published on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 his video clouds earned as a stove 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.829
 which is hoofed for watching these videos 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.140
 in fact they carry there utter 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.660
 nonsense things so pay attention 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 on the playlist and this person if 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.110
 the gamer who raised the burial wants 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 I like to learn how to build up 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 it is in the games he is well versed 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.280
 new flu i would doubt it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.500
 what people carry 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.570
 stupid depths 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.540
 awkwardness creating in this way 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 such an incomprehensible state and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.720
 about one important thing i would like now 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 stop and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.220
 show it to you so here we are 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.110
 go to the refrigerator this video I 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.640
 gotta do it because they called me 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.710
 one my user is my friend 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.450
 fungus that's a beginner from poltava and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.640
 Poltava region and complained 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 that mycelium came to him approximately 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.500
 That's the kind of look I did 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.500
 about a month ago specifically for that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.479
 as he wrote his mycelium specifically 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.810
 took this here it was not a living purpose 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.909
 on white I grind it to grain 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.500
 poured here such packages commission 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.570
 fridge what came out of it you 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.950
 now I see these packages now 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.689
 take away from that fridge there on 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.100
 table there is a little bit better lighting and 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.100
 Now I will tell you what happened here. 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.009
 so look here at these sachets for 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.569
 means inexperienced person who sees 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.459
 this and the goal and for the first time different to him 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.970
 sound like some white targets 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.150
 which the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.010
 can be used for planting mushrooms and so 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.520
 further but in fact here we see 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.230
 almost complete full marriage is not 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.690
 we will look for some words there is an enemy 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.210
 it does not need a mycelium here 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.480
 some parts that's your goals here's 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.330
 all that grew up here means when I 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.550
 This man told me that he came 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.410
 mycelium here in such packages which means 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.090
 Here such a plastic bag is ready 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.070
 packages on top with such a lock 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.690
 that is, manufacturers are somewhere in 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.570
 Konotop is these or water 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.160
 I didn’t go deep there looking for them where 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.870
 They are there but from Konotop him 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.120
 sent here are the way you really have them 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.180
 there were three kilograms sealed here 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.100
 such a seam and approximately external 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.890
 They looked at home or not so well 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.840
 appearance they had such it is not 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.780
 look here is a view from the top here is mycelium 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.510
 there the results of the body was not there looked 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.580
 just here is cooked grain 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.470
 absolutely without any signs there 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.870
 under his cooking so on without 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.769
 some 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.690
 polypropylene bag without such 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.320
 Here are the filters ordinary polyethylene 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.940
 package day and poured grain but I hope 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.860
 at least they cooked it this grain 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.110
 because to sterilize it in such 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.570
 capacity is impossible the package grows 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.050
 melted here is autoclave sterilization 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.780
 and further it was visible in some 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.090
 ground single grains that started 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.320
 only grow the most offensive was 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.000
 for this person what he 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.930
 prepare for sowing he learned that he 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.080
 on Tuesday will have 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.180
 mycelium his background has already dumped something there 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.030
 husk sunflower seeds he wanted to start already 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.560
 I sow there Wednesday but it turned out that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.110
 The sight that went it was just 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.420
 a grain of wheat in which was poured there 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.030
 tablespoon someone's grain 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.610
 special means such a mycelium 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.220
 sell Konotop 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:09.000
 if you want to make sure to order from 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.269
 take them here and see this 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.370
 marriage I specifically this grain this was 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:19.109
 by good high-grade goals by external 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.260
 in appearance he looked like that 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.820
 here and so here so here I am his white 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.540
 simply 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.020
 kneaded on grain 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.400
 and put in the fridge necessarily 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.230
 because if he lay at 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.150
 room temperature for a long time chasing 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.420
 in ten days already and start there 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.580
 I just tried to grow books 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.900
 its at least at low temperatures 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.450
 at about plus 5 it is possible 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.490
 he somehow grows up and we both see that he 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.190
 growing but growing only on one side 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.200
 how do we understand that this clasp is not 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.390
 completely holds the air even see what 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.310
 mycelium penetrates 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.610
 a little bit here it sprouts product 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.710
 here this clasp there is a little bit he already 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.850
 started growing here from here he 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.430
 a little sucks 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.150
 oxygen and how here a little here here grows a 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.460
 what is below 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.830
 he started to just rot with these wet 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.630
 grains are rotting grains of wheat and on 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.750
 his principle mycelium already stretch wants 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.730
 what to do next 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.410
 can sells he asks for kicks though 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.020
 it’s unlikely to turn out well 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.630
 you can try and just need it 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.030
 simply throw on what I wanted 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.450
 pay attention to what allah is from 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.770
 ron 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.070
 due to the fact that on the Internet a lot 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.530
 publications and I make my publications 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.360
 purely sincerely in order to develop 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.160
 mushroom breeding in order to save 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.200
 people from mistakes to tell them how 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.370
 All right to do but despite this 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.740
 there are also people who are not completely honest who 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.780
 instead of doing some 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:50.880
 useful things they do like this 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.580
 Here and frank deceive people leading away 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.240
 their delusions mean this is a man from 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.850
 Poltava 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.490
 he wrote with his customer here 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.440
 asked to return them to compensate for these 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.380
 the costs that he spent on such 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.270
 here mycelium means what they did in 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.930
 did very honestly they sent another 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.570
 not one such party exactly the same 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.180
 mycelium of exactly the same grain covered 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.520
 this way and by the way he has somewhere through 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.740
 two weeks in these packages began to grow 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.900
 black to the stage not whale active centers 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.110
 goals are clear there expect from these 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.000
 the packages were useless and in general they 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.340
 he was sent again exactly the same 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.350
 Party is my life I do not need anyone 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.240
 and after that stopped already taking from 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.139
 it is just a phone that is 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.580
 to call already 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.860
 and it is impossible to have such sellers 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.110
 mycelium wish you follow the correct 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.409
 channels subscribe to my channel 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.719
 keep track of further publications and not 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:51.360
 fall for these scam 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.879
 in the field of mushroom and in the field to hang 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.800
 the rain with us is the best channel on mushrooms 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.080
 thematic and first channel which 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.499
 engaged exclusively in growing 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.520
 mushrooms and with you I am Oksana 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:04.520
 I hope for a rag
