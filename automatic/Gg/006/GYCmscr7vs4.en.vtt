say increased to 10,000 or 12,000 do you
guys<00:00:11.400> think<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.969> would<00:00:12.300> be<00:00:12.420> better<00:00:12.660> for

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
guys think that that would be better for

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.940 
guys think that that would be better for
the<00:00:12.990> game<00:00:13.110> or<00:00:13.230> worse<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> game

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the game or worse for the game

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
the game or worse for the game
personally<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.849> think<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.660> longer<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
personally I think that the longer the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.540 
personally I think that the longer the
game<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.500> yugioh<00:00:16.800> usually<00:00:17.100> drags<00:00:17.310> out<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
game in yugioh usually drags out the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.760 
game in yugioh usually drags out the
more<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.420> chance<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.020> game<00:00:19.199> feels<00:00:19.650> like

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
more of a chance the game feels like

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.769 
more of a chance the game feels like
both<00:00:20.039> players<00:00:20.310> Alex<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.060> play<00:00:21.090> rather

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
then attack two times so we'll just add

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260 
then attack two times so we'll just add
on<00:01:27.509> another<00:01:27.659> 2400<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:29.520> he<00:01:29.909> still<00:01:30.150> had

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270

tributed but he is 1400 so we'll add
1400<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:36.299> when<00:01:36.869> he<00:01:36.990> inflicts<00:01:37.439> battle

though you've already got game another
really<00:02:02.909> simple<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.780> otk<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.740> meta

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
really simple you know otk and the meta

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
really simple you know otk and the meta
essentially<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.880> they<00:02:06.329> go<00:02:06.420> her<00:02:06.570> first

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
essentially is like they go her first

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.240 
essentially is like they go her first
friend<00:02:06.899> log<00:02:07.079> yeah<00:02:07.229> rabbit<00:02:07.649> does<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.890> quite

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
friend log yeah rabbit does it quite

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.979 
friend log yeah rabbit does it quite
frequently<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.569> top<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.869> they

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
frequently and then on top that they

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.270 
frequently and then on top that they
have<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.649> negate<00:02:10.920> any<00:02:11.129> of

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
board is a laga a levee air and two

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.210 
board is a laga a levee air and two
vanilla<00:02:46.090> 1900<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:46.959> we'll<00:02:47.379> add<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.530> up<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:48.010> we

that you know if they increase the life
points<00:03:43.329> which<00:03:43.540> probably<00:03:43.810> won't<00:03:44.230> happen<00:03:44.440> but

you you guys think that you know twelve
thousand<00:04:01.959> or<00:04:02.049> ten<00:04:02.230> thousand<00:04:02.560> would<00:04:02.650> be<00:04:02.769> better

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
thousand or ten thousand would be better

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.710 
thousand or ten thousand would be better
or<00:04:03.459> do<00:04:03.579> you<00:04:03.669> think<00:04:03.790> maybe<00:04:03.970> even<00:04:04.060> lower<00:04:04.449> life

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
or do you think maybe even lower life

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.300 
or do you think maybe even lower life
points<00:04:05.049> but<00:04:05.169> I<00:04:05.410> don't<00:04:05.769> think<00:04:05.889> lower<00:04:06.099> life

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
points but I don't think lower life

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.050 
points but I don't think lower life
points<00:04:06.549> would<00:04:06.639> be<00:04:06.669> good

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060
