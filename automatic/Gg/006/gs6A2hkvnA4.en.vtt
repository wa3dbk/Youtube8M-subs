00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hi guys so today I wanted a quick little

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.710 
hi guys so today I wanted a quick little
person<00:00:02.280> here<00:00:02.490> between<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.909> Galaxy<00:00:03.360> s5<00:00:03.689> mini

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
person here between the Galaxy s5 mini

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.820 
person here between the Galaxy s5 mini
and<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:05.009> galaxy<00:00:05.759> s4<00:00:06.420> so<00:00:06.870> let's<00:00:07.290> take<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> look

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
and the galaxy s4 so let's take a look

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.980 
and the galaxy s4 so let's take a look
at<00:00:08.040> both<00:00:08.280> these<00:00:08.580> two<00:00:08.880> smartphones<00:00:09.330> over<00:00:09.809> here

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
at both these two smartphones over here

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.640 
at both these two smartphones over here
and<00:00:10.170> see<00:00:10.889> how<00:00:11.190> they<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.759> different<00:00:12.500> to<00:00:13.500> each

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
and see how they are different to each

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.140 
and see how they are different to each
other<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.190> obviously<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.120> first

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
other so obviously one of the first

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.630 
other so obviously one of the first
thing<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.890> see<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.369> we

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
thing here is that we can see is that we

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.090 
thing here is that we can see is that we
get<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.850> little<00:00:18.150> bit<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.449> smaller<00:00:19.100> display

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
get a little bit of a smaller display

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.500 
get a little bit of a smaller display
here<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:22.080> s5<00:00:22.500> mini<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.910> 4.5<00:00:24.480> inch

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
here on the the s5 mini it's a 4.5 inch

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.500 
here on the the s5 mini it's a 4.5 inch
display<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> little<00:00:25.590> bit<00:00:25.680> smaller<00:00:26.070> here

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
display it's a little bit smaller here

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.029 
display it's a little bit smaller here
obviously<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> can<00:00:28.320> also<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.680> how<00:00:28.830> it's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
obviously here you can also see how it's

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.030 
obviously here you can also see how it's
adopted<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.900> galaxy<00:00:30.900> s5<00:00:31.140> design<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
adopted the galaxy s5 design here and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.160 
adopted the galaxy s5 design here and
also<00:00:32.399> features<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> fingerprint<00:00:33.570> scanner<00:00:33.840> here

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
also features a fingerprint scanner here

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.520 
also features a fingerprint scanner here
on<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.160> front<00:00:35.370> side<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.050> when<00:00:37.380> we

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
on the front side so you can see when we

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.619 
on the front side so you can see when we
go<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> finger<00:00:39.030> scanner

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
go in here you have the finger scanner

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
go in here you have the finger scanner
here<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.500> set<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.370> works

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
here that you can set up and it works

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.119 
here that you can set up and it works
with<00:00:41.700> PayPal<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.620> definitely<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
with PayPal so that's definitely a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:44.750 
with PayPal so that's definitely a
little<00:00:44.309> bit<00:00:44.399> cool

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
little bit cool

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760 
little bit cool
you<00:00:44.940> also<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.360> new<00:00:45.719> button<00:00:46.170> layout<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you also have new button layout here a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
you also have new button layout here a
little<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:48.690> multitasking<00:00:49.379> key<00:00:50.510> that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
little bit with a multitasking key that

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.010 
little bit with a multitasking key that
you<00:00:51.719> didn't<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.469> s4<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:54.360> s4<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you didn't have on the s4 and the s4 you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.660 
you didn't have on the s4 and the s4 you
did<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.770> actually<00:00:56.129> hold<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.859> we

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
did have to actually hold in so if we

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.150 
did have to actually hold in so if we
move<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> look<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> design<00:01:01.649> here

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
move on here and look at the design here

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
move on here and look at the design here
and<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> hot<00:01:03.989> ray

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and you can see you have the hot ray

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
and you can see you have the hot ray
scanner<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.880> also<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
scanner here and you can also see that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
scanner here and you can also see that
in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.939> s5<00:01:08.939> mini<00:01:08.970> has<00:01:09.720> water<00:01:10.710> assistance<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
in the s5 mini has water assistance and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.330 
in the s5 mini has water assistance and
dust<00:01:11.640> resistant<00:01:12.180> body<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.380> no<00:01:13.530> flap<00:01:13.860> at<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
dust resistant body but no flap at the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700 
dust resistant body but no flap at the
bottom<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:16.470> used<00:01:16.619> some

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
bottom so I think something used some

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
bottom so I think something used some
coding<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.100> something<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> protect<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.180> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
coding or something to protect it but I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990 
coding or something to protect it but I
haven't<00:01:18.570> tested<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.110> myself<00:01:19.820> but<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.880> can

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
haven't tested it out myself but you can

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.200 
haven't tested it out myself but you can
see<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.659> protection<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.560> nice

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
see here the protection pretty nice

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.520 
see here the protection pretty nice
obviously<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.360> need<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> make<00:01:25.140> sure<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
obviously you need to make sure that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.100 
obviously you need to make sure that
it's<00:01:25.770> fully<00:01:26.070> fully<00:01:26.369> closed<00:01:32.810> this<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.020> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it's fully fully closed this one of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.890 
it's fully fully closed this one of
course<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.490> glossy<00:01:35.900> back

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
course has a little bit of a glossy back

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.249 
course has a little bit of a glossy back
instead<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:38.180> also<00:01:39.180> works<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
instead which also works but this is a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.749 
instead which also works but this is a
little<00:01:40.500> bit<00:01:40.619> different<00:01:40.950> obviously<00:01:41.100> home

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
little bit different obviously home

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.389 
little bit different obviously home
button<00:01:42.060> sticks<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.540> bit<00:01:42.780> more<00:01:43.399> you

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
button sticks out a little bit more you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.609 
button sticks out a little bit more you
have<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.579> 720p<00:01:45.299> display<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> s5<00:01:46.560> mini

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
have a 720p display here on the s5 mini

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.920 
have a 720p display here on the s5 mini
versus<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.340> 1080p<00:01:47.850> display<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:48.420> 5<00:01:48.630> inch<00:01:48.810> display

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
versus a 1080p display or 5 inch display

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.770 
versus a 1080p display or 5 inch display
on<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.130> big<00:01:50.340> size<00:01:50.579> s5<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.479> see

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
on there on the big size s5 you can see

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380 
on there on the big size s5 you can see
I<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.670> stock<00:01:53.670> theme<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.360> I

I<00:03:11.910> might<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.270> some<00:03:12.510> side-by-side<00:03:12.720> comparison

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
I might do some side-by-side comparison

you<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:17.310> 2600<00:03:18.180> milliamp<00:03:18.300> inside<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.930> this

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
you have 2600 milliamp inside of this

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.810 
you have 2600 milliamp inside of this
one<00:03:19.290> versus<00:03:19.680> two<00:03:19.890> thousand<00:03:20.520> one<00:03:20.700> hundred

milliamps inside of the s5 million which

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.440 
milliamps inside of the s5 million which
is<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.890> little<00:03:22.980> bit<00:03:23.220> smaller<00:03:23.520> but<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.239> think

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
is a little bit smaller but I think

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.850 
is a little bit smaller but I think
overall<00:03:24.780> they're<00:03:25.110> going<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.320> be<00:03:25.410> very<00:03:25.739> very

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
overall they're going to be very very

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.530 
overall they're going to be very very
familiar<00:03:26.630> battery<00:03:27.630> life<00:03:27.780> there<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.420> can

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
familiar battery life there so you can

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.330 
familiar battery life there so you can
see<00:03:30.660> here<00:03:30.840> both<00:03:31.050> have<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.500> same<00:03:31.530> opening<00:03:32.130> here

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
see here both have the same opening here

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.560 
see here both have the same opening here
but<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.610> one<00:03:32.820> should<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.090> lit<00:03:33.330> with<00:03:33.360> more

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
but this one should be lit with more

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.900 
but this one should be lit with more
protective<00:03:33.989> actually<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:35.610> actually

protective actually this one actually

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.030 
protective actually this one actually
got<00:03:36.000> water<00:03:36.300> damage<00:03:36.450> for<00:03:36.750> me<00:03:37.489> which<00:03:39.440> do<00:03:40.440> kind<00:03:40.860> of

got water damage for me which do kind of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.130 
got water damage for me which do kind of
suck<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:44.120> yes<00:03:45.120> 5<00:03:45.360> minutes<00:03:45.720> should<00:03:45.900> be

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
suck but the yes 5 minutes should be
