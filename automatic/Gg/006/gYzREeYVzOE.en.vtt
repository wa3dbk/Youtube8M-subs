00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
use waterproof formulas because I feel

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.390 
use waterproof formulas because I feel
like<00:05:57.719> it's<00:05:58.050> more<00:05:58.199> wax<00:05:58.529> based<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.190> really

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
like it's more wax based and it really

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.070 
like it's more wax based and it really
holds<00:05:59.669> to<00:05:59.969> lock<00:06:00.150> in<00:06:00.330> that<00:06:00.449> crook<00:06:00.690> especially

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
holds to lock in that crook especially

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.269 
holds to lock in that crook especially
when<00:06:01.229> you're<00:06:01.349> doing<00:06:01.469> that<00:06:01.710> method<00:06:02.130> where

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.920 
minutes to get both eyes complete now
it's<00:06:30.370> a<00:06:30.460> part<00:06:30.670> of<00:06:30.700> my<00:06:30.790> everyday<00:06:30.940> routine<00:06:31.360> and<00:06:31.870> I

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
do both eyes under one minute so it

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.280 
do both eyes under one minute so it
really<00:06:34.270> just<00:06:34.360> takes<00:06:34.600> a<00:06:34.900> little<00:06:35.080> bit<00:06:35.230> of

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
really just takes a little bit of

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.930 
really just takes a little bit of
practice<00:06:35.800> and<00:06:36.040> play<00:06:36.190> around<00:06:36.370> and<00:06:36.610> see<00:06:36.790> what
