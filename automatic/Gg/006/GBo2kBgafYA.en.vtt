they're gonna have to start getting

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
they're gonna have to start getting
teams<00:01:44.219> to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.460> more<00:01:44.640> honest<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.750> know

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
teams to be more honest and you know

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
teams to be more honest and you know
again<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.799> game<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:48.119> get

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
again in a game like this you can get

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.429 
again in a game like this you can get
that<00:01:48.390> extra<00:01:48.539> guy<00:01:48.719> down<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> box<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that extra guy down in the box and it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.590 
that extra guy down in the box and it
didn't<00:01:49.920> play<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.219> the<00:01:51.000> irony<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
didn't play well for the irony of the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
didn't play well for the irony of the
day<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.380> Giants<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
day is the Giants you know how a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.830 
day is the Giants you know how a
performance<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.359> either<00:01:54.539> side<00:01:54.810> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
performance is not going either side of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
performance is not going either side of
the<00:01:54.930> ball<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.320> they<00:01:55.500> consultants<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the ball but they consultants the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.380 
the ball but they consultants the
division<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> fouls<00:01:57.359> who<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
division and a fouls who this

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.360 
division and a fouls who this
but<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.320> think<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.650> going<00:01:59.800> to<00:01:59.890> be<00:01:59.979> posted

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
but I think this is going to be posted

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.230 
but I think this is going to be posted

way<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.600> go<00:02:10.660> giants<00:02:10.959> like<00:02:11.560> either<00:02:11.709> way<00:02:11.920> they

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
way to go giants like either way they

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.620 
way to go giants like either way they
said<00:02:12.280> that's<00:02:12.430> not<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> preferred<00:02:12.940> way<00:02:13.360> to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
said that's not the preferred way to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.199

clinch so and the big thing I think with

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.480 
clinch so and the big thing I think with
this<00:02:16.300> team<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:17.470> wasn't<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> distraction<00:02:18.370> I

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
this team is it wasn't a distraction I

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.190
