Vaseline around the thing so it's a good
watertight<00:01:21.869> seal<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.560> great<00:01:22.740> because

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
watertight seal and it's great because

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
watertight seal and it's great because
inside<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> lot<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.090> super<00:01:24.330> delicate

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
inside here is a lot of super delicate

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.460 
inside here is a lot of super delicate
things<00:01:24.930> there's<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.400> SD<00:01:27.299> card<00:01:27.330> goes<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.320> there

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
things there's the SD card goes in there

things there's the SD card goes in there
it's<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.829> dark<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.280> can't<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
it's really dark so you can't see this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.270 
it's really dark so you can't see this
very<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.659> there's<00:01:31.200> an<00:01:31.470> SD<00:01:31.799> card<00:01:31.829> anair

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
very well but there's an SD card anair

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.999 
very well but there's an SD card anair
there's<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> USB<00:01:32.880> slot<00:01:33.210> there's<00:01:33.869> my<00:01:34.290> kin<00:01:34.619> and

audio-visual out so you've got a lot of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
audio-visual out so you've got a lot of
inputs<00:01:36.960> hidden<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
inputs hidden in here so you want to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
inputs hidden in here so you want to
have<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> good<00:01:38.880> seal<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.750> important<00:01:40.140> in

have a good seal and that's important in

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.660 
have a good seal and that's important in
this<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> perfect<00:01:41.250> solution<00:01:41.369> for

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this this is the perfect solution for

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.389 
this this is the perfect solution for
that<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.509> problem<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:44.100> thumb

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that the problem is the little thumb

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.700 
that the problem is the little thumb
screw<00:01:44.820> goes<00:01:45.720> into<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.500> brass<00:01:47.220> insert<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
screw goes into a brass insert which is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.289 
screw goes into a brass insert which is
right<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.740> there<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> little<00:01:51.000> brass

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
right in there that's the little brass

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.170 
right in there that's the little brass
insert<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.710> brass<00:01:52.950> insert<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.640> set<00:01:54.000> into

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
insert and the brass insert is set into

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.230 
insert and the brass insert is set into
a<00:01:54.390> relief<00:01:55.170> area<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> plastic<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.090> way

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
a relief area in the plastic and the way

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.170 
a relief area in the plastic and the way
they<00:01:57.420> did<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:59.009> plastic<00:01:59.549> around<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
they did it is the plastic around it is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660 
they did it is the plastic around it is
low<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:01.649> I'll<00:02:01.920> show<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> plastic

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
low and here I'll show you the plastic

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.730 
low and here I'll show you the plastic
around<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.360> all<00:02:03.540> low<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.259> bottom<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
around it is like all low the bottom of

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.709 
around it is like all low the bottom of
the<00:02:04.979> thing<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> then<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.090> raised<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.600> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the thing and then they raised up a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.419 
the thing and then they raised up a
little<00:02:06.930> piece<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.259> plastic<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.310> they

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
little piece of plastic and then they

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.880 
little piece of plastic and then they
put<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> insert<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.239> that

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
put the insert in that

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.280 
put the insert in that
it's<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.039> press-fit<00:02:10.340> insert<00:02:10.910> well<00:02:11.750> what<00:02:12.140> they

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
it's a press-fit insert well what they

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.770 
it's a press-fit insert well what they
need<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.500> do<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:13.010> bring<00:02:13.490> all<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.000> plastic<00:02:14.569> up

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
need to do is bring all the plastic up

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780 
need to do is bring all the plastic up
so<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.470> change<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.920> mold<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.190> little<00:02:16.400> bit<00:02:16.580> and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
so just change the mold a little bit and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.940 
so just change the mold a little bit and
if<00:02:17.090> all<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.360> plastic<00:02:17.780> was<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.590> insert

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
if all the plastic was up the insert

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.160 
if all the plastic was up the insert
would<00:02:19.220> sit<00:02:19.490> in<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.819> solid<00:02:20.240> block<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.720> plastic

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
would sit in a solid block of plastic

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.199 
would sit in a solid block of plastic
and<00:02:21.290> be<00:02:21.500> fine<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.400> reason<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.850> want<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.060> do

this is big jumpy monkey more on guys

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.530 
this is big jumpy monkey more on guys
like<00:02:26.990> us<00:02:27.170> who<00:02:28.040> picked<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.459> up<00:02:28.520> put<00:02:29.420> the

there's a thread on it there's there's a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.390 
there's a thread on it there's there's a
slot<00:02:38.480> there<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:38.900> using<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.200> screwdriver<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.950> to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
slot there for using a screwdriver is to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.770 
slot there for using a screwdriver is to
grab<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.610> screwdriver<00:02:40.850> or<00:02:41.209> something<00:02:41.330> we

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
grab a screwdriver or something we

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.150 
grab a screwdriver or something we
didn't<00:02:41.959> even<00:02:42.050> do<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.230> we<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.890> did<00:02:43.070> this

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
didn't even do that we just I did this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.680 
didn't even do that we just I did this
one<00:02:43.340> normal<00:02:43.580> finger<00:02:43.820> pressure<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.420> didn't

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
one normal finger pressure and I didn't

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.960 
one normal finger pressure and I didn't
do<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.810> hard<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:45.860> tugged<00:02:46.489> it<00:02:46.610> down<00:02:46.730> nice

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
do it hard I just tugged it down nice

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.840 
do it hard I just tugged it down nice
and<00:02:47.000> snug<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:48.739> broke<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.489> thing<00:02:49.700> you

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
and snug and I broke the thing you

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.940 
and snug and I broke the thing you
pulled<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.630> little<00:02:50.870> insert<00:02:51.230> right<00:02:51.530> out<00:02:51.709> and

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
pulled the little insert right out and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.490 
pulled the little insert right out and
it<00:02:52.040> broke<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.790> little<00:02:53.030> ring<00:02:53.300> around<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:54.320> in

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
it broke the little ring around it in

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.920 
it broke the little ring around it in
two<00:02:54.800> different<00:02:55.040> places<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.940> did<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.630> on<00:02:56.810> the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
two different places I did this on the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.830 
two different places I did this on the
first<00:02:57.230> day<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.620> having<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:59.330> reason<00:02:59.720> it

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
first day of having this the reason it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.040 
first day of having this the reason it
breaks<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.440> easily<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:01.100> because<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.690> just

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
breaks so easily is because it's just

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.810 
breaks so easily is because it's just
said<00:03:03.260> in<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.440> ring<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.980> isn't<00:03:04.250> fully<00:03:04.459> relief

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
said in that ring it isn't fully relief

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.340 
said in that ring it isn't fully relief
tin<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.390> should<00:03:05.570> be<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.200> could

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
tin like it should be and you could

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.810 
tin like it should be and you could
either<00:03:06.470> fully<00:03:06.769> relief<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.670> use<00:03:07.790> a

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
either fully relief it in and use a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.090 
either fully relief it in and use a
slightly<00:03:08.090> longer<00:03:08.420> screw<00:03:08.840> or<00:03:09.050> change<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.920> mold

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
slightly longer screw or change the mold

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.220 
slightly longer screw or change the mold
a<00:03:10.160> little<00:03:10.340> bit<00:03:10.519> so<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.330> just<00:03:11.660> flush<00:03:11.989> and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
a little bit so that it's just flush and

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.540 
a little bit so that it's just flush and
all<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.470> plastic<00:03:12.890> is<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.010> little<00:03:13.220> bit<00:03:13.340> thicker

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
all the plastic is a little bit thicker

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.949 
all the plastic is a little bit thicker
but<00:03:13.700> either<00:03:13.850> one<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.060> those<00:03:14.209> would<00:03:14.480> fix<00:03:14.720> this

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
but either one of those would fix this

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.020 
but either one of those would fix this
really<00:03:15.440> simple<00:03:15.769> fundamental<00:03:16.489> problem<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
really simple fundamental problem and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.420 
really simple fundamental problem and
the<00:03:17.690> device<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.230> designed<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.860> be<00:03:18.980> super

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the device is designed to be super

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.759 
the device is designed to be super
rugged<00:03:19.790> bulletproof<00:03:20.390> works<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.350> know<00:03:21.440> every

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
rugged bulletproof works you know every

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.259 
rugged bulletproof works you know every
time<00:03:21.799> no<00:03:22.190> problems<00:03:22.579> so<00:03:22.640> that's<00:03:23.030> something

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
time no problems so that's something

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.250 
time no problems so that's something
where<00:03:23.420> you're<00:03:23.540> going<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.750> want<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.930> change<00:03:24.079> it

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
where you're going to want to change it

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.350 
where you're going to want to change it
because<00:03:24.380> we<00:03:24.650> broke<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:24.980> into<00:03:25.130> first<00:03:25.340> day<00:03:25.640> so

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
because we broke it into first day so

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.900 
because we broke it into first day so
but<00:03:26.989> aside<00:03:27.230> from<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:28.100> great<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.579> really

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
but aside from that it's great I really

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.340 
but aside from that it's great I really
I<00:03:28.940> those<00:03:29.420> are<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.600> only<00:03:29.660> complaints<00:03:30.200> is<00:03:30.320> that

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
I those are the only complaints is that

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.930 
I those are the only complaints is that
it's<00:03:30.709> kind<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.190> twitchy<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.730> doesn't

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
it's kind of twitchy and it doesn't

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.310 
it's kind of twitchy and it doesn't
always<00:03:32.060> boot<00:03:32.329> properly<00:03:32.600> maybe<00:03:33.019> that's<00:03:33.230> a

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
always boot properly maybe that's a

solution<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.190> beyond<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.330> works<00:04:30.510> great

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
solution and beyond that it works great

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.530 
solution and beyond that it works great
the<00:04:31.380> only<00:04:31.620> other<00:04:31.650> problem<00:04:32.160> we<00:04:32.400> had<00:04:32.970> with<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.419> at

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
the only other problem we had with it at

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.150 
the only other problem we had with it at
all<00:04:33.570> probably<00:04:34.290> isn't<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.650> problem<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:35.100> the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
all probably isn't a problem of the

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.830 
all probably isn't a problem of the
camera<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:36.210> files<00:04:36.870> that<00:04:37.050> come<00:04:37.290> off<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.740> are

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
camera the files that come off of it are

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.540 
camera the files that come off of it are
kind<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:39.990> funny<00:04:40.260> codec<00:04:40.710> or<00:04:40.889> something<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.520> we

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
kind of a funny codec or something so we

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.040 
kind of a funny codec or something so we
haven't<00:04:41.970> found<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.210> single<00:04:42.240> computer<00:04:42.780> that

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
haven't found a single computer that

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.590 
haven't found a single computer that
just<00:04:43.290> worked<00:04:43.740> well<00:04:44.010> with<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.430> files<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:45.030> if

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
just worked well with the files and if

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.850 
just worked well with the files and if
you<00:04:45.690> take<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.990> files<00:04:46.200> off<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.800> load

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
you take the files off this and load

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.909 
you take the files off this and load
them<00:04:46.980> into<00:04:47.130> sony<00:04:47.340> vegas<00:04:47.760> there's<00:04:48.150> no<00:04:48.330> audio<00:04:48.660> no

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
them into sony vegas there's no audio no

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.500 
them into sony vegas there's no audio no
idea<00:04:49.919> why<00:04:50.100> maybe<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.820> vaio<00:04:50.970> people<00:04:51.360> can

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
idea why maybe the vaio people can

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.300 
idea why maybe the vaio people can
comment<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.169> maybe<00:04:52.410> another<00:04:52.800> vaio<00:04:53.040> user

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
comment on that maybe another vaio user
