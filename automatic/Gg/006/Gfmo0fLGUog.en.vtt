00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello today i will talk to you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.629
 of the watch me to assets so I you 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.420
 present her this little watch so 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.969
 a sport mode that does not allow you to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.259
 connect in bluetooth to your smartphone 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.240
 but who will allow the blow to have 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.140
 a world connected to its performance 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.650
 what can we say so life 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.060
 active 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.960
 we will try to make a tour of 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.960
 features there are a lot 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.500
 first of all buttons presentation here 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.160
 on the side two buttons here and there the 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.469
 sinews of war 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.180
 a small sensor that allow you 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.350
 to have your rhythm directly 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.480
 heart rate 98 and bedtime at 45% of my 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.320
 maximum heart rate so for those 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.739
 who run and who are used to 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.839
 run 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.159
 this is obviously the main objective 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.449
 to have a watch like that it 's 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.280
 power permanently when one is in 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.309
 running to have the rhythm 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.640
 cardiac the second main 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.920
 functionality 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.689
 that's when there is a pedometer 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.250
 to integrate so you can tell you 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.250
 how long will you run the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.420
 distance the speed even though 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.790
 actually as it is on a 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.060
 pedometer and a gps and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.960
 we are going a little less reliability but 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.390
 so we really have a shadow that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.800
 lets run to have those calories at 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.270
 day to day and they are in number 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.020
 not every day so it's very very 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.490
 effective for monitoring its activity 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 the features so there I have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.450
 example the number of calories expended 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.580
 today we can also manage by 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.600
 example here if I'm trying to 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:40.940
 eat I'll be able to indicate in the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.840
 shows that I ate for 300 calories 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.979
 there is a small application that is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.420
 provided via qr code is right here and who 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.860
 will allow the shot to calculate and 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.070
 to have in the day the number of 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.650
 calories in brain balance is what 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.869
 you are in the day there the number 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.310
 of kilometers walking and the time of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.100
 walk the caps the number of steps per 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.560
 day where for example that of this 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.820
 week the tear so to little sounded it 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560
 there is only one configurable weapon but 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.420
 can ring every morning or a moment 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.610
 given of the day and of course the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.810
 race management with different 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.700
 types of races so there for example top 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.700
 we will put ourselves in race mode 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.820
 so that's to make two types of 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.470
 shopping it's going to ring for a minute 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.230
 then for a minute so to do 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.690
 Fractional is perfect we also 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.420
 the timer pushed the little arrow that 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.860
 so decides the little timer for decree 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.450
 lie or for incremental here is there 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.299
 different racing modes that are all 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.520
 made for everyone well prepared for 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.890
 stroke 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.960
 runners those who train this 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.060
 who founded the march for training 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.900
 or for the competition for once 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.940
 have had to see his performances 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.590
 we also have here the different modes of 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.070
 race that will adjust the pace 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.810
 cardiac 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.390
 so to say that there if I'm in 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.610
 fitness of the blow to the minimum it would take 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.110
 that I'm 135 a maximum at 154 for 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.760
 to be in the range that correspond to the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.160
 fitness if I want to burn some 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.830
 fat it will be another etc etc we have 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.650
 all modes that are pre-recorded 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.280
 and suddenly the second mode I'm going to m 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.830
 Europe 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.570
 so here I will be lower and here and there 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.460
 I just have to press start and 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.840
 it's gone on the calculation of the peso call 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.890
 up and here we go for a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.760
 workout so she works very very 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.160
 well there is a little bit of retro 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.610
 lighting that we are not good at 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.170
 the up display is always in a few 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.570
 moments to have my heartbeat that 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.040
 it's really the top 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.270
 and suddenly I can only advise 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.920
 it's really a beautiful watch the 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.330
 bracelet is a bit small but suddenly 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.520
 it does not really go too big 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.020
 world when we run the hay gets annoyed 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.730
 because actually at home and 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.130
 that I am below but 135 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.070
 so that's a very interesting long 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.850
 active lamilhau found on the 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.850
 blue point watch
