choosing<00:00:00.989> between<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.530> Garmin<00:00:01.949> 620<00:00:02.730> in<00:00:02.850> the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
choosing between the Garmin 620 in the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.470 
choosing between the Garmin 620 in the
910<00:00:03.570> XT<00:00:04.049> can<00:00:04.650> be<00:00:04.680> really<00:00:05.130> difficult<00:00:05.460> so<00:00:06.180> I'll

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
910 XT can be really difficult so I'll

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.790 
910 XT can be really difficult so I'll
try<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.930> explain<00:00:07.760> then<00:00:08.990> 620<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.019> more

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
try to explain then 620 is more

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.690 
try to explain then 620 is more
beautiful<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.910> very<00:00:12.300> sleek<00:00:13.160> it's<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.340> lighter

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
beautiful it's very sleek it's a lighter

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.240 
beautiful it's very sleek it's a lighter
it's<00:00:15.089> 44<00:00:15.690> grams<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.800> 9/10<00:00:17.340> XT<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.890> 70<00:00:19.890> grams

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
it's 44 grams and a 9/10 XT is 70 grams

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.750 
it's 44 grams and a 9/10 XT is 70 grams
so<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> little<00:00:21.180> bit<00:00:21.390> heavier<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.039> it's<00:00:23.039> really

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
so a little bit heavier but it's really

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.679 
so a little bit heavier but it's really
big<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.949> the<00:00:25.949> 620<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.519> very<00:00:26.939> beautiful<00:00:27.510> watch

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
big and the 620 is very beautiful watch

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.620 
big and the 620 is very beautiful watch
also<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.380> you're<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.279> run<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:30.330> for

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
also if you're not going to run but for

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.360 
also if you're not going to run but for
daily<00:00:31.260> use<00:00:32.000> but<00:00:33.050> 910<00:00:34.050> XT<00:00:34.410> has<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.800> some

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
daily use but 910 XT has some some

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.600 
daily use but 910 XT has some some
features<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.420> love<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.370> are<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
features that I really love that are the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.990 
features that I really love that are the
four<00:00:39.510> data<00:00:39.750> fields<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:41.129> connection<00:00:41.610> with<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
four data fields the connection with the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.750 
four data fields the connection with the
power<00:00:42.270> top<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.410> when<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.309> go<00:00:44.460> cycling

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
power top for the when you go cycling

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.459 
power top for the when you go cycling
and<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:47.180> endurance<00:00:48.180> Porter<00:00:48.660> for

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and if you are endurance Porter for

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.790 
and if you are endurance Porter for
cycling<00:00:50.370> swimming<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.420> running<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.620> other

sports

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
sports

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
sports
I<00:00:53.430> think<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:55.050> 910<00:00:55.559> XT<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.989> better<00:00:57.989> watch

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
I think the 910 XT is the better watch

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.510 
I think the 910 XT is the better watch
for<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.930> 620<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.530> also<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> couple<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
for you and the 620 is also a couple of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.670 
for you and the 620 is also a couple of
cool<00:01:02.760> features<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.480> few<00:01:03.629> only<00:01:03.870> one<00:01:04.229> for

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
cool features and a few only one for

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.120 
cool features and a few only one for
example<00:01:05.270> then<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.320> great<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
example then I think it's it's great it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.510 
example then I think it's it's great it
has<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.520> extra<00:01:09.000> features<00:01:09.830> in<00:01:10.830> contrast<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
has some extra features in contrast to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
has some extra features in contrast to
the<00:01:11.729> 9<00:01:12.030> 10

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the 9 10

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.630 
the 9 10
XT<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.710> tower<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:16.220> heat<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.960> dect<00:01:19.310> if<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
XT in the tower the heat is dect if I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.560 
XT in the tower the heat is dect if I
may<00:01:20.700> say<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> correctly<00:01:22.759> that<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.150> ground

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
may say that correctly that is to ground

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.289 
may say that correctly that is to ground
contact<00:01:24.960> time<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.310> long<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
contact time so how long are you on the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
contact time so how long are you on the
ground<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> vertical<00:01:29.130> OSC<00:01:29.850> does<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:31.799> height

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
ground the vertical OSC does that height

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.960 
ground the vertical OSC does that height
that<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:34.009> go<00:01:35.009> through<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.729> running

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that you go through when you are running

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
that you go through when you are running
and<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.079> less<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.890> better<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and the less it is the better it is

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
and the less it is the better it is
according<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.150> Garmin<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
according to Garmin and this is the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.910 
according to Garmin and this is the
average<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.970> adjust<00:01:42.360> everything<00:01:42.920> of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
average so you can adjust everything of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.679 
average so you can adjust everything of
course<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.340> shows<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> hard<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.509> zone

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
course it shows the hard way to the zone

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.530 
course it shows the hard way to the zone
and<00:01:46.020> everything<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.540> like

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and everything you want to see like

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.289 
and everything you want to see like
distance<00:01:49.350> time<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.250> pace<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.909> heart<00:01:53.939> rate

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
distance time and pace the heart rate

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.679 
distance time and pace the heart rate
belts<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:55.229> also<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.829> little<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.689> different

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
belts are also a little bit different

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.370 
belts are also a little bit different
they<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> same<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.040> course<00:01:59.509> but<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:01.020> one

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
they do the same of course but this one

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.590 
they do the same of course but this one
is<00:02:01.890> set<00:02:02.250> other<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> world<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.420> new

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
is set other the world of the new

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
is set other the world of the new
government<00:02:04.490> 620<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:06.240> more<00:02:06.570> beautiful<00:02:07.310> but

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
government 620 it's more beautiful but

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.140 
government 620 it's more beautiful but
they<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.270> course<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.810> same<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:11.150> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
they do of course the same and just a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.449 
they do of course the same and just a
little<00:02:12.450> bit<00:02:12.599> newer

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
little bit newer

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.589 
little bit newer
so<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.489> think<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.030> are<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.299> biggest

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
so I think that are the biggest

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.630 
so I think that are the biggest
differences<00:02:16.409> between<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:18.739> 620<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.189> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
differences between the 620 and the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.729 
differences between the 620 and the
government<00:02:21.200> 910<00:02:22.200> xD<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:24.439> yeah<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.500> can

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
government 910 xD and yeah you can

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.909 
government 910 xD and yeah you can
choose<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.340> yourself<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.879> course
