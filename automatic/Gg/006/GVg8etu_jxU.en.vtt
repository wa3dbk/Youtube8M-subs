00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 go and Vasily told me how much 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.330
 time and effort he had to spend on 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.460
 so that the lawn becomes so beautiful and 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.620
 even my wife even had to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.840
 to win a place on flower beds 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:20.880
 everything would be fine if it were not for one nuance 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 host dogs trample the holy wives Olga 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.180
 Well, there is such a problem what to do 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 well first 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.210
 train and train lawns digging 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.279
 all dogs are not only burrows they are just in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 principle can not dig but really 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.410
 In fact, they love places that are 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.149
 tower on these places grow nothing 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.890
 will not be because these places she will 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.149
 all the time behind him and the only one possible 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.550
 come up with the next ti you take 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.260
 reward hooves for them 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.950
 special place separately 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.739
 enter together with your pet and train 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.960
 order him to dig and dig to dig and 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.270
 dig only in this way she understands 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.890
 what is this place specifically reserved for 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.780
 digging you let 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 and dig there lately many 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.080
 the owners in their cottages are not dogs give birth 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.909
 and pigs it 's great because blue 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.040
 man well, for example 3 branches before 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.960
 truffles in france from well and right here 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.470
 profiles i'm afraid we haven't started need 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 rowed 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.119
 sow yourself on the site and straight 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.119
 hatch teach raising then 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.729
 so you can prepare how are you 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.189
 I thought I knew whom to surprise you so as not to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.009
 do all these mushrooms we will dispute 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.680
 take and separate directly from hats 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.049
 let's help come on we need the corpse themselves 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 field say about wormy mushrooms fit 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.060
 fits even better because in shooting range 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.220
 white mushrooms spores already mature ass 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.619
 but in general, it is better to choose 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.869
 will be older actually quantity 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.810
 here has no start what we are now 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.819
 you are preparing a suspension and then you can 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.649
 will breed with any amount and 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.780
 You can sow a very large area 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.200
 pour water whether water should be 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.569
 surely warm you see i cooked 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.209
 three days ago did the same thing 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:11.130
 I cleaned my bra tubes and here it is 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:15.390
 it turned out a suspension with disputes so here 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.760
 here under the Christmas tree we will come out 700 watch 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.670
 so water why 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.220
 to the spawn coming soon 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.530
 for three to five years so the fourth 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.350
 year 5 3 would appear easier looking 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.910
 and why exactly next to the tree on the very 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.400
 you need to go under that tree 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.220
 which the mushroom loves can and canal 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.040
 bring a small parking nearby 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.500
 mushroom from mycelium and plant it on 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.260
 plot this is one hundred percent option because 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.000
 that a place patty will take root for sure 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.079
 and if you need to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.359
 formed 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.130
 a certain microclimate and greenhouse 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.680
 the effect is quite right 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.660
 Of course it is better that these leaves were 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.860
 constantly wet periodically water 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.070
 warm battles 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.590
 and and in no way rake in for 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.510
 Here are a few onions Well, we are waiting for mushrooms 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.510
 yes couple dan owners
