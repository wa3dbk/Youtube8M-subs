00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.410
 hello everyone welcome on green de 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.590
 hope is so today I 'm doing you 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.660
 a little video about nails because 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.609
 that I always had nails but 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.070
 frightful there is no other word it is in 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:26.859
 did I have the soft nails that got 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:29.380
 split and that was very streaked the 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.820
 small that it marks segou who 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.870
 that she knows who was splitting late beats 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.300
 floral and it's now going to 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.350
 three weeks that I found a combo 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.410
 that works I have the hard ongs that get 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.190
 do not split it up long for the 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.489
 first time of my life 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.870
 his mother created that and I'm great 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.020
 so I wanted to explain 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.600
 what I did to get to that so 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.340
 already before I cut my nails with 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.920
 a coupon so thing to banish 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.469
 ban and so it's better to 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.409
 file nails with a nail file 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:11.979
 cardboard for not found everywhere 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.350
 expensive and especially when you have your nails 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.270
 soft and which doubles up it is necessary to be limer 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.149
 the nails only in one direction avoid 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.670
 it is better to limit in a 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.510
 only sense that it prevents the ongs 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.410
 double splits 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.670
 fastrÃ© magne and the other the other thing 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.540
 very well finally there are plenty of things 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.860
 important 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:37.880
 there is that and also you buy a 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.380
 nail brush and you brush them 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.360
 nails every day every day 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.510
 every day you left it on your 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.040
 sink next to your soap and you 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.600
 you really brush every day the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.570
 nails then I brush them like that 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.060
 and I purse them like that too 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.450
 and really it will harden the nails 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.660
 really very very effective here so 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.800
 I also have little sticks in addition 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.450
 small as wooden for pushing the 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.640
 cuticles that too you have to do it and 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.670
 especially do not cut your cuticles 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.810
 because otherwise it will really do 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.940
 part to you are going to have desires 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.650
 everywhere you know the cravings it's the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.860
 small pieces I still have a little 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.740
 little 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.110
 that's how it's made you 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.360
 little is not pretty at all that you 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.170
 makes a small piece of skin that gets 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.170
 go and it hurts a lot 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.440
 and the other very important thing is 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.020
 the hand cream 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.230
 so here it is a sample from 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.910
 the Occitan of not too bad and so that 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.110
 you leave it that you leave it to me 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.519
 I found the technique for my master 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.970
 very often leave you in your bag 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:53.150
 in hand and so you put one in 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:56.840
 hazelnut you add even with this 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.060
 and after, to prevent you from having 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.090
 do you want to massage your nails and 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.019
 cuticles and you'll see if you 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.459
 you get to do it every day 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.989
 so I do not know I found the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.819
 method I put it in my purse 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.080
 there is the night table I put it in 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.150
 here it is again on the table of 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.390
 night it can be at your desk in front of 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.489
 the TV here and you massage well 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.019
 cuticles like that and it's really 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.580
 radical I thought it was okay and 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.930
 effective for me so maybe that's it 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.890
 will be for you see you massage well 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.500
 like that and it's pretty frankly 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.269
 I saw a clear improvement so 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.400
 that's why I 'm telling you this and 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.310
 also when you put polish on 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.620
 everything on everything but you are a base 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.090
 because it's really going to hurt you 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.140
 so if you put directly the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.170
 varnish without base 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.360
 so here it is a mavala base but there 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.890
 is full in other brands but 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.870
 this is not a good state this one 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.640
 it is really good because 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.680
 they dry quickly 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.180
 a layer and live you see that 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.129
 it's the one you can already put 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.660
 your polish so that's a sense 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.049
 today angles is a trick of 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.060
 sick 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.370
 it is essential to protect your 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.430
 nails and other things I had 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.380
 discovered also is apricot cream 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.650
 for the nails of dior so it's 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.359
 find in a little pot like that and 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.579
 so it smells like apricot 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.150
 the indicated is so it's a species of 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.889
 dough 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.889
 so it's not very nice for a game 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.079
 like that I confess then it's a dough 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.670
 very very very thick so this game them 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.810
 updates 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.250
 this woman I put it on the table 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.390
 at night and I do it in the evening because 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.820
 really her tights it's not nice 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.830
 and it's better than any way they 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.970
 say well with no use of 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.700
 preferably in the evening, leaving 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.170
 all night that's effective or if they 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.300
 know that it lasts so well others 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.960
 for for people who have a problem 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.760
 so the slack so here I am doing everything 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.220
 this for a few weeks now 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.990
 and I really saw a clear difference 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.760
 I have never had such beautiful nails 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.370
 that and I wanted to share that with 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.010
 you and for people concerned 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.770
 I hope it would go to you 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.400
 so I make big big kisses but I 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.880
 tell you see you soon 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.880
 ciao
