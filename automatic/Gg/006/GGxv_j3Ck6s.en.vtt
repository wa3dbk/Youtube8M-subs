00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.070
 also offered to Catherine to make sure 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.789
 yourself as a paint and try 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.820
 change my image color with me and my 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.220
 structures are very big plans to run 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.189
 this product but a lot of questions 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.470
 how to use how to pick it up 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.960
 Say very well that we have questions 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.900
 so I suggest you combine 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.020
 holding our master class with 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.090
 answers to the questions we have 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.979
 great tool we have 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.619
 palette for 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.490
 select incas and see for example 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.369
 what shade you choose here is great 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.799
 chose to think we have 5-6 shade 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.810
 the mahogany chose quite right 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.939
 because actually using our 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.369
 paint we can do in two tones 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.009
 darker or 2 tone lighter this 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.979
 hue matter you brighter and at the same time 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.930
 he fits into these two tones many 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.270
 people now buy paints or just 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.740
 in the store or go salon well what to do 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.320
 with this as we face in the market and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.969
 I would recommend her correctly 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.880
 advised to remember a few basic 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.829
 moments of which we will be telling 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.990
 our customers and consultant first 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.570
 we are direct sales and we have a unique 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.510
 opportunity to personally recommend one 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.430
 hue to our client who wants to 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.189
 second 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.379
 the uniqueness of our paint is that 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.750
 flaxseed oil 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.510
 has a great caretaker 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.969
 action yes i'm close shine a voice in 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.640
 third in the third of our paint do 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:31.799
 more expressive your hair shade 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.310
 if a woman does not want to change completely 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:39.269
 shade fourth very important 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.430
 There is no country which produced paint in 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.790
 our case our paint are produced in 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.419
 in Italy we are both so important to talk and 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.090
 certainly paints a gray hair on a hundred 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.379
 percent and master class which we 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.280
 Now we spend with you 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.389
 this is a unique opportunity for 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.329
 promotion of this category is unique 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.709
 opportunity to offer paints and 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.579
 it is an opportunity to collect as much as possible 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:10.489
 more people to 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:13.349
 show how good our paint is 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.560
 consultants have a very topical issue 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.049
 I know about the amount of paint 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.780
 So I think that you need to consider not 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.299
 exactly the amount of paint per se from 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.579
 the ratio of the most coloring cream ok 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.489
 clarifier because for example 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:33.060
 amount of paint in a tool in paints 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.930
 for dark hair a little more brightener 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:41.479
 less and in dye for blond hair 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:45.569
 of the coloring cream and a little less 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:46.169
 oxidizer slightly more than a pyatun paint 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.569
 house 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.489
 many customers are very incredulous 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.000
 which include red composition 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.759
 ammonia 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.739
 now smell the paint he's pretty 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:58.620
 nice and our paint unless there is 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.859
 ammonia in our paint is ammonia and need 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.150
 consider them as paints can be 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.030
 marked and 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.759
 and can be without a ball on the content 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.009
 ammonia without ammonia content of paint 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.810
 which ammonia contains has very 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:15.810
 big plus first ammonia 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.389
 prepares the hair itself to hit 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.930
 there paint secondly he makes paint 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.360
 more resistant 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.850
 ammonia- free paint 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.400
 thin ordinary ones who wash out after 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.630
 first-second wash also want 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:39.300
 say that man himself ammonia 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:39.300
 more than any paint you're ready 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.540
 Katyusha, you're dazzling, it's just 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.190
 great thank you so much for that 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.949
 transformation but I have one more 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.840
 Question say how often you can 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.780
 recommend paint to those who are already and 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.419
 used purse means ours 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.430
 hair grows about one centimeter 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.949
 month we can safely 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.900
 our clients and our consultants 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.270
 recommend once a month 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.090
 our paint at least to either 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.370
 brush the color or brush the roots 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.370
 paint the roots you know for a reason 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.020
 psychologists say that if you 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.110
 want to change life 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.510
 start with hair color 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.389
 but we acquire a new color we acquire 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.380
 new image with this image we 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:36.610
 we fly positive emotions and 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.139
 with these emotions we can our paint 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.889
 with our paint we can 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.669
 offer more than color change 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.830
 hair 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.220
 but changing the whole image for example 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.760
 decorative cosmetics and not only we 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.930
 we come to the fact that our image is your image 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.830
 he is the sales element 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.750
 thanks for such detailed recommendations 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.180
 I am sure that the launch of this segment 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.979
 will bring additional sales to me 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.360
 and my structure and new people bug 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.900
 who now feel confident 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.900
 confidently recommend
