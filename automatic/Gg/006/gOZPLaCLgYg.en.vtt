00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hey people here is the thorsten and in 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.720
 this video is about it something like that 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.630
 My opinion is so my thoughts are 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.950
 if you buy another camera 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.009
 So if you look for example 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.650
 anschafften the other camera buddy 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.060
 other housing and again mine 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.710
 thoughts are when the worth 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:29.640
 It's worth a change and I think so 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.740
 that one of a level he 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.270
 So update at the other level 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.770
 that it's really worth it 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.460
 that means if you are now for example 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.440
 canon eos 700 and it comes then 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.420
 the 800 for example, I know 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 not exactly like the like the successor 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 Just say the 800d and you 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.190
 rising from the 700 to the 800 d to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.260
 that brings you less than you 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.090
 Are you still in the same area? 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.350
 so to speak the beginner area 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.879
 with these three numbers at know and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.309
 are not so many improvements that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.290
 which really bring a lot for you 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.260
 It's worth it, for example 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.729
 from a 700 de to the 70 g 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.369
 switch over 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.770
 that's a little different year again 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.509
 another segment so with the cameras 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.850
 another level, so to speak 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.070
 we can also do the iso, for example 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.750
 values ​​then a bit more accurate 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.360
 adjust and process the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.340
 Camera is better and many others 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.650
 things there you have already rather one already 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.450
 advantage of and then you will notice 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.280
 really the difference that brings 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.680
 then you really what and if you want to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.049
 Example 70 then has it too 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.280
 a little on the 80 g if that could 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.140
 whatever the successor means 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.290
 to switch but then he watch ok 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.360
 on a 6 d or five d mark 3 or the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.670
 Maybe 7d depending on 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.799
 then you have to look because that is 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.689
 another one in another 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.000
 areas other level so to speak, because 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.030
 Do you have the 6d at the 5d? 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.229
 mark three also in full-frame sensor 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 then the picture is less in the picture 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.200
 high iso ranges and so on 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.459
 which also brings them more again 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.080
 but it is also important that you just 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.430
 Let's see what's been photographed 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.770
 actually in the beginning you still know that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.150
 Not 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.970
 then takes a lot of pictures 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.710
 different things and that is 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.050
 of course you wonderfully photographed 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.240
 maybe landscapes and flowers and 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.540
 humans and all sorts of animals and such 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.600
 further and you will notice someday 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.250
 ok or I like it best 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.420
 for example, animal photography or the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.200
 people photography about the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.640
 landscape photography and you will notice too 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.170
 I really want a little bit more 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.270
 I do it often like that 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.910
 Pictures or you also notice I do that 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.920
 twice a month as compensation 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.360
 if I have time and want to have fun 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.730
 then maybe you need it too 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.880
 no other camera and if you notice 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.230
 you do it more often then just look at that 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.480
 you at the camera you then you 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.260
 buy also benefits for you so have 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.630
 if you like a lot for example 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.580
 wildlife photography or sports photography or 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.920
 so maybe it could do that too 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.840
 makes sense to buy his camera at the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.030
 the series speed of the pictures 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.740
 is higher than you have now 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.330
 because maybe he takes more pictures 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.050
 with that and then of course that's from 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.880
 advantage 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.070
 or if you, for example, often the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.310
 dark situations since with the camera 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.440
 where did the ambience really come from? 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.900
 want to start and must not flash 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.970
 We also want to be able to do it all the time 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.350
 of course, if you like for example 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.270
 full format sensor so have a camera 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.010
 with full format sensor and then there 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.050
 situation with the light 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.790
 could catch and that rush something 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.150
 less than for example with one 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.800
 700 de So these thoughts should one 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.320
 then definitely do it before 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.120
 buy and pay attention to what you do 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.820
 actually needs because there are many 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.790
 functions you do not need the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.280
 but then any additional costs or yes 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.640
 where then a change as well 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.230
 not worth it and important, of course 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.640
 that you also the basics of 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.250
 photography dominates my 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.870
 can photograph manual mode that 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.290
 you understand what's happening there 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.060
 knows what to do because only so until 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.680
 is then worth the change on her 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.600
 know these advantages by a 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.340
 new camera really appreciate 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.870
 and to use them too 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.609
 So there are many people who buy themselves 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.440
 a reflex camera and wonder 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.600
 then that the pictures somehow 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.930
 look the same as with a digicam 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.510
 his compact camera that is also quite 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.650
 normal if you are in automatic mode 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.180
 photographed because the camera is there 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.889
 or the SLR camera then does 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.040
 not much different as well 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.560
 compact camera the camera looking 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.030
 an 18 percent gray in the picture and then 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.220
 is that right for you? 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.260
 Exposure and so it's all so 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.050
 technical values but with the 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.539
 reality do not always have something to do 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.720
 and just in situations where you then 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.580
 such pictures like you have to 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.870
 to resort to the manual mode 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.550
 and adjust everything as you do 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.030
 would like to have and then you get too 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.289
 the pictures you would like and how 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.630
 I already in the other video times 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.979
 I have invested the money then 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.620
 rather still in good objective in 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:16.550
 powerful lenses so lenses with 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.570
 a wide-open aperture on the earth 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.400
 can adjust and that is the money 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.690
 better kept and have the objective 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.110
 then you really at the next 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.090
 camera 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.400
 if you also for full format 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.190
 if you are on full format 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.940
 So switch over to each case then 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.710
 rather invest an objective still 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.630
 So a lot of photographs are taken 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.550
 tried different directions 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.190
 and then you know which ones later 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.210
 camera he is suitable for you which 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.550
 really brings you benefits and if 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.500
 you then notice okay i or i want 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.970
 is slowed down by the camera 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.180
 to be able to implement what I like 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.639
 would like to implement then worthwhile 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.160
 Change in any case 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.770
 that is my opinion make you 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.599
 Just a few thoughts about it 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.650
 or even about it and write me 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.490
