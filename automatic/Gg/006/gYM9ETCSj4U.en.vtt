00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
already did that too but to do that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.060 
already did that too but to do that
let's<00:02:14.070> go<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.300> partition<00:02:15.300> SD<00:02:15.930> card<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.410> this

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
let's go to partition SD card and this

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.920 
let's go to partition SD card and this
deletes<00:02:17.400> everything<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.060> SD<00:02:18.209> card<00:02:18.630> tour

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
deletes everything on your SD card tour

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.690 
deletes everything on your SD card tour
so<00:02:19.620> make<00:02:19.830> sure<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.130> everything<00:02:20.370> backed

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
so make sure you have everything backed

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.910 
so make sure you have everything backed
up<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.290> everything<00:02:22.290> backed<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.650> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
up and everything backed up that you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.890 
up and everything backed up that you
want<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.190> your<00:02:23.220> phone<00:02:23.520> too<00:02:23.730> cuz<00:02:24.390> flashing<00:02:24.810> your

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
want on your phone too cuz flashing your

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.800 
want on your phone too cuz flashing your
arm<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.580> wipe<00:02:26.730> everything<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.780> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
arm you have to wipe everything for a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.910 
arm you have to wipe everything for a
torque<00:02:28.520> or<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:29.880> things<00:02:30.390> don't<00:02:30.660> go<00:02:30.870> wrong<00:02:31.080> so

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
torque or so things don't go wrong so

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.100 
torque or so things don't go wrong so
you<00:02:31.980> just<00:02:32.250> go<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:33.470> partition<00:02:34.470> SD<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.660> then

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
you just go to partition SD and then

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.550 
you just go to partition SD and then
this<00:02:37.770> down<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:40.200> would<00:02:40.320> go<00:02:40.530> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
this down here and then you would go to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.180 
this down here and then you would go to
confirm<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:42.590> there<00:02:43.590> would<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.010> then

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
confirm and then there would and then

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.910 
confirm and then there would and then
there<00:02:44.340> would<00:02:44.459> be<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:45.350> then<00:02:46.350> there'd<00:02:46.590> been<00:02:46.769> up

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
there would be a then there'd been up

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.699 
there would be a then there'd been up
two<00:02:47.160> numbers<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:48.150> wanna<00:02:48.420> use<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
two numbers you wanna use this to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
abort on this one and then so and then

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.460 
abort on this one and then so and then
you<00:03:05.370> would<00:03:05.489> just<00:03:05.670> continue<00:03:06.269> on<00:03:06.600> Perdition<00:03:07.260> SD

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.229 
you would just continue on Perdition SD
card<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:07.800> then<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.010> would<00:03:08.100> hit<00:03:08.220> return<00:03:08.550> which

back<00:03:09.480> here<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.989> then<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:12.800> flash<00:03:13.800> zip<00:03:14.100> from<00:03:14.310> sd

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
back here and then so flash zip from sd

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.960 
back here and then so flash zip from sd

once you've done my nandroid backup in

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.699 
once you've done my nandroid backup in
partitioned<00:03:18.540> your<00:03:18.690> SD<00:03:18.930> card<00:03:19.200> if<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.440> haven't

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
partitioned your SD card if you haven't

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.910 
partitioned your SD card if you haven't
already<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.220> then<00:03:20.790> you'd<00:03:20.940> go<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.470> flash<00:03:22.470> zip

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
already and then you'd go to flash zip

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.470 
already and then you'd go to flash zip
from<00:03:23.160> sd<00:03:23.459> card<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:24.420> then<00:03:24.690> do<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:26.310> zip<00:03:26.700> from<00:03:27.150> sd

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.130 
from sd card and then do to zip from sd
card

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.309 

and<00:03:31.140> then<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:33.540> would<00:03:33.660> want<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.080> then<00:03:34.200> you

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
and then you would want and then you

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.860 
and then you would want and then you
first<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.190> want<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.430> wipe<00:03:35.550> everything<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> you

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
would go to VR super white right there

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.600 
would go to VR super white right there
