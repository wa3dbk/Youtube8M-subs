00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
too dark for my complexion but I'm just

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.090 
too dark for my complexion but I'm just
going<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.790> put<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.120> here<00:03:12.080> or<00:03:12.590> whatever<00:03:12.770> they

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
going to put it here or whatever they

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.190 
going to put it here or whatever they
did<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.940> closure<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.569> looks<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.930> lot

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
did with this closure it looks a lot

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.680 
did with this closure it looks a lot
lighter<00:03:15.500> than<00:03:15.680> my<00:03:16.010> complexion<00:03:16.490> which<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.330> okay

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
lighter than my complexion which is okay

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.270 
lighter than my complexion which is okay
because<00:03:17.900> your<00:03:18.170> scalp<00:03:18.440> is<00:03:18.620> lighter<00:03:18.860> than<00:03:19.100> your

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
because your scalp is lighter than your

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.199 
because your scalp is lighter than your
face<00:03:19.489> anyway

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
face anyway

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.320 
face anyway
but<00:03:20.810> that's<00:03:21.680> why<00:03:21.920> I'm<00:03:22.069> using<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.520> darker<00:03:23.000> shade

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
but that's why I'm using a darker shade

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:41.050 
but that's why I'm using a darker shade
to<00:03:23.720> help<00:03:24.620> blend<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.550> pretty<00:03:40.730> much<00:03:40.880> how<00:03:41.030> I
