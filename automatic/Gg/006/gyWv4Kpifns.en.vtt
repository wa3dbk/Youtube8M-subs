00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
of Mohawk and the crown we're going to

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.310 
of Mohawk and the crown we're going to
go<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.030> little<00:00:56.239> bit<00:00:56.420> shorter<00:00:56.660> we're<00:00:57.110> going<00:00:57.199> to

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.930 
go a little bit shorter we're going to
be<00:00:57.379> cutting<00:00:57.589> in<00:00:57.890> basically<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:58.760> going<00:00:58.879> to

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
be cutting in basically it's going to

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.759 
be cutting in basically it's going to
look<00:00:59.089> like<00:00:59.119> a<00:00:59.269> triangle<00:00:59.570> as<00:00:59.960> I'm<00:01:00.140> cutting<00:01:00.379> all

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
look like a triangle as I'm cutting all

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:01.840 
look like a triangle as I'm cutting all
right<00:01:00.890> I'm<00:01:01.040> going<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.250> be<00:01:01.309> cutting<00:01:01.519> in<00:01:01.729> this

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
right I'm going to be cutting in this

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.030 
right I'm going to be cutting in this
direction<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:02.570> in<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.440> center<00:01:03.769> here<00:01:03.799> it

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
direction so in the center here it

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.950 
direction so in the center here it
starts<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.369> become<00:01:04.489> shorter<00:01:05.030> okay<00:01:05.390> into<00:01:05.780> in

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
starts to become shorter okay into in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.899 
starts to become shorter okay into in
what<00:01:06.320> happens<00:01:06.680> is<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.979> top<00:01:07.190> becomes<00:01:07.580> more<00:01:07.820> of

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
what happens is the top becomes more of

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.730 
what happens is the top becomes more of
a<00:01:07.970> triangle<00:01:08.240> as<00:01:08.450> well<00:01:08.659> we<00:01:09.170> don't<00:01:09.320> want<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.619> go

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
a triangle as well we don't want to go

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.170 
a triangle as well we don't want to go
too<00:01:09.799> wide<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:10.220> we're<00:01:10.640> only<00:01:10.760> going<00:01:10.939> to<00:01:11.030> go<00:01:11.119> to

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
too wide so we're only going to go to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.390 
too wide so we're only going to go to
around<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.630> recession<00:01:12.140> point<00:01:12.380> okay<00:01:12.770> hey<00:01:13.100> just

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
around the recession point okay hey just

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.160 
around the recession point okay hey just
in<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:13.670> recession<00:01:14.000> areas<00:01:14.479> we're<00:01:14.900> gonna<00:01:15.020> keep

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
in the recession areas we're gonna keep

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.870 
in the recession areas we're gonna keep
as<00:01:15.350> much<00:01:15.500> length<00:01:15.770> as<00:01:16.010> we<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.340> at<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.580> front

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
as much length as we can at the front

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.429 
as much length as we can at the front
and<00:01:17.210> we're<00:01:17.570> going<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:17.720> keep<00:01:17.869> as<00:01:18.049> much<00:01:18.200> length

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
and we're going to keep as much length

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.289 
and we're going to keep as much length
as<00:01:18.619> we<00:01:18.740> can<00:01:18.950> out<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.220> back<00:01:19.430> alright<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.210> the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
as we can out the back alright so the

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.390 
as we can out the back alright so the
same<00:01:20.510> at<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.689> bottom<00:01:21.110> through<00:01:21.320> here<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:21.979> this

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
same at the bottom through here so this

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.670 
same at the bottom through here so this
will<00:01:22.640> essentially<00:01:23.090> be<00:01:23.240> longer<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.080> we'll<00:01:24.590> be

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
will essentially be longer and we'll be

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.649 
will essentially be longer and we'll be
able<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.890> droop<00:01:25.580> over<00:01:25.850> top<00:01:26.060> if<00:01:26.270> we<00:01:26.360> decide<00:01:26.600> to

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
able to droop over top if we decide to

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.330 
able to droop over top if we decide to
do<00:01:26.840> something<00:01:26.869> funky<00:01:27.530> like<00:01:27.680> blow<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.070> off<00:01:28.189> to

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
do something funky like blow it off to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.690 
do something funky like blow it off to
the<00:01:28.369> side<00:01:28.570> but<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.600> think<00:01:29.960> at<00:01:30.080> this<00:01:30.200> point<00:01:30.700> this

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the side but I think at this point this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.250 
the side but I think at this point this
is<00:01:31.820> what<00:01:31.910> we're<00:01:32.000> going<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.180> do<00:01:32.240> yeah<00:01:32.600> okay<00:01:33.110> I'm

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
is what we're going to do yeah okay I'm

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.290 
is what we're going to do yeah okay I'm
excited

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
excited

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.820 
excited
now<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:35.900> go<00:01:36.080> through<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.380> we<00:01:36.440> find<00:01:36.680> our

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
now we go through and we find our

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.850 
now we go through and we find our
recession<00:01:37.190> point<00:01:37.610> all<00:01:37.940> right<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:39.350> bottom<00:01:39.740> of

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
recession point all right the bottom of

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.160 
recession point all right the bottom of
the<00:01:39.950> recession<00:01:40.280> point<00:01:40.700> right<00:01:40.880> here<00:01:40.910> okay<00:01:41.900> and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
the recession point right here okay and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.470 
the recession point right here okay and
through<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:43.160> side<00:01:43.430> now<00:01:43.970> I've<00:01:44.150> got<00:01:44.330> my

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
through the side now I've got my

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.420 
through the side now I've got my
triangle<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.170> I'm<00:01:45.290> looking<00:01:45.440> for<00:01:45.620> my<00:01:45.980> square

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
triangle that I'm looking for my square

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.700 
triangle that I'm looking for my square
I<00:01:46.460> guess<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.790> could<00:01:46.820> say<00:01:47.180> I'm<00:01:47.390> taking<00:01:48.350> my<00:01:48.440> next

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
I guess you could say I'm taking my next

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.740 
I guess you could say I'm taking my next
section<00:01:49.010> on<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.280> angle<00:01:49.640> right<00:01:49.760> here<00:01:49.820> very

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
section on this angle right here very

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.340 
section on this angle right here very
neatly<00:01:51.080> I<00:01:52.690> normally<00:01:53.690> when<00:01:53.870> I<00:01:53.900> cut<00:01:54.110> through

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
neatly I normally when I cut through

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.170 
neatly I normally when I cut through

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
kind of zip through but for the camera I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.160 
kind of zip through but for the camera I
want<00:01:58.010> everyone<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.490> see<00:01:58.700> sorry<00:01:59.120> we<00:01:59.450> see<00:01:59.990> what

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
it is that we're doing precisely right

up<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.390> around<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.750> point<00:02:03.020> on<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.290> top<00:02:03.470> of<00:02:03.620> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
up to around the point on the top of the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.150 
up to around the point on the top of the
head<00:02:03.860> at<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.610> point<00:02:04.940> I<00:02:05.710> want<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.740> keep<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
head at this point I want to keep the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.910 
head at this point I want to keep the
edge<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.480> hair<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.050> want<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.649> keep<00:02:09.770> it

edge of the hair I want to keep it

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.100 
edge of the hair I want to keep it
longer<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.240> get<00:02:11.360> kind<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.750> wispy

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
longer so that we get kind of a wispy

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.200 
longer so that we get kind of a wispy
very<00:02:12.350> feminine<00:02:12.890> look<00:02:13.100> still<00:02:13.790> trying<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> keep

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
this cut feminine right so at this point

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.550 
this cut feminine right so at this point
we're<00:02:16.490> going<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.670> reach<00:02:16.880> in<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.560> start

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
we're going to reach in and start

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.850 
we're going to reach in and start
cutting<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.790> as<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.090> go<00:02:20.350> you'll<00:02:21.350> be<00:02:21.470> able<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.620> see

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
cutting so as I go you'll be able to see

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.230 
cutting so as I go you'll be able to see
what<00:02:22.040> we're<00:02:22.190> doing<00:02:22.280> put<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.000> through<00:02:23.030> your

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
what we're doing put it through your

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.110 
what we're doing put it through your
fingers<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:24.140> rest<00:02:24.800> your<00:02:24.890> hand<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.310> my<00:02:25.790> head<00:02:26.090> or

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
fingers you rest your hand on my head or

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.390 
fingers you rest your hand on my head or
yeah<00:02:26.900> I'm<00:02:27.170> pulling<00:02:27.620> straight<00:02:27.950> out<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:28.310> I'm

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
yeah I'm pulling straight out so I'm

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.270 
yeah I'm pulling straight out so I'm
doing<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.700> 90<00:02:29.090> degree<00:02:29.500> from<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.680> point<00:02:30.890> I'm

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
doing a 90 degree from that point I'm

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.550 
doing a 90 degree from that point I'm
coming<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.670> quite<00:02:31.850> short<00:02:32.180> okay<00:02:33.170> because<00:02:33.410> we

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
coming in quite short okay because we

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.930 
coming in quite short okay because we
want<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.860> see<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> real<00:02:34.280> difference<00:02:34.520> in<00:02:34.790> that

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
want to see a real difference in that

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.750 
want to see a real difference in that
but<00:02:35.450> I've<00:02:35.540> left<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.290> perimeter<00:02:36.860> lung<00:02:37.370> right

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
but I've left the perimeter lung right

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.790 
but I've left the perimeter lung right
so<00:02:38.300> we're<00:02:38.450> still<00:02:38.630> keeping<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:39.050> close<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.650> go

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
so we're still keeping it close and go

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.229 
so we're still keeping it close and go
short<00:02:40.100> as<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.280> want<00:02:40.310> but<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.700> still<00:02:40.940> want<00:02:41.180> it

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
short as you want but I still want it

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.760 
short as you want but I still want it
long<00:02:41.390> enough<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.660> she<00:02:41.900> can<00:02:42.020> create<00:02:42.350> any<00:02:42.590> kind

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
long enough that she can create any kind

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.620 
long enough that she can create any kind
of<00:02:42.860> movement<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:43.970> I'm<00:02:44.060> gonna<00:02:44.180> go<00:02:44.390> ahead<00:02:44.420> and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
of movement so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.080 
of movement so I'm gonna go ahead and
just<00:02:44.840> bring<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.140> out<00:02:45.260> just<00:02:45.770> enough<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.670> she

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
just bring it out just enough that she

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.150 
just bring it out just enough that she
can<00:02:47.270> create<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.810> we<00:02:48.500> still<00:02:48.739> get<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.010> look

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
can create that we still get the look

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.090 
can create that we still get the look
we're<00:02:49.340> looking<00:02:49.580> for<00:02:50.290> one<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> key<00:02:51.770> points

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
we're looking for one of the key points

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.370 
we're looking for one of the key points
in<00:02:52.400> cutting<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:52.910> cut<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.480> also<00:02:54.200> your

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
in cutting this cut is also your

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.990 
in cutting this cut is also your
thinning<00:02:54.650> shears<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.160> lot<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.730> people<00:02:55.970> just

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
thinning shears a lot of people just

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.490 
thinning shears a lot of people just
grab<00:02:56.360> thin<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.750> cures<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.110> just<00:02:57.260> go<00:02:57.350> in

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
grab thin and cures and just go in

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.229 
grab thin and cures and just go in
however<00:02:58.040> they<00:02:58.160> want<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.610> think<00:02:58.940> thinning

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
however they want I think thinning

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.850 
however they want I think thinning
shears<00:02:59.450> are<00:02:59.510> important<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.080> understand<00:03:00.560> that

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
shears are important to understand that

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.380 
shears are important to understand that
when<00:03:01.459> you're<00:03:01.640> going<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.150> you're<00:03:02.239> taking

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
when you're going in and you're taking

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.500 
when you're going in and you're taking
weight<00:03:02.780> out<00:03:03.640> it's<00:03:04.640> not<00:03:04.790> was<00:03:05.000> just<00:03:05.180> one<00:03:05.330> little

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
weight out it's not was just one little

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.180 
weight out it's not was just one little
chop<00:03:05.840> at<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.080> time<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.650> go<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.100> you're

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
chop at a time you go in and you're

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.850 
chop at a time you go in and you're
taking<00:03:07.370> I'm<00:03:07.700> going<00:03:08.030> base<00:03:08.630> mid<00:03:09.140> shaft<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.590> ends

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
taking I'm going base mid shaft and ends

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.430 
taking I'm going base mid shaft and ends
base<00:03:10.430> mid<00:03:10.850> shaft<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.270> ends<00:03:11.420> when<00:03:12.200> I'm<00:03:12.230> doing

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
base mid shaft and ends when I'm doing

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.199 
base mid shaft and ends when I'm doing
that<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.830> I'm<00:03:12.950> taking<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.400> weight<00:03:13.580> out<00:03:13.610> so

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
that is I'm taking the weight out so

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.940 
that is I'm taking the weight out so
that<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.660> get<00:03:14.780> close<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.410> head<00:03:15.590> right

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
that we can get close to the head right

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.310 
that we can get close to the head right
and<00:03:16.160> I'm<00:03:16.370> still<00:03:16.640> taking<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.540> mid-shaft

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
and I'm still taking it the mid-shaft

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.960 
and I'm still taking it the mid-shaft
and<00:03:18.530> ends<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.310> they<00:03:19.520> don't<00:03:19.640> sit<00:03:19.940> like

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
and ends so that they don't sit like

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.550 
and ends so that they don't sit like
this<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.510> top<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.720> each<00:03:20.959> other<00:03:21.080> they<00:03:21.290> actually

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
this on top of each other they actually

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.160 
this on top of each other they actually
split<00:03:21.890> oh<00:03:22.100> so<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:22.970> blends<00:03:23.239> so<00:03:23.750> when<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.959> push

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
split oh so it blends so when I push

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.510 
split oh so it blends so when I push
down<00:03:24.350> I'm<00:03:24.500> not<00:03:24.650> getting<00:03:24.890> those<00:03:24.980> hard<00:03:25.280> lines
