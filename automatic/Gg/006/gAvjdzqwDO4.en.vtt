00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
now this look generally isn't going to

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.460 
now this look generally isn't going to
have<00:01:03.400> any<00:01:03.580> line<00:01:03.760> on<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:04.089> top<00:01:04.330> but<00:01:04.839> i'm<00:01:05.049> just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
have any line on the top but i'm just

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.450 
have any line on the top but i'm just
going<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:05.740> do<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.009> tiny<00:01:06.640> bit<00:01:07.030> they're<00:01:08.460> really

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
going to do a tiny bit they're really

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.249 
going to do a tiny bit they're really
really<00:01:09.579> fine<00:01:09.970> just<00:01:10.299> to<00:01:10.479> sort<00:01:10.659> of<00:01:10.780> thicken<00:01:11.170> the

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
really fine just to sort of thicken the

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.649 
really fine just to sort of thicken the
lash<00:01:11.439> line<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:12.009> don't<00:01:12.549> really<00:01:12.820> want<00:01:13.150> it<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.270> show

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.510 

so<00:01:19.289> I'm<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.499> to<00:01:19.530> smudge<00:01:19.829> that<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.249> in<00:01:20.399> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
so I'm going to smudge that in in a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.529 
so I'm going to smudge that in in a
second<00:01:21.229> okay<00:01:23.960> okay<00:01:24.960> particularly<00:01:26.359> that<00:01:27.359> one

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
second okay okay particularly that one

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.300 
second okay okay particularly that one
on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> top<00:01:27.899> I<00:01:28.109> really<00:01:28.409> want<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.679> smudge<00:01:29.069> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
on the top I really want to smudge that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940 
on the top I really want to smudge that
in<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> barely<00:01:30.119> shows<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.709> look

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
in so it barely shows because this look

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
in so it barely shows because this look
is<00:01:32.100> about<00:01:32.369> having<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> smoky<00:01:33.270> look<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
is about having a smoky look on the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.679 
is about having a smoky look on the
bottom<00:01:37.219> rather<00:01:38.219> than<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> top<00:01:38.849> can<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.539> see

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
bottom rather than the top can you see

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.630 
bottom rather than the top can you see
that<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.530> mainly<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.069> the<00:01:41.159> bottom<00:01:41.459> of<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
that it was mainly on the bottom of the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.749 
that it was mainly on the bottom of the
lectures<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:43.259> top<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.159> eyelids<00:01:44.579> are

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
lectures and the top the eyelids are

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:56.540 
lectures and the top the eyelids are
really<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.539> be<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> natural<00:01:46.109> look<00:01:46.619> so

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.580 

alright<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.620> much<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.190> sort<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.760> a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
alright this is very much a sort of a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.110 
alright this is very much a sort of a
neutral<00:02:01.590> color<00:02:01.800> it's<00:02:02.160> got<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.730> bit<00:02:02.970> of

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
neutral color it's got a little bit of

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.880 
neutral color it's got a little bit of
Sheen<00:02:03.480> in<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.050> just<00:02:04.290> pressing<00:02:04.560> that
