are<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.179> distant<00:02:09.570> most<00:02:09.780> people<00:02:10.049> don't

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
are so distant most people don't

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.860 
are so distant most people don't
understand<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.799> but<00:02:11.400> we'll<00:02:11.760> take<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> an<00:02:12.450> adult

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
understand it but we'll take a an adult

space<00:02:13.500> used<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.920> out<00:02:14.069> there<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.670> think

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
space used to get out there and I think

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.650 
space used to get out there and I think
that<00:02:15.660> gives<00:02:15.870> me<00:02:16.020> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
that gives me a

pretty smart because we have to grow up

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.260 
pretty smart because we have to grow up

I saw in this show a chance to say

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.080 
I saw in this show a chance to say
things<00:02:46.689> I<00:02:46.870> wanted<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.230> say<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:48.090> propagandize

my own ideas and and that's good writers

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.360 
my own ideas and and that's good writers
should<00:02:53.049> do<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.319> all<00:02:53.620> artists<00:02:54.129> should<00:02:54.280> do

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
should do that all artists should do

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
think the 25th space shuttle mission and

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.449 
think the 25th space shuttle mission and
it<00:03:01.750> has<00:03:01.780> cleared<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.379> tower

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.399 

it's<00:03:09.459> endemic<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:10.329> taking<00:03:10.959> on<00:03:11.139> any

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
it's endemic to taking on any

it's endemic to taking on any
complicated<00:03:12.189> new<00:03:12.909> task<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:13.719> challenge<00:03:14.379> the

complicated new task and challenge the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.780 
complicated new task and challenge the
same<00:03:15.609> sort<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.239> thing<00:03:16.450> happened<00:03:16.930> as<00:03:17.829> airplanes

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
same sort of thing happened as airplanes

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.509 
same sort of thing happened as airplanes
were<00:03:19.090> perfected<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.379> same<00:03:20.620> tragedies<00:03:21.280> and

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
were perfected in the same tragedies and

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.780 
were perfected in the same tragedies and
so<00:03:21.669> on<00:03:22.439> remember<00:03:23.439> the<00:03:23.590> British<00:03:23.950> comet<00:03:24.579> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
so on remember the British comet the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.849 
so on remember the British comet the
first<00:03:25.000> British<00:03:25.780> jet<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.409> two<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.680> them

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
first British jet the two of them

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.860 
first British jet the two of them
exploded<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:27.549> air<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.239> people<00:03:28.510> just<00:03:28.599> about

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
exploded in air and people just about

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.949 
exploded in air and people just about
gave<00:03:29.409> up<00:03:29.590> with<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.889> idea<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.459> Jets<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:31.629> of

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
gave up with the idea of Jets because of

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.339 
gave up with the idea of Jets because of
that<00:03:32.109> but<00:03:32.889> we<00:03:33.069> came<00:03:33.250> back<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.730> did<00:03:33.879> it<00:03:34.349> and

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
that but we came back and did it and

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.589 
that but we came back and did it and
we'll<00:03:35.530> come<00:03:35.709> back<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.010> do<00:03:36.099> this<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.349> not

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
we'll come back and do this it is not

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.059 
we'll come back and do this it is not
absolutely<00:03:40.599> necessary<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:42.489> get<00:03:43.239> this

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
absolutely necessary that we get this

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.490 
absolutely necessary that we get this
system<00:03:45.069> be<00:03:45.239> completely<00:03:46.239> successful<00:03:46.449> I<00:03:46.959> hope

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
system be completely successful I hope

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.909 
system be completely successful I hope
it<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.829> but<00:03:48.549> if<00:03:48.699> it<00:03:48.819> isn't<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.900> reasons<00:03:50.829> for

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
it is but if it isn't the reasons for

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.039 
it is but if it isn't the reasons for
space<00:03:51.459> travelers<00:03:51.940> still<00:03:52.299> there<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.870> so

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
space travelers still there and so

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.830 
space travelers still there and so
strong<00:03:53.379> that<00:03:53.859> in<00:03:54.729> one<00:03:55.060> way<00:03:55.299> right<00:03:55.569> now<00:03:55.659> they're

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
strong that in one way right now they're

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.199 
strong that in one way right now they're
later<00:03:56.049> on<00:03:56.290> we<00:03:56.829> will<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.989> but<00:03:58.989> it's<00:03:59.229> the

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
later on we will do it but it's the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.890 
later on we will do it but it's the
unfortunately<00:04:02.699> if<00:04:03.699> we<00:04:03.909> have<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.389> unfortunate

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
unfortunately if we have the unfortunate

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.039 
unfortunately if we have the unfortunate
accident<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.409> crashing<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.069> next<00:04:06.400> one<00:04:07.049> they

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
accident of crashing the next one they

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.689 
accident of crashing the next one they
didn't<00:04:08.319> put<00:04:08.470> it<00:04:08.560> back<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:08.739> bit<00:04:08.889> longer<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.549> hope

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
didn't put it back a bit longer I hope

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.080 
didn't put it back a bit longer I hope
we<00:04:09.819> don't<00:04:10.229> but<00:04:11.229> I<00:04:11.620> do<00:04:12.129> know<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.790> we<00:04:12.909> will

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
we don't but I do know it we will

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.469 
we don't but I do know it we will
eventually<00:04:13.329> go<00:04:13.629> out<00:04:13.689> there<00:04:13.930> my<00:04:14.769> feeling<00:04:15.479> and

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
eventually go out there my feeling and

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.149 
eventually go out there my feeling and
I've<00:04:16.900> been<00:04:17.109> close<00:04:17.289> to<00:04:17.349> the<00:04:17.590> space<00:04:17.799> program

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
I've been close to the space program

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:22.890 
I've been close to the space program
I've<00:04:19.049> I've<00:04:20.280> spoken<00:04:21.280> at<00:04:21.579> Canaveral<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:22.539> so<00:04:22.720> on
