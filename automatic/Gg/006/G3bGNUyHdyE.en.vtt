00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
going to try to take in mangoes we'll

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.039 
going to try to take in mangoes we'll
just<00:01:02.760> look<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.180> them<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.420> soon<00:01:03.719> they're<00:01:03.899> not

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
just look at them and soon they're not

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.380 
just look at them and soon they're not
ripe<00:01:04.320> yet<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> enjoy

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
ripe yet so that's that's what I enjoy

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.780 
ripe yet so that's that's what I enjoy
about<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.439> why<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> recommend<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
about them and why I recommend them is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.140 
about them and why I recommend them is
that<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.780> don't<00:01:10.140> betray<00:01:10.350> ripeness

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
that they don't betray ripeness

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.130 
that they don't betray ripeness
therefore<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.450> attract<00:01:12.930> themselves

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
therefore they do not attract themselves

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
therefore they do not attract themselves
to<00:01:13.619> miscreants<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.729> want<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.030> ahead<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to miscreants that want to go ahead and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.609 
to miscreants that want to go ahead and
take<00:01:15.390> their<00:01:15.570> mango<00:01:15.930> stock<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.530> the

take their mango stock from the
especially<00:01:17.159> only<00:01:17.340> got<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> few<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.060> year

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
especially only got a few in one year

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.990 
especially only got a few in one year
one<00:01:19.710> way<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.670> common

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
one way I don't know if this is common

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
one way I don't know if this is common
knowledge<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.420> I'll<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.960> anyway<00:01:22.229> one

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
knowledge that I'll do this anyway one

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.749 
knowledge that I'll do this anyway one
way<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.680> test<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> mango<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.640> it's

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
way to test the mango to see if it's

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.149 
way to test the mango to see if it's
right<00:01:24.000> take<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.470> send<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
right take it and you send it up a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
right take it and you send it up a
little<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> gives<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.840> get

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
little bit and if it gives when you get

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.160 
little bit and if it gives when you get
to<00:01:28.170> about<00:01:28.200> three<00:01:28.680> o'clock<00:01:29.240> if<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> had

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
to about three o'clock if it if it had

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.810 
to about three o'clock if it if it had
snapped<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.799> point<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.340> ripe<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
snapped at this point then it's ripe and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.010 
snapped at this point then it's ripe and
I<00:01:32.880> don't<00:01:32.939> want<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.390> too<00:01:33.540> fast<00:01:33.810> because

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
I don't want to do that too fast because

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
I don't want to do that too fast because
I<00:01:34.140> don't<00:01:34.259> want<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> stress<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.009> peduncle

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
I don't want to stress out that peduncle

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.330 
I don't want to stress out that peduncle
but<00:01:36.210> anyway<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.380> our<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.100> way<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but anyway that's so our little way of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.710 
but anyway that's so our little way of
knowing<00:01:38.759> whether<00:01:38.909> they're<00:01:39.180> ripe<00:01:39.360> too<00:01:39.509> thick

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
knowing whether they're ripe too thick

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.539 
knowing whether they're ripe too thick
and<00:01:39.900> then<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.320> probably<00:01:40.619> want<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> let<00:01:41.430> them

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and then you probably want to let them

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.889 
and then you probably want to let them
