root the root on camera here looks black
but<00:02:00.229> actually<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:02.130> say<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:03.090> root

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
but actually I would say that the root

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.710 
but actually I would say that the root
is<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.929> color<00:02:04.140> number<00:02:04.560> six<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.569> it<00:02:06.569> is<00:02:06.860> rooted

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
is the color number six and it is rooted

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.370 
is the color number six and it is rooted
throughout<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:11.280> not<00:02:11.430> eat<00:02:11.640> safe<00:02:12.170> pretty<00:02:13.170> much

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
throughout it's not eat safe pretty much

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.120 
throughout it's not eat safe pretty much
this<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:14.040> texture<00:02:15.470> that's<00:02:16.470> built<00:02:16.890> into

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
this is the texture that's built into

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.699 
this is the texture that's built into
the<00:02:17.579> synthetic<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.810> know<00:02:21.959> gently

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
the synthetic you can you know gently

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.530 
the synthetic you can you know gently
style<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.760> meant<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.360> like

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
style it but it's it's meant to be like

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.280

this<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.920> there's<00:02:29.310> no<00:02:29.459> lace<00:02:30.049> there's<00:02:31.049> no

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
this it's there's no lace there's no

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.860 
this it's there's no lace there's no
skin<00:02:32.870> there's<00:02:33.870> no<00:02:34.079> mono<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:36.269> just<00:02:36.510> pretty

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
skin there's no mono it's just pretty

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.990 
skin there's no mono it's just pretty
much<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.440> regular<00:02:37.739> simple<00:02:38.579> cap<00:02:38.790> wig<00:02:40.609> this<00:02:41.609> one<00:02:41.970> I

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
much a regular simple cap wig this one I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000 
much a regular simple cap wig this one I
think<00:02:42.560> gets<00:02:43.560> away<00:02:43.859> with<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.609> lot<00:02:45.359> because<00:02:46.290> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
think gets away with a lot because it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.150 
think gets away with a lot because it
start<00:02:47.670> routing<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:49.200> there's<00:02:49.769> no<00:02:50.150> part<00:02:51.150> but

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
start routing so there's no part but

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.460 
start routing so there's no part but
there's<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.250> dark<00:02:53.519> rooted<00:02:54.239> part<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.840> that's<00:02:55.049> an

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
there's a dark rooted part so that's an

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.830 
there's a dark rooted part so that's an
illusion<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:56.220> part<00:02:56.489> but<00:02:57.299> my<00:02:57.600> dog<00:02:57.810> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
illusion of this part but my dog is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.160 
illusion of this part but my dog is
sneezing

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.940 

it<00:03:05.860> does<00:03:06.130> have<00:03:06.370> permit<00:03:06.790> ease<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:08.290> was<00:03:08.350> parted

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
it does have permit ease it was parted

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.450 
it does have permit ease it was parted
like<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.340> when<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:09.580> got<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.770> just<00:03:12.130> kept

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:43.300 
there's no combs there's adjustable
straps<00:03:33.750> without<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.800> hooks

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.080 

because<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.519> routing<00:03:44.909> is<00:03:45.090> everywhere<00:03:47.090> you

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
because the routing is everywhere you

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:59.550 
because the routing is everywhere you
could<00:03:48.239> probably<00:03:48.540> add<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.189> bang

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.960 

so<00:04:00.160> then<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.520> would<00:04:00.610> be<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:04.510> know<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:05.760> wig<00:04:06.760> with

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
so then it would be you know a wig with

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.530 
so then it would be you know a wig with
a<00:04:07.000> bang<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.850> from<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.300> top<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.020> head<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:12.540> 24

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
a bang so from the top of the head is 24

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.000 
a bang so from the top of the head is 24
inches<00:04:17.280> from<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.549> back<00:04:18.790> of<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.269> nape<00:04:19.510> it's<00:04:20.470> 18

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
inches from the back of the nape it's 18

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:28.130 
inches from the back of the nape it's 18
and<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:24.220> thickness<00:04:25.110> I'll<00:04:26.110> say<00:04:26.920> it's<00:04:27.250> between

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
and the thickness I'll say it's between

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.100 
and the thickness I'll say it's between
120<00:04:29.140> to<00:04:29.670> maybe<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.760> little<00:04:31.000> bit<00:04:31.180> more<00:04:31.420> it's

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
120 to maybe a little bit more it's

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.950 
120 to maybe a little bit more it's
quite<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> bit<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.650> hair<00:04:37.050> it's<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.260> back<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:39.960> I

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
quite a bit of hair it's the back and I

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.880 
quite a bit of hair it's the back and I
know<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.830> does<00:04:42.040> look<00:04:42.250> bright<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:43.890> but

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
know that it does look bright and but

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.980 
know that it does look bright and but
it's<00:04:45.010> not<00:04:45.190> shiny<00:04:45.640> if<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.480> makes<00:04:46.690> any<00:04:46.840> sense

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
it's not shiny if that makes any sense

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.510 
it's not shiny if that makes any sense
it's<00:04:47.919> it's<00:04:48.430> bright<00:04:48.940> because<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:51.040> is<00:04:51.250> very

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
it's it's bright because it is very

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.860 
it's it's bright because it is very
light<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:53.320> is<00:04:53.760> semi<00:04:54.760> straight<00:04:55.240> does<00:04:55.660> have

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
light and it is semi straight does have

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.750 
light and it is semi straight does have
a<00:04:56.010> tiny<00:04:57.010> bit<00:04:57.310> of<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.580> body<00:04:57.820> wave<00:04:59.130> it's<00:05:00.130> not<00:05:00.340> shiny

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
a tiny bit of a body wave it's not shiny

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.970 
a tiny bit of a body wave it's not shiny
it's<00:05:01.090> bright<00:05:01.480> it's<00:05:02.050> bright<00:05:02.380> because<00:05:02.770> of<00:05:02.890> the

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
it's bright it's bright because of the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.130 
it's bright it's bright because of the
color<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.610> hair<00:05:03.760> texture<00:05:06.870> reminds<00:05:07.870> me<00:05:08.110> a

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
color and the hair texture reminds me a

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.940 
color and the hair texture reminds me a
little<00:05:08.380> bit<00:05:08.560> of<00:05:08.770> Taylor<00:05:09.580> Momsen<00:05:10.800> maybe<00:05:11.800> the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
little bit of Taylor Momsen maybe the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.719
