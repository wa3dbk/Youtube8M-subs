00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 statement bower ads fallout 4 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.269
 was expected sure we are still 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.460
 expect to take a breath when we hear about 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.109
 appearance of elder scrolls 6 series fallout 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.910
 for many older players 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.500
 is the whole cult this first 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.300
 decent open world rpg 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.310
 opportunity is really all that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.260
 you want but pretty serious 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 game with the advent of flow three transitions in 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.099
 group arbors of this series, the game got 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.320
 its share of novelty and mrs all the more 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.030
 easy storytelling and atmosphere those who 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.710
 played the first and second parts follow 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.870
 notice the difference at least in the world 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.520
 fellout arms gazebos became more humorous 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.410
 and light though not by any means 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.480
 belittling ability and vice versa even 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.829
 thanked for the revival of this legend and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
 for what they keep doing 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.579
 the next part the old players need 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.770
 just come to terms with what we play 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.420
 new game old setting she can 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.430
 immediately enjoy this 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 the game will be the same masterpiece but let's 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.190
 go into more detail about what 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.190
 known at the moment 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.920
 the plot of the game will begin shortly before 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.810
 disasters where we can choose our 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.910
 character and you can choose as 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.680
 male and female character and 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.600
 this time they decided to surprise us again 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.220
 good faiz our hero's generator 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.110
 you can literally follow your 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.060
 likeness or make it scary 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.950
 freak while giving perk handsome 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.810
 funny get pun when sold 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.490
 nuclear alert our hero along with others 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.960
 Boston residents will run a supervisor 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.640
 however what exactly will become of his 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.110
 family they die or survive and 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.120
 will play a role in the future while 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.800
 unknown however find out that hd 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.780
 the gameplay of this situation let's say no 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.460
 changeable in front of us all too point that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.460
 the same ability to respond all the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.210
 however the combat system happened 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.740
 certain changes for example now 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.210
 when using your time will not 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.900
 stop completely and pour 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.150
 slow down 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.520
 let's say it will add a hardcore game 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.050
 however, it looks very good hero 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.610
 will allow to modify any waiting time 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.350
 beyond recognition stick on him 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.510
 all kinds of bells and whistles 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.580
 real armor-piercing car of death from 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.440
 pistol incidentally on the bill 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.180
 modifications of the hard fire system from karima 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.160
 brought to mind from now on we can not just 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.510
 I will build a house with furniture or build 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.519
 the house is therefore like seen 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.410
 developers and literally assemble themselves 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.970
 how you see your own house 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.980
 its exactly you moreover you can 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.050
 build a whole city with its inhabitants 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.610
 and defense systems that believe me 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.620
 you will need after all on your town 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.790
 robbers will stroll 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.790
 bit by bit in search of prey 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.340
 also we will get a new companion with 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.319
 which can go through the whole game and 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.540
 this one will be the most responsive shepherd with 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.040
 whom you either get along with or not at all 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.870
 its use is rather doubtful 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.430
 most likely she will just be killed in one of 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.140
 rework and kind of regret it not 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.830
 you will because it has always been to you 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.489
 just a burden 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.379
 although these are only important speculations 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.610
 changes have undergone a dialogue system well 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.140
 Firstly it's nice to see that our 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.940
 character has full voice acting and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.560
 secondly added to the game wheel response 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.329
 in which we saw in the living dead 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.430
 and the mass effect we hope it does not affect 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.700
 on rpd element and even benefit 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.129
 In this series, in general, we can say 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.569
 that he received so low 320 a little more 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.250
 beautiful with lots of 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.079
 opportunities with frills that are already 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.970
 were worked out in addition to skyrim 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.040
 their principle is just new interesting 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.109
 adventures in the wasteland is already quite 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.849
 Soon the game will get us in the fall so 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:19.069
 let's wait for the release and get down to war 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.069
 a war that never changes
