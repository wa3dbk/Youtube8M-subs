00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.299
 Welcome once again to all my 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.889
 channel I'm sea ​​cox I'm here again 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.800
 with all of you to bring you and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.179
 present this new video today Sunday 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.860
 As you are already seeing, we have an 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.529
 little bit of great tourism again 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.750
 after these two days climbing the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.000
 first chapters of final destination cap 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.210
 which I hope you are liking 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.559
 and I'm adjusted there are still several 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.869
 Well, as I say, you see Granderurismo 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.540
 We are here with this fantastic machine 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.780
 with this lexus and sf rising concept from 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.750
 year 2008 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.449
 for my taste of the best that there is in 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.750
 the game seems to me a wonder at level 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.129
 driving as aesthetically 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.530
 tremendously aggressive you can already 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.079
 watch 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.719
 Most of you imagine that you like 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:57.280
 cars you know the lexus notice the 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:01.510
 sporty version of this sedan is the the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.720
 lexus and that's worth then this is a 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.320
 derived from that version f is a derivative 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.360
 extreme as you can see is this racing 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.710
 concept is valid and I can tell you about it 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.159
 because it started to be sold on 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.170
 end of 2007 in Japan approximately 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.299
 and then later in the room of the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.470
 Tokyo Motor Show earlier this year 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.140
 2008 because this car was presented clearly 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.080
 obviously a car like this one 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.649
 because it attracts a lot of attention to 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 which is tremendously aggressive 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.429
 especially good as you can see 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.500
 this super spoiler that has butts 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.000
 two carbon fins one on each side the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.130
 large air intake that has in part 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.440
 front of the vehicle the rear diffuser 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.539
 which is tremendously brutal too and 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.940
 Well, you see the pieces 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.180
 racing tires that he carries I think 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.520
 that stand out pretty much about the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.100
 aesthetics of the vehicle tremendously 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.130
 aggressive I insist very little is known 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.759
 truth about this car because finally 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.590
 the company decided not to market it 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.200
 obviously since it is a machine 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.660
 extreme but it was also thought that it could 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.720
 compete in the German dtm to the famous 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.400
 German dtm and the truth is that when the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.890
 company said it was good that I did not have 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.590
 plans for this vehicle at the level of 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 competition because it was a bit frustrating 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:29.980
 for the japs ​​you already know that they 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.900
 They really like cars and finally the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.209
 Japanese company decided not to participate 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.349
 in the dtm if you have participated in other 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:42.489
 events but nothing has ever been revealed 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.610
 mechanical level or good details let's say 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.470
 vehicle technicians is worth simply 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.390
 it's a vehicle that was built so that 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.739
 the lexus engineers could try 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.370
 what those sensations might have 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.680
 extreme that this good vehicle produces 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.210
 Well, let's say to adapt it to the vehicle 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.610
 street no 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.170
 and otherwise sincerely little 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.850
 I can tell you more than me 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.190
 love that in the game is a wonder 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.580
 drive it a game that has very good 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.280
 grip does not have 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.740
 I do not know nor tour much nor have I either 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.590
 has oversteer or understeer is 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.220
 pretty well balanced maybe you 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.080
 could accelerate a little bit 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.910
 but hey it can be corrected so 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.760
 other then nothing else seems to me 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.780
 I insist a fantastic machine now 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.720
 you will quickly see the return to 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.320
 circuit this high the speed ring that 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.470
 it is undoubtedly a circuit tremendously 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.300
 very fast and good fast then there 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.000
 will show its qualities this 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.580
 fantastic machine this lexus and sf 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.290
 rising concept 2008 so for my part 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.240
 nothing else increases the volume a little 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.120
 because obviously he will be accompanied 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.650
 with music a little bit of music from the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.230
 old school that some of us will like 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.030
 others will like us even less we think 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.550
 the little cake other blogs will seem 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.930
 less but in any case like and favorites 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.880
 if you think it is convenient if it has 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.740
 liked the content of the video and by 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.360
 course if you want more great tourism 5 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.800
 also at the bottom in the 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.170
 description I leave my twitter as 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.540
 always hugs kisses and the host for 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.470
 we are all in the next 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.470
 until next time 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.470
 do not 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.169
 yes 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.169
 of thinking 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.289
 yes 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.920
 Y 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.660
 at the end 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.850
 and it is already 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.850
 all right 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.470
 is called 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.470
 yes 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:16.879
 I'm going to start 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.660
 look 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.529
 it does not make sense 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:58.239
 Never 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.239
 and leave 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.270
 and nothing more 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.530
 final 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.370
 and more
