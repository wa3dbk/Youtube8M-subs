hi<00:00:14.719> Raja<00:00:14.900> well<00:00:15.529> this<00:00:15.920> is<00:00:16.309> a<00:00:16.730> distillation<00:00:17.270> of

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
hi Raja well this is a distillation of

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.599 
hi Raja well this is a distillation of
everything<00:00:18.230> we've<00:00:18.350> done<00:00:18.440> so<00:00:18.680> far<00:00:18.710> basically<00:00:19.400> a

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
everything we've done so far basically a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.330 
everything we've done so far basically a
lot<00:00:20.240> of<00:00:20.330> people<00:00:20.570> love<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:20.810> size<00:00:21.199> of<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.680> 420

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
lot of people love the size of the 420

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.460 
lot of people love the size of the 420
but<00:00:23.089> there<00:00:23.269> are<00:00:23.359> some<00:00:23.539> things<00:00:23.720> about<00:00:23.900> it<00:00:24.050> that

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
but there are some things about it that

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.700 
but there are some things about it that
people<00:00:24.980> would<00:00:25.669> like<00:00:26.179> improved<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:27.019> one<00:00:27.589> of

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
people would like improved and one of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.919 
people would like improved and one of
them<00:00:27.829> is<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.429> grip<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:29.119> on<00:00:29.390> this<00:00:29.570> camera<00:00:29.779> you

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
them is the grip so on this camera you

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.569 
them is the grip so on this camera you
can<00:00:30.050> see<00:00:30.169> it's<00:00:30.320> almost<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.919> same<00:00:31.070> size<00:00:31.339> of<00:00:31.490> the

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
can see it's almost the same size of the

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.180 
can see it's almost the same size of the
420<00:00:32.090> but<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:32.419> for<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.599> larger<00:00:32.900> grip<00:00:33.190> you'll

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
420 but it's for the larger grip you'll

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.950 
420 but it's for the larger grip you'll
also<00:00:34.340> notice<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:35.090> we've<00:00:35.600> got<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:35.810> pancake

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
also notice that we've got the pancake

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.680 
also notice that we've got the pancake
lens<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:36.860> with<00:00:37.430> that<00:00:37.670> this<00:00:38.060> can<00:00:38.300> be<00:00:38.450> a

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
lens on so with that this can be a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.720 
lens on so with that this can be a
pretty<00:00:39.500> much<00:00:39.710> pocketable<00:00:40.160> camera<00:00:40.489> like<00:00:40.640> the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
pretty much pocketable camera like the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.540 
pretty much pocketable camera like the
420<00:00:41.270> but<00:00:41.930> we've<00:00:42.590> built<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:43.070> an<00:00:43.309> image

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
420 but we've built in an image

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.630 
420 but we've built in an image
stabilizer<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.480> 620<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:45.680> can<00:00:45.920> you

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
stabilizer to the 620 so you can you

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.020 
stabilizer to the 620 so you can you
take<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.969> pancake<00:00:47.300> lens<00:00:47.420> off

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
take the pancake lens off

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.400 
take the pancake lens off
swap<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.210> and

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
swap it and

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.110 
swap it and

put<00:00:53.630> on<00:00:53.780> one<00:00:53.900> of<00:00:53.990> the<00:00:54.080> really<00:00:54.590> big<00:00:54.620> telephotos

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
put on one of the really big telephotos

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.700 
put on one of the really big telephotos
and<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:56.270> equivalent<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:57.200> 600

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
and this is equivalent to a 600

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.560 
and this is equivalent to a 600
millimeter<00:00:58.040> lens<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:59.150> now<00:00:59.300> you've<00:00:59.450> got<00:00:59.510> a

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
millimeter lens and now you've got a

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.690 
millimeter lens and now you've got a

four stop Image Stabilizer built into
the<00:01:01.790> body<00:01:01.970> so<00:01:02.210> you<00:01:02.750> can<00:01:02.900> use<00:01:03.140> something<00:01:03.620> like

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
the body so you can use something like

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.850 
the body so you can use something like
this<00:01:03.890> telephoto<00:01:04.309> with<00:01:04.820> no<00:01:05.090> problems<00:01:05.420> at<00:01:05.540> all

this<00:01:37.430> camera<00:01:37.760> basically<00:01:38.150> fits<00:01:38.390> between<00:01:38.600> the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
this camera basically fits between the

two one of the other key developments is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.460 
two one of the other key developments is
a<00:01:42.770> seven-point<00:01:43.520> AF<00:01:43.910> over<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.900> three<00:01:45.110> points

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
a seven-point AF over the three points

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.800 
a seven-point AF over the three points
on<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.680> 420<00:01:46.190> so<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:47.000> very<00:01:47.150> much<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.390> camera

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
on the 420 so it's very much a camera

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.810 
on the 420 so it's very much a camera
for<00:01:47.990> those<00:01:48.170> who<00:01:48.530> don't<00:01:49.070> want<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.430> go<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.610> whole

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
way of the 30 which as you've probably

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.000 
way of the 30 which as you've probably
already<00:01:52.280> seen<00:01:52.640> it's<00:01:52.850> got<00:01:53.030> dual<00:01:53.840> thumb<00:01:54.740> wheels

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010

a big display on the top this is compact

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.940 
a big display on the top this is compact
that<00:01:58.400> allows<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.790> carry<00:01:58.910> around<00:01:59.060> or<00:01:59.960> it

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
that allows you to carry around or it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.400 
that allows you to carry around or it
can<00:02:01.369> be<00:02:01.670> used<00:02:02.210> as<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.420> pretty<00:02:02.600> powerful<00:02:02.780> camera

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
can be used as a pretty powerful camera

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.350 
can be used as a pretty powerful camera
with<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:04.070> big<00:02:04.190> lens<00:02:04.369> without<00:02:04.850> any<00:02:04.940> problems

with a big lens without any problems

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.900 
with a big lens without any problems
but<00:02:06.990> basically<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.650> got<00:02:07.770> combines<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
but basically it's got combines the the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.430 
but basically it's got combines the the
small<00:02:09.210> size<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> 420<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.380> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
small size of the 420 with the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.050 
small size of the 420 with the
stabilization<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.220> 520<00:02:11.790> that's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
stabilization of the 520 that's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.350 
stabilization of the 520 that's
ridiculous<00:02:12.480> green<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:13.230> guessing<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> 30<00:02:13.890> and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
ridiculous green I'm guessing the 30 and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
ridiculous green I'm guessing the 30 and
III<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:15.600> right<00:02:15.810> something<00:02:16.110> for<00:02:16.200> everybody

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
III that's right something for everybody

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.250 
III that's right something for everybody
here<00:02:16.560> plus<00:02:17.520> one<00:02:17.940> thing<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.210> neglected<00:02:18.270> was<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
here plus one thing I neglected was the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.620 
here plus one thing I neglected was the
30<00:02:19.530> pioneered<00:02:20.130> art<00:02:20.370> filters<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.150> we've<00:02:21.480> also

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
30 pioneered art filters and we've also

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.400 
30 pioneered art filters and we've also
got<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> art<00:02:22.050> filters<00:02:22.410> built<00:02:22.650> into<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.220> 620<00:02:23.760> I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
got the art filters built into the 620 I

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.270 
got the art filters built into the 620 I
just<00:02:25.410> remind<00:02:25.680> us<00:02:25.740> milady

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
just remind us milady

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.120 
just remind us milady
the<00:02:26.910> well<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> best<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
the well the one I like the best is the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.070 
the well the one I like the best is the
black<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.910> white<00:02:30.000> contrast<00:02:30.420> II<00:02:30.750> black<00:02:30.930> and

black and white contrast II black and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.860 
black and white contrast II black and
white<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.640> basic<00:02:33.030> principle<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.480> instead

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
white and the basic principle is instead

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.360 
white and the basic principle is instead
of<00:02:33.959> having<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.320> take<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.500> shot<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.070> then<00:02:35.220> go

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
of having to take a shot and then go

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
of having to take a shot and then go
back<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.760> manipulate<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.660> your<00:02:36.780> PC<00:02:37.170> you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
back and manipulate it on your PC you

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.560 
back and manipulate it on your PC you
can<00:02:37.590> take<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.340> contrasting<00:02:39.240> black<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.480> white

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
can take a contrasting black and white

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.920 
can take a contrasting black and white
picture<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.110> camera<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:41.670> also<00:02:41.820> does<00:02:42.209> effects

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
picture in camera it also does effects

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.810 
picture in camera it also does effects
like<00:02:43.260> pinhole<00:02:43.860> soft<00:02:44.340> focus<00:02:44.640> pale<00:02:45.239> colors<00:02:46.820> even

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
like pinhole soft focus pale colors even

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.280 
like pinhole soft focus pale colors even
multiple<00:02:48.300> exposure<00:02:48.690> which<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.140> something

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
multiple exposure which is something

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.070 
multiple exposure which is something
that<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.620> p30<00:02:50.430> pioneered<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.870> try

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
that the p30 pioneered so you can try

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.210 
that the p30 pioneered so you can try
things<00:02:52.140> out<00:02:52.590> when<00:02:52.770> you're<00:02:52.890> out<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.160> about

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
things out when you're out and about

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.860 
things out when you're out and about
that<00:02:53.430> normally<00:02:54.090> you'd<00:02:54.180> only<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.450> able<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.660> do

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
that normally you'd only be able to do

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.110 
that normally you'd only be able to do
when<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.110> get<00:02:55.230> back<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.770> think<00:02:56.580> that's<00:02:56.760> freed

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
when you get back I think that's freed

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.550 
when you get back I think that's freed
up<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.450> lot<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.690> people<00:02:57.900> who<00:02:58.020> are<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.200> little<00:02:58.350> bit

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
up a lot of people who are a little bit

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.750 
up a lot of people who are a little bit
fed<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:58.830> with<00:02:59.070> fiddling<00:02:59.400> around<00:02:59.489> on<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
fed up with fiddling around on the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.979 
fed up with fiddling around on the
computer<00:02:59.850> indoors<00:03:00.360> when<00:03:00.600> they<00:03:00.690> could<00:03:00.810> be<00:03:00.840> out

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
computer indoors when they could be out

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.410 
computer indoors when they could be out
taking<00:03:01.350> photographs<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:03.150> put<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
taking photographs to put the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.760 
taking photographs to put the
painkillers<00:03:03.870> back<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.140> just<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.350> show<00:03:04.380> all

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
painkillers back on just to show all

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.830 
painkillers back on just to show all
sense<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.100> how<00:03:05.190> small<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.610> company<00:03:06.390> worth<00:03:06.630> a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
sense of how small this company worth a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.520 
sense of how small this company worth a
buck<00:03:07.050> goes<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.530> guess<00:03:07.650> when<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.890> put<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.160> on

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
buck goes I guess when you put this on

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.470 
buck goes I guess when you put this on
as<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.370> say<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.640> could<00:03:10.910> actually<00:03:11.030> get<00:03:11.240> it<00:03:11.360> in

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
as you say you could actually get it in

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.809 
as you say you could actually get it in
a<00:03:11.810> baggie<00:03:11.990> pop<00:03:12.230> continue<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:13.100> their<00:03:13.250> cocaine

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
a baggie pop continue so their cocaine

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.240 
a baggie pop continue so their cocaine
yeah<00:03:14.630> definitely<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.050> coat<00:03:15.200> pocket<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:16.069> very

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
yeah definitely a coat pocket it's very

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.240 
yeah definitely a coat pocket it's very
very<00:03:16.459> small

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.650 

this<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> about<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.580> smaller<00:03:20.910> digital<00:03:21.180> SLR

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
this is about a smaller digital SLR

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.710 
this is about a smaller digital SLR
camera<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:23.070> think<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.520> standard<00:03:23.940> form<00:03:24.210> until

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
camera I think in a standard form until

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.770 
camera I think in a standard form until
we<00:03:24.810> go<00:03:24.960> to<00:03:25.580> micro<00:03:26.580> four-thirds<00:03:27.060> later<00:03:27.570> this

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
we go to micro four-thirds later this

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.870 
we go to micro four-thirds later this
year<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.440> as<00:03:28.980> small<00:03:29.100> as<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.430> needs<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.700> be

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
year this is as small as it needs to be

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.460 
year this is as small as it needs to be
I<00:03:29.910> think

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.260 

and<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.190> think<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.430> particular<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:35.000> screen

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
and I think this particular the screen

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.520 
and I think this particular the screen
makes<00:03:35.560> some<00:03:36.560> it's<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.830> live<00:03:37.010> view

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
makes some it's the live view

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.340 
makes some it's the live view
very<00:03:39.130> useful<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:40.150> years<00:03:40.330> ago<00:03:41.020> that's

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
very useful that years ago that's

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.070 
very useful that years ago that's
grateful<00:03:41.770> I<00:03:41.860> do<00:03:42.120> find<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.420 

okay

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.119 

you<00:03:50.969> won't<00:03:51.659> miss<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:54.530> we'll<00:03:55.530> do<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> live<00:03:55.859> demo

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
you won't miss it we'll do a live demo

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.229 
you won't miss it we'll do a live demo
we<00:03:56.489> switch<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.969> to<00:03:58.819> flick<00:03:59.819> it<00:03:59.849> back<00:04:00.060> onto

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
we switch it on to flick it back onto

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.539 
we switch it on to flick it back onto
the<00:04:00.390> scene<00:04:00.719> modes<00:04:01.019> all<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.890> art<00:04:02.069> filters

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
the scene modes all the art filters

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.490 
the scene modes all the art filters
should<00:04:02.579> are<00:04:02.790> saying<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.170> scroll

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
should are saying and if you scroll

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500 
should are saying and if you scroll
through<00:04:04.560> that's<00:04:05.489> contrasted<00:04:06.209> back<00:04:06.329> right

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
through that's contrasted back right
