use that fallback and that's not because

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.080 
use that fallback and that's not because
you<00:00:49.020> should<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.559> afraid<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.309> having<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.910> fall

those old scores are still going to be

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.270 
those old scores are still going to be
in<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> system<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> good<00:00:58.620> number<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> years

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
in the system for a good number of years

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.050 
until the 2019 admissions cycle now
whether<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:13.950> schools<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.549> accepting

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
whether or not schools are accepting

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.460 
whether or not schools are accepting
them<00:01:15.240> still<00:01:15.540> that's<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.990> school<00:01:16.259> by<00:01:16.409> school

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
them still that's a school by school

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.929 
them still that's a school by school
basis<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.310> something<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.790> have

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
basis and that is something you do have

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.980 
basis and that is something you do have
to<00:01:18.090> ask<00:01:18.210> schools<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.380> um<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.220> AMC<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.240> really

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to ask schools but um the AMC is really

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
to ask schools but um the AMC is really
committed<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:23.450> being<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:24.780> clear<00:01:25.610> about<00:01:26.610> how

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
committed to being very clear about how

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 
committed to being very clear about how
to<00:01:26.850> scale<00:01:27.090> old<00:01:27.479> scores<00:01:27.810> onto<00:01:28.320> new<00:01:28.470> scores<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to scale old scores onto new scores and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
to scale old scores onto new scores and
so<00:01:29.729> don't<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.119> afraid<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.659> taking<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.170> old
