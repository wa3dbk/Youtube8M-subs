00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.020
 I was back in the sports area from 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.660
 the dressing rooms of the stadium cements 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.019
 progress where we also find that 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.270
 are each identified with each 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.210
 player where he sits and good 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.210
 we have here paolo suárez in his place 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.789
 well where it already fits during the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.109
 commitments or at halftime after 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.970
 of training and so on 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.329
 good, good, what a pleasure to say hello to paulo 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.319
 and Augustin Suarez his offspring of 5 almost 6 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.839
 years as everything is fine for everyone and 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.670
 here ending one more day between no 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.309
 last time I spoke to you just arrived 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.620
 guatemala routes well culminated a 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.960
 successful career in Salvadoran football 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.690
 with a lot of experience with communications 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.940
 or already champion team scorer 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.150
 happy because I think he got the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 first goal that was 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.610
 to be champion and good happy for that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.790
 now it has started pretty well I think 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.950
 this second tournament a responsibility 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.960
 huge because I think we can in 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.140
 communications that requires a huge 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.240
 Goalscorer responsibility was not your 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.100
 characteristic that that was not your 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.860
 responsibility within the field of 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.300
 study is to create but but always 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.920
 there are many goals in El Salvador and 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.010
 perhaps you have stopped us from doing the same 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.979
 important if obviously this time 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.270
 by the position that one plays of steering wheel 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.790
 offensive let's say score goals 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.620
 I think that gives you a lot of confidence in me 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.160
 person 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.020
 it helps me a lot emotionally but for 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.290
 above all things I am a person 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.120
 that is more dedicated to sacrifice the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.700
 even more tactical team help my 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.110
 companions to the goals but obvious 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.090
 that if I still have the goal situation 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.810
 I try to make the most of it 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.000
 bugler attacked three islands you gave me and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.500
 we said here Augustine the family is 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.320
 something always important for the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.080
 footballer especially so that he is 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.450
 when he was his country with his Uruguayans 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.100
 with a good one a big big step 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.840
 long for the savior now in guatemala 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.820
 How the country treats you and the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.070
 family for all because what 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.020
 extrafutbolístico the theme school the 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.230
 social adaptation and so on here 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.170
 guatemala well the truth that has 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.150
 surprised a lot because to come here to a 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.030
 so big city I thought I was going to 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.020
 cost more 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.920
 in front of a school for the child 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.920
 it helps me a lot later 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.290
 mate in gymnastics near and for 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.420
 for the mother the child the good child 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.550
 you too so the truth that very 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.240
 well people when pressed with one 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.650
 I think well 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.560
 everyone likes it but I think the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.750
 great majority there is a greeting a photo a 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.220
 autograph and it's the truth that one gives 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.500
 much tranquility that above all 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.870
 the things 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.240
 they see you as a clear person have 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.190
 promising future are also children of 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.590
 It is very difficult for the second 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.880
 parts are very difficult because from 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.330
 because they know that they grow with 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.190
 very high parameters like as lbs 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.920
 today let's say good wish 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.260
 surely we see it already dressed between 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.110
 cream in madrid is like some tacos very 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.490
 elegant likes if you like 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.830
 usually soccer or practice 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.540
 because the father did not think practice 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.110
 I like it 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.720
 between you 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.120
 Monday Tuesday and Wednesday 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.060
 with the school leaves at 12 and 15 and 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.800
 already from school and puts on clothes between 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.490
 the first one walks all day with 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.490
 more balls sometimes 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.840
 I get management complaints to the 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.760
 father with the blows to the ball and in in 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.340
 the house and for any time it gets 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.170
 for the ball and well yes I think so 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.010
 he likes to leave it good 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.010
 What is it 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.590
 exactly good excellent in the 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.540
 concacaf having lost with toluca 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.120
 I would practically leave them without 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.430
 possibilities or you good now 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.419
 happy with the ten and tobago trophy 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.970
 obviously they take back some life but from 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.850
 enviable go to Mexico to win or if you already 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.780
 are focusing on the national as how 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.590
 is let's say the reality 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.190
 communications 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.470
 obviously that having lost with 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.050
 toluca was a very hard blow if 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.490
 we wanted to have stronger aspirations 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.050
 that reclassify we have to have 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.750
 won by good number tied it 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.180
 lost but not having won the other day 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.240
 in trinidad and tobago I think it gives us a 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.340
 slight hope still that in the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.530
 port can happen now we play in 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.360
 our court against her we have to 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.370
 win make a good difference 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.800
 goals also yes good and after going to 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.290
 fight the heights because as I have in 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.430
 the port can pass and if we win here 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.120
 for a good difference 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.150
 I think with great enthusiasm the first 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.090
 The tiebreaker criterion in concacaf is in 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.140
 this tournament at least is exactly 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.480
 the direct confrontation that you want and 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.610
 they have to win there 2 to 0 good only 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.260
 if there are 2 to 1 left, let's say there if you go 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.569
 to look at the difference of goals we have 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.789
 to make another goal 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.830
 it's a bit difficult but good in the 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.949
 illusion we still have the dream is 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.869
 to be able to pass the next phase and if 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.520
 there are still possibilities let's fight 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:40.080
 Uruguay now is also going to start 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.490
 once again his participation in the 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.959
 World Cup qualifier where they have 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.909
 been complicated but the last 

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:47.709
 results have put them back in 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.999
 the fight a good participation in 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:50.740
 confederations out there too we 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.779
 which you can excite your brother 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.580
 is that of the excluding stars of 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.770
 that selection that you expect paraguay and 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.230
 Uruguay in this sms in this last section 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:03.020
 of the good eliminator 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.300
 we have to consider the result that 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.490
 it takes us worldwide that is an engine 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.980
 Uruguayan the dream and the illusion that 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.390
 we have know that there are very 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.280
 complicated 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.770
 against Uruguay at night and that the 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.980
 matches are complicated but as 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.090
 any difficult tie I think that 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.380
 maybe nowadays in the world to what 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.010
 only one that is easy with 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.450
 I would feed Argentina-Brazil for 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.000
 potential that he has but then the 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.970
 been pretty even that yes now 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.100
 plays against Peru and I think of taking a 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.410
 good result I think I already believe that 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.110
 is going to go getting hopefully Pablo good 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.560
 many successes as always today is the 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.760
 very cute son and the really your step 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.750
 for guatemala has been so far 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.580
 impeccable 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.670
 so continuous success in football 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.670
 Guatemalan 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.850
 Thank you

 well, thank you, greetings to all 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.590
 the 'creams' and well let's hope to continue 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.770
 this way working hard for 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.260
 get the goal that is this from the 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.300
 title like the bars from the dressing room 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.740
 of the stadium cementos progreso was with 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.740
 us in sports area
