 completely different system it can be compared 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:38.860
 for example, as if a six-string guitar 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.739

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.870

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.800

 slim that allows you to keep big 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.859
 finger by fingerboard for push-button accordion 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:16.479
 usually 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:21.999
 the neck is very thick the same as that of 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.819
 ordinary accordions so a bayan 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:27.609
 who play button accordions 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:34.119
 hold your hand a little differently big 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:37.420
 finger is always on the cyborgs for 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.969
 people playing the accordion we have another 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.450
 position we hold our thumb like 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.719
 rule for the neck but this is the difference 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.029
 between these tools 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:55.610
 now I want to talk about fur 

00:01:49.029 --> 00:02:03.020
 here we have fur fur is the heart of the soul bayan 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:07.570
 the fur allows the fur to allow the tool 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.300
 breathe but actually 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:16.340
 You can probably compare the battle only with 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:20.440
 violin here you know the expression violin 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.230
 sings like that if you know how to use 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.410
 your button accordion will be able to sing the same 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.430
 like a human voice but i am now 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.220
 I'll show you what you can do either 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.290
 violin or accordion 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.800
 but for example you take one note 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.800
 note up 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:03:00.190
 and lead this not where from the quietest 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.770
 sound 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.760
 further louder louder louder to the very 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.120
 loud and further gradually subsided 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.110
 this can be done only on the accordion but also 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.390
 very similar can be done on the violin 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.790
 strictly speaking the same can be 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.050
 make only human voice but 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.810
 is if you know how to handle the fur 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.600
 how sound is formed on the bayan sound 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.860
 formed with a knife not me on 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.930
 a button or a few buttons and when 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.680
 you pull the world and do it right 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.210
 simultaneously press the button and pull 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.060
 laugh if you try to just press 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.210
 no sound buttons for you if you 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.100
 try to just pull the fur without pressing 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.320
 on the buttons you can break the world and 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.320
