00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
first space mission in 1995 today I'm

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.069 
first space mission in 1995 today I'm
gonna<00:01:28.590> make<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.070> piece<00:01:29.600> type<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.750> work<00:01:30.869> I've

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
gonna make a piece type of work I've

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
gonna make a piece type of work I've
been<00:01:31.110> making<00:01:31.380> since<00:01:31.829> 1976<00:01:32.790> they're<00:01:33.119> called

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
been making since 1976 they're called

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.719 
been making since 1976 they're called
planets<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.220> make<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> mega

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
planets and actually I gonna make a mega

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.640 
planets and actually I gonna make a mega
world<00:01:36.060> large<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.689> today<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.439> long

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
world large one today and it's a long

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.260 
world large one today and it's a long
process<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:41.280> building<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.640> layer<00:01:41.850> after<00:01:42.090> layer

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
process of building up layer after layer

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.609

the<00:01:49.619> finished<00:01:49.950> planet<00:01:50.430> won't<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.149> earth

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the finished planet won't be the earth

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.139 
the finished planet won't be the earth
but<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.229> world<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:53.009> its<00:01:53.340> own<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but a little world all its own this is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.300 
but a little world all its own this is
just<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> beginning<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> stir<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> embryo<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
just the beginning to stir the embryo of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
just the beginning to stir the embryo of
what<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.210> hope<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> very<00:01:58.040> relatively

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
what we hope will be a very relatively

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.649 
what we hope will be a very relatively
large<00:01:59.250> piece<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.820> should<00:01:59.850> be<00:02:00.299> something

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
large piece it should be something

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.090 
large piece it should be something
that's<00:02:00.689> around<00:02:01.110> 10

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that's around 10

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's around 10
or<00:02:02.270> or<00:02:03.270> maybe<00:02:04.020> even<00:02:04.110> 11<00:02:04.650> inches<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.070> diameter

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
or or maybe even 11 inches in diameter

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.430 
or or maybe even 11 inches in diameter
it'll<00:02:05.880> probably<00:02:06.090> weigh<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.780> 80<00:02:07.170> pounds

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
it'll probably weigh about 80 pounds

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.740 
it'll probably weigh about 80 pounds
right<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.280> Holly<00:02:08.759> what<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.570> Greg

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
right now Holly what do you think Greg

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.340 
right now Holly what do you think Greg
four<00:02:10.110> pounds<00:02:11.090> adding<00:02:12.090> hot<00:02:12.300> glass<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:13.320> be

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
four pounds adding hot glass can be

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
all of that is is just how we prepare it

added then heat is applied to the bottom
of<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.320> globe<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.919> make<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.250> thinner<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:40.090> it

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
of the globe to make it thinner so it

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.950

temperature<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.160> that's<00:04:48.280> enough<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.729> warm

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
temperature and that's enough to warm

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.249 
temperature and that's enough to warm
just<00:04:49.449> the<00:04:49.600> bottom<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.110> this<00:04:50.260> planet

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.629 

okay<00:04:54.259> we're<00:04:54.410> about<00:04:54.620> ready<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.949> take<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.280> off<00:04:55.460> I

now<00:05:05.479> I<00:05:05.509> don't<00:05:05.630> want<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.930> hold<00:05:06.020> on<00:05:06.229> to<00:05:06.320> this<00:05:06.440> for

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
now I don't want to hold on to this for

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:15.269 
now I don't want to hold on to this for
very<00:05:06.800> long<00:05:06.919> because<00:05:07.130> it's<00:05:07.280> 1,300<00:05:07.910> degrees

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:15.279 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.130 

okay

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.260 

so<00:05:18.740> that's<00:05:19.370> how<00:05:19.490> we<00:05:19.550> make<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:19.820> make<00:05:20.030> a<00:05:20.060> world

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
so that's how we make a make a world

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.800 
so that's how we make a make a world
that<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.870> that<00:05:21.440> piece<00:05:21.880> was<00:05:22.880> just<00:05:22.910> about<00:05:23.210> 1300

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
that that that piece was just about 1300

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.220 
that that that piece was just about 1300
degrees<00:05:24.020> it's<00:05:24.470> heavy<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:25.570> now<00:05:26.570> needs<00:05:26.840> to<00:05:26.930> sit

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
degrees it's heavy and now needs to sit

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.110 
degrees it's heavy and now needs to sit
in<00:05:27.380> this<00:05:27.530> annealing<00:05:28.130> oven<00:05:28.370> for<00:05:28.640> about<00:05:28.790> a<00:05:28.820> month

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
in this annealing oven for about a month

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.440 
in this annealing oven for about a month
30<00:05:29.660> days<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.800> cool<00:05:31.070> down<00:05:31.280> from<00:05:31.580> that<00:05:31.790> 1,300

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
30 days and cool down from that 1,300

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.670 
30 days and cool down from that 1,300
degrees<00:05:32.510> all<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.050> way<00:05:33.140> down<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.500> room

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
degrees all the way down to room

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.410 
degrees all the way down to room
temperature<00:05:34.720> that's<00:05:35.720> it

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.390
