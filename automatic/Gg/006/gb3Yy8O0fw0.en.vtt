00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
of scale but certainly we want to try to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.859 
of scale but certainly we want to try to
be<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.439> accurate<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.509> give<00:01:42.750> the
