okay<00:00:01.970> here's<00:00:02.970> my<00:00:03.030> first<00:00:03.389> hydroxy<00:00:04.049> generator

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
okay here's my first hydroxy generator

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.080 
okay here's my first hydroxy generator
and<00:00:05.270> it's<00:00:06.270> running<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:07.189> about<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.400> gallon<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
and it's running in about a gallon of

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.610 
and it's running in about a gallon of
distilled<00:00:09.210> water<00:00:09.660> with<00:00:10.639> mm<00:00:12.019> approximately<00:00:13.019> 1

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
distilled water with mm approximately 1

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.740 
distilled water with mm approximately 1
tablespoon<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.670> sodium<00:00:15.089> hydroxide

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
tablespoon of sodium hydroxide

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.410 
tablespoon of sodium hydroxide
concentrated<00:00:16.730> mixed<00:00:17.730> into<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> gallon<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
concentrated mixed into the gallon of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.490 
concentrated mixed into the gallon of
water<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.180> series<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> five<00:00:21.630> stainless

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
water this is a series of five stainless

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.470 
water this is a series of five stainless
steel<00:00:22.529> cones<00:00:23.330> which<00:00:24.330> used<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:25.880> cups<00:00:26.880> that

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
steel cones which used to be cups that

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
steel cones which used to be cups that
were<00:00:27.630> reconfigured<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.830> were<00:00:28.949> bought<00:00:29.130> from

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
were reconfigured that were bought from

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.189 
were reconfigured that were bought from
the<00:00:29.429> habitat<00:00:29.849> humanity<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> dollar

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the habitat humanity for about a dollar

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.010 
the habitat humanity for about a dollar
apiece<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.980> there's<00:00:32.910> my<00:00:33.090> power<00:00:33.360> source<00:00:33.750> right

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
apiece and there's my power source right

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.430 
apiece and there's my power source right
there<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.680> 12<00:00:35.010> volt<00:00:35.160> battery<00:00:35.610> charger<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
there is a 12 volt battery charger and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.709 
there is a 12 volt battery charger and
so<00:00:37.440> I've<00:00:38.160> got<00:00:38.460> pretty<00:00:38.730> good<00:00:38.790> results<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.450> so

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so I've got pretty good results here so

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:55.580 
so I've got pretty good results here so
let's<00:00:39.930> kick<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.649> how<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> looks

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.040 

alright<00:00:56.190> let<00:00:56.370> me<00:00:56.430> turn<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.760> off<00:00:56.910> again

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.970 

this<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.890> a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.020 

overworked

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
overworked

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.330 
overworked
work<00:01:07.630> table

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
work table

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.249 
work table
let's<00:01:10.000> go<00:01:10.119> down<00:01:10.299> here<00:01:10.329> and<00:01:10.600> see<00:01:10.990> if<00:01:11.020> we<00:01:11.140> can

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
let's go down here and see if we can

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.310 
let's go down here and see if we can
look<00:01:11.350> at<00:01:11.469> it<00:01:11.530> from<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.950> side<00:01:12.100> as<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.789> comes<00:01:13.000> on

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
look at it from the side as it comes on

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.649 
look at it from the side as it comes on
there<00:01:14.320> we<00:01:14.409> go<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.850> hold<00:01:16.090> on<00:01:16.240> let<00:01:16.450> me<00:01:16.509> turn

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
there we go and just hold on let me turn

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.160 
there we go and just hold on let me turn
it<00:01:16.719> on

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.210 

go

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
go

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.130 
go
so<00:01:24.790> it's<00:01:24.940> doing<00:01:25.120> pretty<00:01:25.210> good<00:01:25.480> pretty<00:01:26.410> good

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so it's doing pretty good pretty good

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.200 
so it's doing pretty good pretty good
pretty<00:01:28.800> nice<00:01:28.920> production<00:01:29.460> there

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
pretty nice production there

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.830 
pretty nice production there
and<00:01:31.450> that's<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:33.400> of<00:01:33.460> high<00:01:33.670> on<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.909> IMP<00:01:34.060> so

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
and that's kind of high on the IMP so

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.370 
and that's kind of high on the IMP so
click<00:01:36.560> revive<00:01:36.859> 15<00:01:37.549> amps<00:01:37.939> plus<00:01:39.549> 12<00:01:40.549> volts<00:01:40.909> on

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
click revive 15 amps plus 12 volts on

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.310 
click revive 15 amps plus 12 volts on
the<00:01:42.640> start<00:01:43.640> mode<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.329> kind<00:01:44.600> of<00:01:44.630> charge

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the start mode this kind of charge

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.090 
the start mode this kind of charge
mode

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
mode

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.830 
mode
so<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.729> answer<00:01:48.760> a<00:01:49.030> little<00:01:49.210> high<00:01:49.330> maybe<00:01:49.780> a

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
so the answer a little high maybe a

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.590 
so the answer a little high maybe a
little<00:01:49.930> bit<00:01:50.080> too<00:01:50.170> much<00:01:50.290> set<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.619> hydroxide

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
little bit too much set of hydroxide

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.340 
little bit too much set of hydroxide
only<00:01:52.600> about<00:01:53.189> approximately<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:55.210> much<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:56.259> I

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
only about approximately this much and I

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.109 
only about approximately this much and I
go<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.680> water<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:58.210> we're<00:01:58.420> getting<00:01:58.659> very

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
go in the water but we're getting very

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.290 
go in the water but we're getting very
positive<00:02:01.119> results

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.990 

ok
