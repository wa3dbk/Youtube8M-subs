now
which<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.780> uncommon<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> we're<00:00:53.940> gonna

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
which is not uncommon so we're gonna

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
which is not uncommon so we're gonna
take<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:55.170> movies<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.309> through<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
take some movies as we go through this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
so you can see the process of how we

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.899 
so you can see the process of how we
proceed<00:00:59.070> doing<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.850> okay<00:01:00.510> thank<00:01:01.050> you

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
that happened was made to replace this

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.280 
that happened was made to replace this
piece<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.530> wood<00:02:03.680> down<00:02:03.890> here<00:02:04.660> on<00:02:05.660> both<00:02:05.930> sides

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
piece of wood down here on both sides

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.730 
piece of wood down here on both sides
and<00:02:06.880> down<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.119> sills<00:02:08.450> on<00:02:08.750> both<00:02:08.899> sides<00:02:09.260> as<00:02:09.560> well

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
and down the sills on both sides as well

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.950 
and down the sills on both sides as well
so<00:02:10.070> there<00:02:10.220> was<00:02:10.310> quite<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.670> bit<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:10.940> rot<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
so there was quite a bit of rot and the

rod had also gone inside the door so we

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.750 
rod had also gone inside the door so we
had<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.960> then<00:02:15.110> put<00:02:15.380> epoxy<00:02:15.710> on<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> inside<00:02:16.550> of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760
