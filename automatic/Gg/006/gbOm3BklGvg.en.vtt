00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840 
it up and this one honestly be a
collection<00:00:22.439> riding<00:00:22.830> kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.160> knife<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
collection riding kind of knife the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.570 
collection riding kind of knife the
blade<00:00:23.880> seems<00:00:24.300> kind<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.570> small<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:25.109> EDC<00:00:25.580> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
blade seems kind of small for EDC the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.250 
blade seems kind of small for EDC the
blade<00:00:26.820> length<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.359> thing<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.019> at

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
blade length on this thing is right at

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.859 
blade length on this thing is right at
two<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> quarter<00:00:28.920> inches<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.939> overall

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
two and a quarter inches so overall

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.870 
two and a quarter inches so overall

length is 3 and 1/8 but it does weigh

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.030 
length is 3 and 1/8 but it does weigh
1.6<00:00:35.880> ounces<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.630> that's<00:00:37.050> pretty<00:00:37.350> sweet<00:00:37.530> really

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
maybe not for me but for other people

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.060 
maybe not for me but for other people
they<00:01:56.280> might<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.299> do<00:01:57.540> find<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
they might like that I do find that the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.289 
they might like that I do find that the
handle<00:01:59.460> is<00:02:00.829> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> smooth<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> red

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
handle is kind of smooth I like the red

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569 
handle is kind of smooth I like the red
finish<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:05.070> metal<00:02:05.310> work<00:02:05.430> is

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
finish on it and the metal work is

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.479 
finish on it and the metal work is
definitely<00:02:05.759> shiny<00:02:06.409> I've<00:02:07.409> seen<00:02:07.710> faster<00:02:08.009> blades

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
definitely shiny I've seen faster blades

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.260 
definitely shiny I've seen faster blades
that's<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.209> sure<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.840> have

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
that's for sure I have

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.240 
that's for sure I have
really<00:02:10.510> use<00:02:10.720> this<00:02:10.900> a<00:02:10.960> bunch<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.560> might<00:02:11.800> we're

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
really use this a bunch so might we're

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.360 
really use this a bunch so might we're
in<00:02:12.460> with<00:02:12.640> time<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:14.530> lighter<00:02:14.830> lock<00:02:15.130> is

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
in with time and this lighter lock is

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.670 
in with time and this lighter lock is
extremely<00:02:16.030> slippery<00:02:16.420> cuff<00:02:16.750> almost<00:02:17.410> hard<00:02:17.620> to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
extremely slippery cuff almost hard to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.160 
extremely slippery cuff almost hard to
actuate<00:02:18.070> just<00:02:18.430> because<00:02:18.640> it's<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:18.910> small<00:02:19.170> so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
actuate just because it's so small so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.550 
actuate just because it's so small so
you<00:02:20.710> don't<00:02:20.890> really<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.190> cutout<00:02:21.490> here

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you don't really have a cutout here

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.900 
you don't really have a cutout here
thumb-stud<00:02:23.560> deployment<00:02:24.250> I'm<00:02:24.550> gonna<00:02:24.700> go<00:02:24.850> ahead

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
thumb-stud deployment I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.190 
thumb-stud deployment I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:25.090> say<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.950> near<00:02:26.950> impossible<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.870> might<00:02:29.080> be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and say is near impossible you might be

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.060 
and say is near impossible you might be
able<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.380> get<00:02:29.500> underneath<00:02:29.680> there<00:02:29.860> maybe

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
able to get underneath there maybe

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.320 
able to get underneath there maybe
loosen<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.520> up<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.640> little<00:02:30.730> bit<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.060> probably

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
loosen it up a little bit you probably

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.210 
loosen it up a little bit you probably
be<00:02:31.450> alright

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
be alright

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.710 
be alright
but<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.310> seems<00:02:33.490> closer<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.000> me<00:02:34.120> even<00:02:34.360> than<00:02:34.570> that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
but it seems closer to me even than that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.440 
but it seems closer to me even than that
of<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.280> leak<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.790> scallion<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> ones

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
of the leak and the scallion the ones

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.970 
of the leak and the scallion the ones
that<00:02:37.540> are<00:02:37.630> kind<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.870> comparable<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.830> would

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that are kind of comparable I would

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.440 
that are kind of comparable I would
guess<00:02:41.010> let's<00:02:42.010> say<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:42.520> have<00:02:42.550> torque

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
guess let's say you do have torque

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.200 
guess let's say you do have torque
screws<00:02:43.750> here<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.260> take<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.560> apart<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.210> your

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
screws here to take it apart and your

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.840 
screws here to take it apart and your
pivot<00:02:46.600> screw<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:47.170> actually<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.040> same<00:02:48.220> size<00:02:48.490> as

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
pivot screw is actually the same size as

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.910 
pivot screw is actually the same size as
your<00:02:49.480> frame<00:02:49.750> screws<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.800> just

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
your frame screws so you have to just

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.680 
your frame screws so you have to just
kind<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.310> give<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.550> testament<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:52.120> size

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
kind of give you a testament as size

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.530 
kind of give you a testament as size
wise<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:54.040> comparison<00:02:54.370> because<00:02:55.240> I<00:02:55.390> just

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
wise and for comparison because I just

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.400 
wise and for comparison because I just
did<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> video<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.350> was<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.710> ah

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
did a video and this was in it ah

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.390 
did a video and this was in it ah

all blurred out there - yup - just so we

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.440 
all blurred out there - yup - just so we
can<00:03:17.080> see<00:03:17.320> an<00:03:18.070> overall<00:03:18.520> comparison<00:03:19.240> I<00:03:19.300> know

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
can see an overall comparison I know

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.630 
can see an overall comparison I know
it's<00:03:19.770> realistically<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> same<00:03:21.070> exact<00:03:21.340> knife

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
it's realistically the same exact knife

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.550 
it's realistically the same exact knife
top<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.090> bottom<00:03:22.360> but<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:23.050> got<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.500> I
