00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.880 
program I think it's a program that can
be<00:00:40.670> expanded<00:00:41.090> throughout<00:00:41.960> Australia<00:00:42.710> and

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
naturally cry and it encourages this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.620 
naturally cry and it encourages this
safety<00:01:56.929> because<00:01:57.350> if<00:01:57.740> you're<00:01:58.069> not<00:01:58.630> relying

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
safety because if you're not relying

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.649 
safety because if you're not relying
upon<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.350> pair<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.009> punches<00:02:01.459> to<00:02:01.700> score<00:02:02.030> so

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
upon the pair of the punches to score so

upon the pair of the punches to score so
and<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.280> you're<00:02:05.030> not<00:02:05.179> going<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.630> score

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
and and so you're not going to score

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.929 
and and so you're not going to score
effectively<00:02:06.530> penalized<00:02:07.009> if<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.459> if<00:02:07.729> you

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
positive i love it also is obviously a

variation<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:38.090> traditional<00:02:38.569> amateur<00:02:39.350> boxing

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
variation on traditional amateur boxing

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.060 
variation on traditional amateur boxing
with<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.040> way<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.180> designed<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.470> i

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
with the way that it's designed and i

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.140 
with the way that it's designed and i
think<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.490> offers

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
think it offers

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.449 
think it offers
more<00:02:44.689> alternatives<00:02:45.409> for<00:02:45.739> people<00:02:46.189> and<00:02:46.340> more

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
more alternatives for people and more

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.880 
more alternatives for people and more
inclusivity<00:02:47.090> particularly<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.409> opportunity

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
inclusivity particularly the opportunity

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.520 
inclusivity particularly the opportunity
for<00:02:48.980> men<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.819> women<00:02:49.849> to<00:02:50.239> compete<00:02:50.659> or<00:02:51.049> fail<00:02:51.290> or

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
for men and women to compete or fail or

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.619 
for men and women to compete or fail or
to<00:02:52.040> have<00:02:52.159> bouts<00:02:52.400> against<00:02:52.700> one<00:02:52.849> another<00:02:52.879> and

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
to have bouts against one another and

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.449 
to have bouts against one another and
also<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.260> different<00:02:54.650> weight<00:02:54.980> categories

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
also for the different weight categories

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.160 
also for the different weight categories
to<00:02:55.670> more<00:02:56.090> fairly<00:02:56.329> compete<00:02:56.900> against<00:02:57.110> one

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
to more fairly compete against one

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.050 
to more fairly compete against one
another<00:02:57.319> so<00:02:57.829> again<00:02:58.430> showed<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> lot<00:02:59.030> of

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
another so again showed a lot of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.149 
another so again showed a lot of
opportunities<00:02:59.629> for<00:02:59.659> the<00:02:59.959> sport<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.470> also

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
opportunities for the sport and also

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.649 
opportunities for the sport and also

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329

participation wing and this looks to me
to<00:03:55.579> be<00:03:55.699> perfect<00:03:56.329> for<00:03:56.389> that<00:03:56.569> I'd<00:03:57.379> be<00:03:57.709> wearing<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
to be perfect for that I'd be wearing to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.180 
to be perfect for that I'd be wearing to
say<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.699> this<00:03:58.819> is<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.989> learning<00:04:00.530> ground<00:04:00.949> to

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
say that this is the learning ground to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.379 
say that this is the learning ground to
then<00:04:01.340> move<00:04:01.519> on<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.790> amateur<00:04:02.180> boxing<00:04:02.209> i'd<00:04:03.079> be<00:04:03.139> i

research study and I guess that's why
I'm<00:04:28.760> here<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.690> have<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.870> look<00:04:30.050> at<00:04:30.229> how<00:04:30.440> we<00:04:30.500> might

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
I'm here to have a look at how we might

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.670 
I'm here to have a look at how we might
framework<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.120> research<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:33.050> have<00:04:33.229> a<00:04:33.260> look<00:04:33.530> at

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
framework the research to have a look at

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.500 
framework the research to have a look at
how<00:04:33.919> this<00:04:34.190> is<00:04:34.400> really<00:04:34.669> affecting<00:04:35.330> young

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
how this is really affecting young

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.839 
how this is really affecting young
people<00:04:35.990> what<00:04:36.590> sort<00:04:36.949> of<00:04:37.039> benefits<00:04:37.550> are<00:04:37.729> they

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
people what sort of benefits are they

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.020 
people what sort of benefits are they
getting<00:04:38.120> from

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
getting from

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.020 
getting from
and<00:04:39.200> what<00:04:40.200> do<00:04:40.350> we<00:04:40.500> need<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:41.040> put<00:04:41.340> around<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
and what do we need to put around the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.330 
and what do we need to put around the
sport<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.960> give<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.350> best<00:04:43.380> chance<00:04:43.950> of

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
sport to give it the best chance of

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.370 
sport to give it the best chance of
being<00:04:44.790> something<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.450> young<00:04:45.840> people<00:04:46.020> want
