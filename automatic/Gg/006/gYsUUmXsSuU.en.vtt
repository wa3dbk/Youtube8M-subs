the<00:00:12.960> story<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.590> far<00:00:14.420> all<00:00:15.420> substances<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.680> all

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the story so far all substances in all

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.220 
the story so far all substances in all
three<00:00:17.340> states<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.760> matter<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:18.300> made<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:19.080> of

three states of matter are made up of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.460 
three states of matter are made up of
little<00:00:19.439> round<00:00:19.770> things<00:00:20.160> called<00:00:20.610> atoms<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.930> pure

metals all the atoms are arranged
separately<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> individually<00:00:26.270> but<00:00:27.270> in<00:00:27.390> most

what's<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.400> smallest<00:00:40.760> thing<00:00:41.180> you<00:00:41.690> can<00:00:41.870> think

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
what's the smallest thing you can think

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.630 
what's the smallest thing you can think
of<00:00:42.260> a<00:00:42.700> fleet<00:00:43.900> yes<00:00:44.900> that's<00:00:45.170> pretty<00:00:45.320> small<00:00:45.650> but

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
of a fleet yes that's pretty small but

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.370 
of a fleet yes that's pretty small but
if<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:46.760> put<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.060> flea<00:00:47.300> under<00:00:47.750> even<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.200> most

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
if you put a flea under even the most

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.190 
if you put a flea under even the most
powerful<00:00:48.710> microscope<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.910> world<00:00:50.200> you

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
powerful microscope in the world you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.780 
powerful microscope in the world you
still<00:00:51.590> wouldn't<00:00:51.980> be<00:00:52.100> able<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.520> see<00:00:52.670> the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
still wouldn't be able to see the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.720 
still wouldn't be able to see the
molecules<00:00:53.330> that<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.810> fleas<00:00:54.050> made<00:00:54.440> up<00:00:54.730> let

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
molecules that the fleas made up let

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.670 
molecules that the fleas made up let
alone<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.270> atoms<00:00:56.630> that<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.900> molecules<00:00:57.410> are

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
alone the atoms that the molecules are

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.410 
alone the atoms that the molecules are
made<00:00:57.890> of

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
in fact atoms are so incredibly tiny

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.030 
in fact atoms are so incredibly tiny
that<00:01:02.750> from<00:01:02.960> their<00:01:03.170> point<00:01:03.410> of<00:01:03.560> view

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
that from their point of view

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.590 
that from their point of view
you're<00:01:04.940> an<00:01:05.180> unbelievably<00:01:06.170> enormous<00:01:06.830> giant

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
you're an unbelievably enormous giant

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.940 
you're an unbelievably enormous giant
that<00:01:08.600> makes<00:01:08.900> you<00:01:09.020> feel<00:01:09.200> pretty<00:01:09.410> big<00:01:09.680> doesn't

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
that makes you feel pretty big doesn't

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.520 
that makes you feel pretty big doesn't
it<00:01:10.240> hmm<00:01:11.330> but<00:01:11.510> if<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:11.750> look<00:01:11.960> up<00:01:12.110> at<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.350> night

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
it hmm but if you look up at the night

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.430 
it hmm but if you look up at the night
sky<00:01:12.850> you'll<00:01:13.850> see<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.479> there<00:01:14.690> are<00:01:14.720> thousands

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
sky you'll see that there are thousands

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.160 
sky you'll see that there are thousands
of<00:01:15.560> other<00:01:15.740> worlds<00:01:16.280> up<00:01:16.400> there<00:01:16.690> from<00:01:17.690> your<00:01:17.900> point

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
of other worlds up there from your point

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.680 
of other worlds up there from your point
of<00:01:18.260> view<00:01:18.340> there<00:01:19.340> are<00:01:19.460> no<00:01:19.640> bigger<00:01:19.970> than<00:01:20.090> tiny

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
of view there are no bigger than tiny

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.150 
of view there are no bigger than tiny
pinheads<00:01:22.540> but<00:01:23.540> from<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.869> point<00:01:24.110> of<00:01:24.229> view<00:01:24.500> of

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
pinheads but from the point of view of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:34.719 
pinheads but from the point of view of
someone<00:01:25.580> on<00:01:26.090> one<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.050> those<00:01:27.260> other<00:01:27.560> worlds<00:01:33.729> the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
someone on one of those other worlds the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.440 
someone on one of those other worlds the
planet<00:01:35.150> would<00:01:35.750> look<00:01:35.960> like<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> tiny<00:01:36.530> pinhead

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
planet would look like a tiny pinhead

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.930 
planet would look like a tiny pinhead
and<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:38.990> yourself<00:01:39.560> wouldn't<00:01:40.340> be<00:01:40.430> visible<00:01:40.610> at

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
and you yourself wouldn't be visible at

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.440 
and you yourself wouldn't be visible at
all<00:01:41.090> even<00:01:41.450> through<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.960> largest<00:01:42.350> telescope

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
all even through the largest telescope

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.940 
all even through the largest telescope
it<00:01:44.450> would<00:01:44.630> be<00:01:44.810> as<00:01:44.960> if<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.259> were<00:01:45.380> no<00:01:45.649> bigger

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
it would be as if you were no bigger

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.540 
it would be as if you were no bigger
than<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.820> atoms<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.509> fleet<00:01:48.550> but

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
than one of the atoms in that fleet but

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.190 
than one of the atoms in that fleet but
just<00:01:49.880> as<00:01:50.000> there's<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.270> lot<00:01:50.570> more<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:50.990> than

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
just as there's a lot more to you than

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.219 
just as there's a lot more to you than
someone<00:01:51.890> on<00:01:52.160> another<00:01:52.429> world<00:01:52.670> might<00:01:52.970> think<00:01:53.330> so

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
someone on another world might think so

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.440 
someone on another world might think so
there's<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.590> lot<00:01:54.860> more<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.429> atoms<00:01:55.880> than<00:01:56.179> you

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
there's a lot more to atoms than you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.290 
there's a lot more to atoms than you
might<00:01:56.720> think<00:01:57.880> scientists<00:01:58.880> have<00:01:58.970> tried<00:01:59.240> to

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
might think scientists have tried to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.570 
might think scientists have tried to
imagine<00:02:00.020> what<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.350> might<00:02:00.560> see<00:02:00.890> if<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.399> could

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
imagine what you might see if you could

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.779 
imagine what you might see if you could
ever<00:02:01.850> come<00:02:02.119> face-to-face<00:02:02.479> with<00:02:02.960> an<00:02:03.350> atom

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
ever come face-to-face with an atom

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.370 
ever come face-to-face with an atom
here's<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:05.060> simplest<00:02:05.569> model<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.229> they've

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
here's the simplest model that they've

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.490 
here's the simplest model that they've
come<00:02:06.619> up<00:02:06.740> with<00:02:07.479> your<00:02:08.479> first<00:02:08.810> impression<00:02:09.319> might

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
come up with your first impression might

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.550 
come up with your first impression might
be<00:02:09.710> that<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.220> just<00:02:10.550> seen<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> ghost

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
be that you just seen a ghost

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.430 
be that you just seen a ghost
since<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.680> could<00:02:12.890> walk<00:02:13.160> right<00:02:13.400> through<00:02:13.610> it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
since you could walk right through it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.530 
since you could walk right through it
this<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.500> because<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.310> atom<00:02:16.730> consists<00:02:17.360> mainly
