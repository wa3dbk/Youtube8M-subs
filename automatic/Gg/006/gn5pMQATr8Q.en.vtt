S duos phone this one though is coming
with<00:00:15.000> ice-cream<00:00:15.719> sandwich<00:00:16.350> which<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.680> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
with ice-cream sandwich which is a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.650 
with ice-cream sandwich which is a
little<00:00:17.100> bit<00:00:17.190> slow<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:17.850> some<00:00:18.119> new<00:00:18.270> galaxy

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
little bit slow we have some new galaxy

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.090 
little bit slow we have some new galaxy
print<00:00:18.840> phones<00:00:19.109> coming<00:00:19.380> up<00:00:19.590> now<00:00:19.770> like<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
print phones coming up now like the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.090 
print phones coming up now like the
galaxy<00:00:20.490> trend<00:00:20.789> light<00:00:21.439> and<00:00:22.439> some<00:00:22.949> other

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
galaxy trend light and some other

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.679 
galaxy trend light and some other
devices<00:00:23.279> that's<00:00:23.789> coming<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
devices that's coming out now on the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.740 
devices that's coming out now on the
market<00:00:25.340> but<00:00:26.340> Ice<00:00:26.550> Cream<00:00:26.730> Sandwich<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.359> really

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
market but Ice Cream Sandwich is really

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.019 
market but Ice Cream Sandwich is really
not<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> impressive<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:29.460> pretty<00:00:29.789> poor

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
not that impressive it's pretty poor

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.269 
not that impressive it's pretty poor
actually<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.810> only<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> single<00:00:32.040> core

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
actually and only a single core

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.000 
actually and only a single core
processor<00:00:33.140> which<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.170> definitely<00:00:34.469> kind<00:00:34.890> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
processor which is definitely kind of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
processor which is definitely kind of
slow<00:00:37.100> versus<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> Galaxy<00:00:38.700> core<00:00:38.910> plus<00:00:39.180> here

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
slow versus the Galaxy core plus here

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600 
slow versus the Galaxy core plus here
which<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> having<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.710> dual-core<00:00:41.100> processor

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
which is having a dual-core processor

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.279 
which is having a dual-core processor
called<00:00:41.850> M<00:00:42.000> over<00:00:42.210> 2<00:00:42.360> gigahertz<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:45.289> an

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
called M over 2 gigahertz and then an

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.770 
called M over 2 gigahertz and then an
Android<00:00:46.770> 4.2.2<00:00:47.460> jelly<00:00:47.579> bean<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.629> not

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
Android 4.2.2 jelly bean which is not

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.590 
Android 4.2.2 jelly bean which is not
slate<00:00:48.989> fashion<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.410> Android<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:51.059> definitely

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
slate fashion on Android but definitely

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.880 
slate fashion on Android but definitely
the<00:00:51.809> Burberry<00:00:52.140> improved<00:00:52.879> version<00:00:57.890> that's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the Burberry improved version that's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.520 
the Burberry improved version that's
pretty<00:00:59.160> cool<00:00:59.309> okay<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
pretty cool okay so you just want to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.979 
pretty cool okay so you just want to
boot<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.770> down<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.690> see<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.840> we're

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
boot them down here and see if we're

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.240 
boot them down here and see if we're
gonna<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> big<00:01:04.470> difference<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:04.979> we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
gonna see a big difference I think we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.480 
gonna see a big difference I think we
should<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> big<00:01:05.880> difference

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.870 

definitely<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.540> galaxy<00:01:14.900> corbels<00:01:15.320> should<00:01:15.560> be

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
definitely the galaxy corbels should be

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:26.500 
definitely the galaxy corbels should be
quicker<00:01:16.880> here<00:01:17.330> way<00:01:17.870> faster<00:01:24.550> yes<00:01:25.550> as<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.240> wicked

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
quicker here way faster yes as to wicked

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.200 
quicker here way faster yes as to wicked
here<00:01:26.750> they're<00:01:26.990> also<00:01:27.520> only<00:01:28.520> sound<00:01:28.820> it's
