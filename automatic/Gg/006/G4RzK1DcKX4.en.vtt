lot of gray on happy owners
and<00:00:09.670> we<00:00:09.850> thought<00:00:10.060> we<00:00:10.240> had<00:00:10.390> made<00:00:10.540> a<00:00:10.600> mistake<00:00:10.750> how

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
and we thought we had made a mistake how

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.960 
and we thought we had made a mistake how
can<00:00:11.650> you<00:00:11.770> treat<00:00:11.980> a<00:00:12.040> disease<00:00:12.250> and<00:00:12.730> get<00:00:12.850> it

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.970 
can you treat a disease and get it

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.700 
can you treat a disease and get it
better<00:00:13.120> in<00:00:13.360> 12<00:00:13.570> to<00:00:13.690> 24<00:00:14.110> hours<00:00:14.140> well<00:00:14.560> that's

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 
better in 12 to 24 hours well that's

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.450 
better in 12 to 24 hours well that's
virtually<00:00:14.980> impossible<00:00:15.419> and<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.619> realization

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
virtually impossible and the realization

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.069 
virtually impossible and the realization
hit<00:00:18.699> us<00:00:18.849> that<00:00:19.089> we<00:00:19.240> had<00:00:19.390> something<00:00:19.659> that<00:00:19.929> was

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:20.079 
hit us that we had something that was

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.529 
hit us that we had something that was
different<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.400> was<00:00:21.609> a<00:00:21.640> material<00:00:22.060> that<00:00:22.359> was

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
different this was a material that was

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.390
