first thing I've been loving has been by

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
first thing I've been loving has been by
Weller<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.680> their<00:00:46.860> elements

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.790 
Weller and this is their elements
renewing<00:00:47.969> shampoo<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:49.140> basically<00:00:49.500> has<00:00:49.770> no

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
renewing shampoo this basically has no

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010 
renewing shampoo this basically has no
parabens<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.789> no<00:00:50.879> sulfates<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
parabens and no sulfates and that's the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
parabens and no sulfates and that's the
most<00:00:52.320> important<00:00:52.860> thing<00:00:52.920> when<00:00:53.610> you're<00:00:53.760> using

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
most important thing when you're using

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
most important thing when you're using
shampoo<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.809> hair<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.500> has<00:00:55.649> extensions<00:00:56.039> in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
shampoo on hair that has extensions in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.639 
shampoo on hair that has extensions in
because<00:00:56.910> basically<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> damage

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
because basically it can kind of damage

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.410 
because basically it can kind of damage
them<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.980> also<00:00:59.100> make<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.579> loosen<00:01:00.030> from<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
them and also make them loosen from the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
them and also make them loosen from the
scalp<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.899> all<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> rest<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.469> I've<00:01:01.590> had

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
scalp and all the rest of it I've had

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
scalp and all the rest of it I've had
like<00:01:01.859> bombs<00:01:02.190> button<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.750> just

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
like bombs button and so it can just

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
like bombs button and so it can just
sort<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.080> loosen<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.250> really

afterwards<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.459> hold<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.880> place<00:02:33.910> this<00:02:34.750> does

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
afterwards to hold it in place this does

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.259 
afterwards to hold it in place this does
smells<00:02:35.290> incredible<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.880> only<00:02:36.970> thing<00:02:37.090> I

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
smells incredible and the only thing I

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.850 
smells incredible and the only thing I
say<00:02:37.450> would<00:02:37.780> be<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.410> be<00:02:38.620> really

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
say would be to really be really

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.280 
say would be to really be really
important<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:40.330> not<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.690> use<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.900> sort<00:02:41.260> of

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
important it's not to use it sort of

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.780 
important it's not to use it sort of
maybe<00:02:41.530> every<00:02:41.860> day<00:02:42.010> because<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.310> find<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.670> it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
maybe every day because I find that it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.670 
maybe every day because I find that it
kind<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:42.970> builds<00:02:43.150> up<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.540> my<00:02:43.720> hair<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.440> if<00:02:44.530> I'm

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
kind of builds up on my hair but if I'm

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.440 
kind of builds up on my hair but if I'm
just<00:02:44.980> sort<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.280> curling<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.880> every<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.269> often

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
just sort of curling it every so often

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.720 
just sort of curling it every so often
this<00:02:47.080> really<00:02:47.650> helps<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.130> hold<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.489> in<00:02:48.580> place

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
this really helps to hold it in place

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.949 
this really helps to hold it in place
and<00:02:48.849> as<00:02:49.120> long<00:02:49.239> as<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.480> brush<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.750> through

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
and as long as you brush it through

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.720 
and as long as you brush it through
afterwards<00:02:50.650> you're<00:02:51.040> not<00:02:51.220> going<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.489> have<00:02:51.700> that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
afterwards you're not going to have that

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.520 
afterwards you're not going to have that
buildup<00:02:52.299> of<00:02:52.450> product<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.900> your<00:02:52.930> hair<00:02:53.049> which<00:02:53.380> is

with exfoliator like mental because

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.879 
with exfoliator like mental because
obviously<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:44.170> quite<00:03:44.319> harsh<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.859> skin

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889

anyway<00:03:45.579> if<00:03:45.730> you've<00:03:45.850> got<00:03:46.030> exfoliating<00:03:46.989> beads

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
anyway if you've got exfoliating beads

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.840 
anyway if you've got exfoliating beads
in<00:03:47.470> there<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:48.040> do<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:48.430> be<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.549> little<00:03:48.639> bit

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
in there so do just be a little bit

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.069 
in there so do just be a little bit
careful<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.299> all<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.480> think<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.840> has<00:03:49.900> like

careful this all I think it has like
crystals<00:03:50.590> or<00:03:50.799> something<00:03:51.160> in<00:03:51.280> there<00:03:51.459> but<00:03:52.090> it's

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
crystals or something in there but it's

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.210 
crystals or something in there but it's
meant<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.630> add<00:03:52.750> hydration<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.799> just<00:03:54.100> make

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
have seen this in a couple of my like

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.969 
have seen this in a couple of my like
spring<00:04:44.720> makeup<00:04:45.080> videos<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.650> stuff<00:04:45.770> like<00:04:45.889> that

spring makeup videos and stuff like that

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.670 
spring makeup videos and stuff like that
and<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:47.030> is<00:04:47.210> by<00:04:47.419> Gaia<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:48.260> think<00:04:48.470> that's<00:04:48.590> how

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
and this is by Gaia I think that's how

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.460 
and this is by Gaia I think that's how
you<00:04:48.710> spell<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:49.150> gayaa<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:51.080> basically

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
you spell it gayaa and this is basically

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.100 
you spell it gayaa and this is basically
like<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.770> fan<00:04:52.160> brush<00:04:52.400> now<00:04:53.000> this<00:04:53.449> I<00:04:53.630> use<00:04:53.660> when<00:04:53.990> I'm

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
like a fan brush now this I use when I'm

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.260 
like a fan brush now this I use when I'm
doing<00:04:54.260> highlighting<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.729> just<00:04:56.060> kind<00:04:56.240> of
