base<00:00:10.080> stats<00:00:10.469> like<00:00:10.889> what<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:12.389> have

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
base stats like what is this we have

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.990 
base stats like what is this we have
high<00:00:13.349> amount<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.710> attack<00:00:13.950> high<00:00:14.549> amount<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.849> hit

high amount of attack high amount of hit

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.450 
high amount of attack high amount of hit
points<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.049> same<00:00:16.379> special<00:00:16.890> attack<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
points in the same special attack and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.880 
points in the same special attack and
then<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.300> decent<00:00:18.900> defense<00:00:18.990> okay

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
then you know decent defense okay

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.620 
then you know decent defense okay
special<00:00:20.160> defense<00:00:20.490> bad<00:00:20.850> speed<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.390> overall

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
special defense bad speed but overall

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.359 
special defense bad speed but overall
that's<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> weird<00:00:22.320> stature<00:00:22.710> severe<00:00:23.220> soon

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that's like a weird stature severe soon

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.920 
that's like a weird stature severe soon
that<00:00:23.730> actually<00:00:24.029> seems<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.660> would<00:00:24.720> make<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that actually seems like it would make a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929 
that actually seems like it would make a
strong<00:00:25.199> Pokemon<00:00:25.800> look<00:00:26.340> yeah<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.609> typing

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
strong Pokemon look yeah it's typing

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.120 
strong Pokemon look yeah it's typing
it's<00:00:27.060> grass<00:00:27.300> sidekick<00:00:28.109> which<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.949> takes

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
it's grass sidekick which kind of takes

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580 
it's grass sidekick which kind of takes
away<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.760> its<00:00:29.910> strength<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.380> look

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
away all of its strength because we look

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.220 
away all of its strength because we look
at<00:00:31.710> weaknesses<00:00:32.309> its<00:00:32.520> weak<00:00:33.210> too<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
at weaknesses its weak too a lot of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
at weaknesses its weak too a lot of
things<00:00:34.469> flying<00:00:35.070> poison<00:00:35.520> bug<00:00:35.700> goes<00:00:35.940> fire<00:00:36.239> ice

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
things flying poison bug goes fire ice

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.209 
things flying poison bug goes fire ice
and<00:00:36.660> dark<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.680> does<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> lot<00:00:38.190> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
and dark it does have a lot of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.650 
and dark it does have a lot of
resistances<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.030> pretty<00:00:39.239> much<00:00:39.450> you're

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
resistances but pretty much you're

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.479 
resistances but pretty much you're
either<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> hit<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.739> hit<00:00:40.890> super<00:00:41.280> or

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
either going to hit get hit super or

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.069 
either going to hit get hit super or
you're<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.239> hit<00:00:42.420> neutral<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you're going to get hit neutral and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.200 
you're going to get hit neutral and
that's<00:00:43.379> generally<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.340> good<00:00:44.489> thing<00:00:44.850> when

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that's generally not a good thing when

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
that's generally not a good thing when
you're<00:00:45.360> making<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.690> tanky<00:00:45.989> pokemon<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.770> if

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you're making a tanky pokemon but if

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
you're making a tanky pokemon but if
you're<00:00:46.950> valuing<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.789> sweeper<00:00:48.270> aspect

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you're valuing it from a sweeper aspect

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.529 
you're valuing it from a sweeper aspect
can<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.289> rather<00:00:49.590> strong<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.700> found<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.300> lot

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
can be rather strong and I found a lot

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
can be rather strong and I found a lot
of<00:00:51.570> strengths<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.110> his<00:00:52.230> executor<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.070> was

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of strengths with his executor I was

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.250 
of strengths with his executor I was
surprised<00:00:53.640> by<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.300> strategy<00:00:54.690> diversity

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
surprised by all the strategy diversity

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260 
surprised by all the strategy diversity
in<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> has<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.309> let's<00:00:56.520> hop<00:00:56.670> into<00:00:56.940> Pokemon

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
in that it has so let's hop into Pokemon

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.910 
in that it has so let's hop into Pokemon
showdown<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.930> figure<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.500> works

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
showdown and figure out how it works

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.639 
showdown and figure out how it works
so<00:00:59.309> executor<00:01:00.030> surprising<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.020> made<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
so executor surprising it's made up of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
so executor surprising it's made up of
sweet<00:01:01.920> bad<00:01:02.219> all<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.640> little<00:01:02.910> froggy<00:01:03.239> stuff

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600

the trick room set up and then just kind

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.120 
the trick room set up and then just kind
of<00:02:13.510> do<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> lot<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:14.020> crazy<00:02:14.290> things<00:02:14.410> about<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:15.010> and

harvest<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.180> pretty<00:02:16.390> much<00:02:16.480> go<00:02:16.600> make<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.810> square

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990

if they can't one hit ko you you could

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.760

probably<00:02:19.540> knock<00:02:19.780> them<00:02:19.990> out<00:02:20.080> or<00:02:20.319> at<00:02:20.410> least<00:02:20.590> just

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
probably knock them out or at least just

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.740 
probably knock them out or at least just
out<00:02:20.980> sustain<00:02:21.370> them<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:22.000> does<00:02:22.209> take<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> good

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
out sustain them that does take a good

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.600 
out sustain them that does take a good
amount<00:02:22.959> turns<00:02:23.260> because<00:02:23.620> we've<00:02:24.100> seen<00:02:24.340> as<00:02:24.489> only

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
1/8 infestation is only 1/6 I believe so

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.820 
1/8 infestation is only 1/6 I believe so
it<00:02:28.630> could<00:02:28.840> take<00:02:28.870> some<00:02:29.170> time<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.620> instead

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830
