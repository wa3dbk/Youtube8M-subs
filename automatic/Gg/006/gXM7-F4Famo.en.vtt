00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 you hi guys 50 new videos 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.500
 I hope you are well me it 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.849
 quietly 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.759
 so we end up in mm on strike 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.230
 area and still small so to the subscriber 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.839
 hour badge so this is one of the cases but 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.580
 chooses us the hottest at 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.640
 ass in fact to do it you already have 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.500
 at the beginning more micron was all red and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.090
 it still has it here again at 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340
 least I had four five passages where 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.260
 I'm really hot 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.939
 and so here is in the face it's still 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.740
 and he played well duels and I 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.809
 maybe I was lucky at 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.850
 connection level so surely 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.649
 surely in the part I knew 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 advantage of the connection for once 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.180
 but it's nice in any case without it 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.710
 I would not have this gameplay and so that's it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.910
 our little water is not saying 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 that he is a very very good harmony 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.770
 if migrants cap large cape referred 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.300
 reflex so considering that ten years ago a 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 silencer on it can we can 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.309
 favor others more 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.030
 accessories 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.579
 after they are people who put handful 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.590
 hours a big cape handle it depends 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.989
 but I prefer to put the reflexes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.400
 and large capes by far this is not necessary 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.159
 do Info nag the foutiez 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 blow by blow must not make nag and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.760
 a moment that it goes alone and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.619
 close she is really really very 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.450
 very very deadly 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.159
 so here for September so solo 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.869
 if it's important to specify anyway 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.030
 because obviously have you will 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.470
 even you can tell your friends stopped 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.689
 he stopped kiel emotions series 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.250
 1 me you decide nothing so it's 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.560
 how domination you decide not 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.810
 to have b to have these two leash 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 positive and it is to make the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.380
 part so that's why it's very 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.210
 different children when I say solo 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.210
 it is with one or two people maximum 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.000
 on that that's what is sure that after 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.020
 six is ​​not the same 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.149
 So that's a bit of a pity 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.009
 in this kids dance is that we can 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.409
 is not such as black ops I 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.049
 think that seemed like that anyway 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.829
 I search so there you see again 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.960
 all red red 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.039
 short so on black ops but I 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.109
 believe it's still dofes with 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.939
 all the weapons that it's solo in 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.219
 group are 6 4 with his cards with 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.219
 all the weapons I was looking for maha 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.179
 fonfon but that's the look I have 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.829
 the luck on the mini map is 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.599
 almost no one as an assassin maybe 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.459
 just a person it's pretty rare 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.040
 because even the small levels the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.690
 level below 10 they already have there 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.480
 all this is incredible 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.420
 this asset is time to like 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.890
 past players this is the miraculous asset 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.870
 who will not describe me not put them at all 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.360
 actually because me on this I play 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.840
 even more in case my cousin there the one who 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.819
 appeared in the video scene he fights 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.030
 like as human when a fold has so 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.530
 so 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.739
 so here I am what I said in 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.359
 more well it's you that it's not it 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.859
 that will help you in this game so I 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.410
 the play without drones etc 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.430
 because I know that even meaning there 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.680
 had something that I like 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.420
 the sonar asset so when you do a 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.090
 kill at the place or do it there 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.010
 a little a little sonar that sweeps the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.230
 card and that can allow to detect the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.040
 enemy players possibly Swiss to 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.660
 sanaa everything from the phew 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.400
 Well, yes, it is an asset of my 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.680
 camp finally half of the guys who are at 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.000
 his sister is an asset that will be nothing and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.590
 so that's like with two lynxes 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.269
 the small marks and rouch and by a 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.090
 pressure that it is well efficient 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.709
 huh when we chained enemies view 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.910
 who already very very low health I 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.000
 do not see too much interest in seeing you there 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.919
 this rotten time in this place there for 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.019
 Last 3-4 they to ensure my cam 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.549
 for not enriched stupid especially on 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.889
 strike zone here it does not matter you go 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.730
 there you see where I am I can die 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.380
 anywhere spawns 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.950
 lesponne especially on this map seen 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.359
 she is small 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.319
 either these fairs and GEIQ on 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.400
 big cards he can not do 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.190
 spawn bonds then on small 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.650
 cards you imagine that it wants it fun 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.060
 in the back so here's the video itself 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.290
 coming to an end so I repeat again 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.669
 once there is just this map that is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.560
 destructible with acca 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.880
 it's right on this one that you 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.739
 can really have the truth that she 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.760
 likes in the package for those who 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.410
 were not aware 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.970
 here are the guys I leave you on the end 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.500
 of the video do not hesitate to like a 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.510
 commented I wish you a good 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.760
 evening two bombs will not survive 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.760
 mission accomplished my ear
