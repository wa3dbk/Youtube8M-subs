00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
responsive so I'm not too concerned to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
responsive so I'm not too concerned to
be<00:00:42.719> honest<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.070> flip<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.460> around<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
be honest if you flip it around on the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
be honest if you flip it around on the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
smaller cousin to the phone we just

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.760 
smaller cousin to the phone we just
looked<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.460> has<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.170> 3.5<00:01:40.170> inch
