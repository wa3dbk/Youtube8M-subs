00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.239
 the first real choice with a seat 0 0 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.640
 was made by Martin Verkerk in 1961 under the eyes of journalists and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.649
 American observers are of origin and pulled the protective curtain 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.649
 of your face requirement to more than 90 meters 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.150
 the image of the seat 0 0 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
 was the installation of a rocket under the seat 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.560
 once the dictator's pilot was out of the plane 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.390
 it was understood a rocket engine 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.810
 accelerating the pilot to a height sufficient for the parachute 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.810
 work properly 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.550
 this type of seat was especially well received by the pilots of 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.510
 aircraft carrier 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.410
 who were at special risk of engine failure during pitches 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.480
 catapult 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.080
 to convince the guarantee pilots of the advantages of the new seat 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.960
 Martin Verkerk built a special test bench that was launched 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.590
 from an aircraft carrier 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.860
 it is not strange that the Martin Becker seats have become elements 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.660
 fixed aircraft of the US Navy 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.979
 including goods as recent as him this 18 days 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.419
 fierce seats but manufactured by firms such as the British Martin 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.510
 verkerk by the 11 thousand and gray hair he killed to notice those that are salt 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.419
 have become a basic ingredient of almost all systems of 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.419
 escape and modern fighter jets 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.029
 Let's take a look at how an ejection seat works 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.269
 when boarding the plane the pilot fastens with buckles and hooks a series of 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.269
 fastenings of the revolted costume 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:47.590
 enable 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.840
 these will be held down by the pilot's members roaming back from him 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.840
 up to the correct vertical position 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.399
 to act is the ejection system 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.829
 most of the current seats use a ring located between the 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 Pilot's legs oas well armrests 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.200
 in the seats of the 50s a protective curtain was used 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.799
 face 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.199
 located on the head 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.569
 but that was how time was lost and it was difficult to operate when the plane 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.299
 I was out of control 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.499
 When you pull the steering knob, a series of 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:25.969
 Actions 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.729
 the harnesses of the pilot's shoulders pull him back against the 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:30.639
 back 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.759
 reducing the risk of damage to the spine 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.709
 the arms legs are also stretched towards the seat 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.909
 to prevent them from hitting the cabin when injected I feel 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.579
 There are three ways to remove the ejection seat from the cabin 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.110
 in some airplanes the cover is expelled by an explosive charge 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:54.959
 in others 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.419
 the explosive cord incorporated in the cover itself cuts the plastic 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.739
 in other designs the ejection seat is powerful enough to 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.739
 go through the hard mexicanas 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:16.150
 after pulling the n-iia only two seconds pass until the pilot 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
 is outside the region 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.099
 then the rocket engine is understood 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.099
 and then the critical phase of the parachute begins 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 a small sleeve with ica is released 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.849
 the sleeve prevents the seat from turning over 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.259
 once the speed has been conveniently reduced 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.459
 the seat automatically releases the pilot's harnesses and pushes it apart 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.870
 saved the seat 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.050
 the main parachute begins to unfold 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.050
 a modern ejection system is more than just a parachute 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.800
 in case of splashdown it contains an emergency equipment with flotation system 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.629
 and survival supplies
