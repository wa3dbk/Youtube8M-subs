00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.930
 the least we can say is that it is indeed diminished not been 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.629
 heard 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.700
 oil prices rose from 4 to 98 date at which had a lack more 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.519
 than simple ones adapted so that all these fluctuations or even not that 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.519
 it's dragging its feet it's secondary 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.279
 that's where I understand with the purchase of five people 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.259
 the room facing the board room the program among others 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.330
 for two years the cost of our tobacco grocery cart is growing faster than 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.640
 inflation 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.110
 laying the price of gasoline corn production to make 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.870
 ethanol 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 and poor harvests are the main culprits 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.030
 in this fight 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.250
 started the production season in 2008 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.290
 was there a world reserve of wheat 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.150
 l outside or last 30 years 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.500
 there was an additional pressure blasted by the government but that is 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.530
 in this way the Canadian government 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.719
 to production 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.710
 of ethanol so from corn the fact that one produces sports notebook 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.789
 make ethanol 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.410
 has therefore caused a rise of almost 50% in the price of corn for consumption 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.720
 and corn and everywhere 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.320
 we think that the bayer is used for animal feed that it serves to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.320
 the human food at the shepherd's pie it's serving the cereal beard 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.160
 the morning 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.110
 but it's a lot more than that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 giving up for example in this debate because you have 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.770
 90% of cows' balloons that are held in Canada contain early fire that fire 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.810
 early this fall under corn hand seals 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.680
 wheat has increased it by 75% 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.700
 which has had an impact on the price of many foods 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.719
 the predictions the face to the inter it are the products that contain 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.399
 cereals 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.540
 poorly prepared data and potatoes 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 flour prices argue 44% 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.300
 as a result the country has passed him from $ 6 1 to $ 39 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.630
 the bunny paws bucks 2 to 1 $ 51 points 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.949
 and sometimes instead of increasing the price we reduce the format of the products 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.519
 but not entirely 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.689
 it decreases the amount 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.889
 we even have his life to death drop to 5 5% as early as mid-November 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.479
 weird but I still think and if the union scheduled an equal place 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.039
 the scene 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.269
 on the side of fruits and vegetables it is more expensive because of the rise 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.259
 petrol 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:31.149
 this fuel is used for transportation but also for the production of fertilizers and 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.479
 pesticides and packaging 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.720
 in the capital 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.759
 public services a lot 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:42.259
 enough of what apple and and our champion here in quebec but it remains 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.970
 to heart there also percent having increased the blow of the attacks 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.430
 the implementation of transport costs of the increase in the cost of energy 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.879
 result kilos per month increased by 31% 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.230
 the same is true for imported fruits such as bananas that have undergone 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.749
 17% increase from $ 19 to $ 40 per kilogram 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.310
 because here it is this rock trend that is the major element because 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.829
 this measure becomes south america 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.180
 other sectors are less affected is the case of milk and helmsman whose 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.939
 prices are regulated by 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.309
 on the meat side, beef has not risen by an average of 4% 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.739
 the chicken two goals for that 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.579
 the meat was really bad 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.549
 the road 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.049
 it was the cheapest move of the dj decline even banal president of the 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.959
 pork meat 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.529
 and if the price of pork has gone down is that the fed was bigger than the 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:36.559
 death 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:40.049
 despite everything because of the fierce competition that the 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.379
 food giants the cost of our grocery basket has increased 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.939
 than 5% is still one of the cheapest on the planet 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:48.910
 on average 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.040
 Canadian families now spend $ 135 a week rather than 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.459
 $ 5 29 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.139
 but turnaround of situation at the end of 2008 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.699
 the cost of gasoline drops along with the dollar and the economy 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.479
 world enters recession 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.999
 the price of food should logically also fall in 2009 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.269
 not necessarily say the experts 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.920
 daniel directory and director for north america's biggest 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:13.680
 business 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.919
 vegetable canning in mans 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.759
 but there are times where bling 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.269
 % ytd not a sport is not the picture do not think about your masks the statues 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.529
 why quality in July 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.680
 and in the month of July in the Bahamas at school 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.260
 Santa Claus has gone from beautiful 60s by access it was at 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.319
 maximum 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.139
 when to get out and people to reap cost of his navy 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.680
 it was quite high this summer so that today we have 

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:42.069
 devices with high costs 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.719
 going through the reverse to have subscriber benefits for this 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.160
 to do there marine life 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.900
 the bottom of the box 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.270
 to even mater in a flash of 50 percent 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.319
 she has France notice to the amateurs 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.419
 we do not have everything the auto industry the state of the field discuss 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.660
 but these two models with holidays to my share of steel a year ago in 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.230
 the stove in steel today 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.020
 in these assessments in addition to the high pressure 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.610
 ervin santana base 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.400
 they decided to go out of their way to get my passion for my box 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.789
 canned 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.180
 other factor for imported products the fall of the Canadian dollar 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.449
 cancel the positive effects of the recent drop in the price of gasoline 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.290
 because ballard went from 'aa1' dallas to 4 to 24 mdse 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.300
 for canadians who buy a product that is united states 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.569
 that's 25 for his adaptation 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.689
 7 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.089
 we will have to contend with new price increases 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.569
 so expect response back to a laptop during 2009 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.150
 to price increases in food coming out of three years 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.180
 between 5 and 6% 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.590
 I'd like to go budget spent on food is the equivalent of 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.449
 press 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.669
 because it has been found by year what is done seriously the point of 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.779
 departure from this text as rent electricity she phone to m 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:04.289
 so I pick them up alesian marl customers who will make some 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.189
 concessions its news about the quality of these defeats 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.389
 but remember what always costs less is to plan 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.569
 and make your own meals 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.840
 in control the coup on control taste and in control the quality
