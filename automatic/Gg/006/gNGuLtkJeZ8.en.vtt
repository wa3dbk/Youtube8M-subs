road everyone thought that Howard it sat

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.620 
road everyone thought that Howard it sat
there<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:53.939> being<00:01:54.149> selfish

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
there because he was being selfish

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.700 
there because he was being selfish
because<00:01:55.460> he<00:01:56.460> wanted<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> most<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.899> know<00:01:57.990> room

because he wanted the most you know room

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.310 
because he wanted the most you know room
because<00:01:59.100> he's<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> biggest<00:01:59.549> guy<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:01.229> know

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
because he's the biggest guy you know

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200

Piper<00:02:01.799> was<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.490> about<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:03.090> that's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
Piper was going on about but that's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.030 
Piper was going on about but that's
supposed<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.990> king<00:02:04.290> seat<00:02:04.710> I'm

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
supposed to be like the king seat I'm

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.639 
supposed to be like the king seat I'm
guessing<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.939> Piper<00:02:06.469> probably<00:02:07.469> thought

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
guessing that Piper probably thought

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.080 
guessing that Piper probably thought
that<00:02:07.710> he<00:02:08.129> should<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.369> been<00:02:08.520> sitting<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
that he should have been sitting in that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.360 
that he should have been sitting in that
seat<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:10.259> he<00:02:10.560> was<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> guy<00:02:10.979> who<00:02:11.009> was

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
seat because he was the guy who was

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.870 
seat because he was the guy who was
probably<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.849> biggest<00:02:12.270> name

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
probably the biggest name

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.870 
probably the biggest name
of<00:02:13.030> anybody<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.200> on<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.410> show<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.730> when
