00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.770 
interest will equal annual revenue
in<00:04:00.150> 2017<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.950> basically<00:04:02.370> that's<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.569> point

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
in 2017 so basically that's the point

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.410 
in 2017 so basically that's the point
when<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.319> interest<00:04:04.560> on<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.740> debt<00:04:05.180> can<00:04:06.180> be<00:04:06.209> put

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
when the interest on the debt can be put

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.880 
when the interest on the debt can be put
aside<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.900> basically<00:04:07.080> in<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.470> next<00:04:07.709> six

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
aside and that basically in the next six

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.400 
aside and that basically in the next six
years<00:04:08.120> new<00:04:09.120> spending<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.780> going<00:04:09.990> to<00:04:10.050> continue

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
years new spending is going to continue

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.890 
years new spending is going to continue
to<00:04:10.800> add<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.370> day<00:04:11.520> though<00:04:11.940> isn't<00:04:12.840> that

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
to add to the day though isn't that

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.809 
to add to the day though isn't that
adding<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.410> debt<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.830> mean<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.340> not<00:04:14.490> just

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
adding to the debt I mean it's not just

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.699 
adding to the debt I mean it's not just
interest<00:04:15.180> under<00:04:15.300> that<00:04:15.510> its<00:04:15.720> new<00:04:16.079> spending<00:04:16.500> in

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
interest under that its new spending in

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.259 
interest under that its new spending in
the<00:04:16.769> next<00:04:16.950> six<00:04:17.100> years<00:04:17.160> well<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:18.000> know<00:04:18.090> we
