00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.870
 people who want to play with the old 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.990

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.189
 the former ronaldo ronaldinho a team 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.609
 de France 98 a team from brazil 98 94 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.289
 and so on, so everything is possible 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.849
 can even create players so I 'm going 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.160
 to show you that as you could have 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.600
 see just small precision I do not like 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.770
 not use a lot of software on 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.690
 my pc so what I did was 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.190
 just price screenshots you 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.600
 do not worry it's not complicated 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 everything you see on this capture 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.350
 of screen there so I go to party or must 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 click and where to go for 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.610
 simply be able to download a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.270
 of his players so on the site of i and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.940
 ii you just have to type fifa 13 that's 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.109
 it's as stupid as that so as if 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.300
 you go on the flute app at 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.500
 worst of a guy apps and my 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.660
 mathematical soap opera profile you click 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.070
 on creation center they could have 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.670
 put creation center or center of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.530
 creation but we short we square 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.210
 so created there you can create players 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.409
 team or a tournament and if not you have 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.570

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.519
 stray player competition so zinedine 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.860
 zidane created on September 23, 2011 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.110
 like what the guy he did not lose any 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.430
 time to create his game I think that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.820
 it's even on those dates that the game is 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.799
 got out 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.650
 yeah to tell you that this is it 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.209
 harry his side the shock yes we're going 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.090
 never download it yes I do it on purpose 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.440
 on the other hand on the left it's 12 ha yeah he 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.660
 had written it jay reatard came out of 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.650
 game and we can get it on fifa 13 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.190
 while they come from the 12 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.870
 it's not bad listen I'm just going 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.820
 try to find yourself in the game 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.790
 then assign players to trade at 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.610
 any club is also in except 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.120
 that I have not taken my time to read a 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.810
 modified players player creation 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.780
 modified team 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.880
 according to me, we will be able to do that 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.030
 in our transfer 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.190
 we will find the old lady is a 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.810
 take a team at random like that then 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.600
 that I'm doing this hop did it or not I did not 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.810
 on purpose so sorry I think we 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.500
 will put zidane and then it'll find 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.200
 empty well here it is so we will send it 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.470
 to listen to the talent of madrid 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.770
 we will not speak for twelve to fourteen 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.480
 hours as they say you have your jeans 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.730
 eddine zidane in the real team of 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.020
 madrid to download a team this is 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.310
 same except that the team down I think 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.930
 not that he will need maintenance 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.080
 of our team not know so high if she 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 delirium it would be a little logical 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.150
 I'm just going to try to show you 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.680
 quickly what gives me I already have a 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.070
 little idea of ​​what makes a day of which 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.930
 90 in the lead who must have is this is 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.090
 not caricatures but it's the 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.380
 things that made their careers that 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.480
 will be highlighted above all in his 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.960
 I pass if you get to understand 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.240
 than what I want what I mean 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.820
 so if you want to put zidane in 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.900
 the arena is simple just go 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.370
 do a crisis management I guess 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.940
 to put on the ground so 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.900
 to learn in madrid yes tac and there it is necessary 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.950
 put it on the ground because if we 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.120
 do not put on the ground we will not be able 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.520
 select it for example for the game 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.930
 technical and so on cracking 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.850
 I fart blows people nice video 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.820
 it's a little late and maybe 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:19.540
 I stop people go there one day project 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.430
 and then I got stuck was the head that 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.150
 rots everything that is not so I stop my 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.650
 bullshit so because in addition I'm doing 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.030
 a tutorial of capital so often watched 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.510
 by other people that I like it came to 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.370
 your choice 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.320
 so if I start to leave in 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.020
 delusions that are on my chain not frozen 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.370
 a little in the beautiful the corner so I 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.230
 looking for technique that's the choice of 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.100
 player 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.930
 you saw I do it fast and everything 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.470
 I'm doing that fucking late t tac to the 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.870
 summer break 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.300
 see 99 of history to control the 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.320
 head sorting center 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.670
 it's a good caricature but the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.480
 damn good to note so me I you 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.260
 advise to take the players in 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.190
 the best schools and the best rated 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.780
 the teams I looked for a sheet 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.450
 france 1998 there were only three 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.820
 stars it makes me a little scared 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.140
 Well, here it is not necessarily thousandths 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.840
 faith I think we can not so 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.550
 on the site and we're just going to get 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.700
 in the arena for me he has five stars 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.170
 he has five stars he has great 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.740
 shoes too if you like it 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:26.030
 you respect the study and I can do it 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:27.560
 and and is good short I galley with 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:33.350
 zinedine we 're just going to leave on a 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:35.570
 thing to the voices it's a radar but 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.130
 he's a bastard he wanted to buy a 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.120
 thing finally you just have to 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.170
 launch games so if you want 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.900
 play with you can play in match in 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.580
 multi match but seasons daddy so 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.100
 I show you you can play against 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.410
 friends so thanks to the debate mode 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.660
 listen to season with friends it must be 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.270
 a trick of style awaits game modes 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.920
 online here is ring friendly matches and 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.830
 otherwise do custom match face to 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.930
 tac tac tac and there you go in 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.430
 a living room finally you come in the living room 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.480
 no but look there are 100 rankings 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.010
 and without classification ie 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.660
 can put any player you 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.100
 do you look for it and 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.410
 you will find an opponent 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.760
 and there will be a life so you see that 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.620
 with the 4th set of notes we see that I have 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.910
 zidane well short people it was just 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.170
 to show you I hope that you 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.570
 will be pleased if you are new to my 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.490
 chain or the same subscriber from a subscriber 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.320
 moment there are other tutorials on machine 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.300
 who gives you a free kick rather technical gesture 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.960
 which worked very well I leave you 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.430
 to go for a tour 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.960
 and then I wish you a good 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.340
 day go down and people and if you 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.870
 have friends interested in showing 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.800
 the time when rage 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.800
 go ciao
