00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:06.300
 Today we have a question of those ... very good ... 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.722
 Professor Leandro Quadros, the question came by SMS: 

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:16.161
 "If the 10 commandments were not abolished, 

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:21.085
 Then, what laws were eliminated? 

00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:25.139
 Professor, we know that the 10 commandments were not abolished ... 

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:27.669
 But ... was some law eliminated? 

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:29.710
 What story is that teacher? 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.387
 That's an interesting question Tito, for the following: 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.294
 Same as the Jew did not make a separation between laws, 

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:44.682
 that is, for them, the term Law = Tora, referred to the 5 books of Moses. 

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:47.654
 and all the existing laws in those books! 

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.924
 That does not mean we can not see 

00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:53.495
 a difference between types of laws ... 

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:56.854
 For example, we see laws of moral order, 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:58.632
 what would the 10 commandments be ... 

00:00:58.778 --> 00:01:01.749
 Laws of civil order, which regulated 

00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:04.389
 the social behavior of the people of Israel. 

00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:07.390
 We also see dietary laws, 

00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:09.897
 and ceremonial laws. 

00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:13.552
 That regulated 

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.466
 the ceremonies of Israel to worship God. 

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:19.704
 Actually, the moral laws of God 

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.496
 as we can see here in MATEO 5:17 

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.813
 they were not abolished ... 

00:01:24.942 --> 00:01:29.398
 He says: "Do not think that I have come to abrogate the law or the prophets; 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.136
 I have not come to abrogate, but to fulfill. " 

00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:34.443
 That is, the word LAW here refers to 

00:01:34.614 --> 00:01:36.118
 the 5 books of Moses 

00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:38.808
 and prophets ... to the other books of the OT 

00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:41.024
 And there Christ says in v. 18 

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:45.454
 "... until heaven and earth pass, not a jot or a tittle ..." 

00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:49.675
 NOTHING WILL BE REMOVED UNTIL EVERYTHING IS FULFILLED! 

00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:53.636
 But, then, where does it say in the Bible that some law was withdrawn? 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.218
 Since people say that the laws were eliminated ... where does that say in the Bible? 

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:07.103
 We have a text here in EPHESIANS 2:15 ... 

00:02:07.238 --> 00:02:09.398
 that will help us clarify 

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:13.483
 know what part of the law, that is, what part of the AT 

00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.581
 still in force and what not! 

00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:19.085
 EPHESIANS 2:15 says thus: 

00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:20.754
 (referring to Christ) 

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:24.093
 "abolishing in their flesh the enmities, the law of the commandments 

00:02:24.337 --> 00:02:27.149
 EXPRESSED IN ORDINANCES ... " 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:33.904
 So ... what are those laws that ... stopped being important, 

00:02:34.248 --> 00:02:35.703
 after the death of Christ? 

00:02:35.868 --> 00:02:38.304
 Laws in the form of Ordinances !!! 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.240
 What are those ceremonial laws, 

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:44.389
 for example, where they sacrificed the lamb, 

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:47.915
 for the person to express faith in the Savior! 

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:49.916
 I mean, is that what they did in the sanctuary, too? 

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:51.474
 Exactly that ! 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.880
 Because all that symbolizes, all that ceremonialism, 

00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:58.428
 of the earthly sanctuary, 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.494
 It symbolized what Christ does for us in the Heavenly Sanctuary! 

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:06.667
 So what's up ? 

00:03:06.842 --> 00:03:09.312
 That all the meaning 

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.654
 prophetic of the ceremonial laws, 

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:15.652
 It was transferred to Christ! 

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:19.104
 So, today, EL fulfills all that! 

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:21.312
 He is our Lamb who died on the cross, 

00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:24.889
 and He is the High Priest who intervenes for us in Heaven! 

00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:27.037
 Then, we can affirm the following: 

00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:31.485
 That the function of the ceremonial law was transferred to Christ! 

00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:34.235
 And therefore, those ceremonial laws, 

00:03:34.342 --> 00:03:35.837
 who aimed for Christ ... 

00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:38.198
 it is not necessary to practice them !!! 

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:41.047
 But, the moral standards of God ... 

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:43.444
 they were not abolished by Christ! 

00:03:43.618 --> 00:03:47.317
 So, this text that they use from EPHESIANS 2:15 ... 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.903
 Do they use it to say that the 10 commandments were abolished? 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.654
 Yes ... many distort the text, 

00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:56.294
 they fuck EPHESIANS 2:15 

00:03:56.398 --> 00:03:59.063
 and they forget to read MATEO 5:17 

00:03:59.164 --> 00:04:01.052
 and neither HEBREWS 8: 10 for example .... 

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:02.998
 HEBREWS 8:10 says 

00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:07.454
 that in the new Covenant, in which He will save us by the grace of Christ, 

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:10.576
 God writes his Law in our hearts !!! 

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:12.195
 What law is that going to be? 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.848
 It can only be the moral law, God will not write the ceremonial law in my heart. do not ? 

00:04:16.076 --> 00:04:17.920
 Because the law is a symbol of Christ! 

00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:20.814
 And if the law is written in my heart, 

00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:24.626
 it is clear that the 10 commandments continue in force! 

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:29.850
 The problem is, that many Christians want to keep 9 commandments, and ONE DOES NOT! 

00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:32.423
 They take the 10 commandments, 

00:04:32.596 --> 00:04:35.417
 they take out the 4th commandment, which is about the observance of the Sabbath, 

00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:37.241
 and there you tell them ... 

00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:41.302
 "Then, the commandment You will not steal, You will not kill ... they were abolished? ... NOOO, those NOT! 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.855
 They tell you those are NOT! 

00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:46.652
 Now I wonder ... "Why are the others NOT and is it Saturday?" 

00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:48.647
 We can not say that ... 

00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:52.867
 We can not use human criteria to judge which commandment 

00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:55.359
 of God is valid and which is not! 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.062
 We have to, by faith and by the grace of God, 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.393
 accept the Word of God and His commandments as they are!
