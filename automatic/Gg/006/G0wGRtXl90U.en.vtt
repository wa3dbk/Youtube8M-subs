running as good as it is as it was
running<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.729> broken<00:01:35.970> down<00:01:36.240> because

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
running when it was broken down because

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.719 
running when it was broken down because
this<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.710> unbelievable<00:01:38.520> this

this was this was unbelievable this
shouldn't<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.119> been<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.720> was

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
shouldn't have been like that there was

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
shouldn't have been like that there was
so<00:01:39.990> much<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.500> wordplay<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.970> much<00:01:42.180> fool

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
so much for wordplay and so much fool

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.450 
so much for wordplay and so much fool
would<00:01:42.600> pressure<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> motor<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
would pressure on the motor that it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.460 
would pressure on the motor that it
opened<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.119> keyhole<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
opened up this keyhole right here and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.240 
opened up this keyhole right here and
right<00:01:47.299> here<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.810> had<00:01:52.380> created<00:01:53.130> an

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
right here and it also it had created an

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
right here and it also it had created an
uneven<00:01:53.640> wear<00:01:53.850> pattern<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.750> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
uneven wear pattern right here on this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.179 
uneven wear pattern right here on this
lip<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.409> was<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.710> much<00:01:55.860> forward

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
lip but there was so much forward

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
lip but there was so much forward
pressure<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.630> surprised

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
pressure going on there I'm surprised

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.260 
pressure going on there I'm surprised
the<00:01:58.320> motor<00:01:58.890> didn't<00:01:59.219> backfire<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.000> thing

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the motor didn't backfire but that thing

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.920 
the motor didn't backfire but that thing
still<00:02:00.719> ran<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> ran<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.619> 60<00:02:02.040> years

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
still ran it ran for 60 years
