research before you buy one of these to

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.020 
research before you buy one of these to
make<00:03:28.010> sure<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.340> you're<00:03:28.459> getting<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.760> right

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
make sure that you're getting the right

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.440 
make sure that you're getting the right
one

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
one

also<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:30.860> an<00:03:31.040> NTSC<00:03:31.940> other<00:03:32.630> than<00:03:32.930> the

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
also this is an NTSC other than the

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.170 
also this is an NTSC other than the
obvious<00:03:33.200> power<00:03:33.620> supply<00:03:34.070> differences<00:03:34.670> these

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
obvious power supply differences these

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.789 
obvious power supply differences these
things<00:03:35.420> are<00:03:35.570> pretty<00:03:35.840> much<00:03:35.989> identical<00:03:36.230> they

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
things are pretty much identical they

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.580 
things are pretty much identical they
use<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.160> same<00:03:37.340> video<00:03:37.989> output<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.200> if<00:03:39.470> you

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
use the same video output and if you

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.560 
use the same video output and if you
already<00:03:39.769> have<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.190> pre-existing

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
already have it a pre-existing

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.090 
already have it a pre-existing
PlayStation<00:03:41.570> 2<00:03:41.750> or<00:03:41.930> Playstation<00:03:42.440> 3<00:03:42.470> cables

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
PlayStation 2 or Playstation 3 cables

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.240 
PlayStation 2 or Playstation 3 cables
they<00:03:43.880> work<00:03:44.090> just<00:03:44.510> fine<00:03:44.750> in<00:03:44.959> here<00:03:45.200> there's<00:03:46.190> an

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
they work just fine in here there's an

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.890 
they work just fine in here there's an
optical<00:03:46.700> output<00:03:46.850> on<00:03:47.209> both<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.570> these<00:03:47.660> and

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
optical output on both of these and

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.390 
optical output on both of these and
built-in<00:03:48.380> Ethernet

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
built-in Ethernet

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.210 
built-in Ethernet
so<00:03:50.440> there's<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.500> slight<00:03:51.680> difference<00:03:51.920> in

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
so there's a slight difference in

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.210 
so there's a slight difference in
molding<00:03:52.670> here<00:03:52.879> on<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.150> sides<00:03:53.950> if<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.010> look

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
molding here on the sides if you look

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.979 
molding here on the sides if you look
over<00:03:55.459> here<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:56.269> can<00:03:56.420> see<00:03:56.599> you<00:03:56.750> get<00:03:56.840> a

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
over here you can see you get a

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.630 
over here you can see you get a
different<00:03:57.530> pattern<00:03:57.799> here<00:03:58.220> on<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.400> side<00:03:58.610> of

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
different pattern here on the side of

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.570 
different pattern here on the side of
the<00:03:58.819> Japanese<00:03:59.360> PlayStation<00:03:59.599> to<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:01.250> front<00:04:01.519> of
