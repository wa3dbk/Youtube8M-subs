00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.079
 from the case and today usually two thirds 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 Bern 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.990
 let's go 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.039
 when comes now as explanatory pattern 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.070
 I was driving at noon 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.439
 because the damage is about 8 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.629
 says that the AHV address Pauli let it go on the balance so 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.759
 because they can really remember Klein Left 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.570
 so seen Isa Dahl 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.050
 It should not be prepared too close to the gate by the clock in the turn 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.730
 even more than 40 o'clock with so 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.950
 Â«Let us pray between Cologne and Bonn 2 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.700
 way, Data prohibits from some &amp; any 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.680
 and as is the case with the Blackies, this is a pretty simple Kerber 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.890
 but that must know 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.850
 that he has very close to the forefoot 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.640
 because most points got sampled for the first time 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.600
 both sides would have Easter water so stay that way 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.450
 if you can here 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.820
 I want to be with our fans 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.400
 we were not ready together 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.850
 Growing up is becoming an intermediary for being irritating with 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.080
 leather soles 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.570
 if they make me sad that the two are not like this right now 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.480
 the traffic is released 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.310
 loses today 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.680
 last seen 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.240
 50-year-old offenders ran the cinemas too short then run out of that 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.300
 that does not rule 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.300
 So the printed word of the northwest wind blows here 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.660
 and that can be said against the Swedes - the championship title SPD 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.719
 while continuing in a letter 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.680
 important 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.480
 So no glasses packed no luck 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.830
 but far at the Swiss Re publica 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.780
 and then a patent for Blumberg 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.020
 Pauli was coming for brevity 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.050
 this site fires with the foot that would only have the front one 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.870
 bit forward 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.820
 already they will come as the answer 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.940
 continue reading 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.940
 St 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.350
 what you can do wrong Â»explains life thanks 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.449
 not enough how this turns out to be in the yard Christopher the amounts 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.910
 because the perpetrators because of this you do not have to move out 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.419
 I can only say that they have the test 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.189
 Eddy Achterberg User need 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.029
 or other common mistakes 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:26.479
 the animal and more than 90 degrees in the second single he plays piano why asked 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.219
 the cancer league St Gallen 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.849
 but it does not continue 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.009
 always like that 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.359
 and then the Olivia blocks 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.359
 Peter Paziorek such a 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.319
 and there is now clearly distributed 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.509
 when he just something just the right house is 90 degrees as possible 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.509
 he has to go 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.199
 I hope 12 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.199
 and we talked 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:53.369
 Bern
