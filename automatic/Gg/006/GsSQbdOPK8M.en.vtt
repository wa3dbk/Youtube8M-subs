00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
is first take a look at where your your

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.000 
is first take a look at where your your
fluid<00:00:45.929> level<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.629> this<00:00:48.629> bag<00:00:49.199> of<00:00:49.469> fluids<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
fluid level is this bag of fluids is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.840 
fluid level is this bag of fluids is
right<00:00:50.219> at<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> each<00:00:51.809> increment<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
right at the one and each increment is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.619 
right at the one and each increment is
100<00:00:53.850> mils<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.600> 100<00:00:55.170> CCS<00:00:55.679> and<00:00:56.149> infra<00:00:57.149> Moby<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
100 mils or 100 CCS and infra Moby I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.649 
100 mils or 100 CCS and infra Moby I
want<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> give<00:00:58.230> her<00:00:58.499> one<00:00:58.530> hundred<00:00:58.949> CCS<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.510> I'm

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
want to give her one hundred CCS so I'm

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.590 
want to give her one hundred CCS so I'm
going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.839> watch<00:01:01.100> when<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.309> line<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.239> fluid

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
going to watch when this line of fluid

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 
going to watch when this line of fluid
gets<00:01:03.870> down<00:01:04.050> to<00:01:04.230> the<00:01:04.350> two<00:01:04.560> then<00:01:05.100> we'll<00:01:05.310> be<00:01:05.430> done

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
gets down to the two then we'll be done

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.560 
gets down to the two then we'll be done
that<00:01:06.030> will<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.300> hundred<00:01:06.720> CCS<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:09.210> think

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that will be a hundred CCS so I think

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
that will be a hundred CCS so I think
it's<00:01:09.810> helpful<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> put<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.980> course<00:01:11.160> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
it's helpful to put this of course I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
it's helpful to put this of course I
have<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> nice<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:11.670> IV<00:01:12.120> pole<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.600> it's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
have a nice little IV pole but it's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
have a nice little IV pole but it's
going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> work<00:01:13.710> better<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.490> put<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.360> bag

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
going to work better if you put this bag

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140 
going to work better if you put this bag
of<00:01:16.140> fluids<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> hanger<00:01:17.160> and<00:01:17.310> maybe<00:01:17.820> hang<00:01:18.030> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
of fluids on a hanger and maybe hang it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
floor the higher up the bag of fluids

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.570 
floor the higher up the bag of fluids
are<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.680> faster<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.800> fluids<00:01:32.100> will<00:01:32.220> run<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
are the faster the fluids will run and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.440 
are the faster the fluids will run and
everything<00:01:32.730> will<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.690> faster<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.240> have

it up here and then I've got our fluid
line<00:01:39.780> there's<00:01:40.440> going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.800> fluid

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
line there's going to be a little fluid

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.270 
line there's going to be a little fluid
clamps<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:42.480> now<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.710> clamped

skin<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.080> area<00:02:07.410> so<00:02:07.590> we're<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
skin in this area so we're just going to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.660 
skin in this area so we're just going to
tint<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.429> skin<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.649> wear<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
tint the skin up and wear that the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
tint the skin up and wear that the
center<00:02:12.030> part<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.540> skin<00:02:12.900> fold<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.350> is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
center part of that skin fold is is

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.910 
center part of that skin fold is is
really

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
really

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.830 
really
we're<00:02:14.069> going<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> give<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.730> fluids<00:02:17.840> we'll

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
we're going to give the fluids we'll

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.089 
we're going to give the fluids we'll
take<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.200> cap<00:02:19.410> off<00:02:19.590> there

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
take the cap off there

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.860 
take the cap off there
you'll<00:02:20.489> also<00:02:20.700> notice<00:02:21.030> when<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.390> look<00:02:21.599> at<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
you'll also notice when you look at the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.870 
you'll also notice when you look at the
needle<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.319> there<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> bevel<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
needle that there is a bevel to the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.449 
needle that there is a bevel to the
needle<00:02:24.180> meaning<00:02:24.569> there's<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.470> part<00:02:26.069> where<00:02:26.250> it's

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
needle meaning there's a part where it's

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.070 
needle meaning there's a part where it's
trying<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.569> wear<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> some<00:02:29.090> angled<00:02:30.090> I'm<00:02:30.600> used

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
trying to wear it some angled I'm used

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.280 
trying to wear it some angled I'm used
to<00:02:31.200> giving<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.520> needle<00:02:32.819> bevel<00:02:33.150> up<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to giving that the needle bevel up so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.440 
to giving that the needle bevel up so
when<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.040> insert<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.790> into<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.120> skin<00:02:36.330> it's

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
when I insert it into the skin it's

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.710 
when I insert it into the skin it's
going<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.660> be<00:02:36.840> at<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.470> angle<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.450> I'm<00:02:39.540> just

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
going to be at this angle so I'm just

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.740 
going to be at this angle so I'm just
going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.900> pet<00:02:40.470> her<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.769> this<00:02:40.860> area<00:02:41.630> kind<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
going to pet her in this area kind of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.020 
going to pet her in this area kind of
tent<00:02:42.959> up<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> skin<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.950> then<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:44.760> poke<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
tent up the skin and then just poke it

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.600 
tent up the skin and then just poke it
through<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.450> skin<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.459> certainly<00:02:47.459> with

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
through the skin and certainly with

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.640 
through the skin and certainly with
practice<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.180> tell<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:48.900> going

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
practice I can tell that that's going

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.930 
practice I can tell that that's going
under<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.190> skin<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:52.260> there<00:02:52.819> then<00:02:53.819> I'm

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
under the skin and is in there then I'm

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.910 
under the skin and is in there then I'm
going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:55.019> it's<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.290> sitting<00:02:55.500> there<00:02:55.620> I'm

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
going to so it's just sitting there I'm

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.240 
going to so it's just sitting there I'm
going<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.090> release<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.390> clamp<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
going to release the clamp and now the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.460 
going to release the clamp and now the
fluid<00:02:59.640> should<00:02:59.940> start<00:03:00.239> flowing<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.319> way

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
fluid should start flowing and the way

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.520 
fluid should start flowing and the way
you<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.769> tell<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.250> by<00:03:02.280> looking<00:03:03.120> up<00:03:03.239> here<00:03:03.569> that

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
you can tell is by looking up here that

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.460 
you can tell is by looking up here that
there's<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.100> little<00:03:05.370> drip<00:03:05.930> that's<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.230> if

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
there's a little drip that's going if

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.580 
there's a little drip that's going if
it's<00:03:08.220> real<00:03:08.430> slow<00:03:08.880> like<00:03:09.299> that's<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.690> fairly<00:03:10.380> slow

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
it's real slow like that's a fairly slow

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.240 
it's real slow like that's a fairly slow
drip

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
drip

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.330 
drip
you<00:03:11.700> might<00:03:11.970> try<00:03:12.860> redirecting<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.010> needle

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
you might try redirecting the needle

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.910 
you might try redirecting the needle
just<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.910> little<00:03:15.150> bit<00:03:15.299> or<00:03:15.600> getting<00:03:16.380> your<00:03:16.560> bag<00:03:16.739> of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
just a little bit or getting your bag of

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.110 
just a little bit or getting your bag of
fluids<00:03:17.340> up<00:03:17.940> higher<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.670> during<00:03:20.970> this

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
fluids up higher and so during this

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.020 
fluids up higher and so during this
process<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:22.739> can<00:03:22.890> just<00:03:23.100> pet<00:03:23.430> your<00:03:23.730> Kitty's

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
cheek and ear and as the fluids are

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.210 
cheek and ear and as the fluids are
going<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:31.049> does<00:03:31.380> take<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> little<00:03:31.950> bit<00:03:32.160> of

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
going it does take a little bit of

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.569 
going it does take a little bit of
practice<00:03:33.260> but<00:03:34.260> often<00:03:34.829> times<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.160> can<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:35.430> this

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
practice but often times you can do this

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.360 
practice but often times you can do this
without<00:03:35.760> any<00:03:36.120> assistance<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:38.070> know<00:03:38.160> if<00:03:38.250> your

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
without any assistance you know if your

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.949 
without any assistance you know if your
kitty<00:03:38.579> tries<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.940> get<00:03:39.060> up<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.299> walk<00:03:39.420> away<00:03:39.570> just

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
kitty tries to get up and walk away just

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.020 
kitty tries to get up and walk away just
just<00:03:40.470> kind<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.739> pet<00:03:41.340> her<00:03:41.430> back<00:03:41.670> into<00:03:41.880> a

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
lying-down position and and they really

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.500 
lying-down position and and they really
tolerate<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.109> very<00:03:46.470> well<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:47.040> do<00:03:47.910> try<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.299> keep

is just holding it steady when you are
administering<00:04:02.700> fluids<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.780> maybe<00:04:04.350> noticing

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
administering fluids and maybe noticing

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.490 
administering fluids and maybe noticing
that<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.670> drip<00:04:06.030> rate<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:07.319> not

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that the the drip rate that it's not

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.759 
that the the drip rate that it's not
flowing<00:04:07.950> real<00:04:08.310> fast<00:04:08.850> or<00:04:09.239> real<00:04:09.540> smoothly<00:04:09.870> you

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
flowing real fast or real smoothly you

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.470 
flowing real fast or real smoothly you
can<00:04:11.130> actually<00:04:11.489> go<00:04:11.700> ahead<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:11.940> clamp<00:04:12.180> off<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
can actually go ahead and clamp off the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.990 
can actually go ahead and clamp off the
fluids<00:04:13.049> take<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.769> needle<00:04:13.920> out<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.400> try<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> new

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
fluids take the needle out and try a new

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.849 
fluids take the needle out and try a new
location<00:04:15.389> because<00:04:15.900> sometimes<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.500> just<00:04:16.620> a

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
location because sometimes it's just a

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.050 
location because sometimes it's just a
matter<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.400> finding<00:04:17.669> just<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.000> right

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
matter of finding just the right

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.450 
matter of finding just the right
location<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:19.739> do<00:04:20.100> give<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.489> try<00:04:21.979> so<00:04:22.979> after

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
location so do give that a try so after

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.560 
location so do give that a try so after
your<00:04:23.640> fluids<00:04:24.349> have<00:04:25.349> flown<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.039> your

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
your fluids have flown and your

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.430 
your fluids have flown and your
you<00:04:27.630> reach<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.050> level<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.950> want<00:04:29.210> I'll

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
you reach the level that you want I'll

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.970 
you reach the level that you want I'll
keep<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.250> needle<00:04:32.580> in<00:04:32.760> position<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.980> then

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
keep the the needle in position and then

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.240 
keep the the needle in position and then
with<00:04:35.130> my<00:04:35.280> other<00:04:35.490> hand<00:04:36.560> I'll<00:04:37.560> find<00:04:37.950> that<00:04:38.100> little

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
with my other hand I'll find that little

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.730 
with my other hand I'll find that little
clamp<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.910> then<00:04:39.060> I'll<00:04:39.180> clamp<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:39.570> off<00:04:39.720> so<00:04:40.680> I

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
clamp and then I'll clamp it off so I

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.130 
clamp and then I'll clamp it off so I
want<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.890> clamp<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.220> off<00:04:41.310> before<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:41.990> take<00:04:42.990> the

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
want to clamp it off before I take the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.410 
want to clamp it off before I take the
needle<00:04:43.500> out<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:44.280> then<00:04:44.460> I'm<00:04:44.610> going<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.760> kind<00:04:45.390> of

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
needle out so then I'm going to kind of

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.380 
needle out so then I'm going to kind of
pinch<00:04:45.660> right<00:04:46.410> where<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.740> needle<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.610> just

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
pinch right where the needle is and just

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.590 
pinch right where the needle is and just
pull<00:04:48.630> out<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.370> then<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.700> usually<00:04:51.330> keep<00:04:51.450> it

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
pull out and then I usually keep it

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600 
pull out and then I usually keep it
pinched<00:04:51.900> for<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.560> moment<00:04:52.710> or<00:04:52.950> so<00:04:53.010> but<00:04:53.460> it's

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
pinched for just a moment or so but it's

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.370 
pinched for just a moment or so but it's
normal<00:04:54.150> for<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.360> little<00:04:54.630> bit<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.870> fluids<00:04:55.260> to

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
normal for a little bit of fluids to

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.730 
normal for a little bit of fluids to
come<00:04:55.680> out<00:04:56.660> then<00:04:57.660> I'll<00:04:57.780> very<00:04:58.050> carefully<00:04:58.530> put

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
come out then I'll very carefully put

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.370 
come out then I'll very carefully put
the<00:04:58.770> cap<00:04:59.100> back<00:04:59.910> on<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.180> needle<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.900> set<00:05:01.230> that

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
the cap back on the needle and set that

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.270 
the cap back on the needle and set that
aside<00:05:02.810> there<00:05:03.810> may<00:05:04.230> be<00:05:04.260> a<00:05:04.440> little<00:05:04.680> bit<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:05.010> a<00:05:05.100> wet

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
aside there may be a little bit of a wet

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.750 
aside there may be a little bit of a wet
spot<00:05:05.610> where<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.570> gave<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.990> fluids<00:05:07.520> now<00:05:08.520> if

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
spot where you gave the fluids now if

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.830 
spot where you gave the fluids now if
the<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.900> know<00:05:09.930> some<00:05:10.260> things<00:05:10.530> that<00:05:10.770> can<00:05:10.950> can

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
the you know some things that can can

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.390 
the you know some things that can can
happen<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:13.050> if<00:05:13.260> you<00:05:13.410> poked<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:13.980> all<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.310> way

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
happen is if you poked it all the way

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.760 
happen is if you poked it all the way
through<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:14.850> skin<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.810> when<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.470> turn<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
through the skin the when you turn the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.040 
through the skin the when you turn the
fluids<00:05:17.100> on<00:05:17.220> you'll<00:05:17.610> see<00:05:17.700> or<00:05:18.570> if<00:05:18.780> you're<00:05:18.930> not

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
fluids on you'll see or if you're not

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.070 
fluids on you'll see or if you're not
all<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.350> way<00:05:19.440> through<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.860> skin<00:05:20.630> its<00:05:21.630> fluids

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
all the way through the skin its fluids

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.900 
all the way through the skin its fluids
will<00:05:22.170> start<00:05:22.410> leaking<00:05:22.590> when<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.160> give<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.460> so

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
will start leaking when you give it so

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.820 
will start leaking when you give it so
if<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.150> happens<00:05:24.600> don't<00:05:24.870> don't<00:05:25.440> be<00:05:25.560> alarmed

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
if that happens don't don't be alarmed

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.620 
if that happens don't don't be alarmed
or<00:05:26.070> don't<00:05:26.250> panic<00:05:26.610> just<00:05:26.760> go<00:05:27.060> ahead<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.390> clamp

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
or don't panic just go ahead and clamp

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.400 
or don't panic just go ahead and clamp
off<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.870> fluids<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:29.360> reposition<00:05:30.410> when

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
off the fluids and reposition when

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.300 
off the fluids and reposition when
you're<00:05:31.590> done<00:05:31.800> there<00:05:32.550> will<00:05:32.730> be<00:05:32.760> kind<00:05:33.570> of<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.810> I

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
you're done there will be kind of a I

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.590 
you're done there will be kind of a I
call<00:05:35.310> it<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.520> humpback<00:05:35.910> there's<00:05:36.360> going<00:05:36.450> to<00:05:36.510> be

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
call it the humpback there's going to be

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.990 
call it the humpback there's going to be
a<00:05:36.720> kind<00:05:37.230> of<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.350> balloon<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:38.070> fluids<00:05:38.460> under<00:05:38.790> her

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
a kind of a balloon of fluids under her

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.600 
a kind of a balloon of fluids under her
skin<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:42.200> but<00:05:43.200> that<00:05:43.350> does<00:05:43.590> absorb<00:05:43.860> sometimes

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
skin and but that does absorb sometimes

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.250 
skin and but that does absorb sometimes
it<00:05:44.730> starts<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.150> kind<00:05:45.300> of<00:05:45.420> migrate<00:05:45.870> down<00:05:46.050> their

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
it starts to kind of migrate down their

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.210 
it starts to kind of migrate down their
legs<00:05:46.500> a<00:05:46.740> little<00:05:46.860> bit<00:05:47.100> too<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:48.170> so<00:05:49.170> if<00:05:49.380> you<00:05:49.500> know

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
legs a little bit too and so if you know

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.310 
legs a little bit too and so if you know
later<00:05:50.490> on<00:05:50.600> see<00:05:51.600> them<00:05:51.780> walking<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.230> they've

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
later on see them walking and they've

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.650 
later on see them walking and they've
got<00:05:52.500> some<00:05:52.740> fluid<00:05:53.520> under<00:05:53.760> their<00:05:53.910> skin<00:05:54.240> that's

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
got some fluid under their skin that's

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.950 
got some fluid under their skin that's
it's<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.230> shifting<00:05:55.980> in<00:05:56.130> its<00:05:56.280> distribution

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.439 

another<00:06:00.830> practice<00:06:01.430> tip<00:06:01.699> for<00:06:01.970> you<00:06:02.060> if<00:06:02.180> you<00:06:02.270> want

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
another practice tip for you if you want

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.719 
another practice tip for you if you want
to<00:06:02.600> practice<00:06:02.870> this<00:06:03.410> before<00:06:04.009> actually<00:06:04.520> trying

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
to practice this before actually trying

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.450 
to practice this before actually trying
this<00:06:04.910> on<00:06:05.090> your<00:06:05.270> cat<00:06:05.479> is<00:06:05.889> to<00:06:06.889> take<00:06:07.070> up<00:06:07.190> an<00:06:07.280> out

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
this on your cat is to take up an out

this on your cat is to take up an out
banana<00:06:07.970> peel<00:06:08.210> after<00:06:08.509> you've<00:06:08.960> eaten<00:06:09.169> the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
banana peel after you've eaten the

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.670 
banana peel after you've eaten the
banana<00:06:09.740> and<00:06:09.979> maybe<00:06:10.820> go<00:06:11.150> over<00:06:11.449> by<00:06:11.600> a<00:06:11.630> sink<00:06:12.440> or

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
banana and maybe go over by a sink or

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.939 
banana and maybe go over by a sink or
someplace<00:06:12.919> and<00:06:13.630> practice<00:06:14.630> taking<00:06:14.990> off<00:06:15.320> the

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
someplace and practice taking off the

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.279 
someplace and practice taking off the
cap<00:06:16.430> of<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.639> needle<00:06:17.090> poking<00:06:17.840> it<00:06:17.960> through<00:06:18.139> the

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
cap of the needle poking it through the

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.930 
cap of the needle poking it through the
banana<00:06:18.620> skin

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
banana skin

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.870 
banana skin
unclamping<00:06:20.630> your<00:06:20.930> fluids<00:06:21.380> and<00:06:21.740> then<00:06:22.460> re

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
unclamping your fluids and then re

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.029 
unclamping your fluids and then re
clamping<00:06:23.300> your<00:06:23.419> fluids<00:06:23.780> taking<00:06:24.259> the<00:06:24.500> needle

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
clamping your fluids taking the needle

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.770 
clamping your fluids taking the needle
out<00:06:25.160> of<00:06:25.340> the<00:06:25.430> banana<00:06:25.580> peel<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:26.210> just

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
out of the banana peel and just

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.300 
out of the banana peel and just
practicing<00:06:27.350> that<00:06:27.500> so<00:06:27.740> you<00:06:27.800> because<00:06:28.070> there's<00:06:28.250> a

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
practicing that so you because there's a

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.279 
practicing that so you because there's a
fair<00:06:28.699> amount<00:06:28.940> of<00:06:29.000> coordination<00:06:29.240> involved<00:06:30.110> and

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
fair amount of coordination involved and

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.680 
fair amount of coordination involved and
so<00:06:31.100> if<00:06:31.280> you<00:06:31.400> want<00:06:31.610> to<00:06:31.669> get<00:06:32.150> through<00:06:32.449> that

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
so if you want to get through that

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.480 
so if you want to get through that
before<00:06:33.440> actually<00:06:33.770> trying<00:06:33.949> it<00:06:34.070> on<00:06:34.160> your<00:06:34.310> cat

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490

it can help to warm up the bag of fluids
just<00:06:44.750> a<00:06:45.020> little<00:06:45.289> bit<00:06:45.440> this<00:06:46.039> is<00:06:46.280> just<00:06:46.490> room

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699
