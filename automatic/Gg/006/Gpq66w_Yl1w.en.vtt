that's basically how this thing you can
do<00:02:29.569> more<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.750> half<00:02:30.959> back<00:02:31.290> style<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.840> would

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
do more of a half back style so I would

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.140 
do more of a half back style so I would
probably<00:02:34.650> leave<00:02:34.769> my<00:02:34.890> curly<00:02:35.129> bits<00:02:35.340> forward<00:02:38.150> but

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
probably leave my curly bits forward but

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.390 
probably leave my curly bits forward but
you<00:02:39.739> take<00:02:40.739> your<00:02:40.950> bits<00:02:41.340> from<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.640> side

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.720 

Oh<00:02:47.430> Mac<00:02:48.349> Punk<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.739> twist<00:02:49.980> over<00:02:50.190> depends

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.580 

and<00:04:05.430> again<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:06.060> don't<00:04:06.360> have<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.659> mirror<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.170> I

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
and again I don't have a mirror so I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.530 
and again I don't have a mirror so I
can't<00:04:07.920> imagine<00:04:08.010> what<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.519> look<00:04:08.700> like<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:09.420> if

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
can't imagine what I look like but if

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.699 
can't imagine what I look like but if
you've<00:04:09.690> got<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.930> cow<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:11.010> neaten<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:11.970> up

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
you've got a cow and neaten that up

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:22.500 
you've got a cow and neaten that up
I'm<00:04:13.709> round<00:04:14.159> your<00:04:14.340> back

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.520 

or<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.410> can<00:04:23.680> use<00:04:23.920> these<00:04:24.900> just<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.020> hold<00:04:26.230> your

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
or you can use these just to hold your

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.840 
or you can use these just to hold your
sides<00:04:26.830> back<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:27.700> a<00:04:27.790> traditional<00:04:28.360> kind<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.870> way

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
sides back in a traditional kind of way

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.250 
sides back in a traditional kind of way
pull<00:04:30.850> your<00:04:31.000> sides<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:31.780> you<00:04:31.840> might<00:04:32.020> do<00:04:32.140> this

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
pull your sides so you might do this

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.680 
pull your sides so you might do this
with<00:04:32.470> two<00:04:32.500> cones<00:04:32.980> when<00:04:33.310> on<00:04:33.400> each<00:04:33.520> side<00:04:33.760> or<00:04:33.790> you

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
with two cones when on each side or you

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.230 
with two cones when on each side or you
could<00:04:34.810> just<00:04:34.990> do<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.140> with<00:04:35.260> one<00:04:35.470> one<00:04:35.890> come<00:04:36.240> so

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
could just do it with one one come so

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.560 
could just do it with one one come so
you<00:04:37.840> take<00:04:38.050> your<00:04:38.080> hair<00:04:38.650> back<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.160> sort<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.210> find

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
you take your hair back and sort of find

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.630 
you take your hair back and sort of find
your<00:04:40.720> ear<00:04:40.990> roughly<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:42.070> have<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.310> experiment

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
your ear roughly you have to experiment

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.540 
your ear roughly you have to experiment
with<00:04:42.910> your<00:04:43.030> own<00:04:43.090> hair<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.870> looks<00:04:43.900> good<00:04:44.400> push<00:04:45.400> it

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
with your own hair it looks good push it

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.810 
with your own hair it looks good push it
forward

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.360 

so<00:04:54.360> that's<00:04:54.540> just<00:04:54.840> three<00:04:55.200> ways<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.160> can

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
so that's just three ways that you can

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.580 
so that's just three ways that you can
play<00:04:56.490> with<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.790> comb<00:04:57.000> there's<00:04:57.990> loads<00:04:58.440> more

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
play with the comb there's loads more

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
play with the comb there's loads more
styles<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.900> it's<00:05:01.620> worth<00:05:01.800> having<00:05:02.040> one<00:05:02.370> comb

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
styles so it's worth having one comb

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.840 
styles so it's worth having one comb
just<00:05:03.030> having<00:05:03.420> a<00:05:03.480> good<00:05:03.600> play
