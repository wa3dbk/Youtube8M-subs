then go ahead go to the 1/2 inch I don't
think<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> at<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.369> point<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
think that the at this point here the

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.060 
think that the at this point here the
well<00:01:56.159> let<00:01:56.280> me<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:57.329> plate<00:01:57.860> they<00:01:58.860> call

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
well let me see this plate they call

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.840 
well let me see this plate they call
that<00:01:59.219> plate<00:01:59.610> a<00:02:00.290> spring<00:02:01.290> tension<00:02:02.250> adjusting

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that plate a spring tension adjusting

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.249 
that plate a spring tension adjusting
plate<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.950> gets<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.850> duster<00:02:06.719> your

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
plate so you it gets just a duster your

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.339 
plate so you it gets just a duster your
clutch<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.740> tensioned<00:02:08.220> all<00:02:08.399> laugh<00:02:08.610> anyway<00:02:09.030> so

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
clutch is tensioned all laugh anyway so

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.680 
clutch is tensioned all laugh anyway so
whatever<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.560> remember

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
whatever you remember

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.420 
whatever you remember
like<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.349> was<00:02:12.470> saying<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:12.860> don't<00:02:13.010> think<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.340> would

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
like I was saying I don't think it would

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.430 
like I was saying I don't think it would
pop<00:02:13.670> out<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.959> wouldn't<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.260> bad

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
pop out on you but it wouldn't be a bad

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.229 
pop out on you but it wouldn't be a bad
idea<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.950> remove<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.459> 7/16<00:02:17.920> nuts<00:02:18.920> first<00:02:19.280> then

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
idea to remove the 7/16 nuts first then

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.390 
idea to remove the 7/16 nuts first then
NC<00:02:20.540> goes<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.870> half-inch<00:02:21.440> as<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:22.069> start

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
NC goes to the half-inch as you start

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.610 
NC goes to the half-inch as you start
getting<00:02:22.670> them<00:02:22.970> almost<00:02:23.180> all<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> way<00:02:23.810> out<00:02:24.050> go

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
getting them almost all the way out go

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.890 
getting them almost all the way out go
ahead<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:24.830> do<00:02:24.980> all<00:02:25.030> equally<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.540> do<00:02:26.780> it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
ahead and do all equally like do it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.870 
ahead and do all equally like do it
launch<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.349> this<00:02:27.590> one<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.099> then<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.610> one

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
launch on this one and then on that one

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.550 
launch on this one and then on that one
and<00:02:29.150> then<00:02:29.239> on<00:02:29.360> this<00:02:29.480> one<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.930> just<00:02:30.380> go<00:02:30.440> like

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
and then on this one and just go like

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.949 
and then on this one and just go like
that<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.670> all<00:02:31.819> even<00:02:32.360> amount<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.690> pressure

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
that so it's all even amount of pressure

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.559 
that so it's all even amount of pressure
so<00:02:33.290> once<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.709> start<00:02:34.010> trying<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.340> push<00:02:34.610> all<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
so once I start trying to push all the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.630 
so once I start trying to push all the
other<00:02:35.690> side<00:02:35.989> still<00:02:36.290> something<00:02:36.769> in<00:02:36.980> or

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
other side still something in or

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.949 
other side still something in or
tightened<00:02:38.239> up<00:02:38.330> for<00:02:38.540> me

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
tightened up for me

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.290 
tightened up for me
being<00:02:39.830> one<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:40.280> wherever<00:02:40.670> you're<00:02:40.910> moving<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
being one so wherever you're moving the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.690 
being one so wherever you're moving the
half-inch<00:02:41.780> once<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.319> you've<00:02:43.040> got<00:02:43.250> your<00:02:43.430> plate

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
half-inch once and you've got your plate

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.559 
half-inch once and you've got your plate
on<00:02:43.730> there<00:02:44.230> like<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:46.120> like<00:02:47.120> whenever<00:02:47.330> you

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
on there like this like whenever you

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.180 
on there like this like whenever you
remove<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.989> on<00:02:48.049> go<00:02:48.290> ahead<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.709> see<00:02:48.860> if<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.010> came

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
remove it on go ahead and see if it came

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.100 
remove it on go ahead and see if it came
with<00:02:49.400> one<00:02:49.430> hand<00:02:49.880> push<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.330> plate<00:02:50.600> in<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
with one hand push that plate in and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.630 
with one hand push that plate in and
then<00:02:51.920> loosen<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.519> up<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.900> way<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:55.190> will<00:02:55.340> just

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
then loosen it up that way it will just

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.190 
then loosen it up that way it will just
shoot<00:02:55.940> out<00:02:56.120> on<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.660> don't<00:02:56.780> know<00:02:56.989> if<00:02:57.019> it

can see let me see there you got your
spring<00:03:45.139> here<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.709> then<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.220> got<00:03:46.340> like<00:03:46.489> a

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
spring here and then you got like a

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.970 
spring here and then you got like a
little<00:03:46.760> cup<00:03:47.090> but<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:47.959> spring<00:03:48.319> goes<00:03:48.620> into

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
little cup but that spring goes into

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.780 
little cup but that spring goes into
like<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.430> go<00:03:50.269> ahead<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.600> remove<00:03:50.720> those

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
probably would be about at the end of go

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.440
