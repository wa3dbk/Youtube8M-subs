and so hot and this

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.819

the<00:04:19.079> radar<00:04:19.230> tied<00:04:19.829> with<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.190> Thunder<00:04:20.400> with<00:04:20.700> the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
the radar tied with the Thunder with the

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.909 
the radar tied with the Thunder with the
best<00:04:21.060> record<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.720> think<00:04:22.169> this<00:04:22.410> kind<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.680> suits

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
best record I think this kind of suits

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.740 
best record I think this kind of suits
them<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.160> little<00:04:23.340> bit<00:04:23.520> now<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.910> agree<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.480> they

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
them a little bit now I agree and they

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.360 
them a little bit now I agree and they
have<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.020> continuity<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.680> now<00:04:26.010> being

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
have the continuity of now being

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.870 
have the continuity of now being
together<00:04:26.550> for<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.300> year<00:04:27.389> I<00:04:27.750> think<00:04:28.050> they<00:04:28.200> were

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
together for a year I think they were

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.730 
together for a year I think they were
really<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.030> good<00:04:30.540> defensive<00:04:31.050> team<00:04:31.290> last<00:04:31.530> year

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
really a good defensive team last year

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.409 
really a good defensive team last year
but<00:04:32.010> offensively<00:04:32.729> they<00:04:32.970> haven't<00:04:33.300> really

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
but offensively they haven't really

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.790 
but offensively they haven't really
found<00:04:33.690> their<00:04:33.930> identity<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.500> fact<00:04:34.710> that

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
found their identity the fact that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.260 
found their identity the fact that
they're<00:04:34.979> playing<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.400> much<00:04:35.520> faster<00:04:36.060> as<00:04:36.240> you

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
they're playing so much faster as you

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.510 
they're playing so much faster as you
mentioned<00:04:36.720> earlier<00:04:36.960> Reggie<00:04:37.169> suits<00:04:37.950> them<00:04:38.220> so

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
mentioned earlier Reggie suits them so

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.219 
mentioned earlier Reggie suits them so
well<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:39.060> more<00:04:39.240> possessions<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:40.020> better

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
well the more possessions the better

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.350 
well the more possessions the better
when<00:04:40.620> they<00:04:40.740> have<00:04:40.889> those<00:04:41.550> two<00:04:41.880> guys<00:04:42.060> in

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
when they have those two guys in

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.840 
when they have those two guys in
particular<00:04:42.930> running<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.800> floor<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:44.669> think

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
particular running the floor and I think

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.090 
particular running the floor and I think
the<00:04:44.970> way<00:04:45.150> Miami<00:04:45.570> has<00:04:45.840> has<00:04:46.470> now<00:04:46.710> transformed

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
the way Miami has has now transformed

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.330 
the way Miami has has now transformed
into<00:04:47.669> more<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.300> an<00:04:48.479> up-tempo<00:04:48.780> team<00:04:49.260> but<00:04:50.010> still

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
into more of an up-tempo team but still

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.060 
into more of an up-tempo team but still
has<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.880> defensive<00:04:51.570> ability<00:04:52.169> in<00:04:52.380> spurts

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
has that defensive ability in spurts

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.370 
has that defensive ability in spurts
