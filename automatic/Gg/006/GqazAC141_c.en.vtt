00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
terminals and the amplifiers obviously

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.000 
terminals and the amplifiers obviously
you<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.810> see<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:27.080> not<00:02:27.200> perfect<00:02:27.680> some<00:02:27.920> of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
you can see it's not perfect some of

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
marks cuz it started to peel up a little

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.920 
marks cuz it started to peel up a little
bit<00:02:32.210> when<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.810> was<00:02:33.220> taking<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.280> tape<00:02:34.460> off<00:02:34.930> but

bit when I was taking the tape off but

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.240 
bit when I was taking the tape off but
for<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.110> most<00:02:36.260> part<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.620> really<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> way

I might as well just give you a little
uh<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.480> know<00:02:44.600> process<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.440> too<00:02:45.709> the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
uh you know process of that too the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.130 
uh you know process of that too the
reason<00:02:46.040> why<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.430> didn't<00:02:46.760> film<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.720> believe<00:02:48.050> it
