in<00:00:00.260> this<00:00:01.260> session<00:00:01.500> we<00:00:01.920> are<00:00:01.949> going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.370> learn

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
in this session we are going to learn

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.210 
in this session we are going to learn
how<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.000> rewrite<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.629> number<00:00:04.140> or<00:00:04.380> route<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
how to rewrite a number or route of a

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.579 
how to rewrite a number or route of a
number<00:00:05.640> correct<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.299> two<00:00:06.930> significant

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
number correct to two significant

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.620 
number correct to two significant
figures<00:00:07.820> let's<00:00:08.820> start<00:00:09.120> with<00:00:09.330> our<00:00:09.450> first

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
figures let's start with our first

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.860 
figures let's start with our first
example<00:00:10.370> eight<00:00:11.370> point<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.830> seven<00:00:13.830> four<00:00:14.870> now

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
example eight point one seven four now

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.740 
example eight point one seven four now
here<00:00:16.230> eight<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.340> first<00:00:18.000> significant

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
here eight is the first significant

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.960 
here eight is the first significant
figure<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.520> second

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
figure and what is the second

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.240 
figure and what is the second
significant<00:00:21.539> figure<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.590> I'm<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
significant figure so I'm going to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.150 
significant figure so I'm going to
circle<00:00:23.519> one<00:00:23.970> because<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.529> Rhynie

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
circle one because we are Rhynie

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.910 
circle one because we are Rhynie
rounding<00:00:26.789> off<00:00:26.939> numbers<00:00:27.210> correct<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.199> two

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
rounding off numbers correct to two

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.349 
rounding off numbers correct to two
significant<00:00:29.640> figures

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
significant figures

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.740 
significant figures
now<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> next<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:31.949> number<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.520> seven<00:00:33.360> which<00:00:33.719> is

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
now the next or number is seven which is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.170 
now the next or number is seven which is
of<00:00:34.020> course<00:00:34.200> more<00:00:34.649> than<00:00:34.680> five<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.520> therefore<00:00:36.000> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
of course more than five and therefore I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
of course more than five and therefore I
must<00:00:36.239> add<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> circled<00:00:38.610> number<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> my

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
must add one to the circled number so my

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.450 
must add one to the circled number so my
answer<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.430> eight<00:00:42.239> point<00:00:43.020> two<00:00:45.680> next<00:00:46.680> nineteen

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
answer is eight point two next nineteen

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.279 
answer is eight point two next nineteen
point<00:00:48.300> six<00:00:49.070> one<00:00:50.070> seven<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> first

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
point six one seven so the first

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.130 
point six one seven so the first
significant<00:00:53.070> figure<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.610> 1<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.690> second

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
significant figure is 1 and the second

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.939 
significant figure is 1 and the second
significant<00:00:55.739> figure<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.280> nine<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.620> next

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
significant figure is nine and the next

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.700 
significant figure is nine and the next
one<00:00:59.070> number<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.550> six<00:01:00.180> which<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:01.410> course

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
one number is six which is of course

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.630 
one number is six which is of course
more<00:01:01.920> than<00:01:02.100> five<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> must<00:01:03.539> add<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.129> nine

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
more than five so I must add one to nine

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.109 
more than five so I must add one to nine
if<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.270> add<00:01:06.510> 1<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.020> 9<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.950> my<00:01:08.220> answer<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.850> 20

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
if I add 1 to 9 I get my answer as 20

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.830 
if I add 1 to 9 I get my answer as 20
next<00:01:12.119> eight<00:01:13.549> one<00:01:14.659> four<00:01:15.659> point<00:01:16.409> five<00:01:17.189> two<00:01:17.939> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
next eight one four point five two so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.580 
next eight one four point five two so
the<00:01:18.990> first<00:01:19.290> significant<00:01:19.979> figure<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.430> 8<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
the first significant figure is 8 and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.840 
the first significant figure is 8 and
the<00:01:22.590> second<00:01:23.070> significant<00:01:23.670> figure<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
the second significant figure is one and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.249 
the second significant figure is one and
the<00:01:26.850> next<00:01:27.150> row<00:01:27.210> number<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.630> four<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the next row number is four and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.160 
the next row number is four and
according<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.430> rule<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.210> less<00:01:30.450> just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
according to the rule for or less just

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
according to the rule for or less just
ignore<00:01:31.619> okay<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:33.210> gonna<00:01:33.360> write<00:01:33.659> 8<00:01:34.189> 1<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.400> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
ignore okay so I'm gonna write 8 1 as it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.480 
ignore okay so I'm gonna write 8 1 as it
is<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.869> remaining<00:01:37.170> places<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.310> have

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
is and the remaining places I just have

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.580 
is and the remaining places I just have
to<00:01:38.640> write<00:01:38.790> zeros<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.200> answer<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.450> 810

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
to write zeros so my answer is 810

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.069 
to write zeros so my answer is 810
because<00:01:43.590> after<00:01:44.430> decimal<00:01:44.880> there's<00:01:45.360> no<00:01:45.509> point

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
because after decimal there's no point

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
because after decimal there's no point
writing<00:01:46.740> zeroes<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.909> my<00:01:48.030> answer<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.500> 810<00:01:49.520> ok

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
writing zeroes so my answer is 810 ok

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.330 
writing zeroes so my answer is 810 ok
let's<00:01:51.329> down<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> last<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.140> zero<00:01:52.799> point

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
let's down to the last one zero point

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.929 
let's down to the last one zero point
zero<00:01:53.670> zero<00:01:54.829> seven<00:01:55.829> four<00:01:56.719> seven<00:01:57.740> now<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
zero zero seven four seven now here the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.569 
zero zero seven four seven now here the
first<00:01:59.969> significant<00:02:00.960> figure<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.350> 7<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
first significant figure is 7 and the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.440 
first significant figure is 7 and the
next<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.560> four<00:02:04.590> ok<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.030> next<00:02:06.180> door

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
next one is four ok and the next door

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.469 
next one is four ok and the next door
number<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.990> seven<00:02:07.829> more<00:02:08.310> than<00:02:08.489> five<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.270> add

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
number is seven more than five so add

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.650 
number is seven more than five so add
one<00:02:10.610> ok<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.670> my<00:02:11.970> answer<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.840> zero

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
one ok so my answer is going to be zero

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.150 
one ok so my answer is going to be zero
point<00:02:13.840> zero<00:02:14.830> zero<00:02:15.660> seven<00:02:16.710> five<00:02:18.300> that's<00:02:19.300> it
