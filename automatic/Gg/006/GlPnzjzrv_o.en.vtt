we had recommended and it really turned
out<00:01:48.280> nice<00:01:48.610> because<00:01:49.240> there<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.540> synergism

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
out nice because there is a synergism

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.530 
out nice because there is a synergism
when<00:01:50.890> everything<00:01:51.640> starts<00:01:52.030> working<00:01:52.390> together

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
when everything starts working together

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.359 
when everything starts working together
you<00:01:53.440> know<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.770> front<00:01:54.130> suspension

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
you know the front suspension

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.750 
you know the front suspension
complements<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.420> rear<00:01:55.630> suspension<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.760> then

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
complements the rear suspension and then

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.120 
complements the rear suspension and then
it<00:01:57.880> just<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.210> like<00:01:58.390> 1<00:01:58.900> &amp;<00:01:59.110> 1<00:01:59.320> doesn't<00:01:59.710> equal<00:01:59.920> to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
it just is like 1 &amp; 1 doesn't equal to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.000 
it just is like 1 &amp; 1 doesn't equal to
anymore<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.610> equals<00:02:00.850> 3<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.840> know<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.350> think

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
anymore it equals 3 you know I think

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.520 
anymore it equals 3 you know I think
