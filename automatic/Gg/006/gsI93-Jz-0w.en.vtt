00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
just look at the bogie wheels here we

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.569 
just look at the bogie wheels here we
have<00:01:36.720> six<00:01:37.079> bogie<00:01:37.350> wheels<00:01:37.680> /<00:01:38.100> two<00:01:38.310> Panzer<00:01:38.939> three

now I think that red text just meant

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.719 
now I think that red text just meant
that<00:01:44.340> someone<00:01:45.299> was<00:01:45.420> capturing<00:01:45.899> Zone<00:01:46.229> C<00:01:46.740> but

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

you can see the movement of the Panzer
tank<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.380> lot<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.740> people<00:01:52.979> are<00:01:53.340> questioning

be<00:04:01.110> in<00:04:01.140> game<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:02.220> he<00:04:02.310> had<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.459> Panzer<00:04:02.820> 3oz<00:04:03.269> fell

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
be in game so he had the Panzer 3oz fell

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.820 
be in game so he had the Panzer 3oz fell
he's<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.950> for<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.250> panzer<00:04:05.640> 4<00:04:05.670> i'll<00:04:06.090> see<00:04:06.830> way

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
he's going for the panzer 4 i'll see way

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.880 
he's going for the panzer 4 i'll see way
which<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:08.280> at<00:04:08.430> tier<00:04:08.760> 3<00:04:09.330> pretty<00:04:10.170> early<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.860> you

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
which is at tier 3 pretty early so you

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.190 
which is at tier 3 pretty early so you
can<00:04:11.100> kind<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.549> see<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.910> tiering<00:04:12.810> i<00:04:12.900> think

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
can kind of see that tiering i think

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.050 
can kind of see that tiering i think
we'll<00:04:13.380> go<00:04:13.560> more<00:04:13.920> towards<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.400> armament<00:04:14.940> and

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
we'll go more towards the armament and

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.289 
we'll go more towards the armament and
less<00:04:15.390> towards<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:16.320> armor<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:17.040> most<00:04:17.519> cases<00:04:17.700> I

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
less towards the armor in most cases I

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.020 
less towards the armor in most cases I
mean<00:04:19.049> seeing<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.500> panzer<00:04:19.890> 4<00:04:19.919> at<00:04:20.340> tier<00:04:20.609> 3<00:04:20.880> which

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
mean seeing a panzer 4 at tier 3 which

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.870 
mean seeing a panzer 4 at tier 3 which
is<00:04:21.060> obviously<00:04:21.600> subject<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.320> change<00:04:22.880> this

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
is obviously subject to change this

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.190 
is obviously subject to change this
guy's<00:04:24.090> calling<00:04:24.450> an<00:04:24.539> artillery

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
guy's calling an artillery

guy's calling an artillery
another<00:04:25.890> Panzer<00:04:26.460> pains<00:04:26.880> are<00:04:27.030> three<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:27.390> looks

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
another Panzer pains are three it looks

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.760 
another Panzer pains are three it looks
like<00:04:28.460> Crouching<00:04:29.460> up<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.630> level<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.440> quality

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
like Crouching up the level of quality

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.050 
like Crouching up the level of quality
look<00:04:31.950> at<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.160> guy<00:04:32.280> getting<00:04:32.580> caught<00:04:32.760> on<00:04:32.910> the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
look at that guy getting caught on the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.930 
look at that guy getting caught on the
tank<00:04:33.300> trap<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.540> was<00:04:33.840> amazing<00:04:34.490> yeah<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:35.760> the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
tank trap that was amazing yeah so the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.740 
tank trap that was amazing yeah so the
terrain<00:04:36.390> is<00:04:36.740> rather<00:04:37.740> dynamic<00:04:38.550> now<00:04:39.420> people

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
terrain is rather dynamic now people

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.720 
terrain is rather dynamic now people
were<00:04:39.840> talking<00:04:40.080> about<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.590> basically<00:04:41.340> close

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
were talking about the basically close

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.820 
were talking about the basically close
proximity<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.360> these<00:04:42.480> maps<00:04:42.750> this<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.650> rather

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
proximity of these maps this is rather

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.200 
proximity of these maps this is rather
short<00:04:43.950> and<00:04:44.340> look<00:04:44.460> at<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:44.640> kind<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:44.970> just

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
short and look at this kind of just

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.930 
short and look at this kind of just
cliff<00:04:45.570> area<00:04:45.870> it's<00:04:46.050> very<00:04:46.140> dynamic<00:04:46.890> as<00:04:47.040> far<00:04:47.820> as

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
cliff area it's very dynamic as far as

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.570 
cliff area it's very dynamic as far as
like<00:04:48.150> elevation<00:04:48.720> let's<00:04:48.930> rain<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:49.680> just<00:04:50.400> all

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
like elevation let's rain and just all

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.580 
like elevation let's rain and just all
the<00:04:50.850> little<00:04:51.300> details<00:04:51.540> going<00:04:52.140> into<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.500> and

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
the little details going into it and

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.280 
the little details going into it and
he's<00:04:52.740> calling<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.130> an<00:04:53.220> artillery<00:04:53.670> strike<00:04:54.290> well

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
he's calling it an artillery strike well

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.220 
he's calling it an artillery strike well
it<00:04:55.410> looks<00:04:55.590> like<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.770> Panzer<00:04:56.220> for<00:04:56.430> Alf<00:04:56.610> see

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
it looks like a Panzer for Alf see

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.430 
it looks like a Panzer for Alf see
potentially<00:04:58.230> yeah<00:04:59.160> but<00:05:00.090> um<00:05:00.270> people<00:05:01.200> were

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
potentially yeah but um people were

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.230 
potentially yeah but um people were
saying<00:05:01.650> oh<00:05:01.860> these<00:05:02.040> maps<00:05:02.340> look<00:05:02.610> kind<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:02.940> close

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
saying oh these maps look kind of close

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.330 
saying oh these maps look kind of close
and<00:05:03.540> for<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.230> most<00:05:04.410> part<00:05:04.560> you're<00:05:04.980> going<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.220> be

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
and for the most part you're going to be

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.530 
and for the most part you're going to be
going<00:05:05.580> for<00:05:06.390> close<00:05:06.720> maps<00:05:07.140> with<00:05:07.530> our<00:05:07.740> Kate<00:05:08.070> and

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
going for close maps with our Kate and

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.000 
going for close maps with our Kate and
historical<00:05:09.540> battles<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.020> then<00:05:10.170> eventual<00:05:10.680> for

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
historical battles and then eventual for

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.920 
historical battles and then eventual for
real<00:05:11.250> battles<00:05:11.670> are<00:05:11.880> going<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.360> be<00:05:12.420> completely

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
real battles are going to be completely

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.470 
real battles are going to be completely
different<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:14.430> can<00:05:14.610> kind<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.880> tell<00:05:15.120> like<00:05:15.330> I

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
different you can kind of tell like I

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.540 
different you can kind of tell like I
think<00:05:15.690> when<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.380> look<00:05:16.410> at<00:05:16.860> look<00:05:17.400> at<00:05:17.490> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
think when you look at look at the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.180 
think when you look at look at the
turret<00:05:18.120> just<00:05:18.330> popping<00:05:18.720> off<00:05:18.840> right<00:05:19.110> there<00:05:19.380> when

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
turret just popping off right there when

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.180 
turret just popping off right there when
you<00:05:20.310> look<00:05:20.520> at<00:05:20.700> maps<00:05:20.970> right<00:05:21.330> now<00:05:21.480> for<00:05:21.720> planes

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
you look at maps right now for planes

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.250 
you look at maps right now for planes
generally<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.970> arcade<00:05:24.450> maps<00:05:24.750> are<00:05:25.020> more

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
generally the arcade maps are more

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.330 
generally the arcade maps are more
dynamic<00:05:25.890> they're<00:05:26.100> smaller<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:28.340> there's

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
dynamic they're smaller and there's

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.940 
dynamic they're smaller and there's
greater<00:05:30.060> elevation<00:05:30.690> changes<00:05:31.080> which<00:05:31.320> is<00:05:31.500> very

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
greater elevation changes which is very

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.470 
greater elevation changes which is very
similar<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.610> what<00:05:32.760> we're<00:05:32.970> seeing<00:05:33.120> here<00:05:33.240> with

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
similar to what we're seeing here with

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.480 
similar to what we're seeing here with
tanks<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.860> looks<00:05:35.010> like<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.250> enemy's

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
tanks and it looks like the enemy's

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.920 
tanks and it looks like the enemy's
capturing<00:05:36.000> a<00:05:36.180> right<00:05:36.420> now<00:05:36.540> that<00:05:36.720> little

you yet who knows if they will in the

you yet who knows if they will in the

future but in historical battles with

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.470 
future but in historical battles with
planes<00:05:49.170> you<00:05:49.380> have<00:05:49.590> bigger<00:05:50.220> flatter<00:05:50.790> maps<00:05:51.150> and

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
planes you have bigger flatter maps and

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.340 
planes you have bigger flatter maps and
I<00:05:51.570> expect<00:05:52.050> that<00:05:52.320> to<00:05:53.070> be<00:05:53.100> more<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.850> case

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
I expect that to be more the case

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.450 
I expect that to be more the case
because<00:05:55.350> you're<00:05:55.470> going<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.650> have<00:05:55.860> maps<00:05:56.220> that

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
because you're going to have maps that

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.060 
because you're going to have maps that
are<00:05:56.520> based<00:05:57.300> off<00:05:57.480> of<00:05:57.540> historical<00:05:58.440> battle<00:05:58.770> sites

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
are based off of historical battle sites

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.850 
are based off of historical battle sites
and<00:05:59.310> there's<00:06:00.060> not<00:06:00.270> too<00:06:00.480> many<00:06:00.600> high<00:06:01.020> elevation

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
and there's not too many high elevation

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.880 
and there's not too many high elevation
maps<00:06:02.070> though<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:03.000> could<00:06:03.330> get<00:06:04.170> some<00:06:04.470> but<00:06:04.860> I

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
maps though you could get some but I

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.260 
maps though you could get some but I
think<00:06:05.190> for<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.460> most<00:06:05.670> part<00:06:05.910> they're<00:06:06.090> going<00:06:06.210> to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
think for the most part they're going to

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.820 
think for the most part they're going to
be<00:06:06.330> flattered<00:06:06.780> Maps<00:06:07.110> not<00:06:07.350> to<00:06:07.500> say<00:06:07.650> they're

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
be flattered Maps not to say they're

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.320 
be flattered Maps not to say they're
completely<00:06:08.370> flat<00:06:08.790> there's<00:06:09.060> going<00:06:09.240> to<00:06:09.300> be

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
completely flat there's going to be

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.110 
completely flat there's going to be
heels<00:06:09.690> to<00:06:09.930> make<00:06:10.050> things<00:06:10.260> dynamic<00:06:10.950> but<00:06:11.700> I<00:06:11.730> think

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
heels to make things dynamic but I think

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.610 
heels to make things dynamic but I think
mobility<00:06:13.970> maneuvering<00:06:14.970> in<00:06:15.470> planning<00:06:16.470> with

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
mobility maneuvering in planning with

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.070 
mobility maneuvering in planning with
your<00:06:16.830> teammates<00:06:17.550> and<00:06:17.820> in<00:06:18.000> within<00:06:18.300> your<00:06:18.690> squad

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
your teammates and in within your squad

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.040 
your teammates and in within your squad
is<00:06:19.290> going<00:06:19.500> to<00:06:19.560> be<00:06:19.680> have<00:06:20.640> much<00:06:21.090> more<00:06:21.420> importance

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
is going to be have much more importance

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.160 
is going to be have much more importance
look<00:06:22.920> at<00:06:23.010> this<00:06:23.100> guy<00:06:23.220> falling<00:06:23.640> down<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:24.360> he<00:06:24.990> is

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
look at this guy falling down and he is

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.520 
look at this guy falling down and he is
done<00:06:25.500> generally<00:06:26.340> when<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:26.580> flip<00:06:26.940> your<00:06:27.120> tank

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
done generally when you flip your tank

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.680 
done generally when you flip your tank
you<00:06:28.530> blow<00:06:28.800> up<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:29.280> do<00:06:29.430> we<00:06:29.550> see<00:06:29.760> the<00:06:29.880> timer<00:06:30.210> yeah

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
you blow up and do we see the timer yeah

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.870 
you blow up and do we see the timer yeah
there<00:06:30.870> it<00:06:30.960> is<00:06:31.050> it's<00:06:31.650> basically<00:06:32.100> the<00:06:32.220> J<00:06:32.580> count

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
there it is it's basically the J count

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.279 
there it is it's basically the J count
from<00:06:33.170> 320

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
from 320

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.149 
from 320
right<00:06:34.439> there<00:06:35.330> so<00:06:36.330> flip<00:06:36.899> this<00:06:37.050> tank<00:06:37.349> and<00:06:37.860> you're

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
right there so flip this tank and you're

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.540 
right there so flip this tank and you're
done<00:06:38.369> but<00:06:39.240> definitely<00:06:40.069> what<00:06:41.069> you<00:06:41.219> should<00:06:41.279> get

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
done but definitely what you should get

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.059 
done but definitely what you should get
out<00:06:41.729> of<00:06:41.759> this<00:06:42.029> is<00:06:42.349> with<00:06:43.349> artillery<00:06:43.710> strikes

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
out of this is with artillery strikes

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:45.529 
out of this is with artillery strikes
heavy<00:06:44.309> tanks<00:06:44.610> won't<00:06:44.789> have<00:06:44.999> that<00:06:45.029> and<00:06:45.389> that

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
heavy tanks won't have that and that

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.519 
heavy tanks won't have that and that
kind<00:06:45.779> of<00:06:45.809> forces<00:06:46.409> things<00:06:46.740> to<00:06:47.039> not<00:06:47.819> say<00:06:48.149> so

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 
kind of forces things to not say so

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:51.920 
kind of forces things to not say so
stagnant<00:06:49.529> and<00:06:49.979> then<00:06:50.789> with<00:06:50.999> historical<00:06:51.569> battle

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
stagnant and then with historical battle

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.260 
stagnant and then with historical battle
maps<00:06:52.139> expect<00:06:52.680> them<00:06:52.830> to<00:06:52.979> be<00:06:53.099> bigger<00:06:53.369> expect

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270

them<00:06:54.479> to<00:06:55.139> have<00:06:55.319> maneuvering<00:06:56.099> play<00:06:56.699> more<00:06:56.999> of<00:06:57.029> a

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
them to have maneuvering play more of a

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.909 
them to have maneuvering play more of a
role<00:06:57.300> so<00:06:57.749> it's<00:06:57.899> not<00:06:57.990> just<00:06:58.050> run<00:06:58.559> up<00:06:58.710> to<00:06:58.830> each

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
role so it's not just run up to each

role so it's not just run up to each
other<00:06:59.129> and<00:06:59.249> then<00:06:59.369> slug<00:06:59.789> it<00:06:59.909> out<00:07:00.050> maneuvering

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050

is going to be a key aspect what I

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:07.519 
is going to be a key aspect what I

be<00:07:17.419> more<00:07:18.419> dependent<00:07:18.930> on<00:07:18.990> maneuvering<00:07:19.860> so<00:07:20.099> fear

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
be more dependent on maneuvering so fear

here<00:07:26.580> we<00:07:26.639> have<00:07:26.669> the<00:07:26.819> kv-1<00:07:27.209> look<00:07:27.360> at<00:07:27.479> that<00:07:27.629> rear

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
here we have the kv-1 look at that rear

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.929 
here we have the kv-1 look at that rear
machine<00:07:28.709> gun<00:07:28.889> facing<00:07:29.099> the<00:07:29.309> turn<00:07:29.520> and<00:07:29.699> look<00:07:29.819> at

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:29.939 
machine gun facing the turn and look at

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:31.909 
machine gun facing the turn and look at
that<00:07:30.059> front<00:07:30.389> of<00:07:30.509> that<00:07:30.599> turret<00:07:30.959> as<00:07:31.080> he<00:07:31.649> fires

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 
that front of that turret as he fires

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.739 
that front of that turret as he fires
that<00:07:32.309> cannon<00:07:32.569> base<00:07:33.569> mode<00:07:33.839> we<00:07:34.020> also<00:07:34.139> see<00:07:34.469> a<00:07:34.499> stug

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:35.749 
that cannon base mode we also see a stug

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:38.600 
that cannon base mode we also see a stug
3<00:07:36.749> and<00:07:37.050> then<00:07:37.229> another<00:07:37.499> kb1<00:07:37.949> and<00:07:38.189> check<00:07:38.370> out<00:07:38.490> the

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610 
3 and then another kb1 and check out the

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.219 
3 and then another kb1 and check out the
rear<00:07:38.789> of<00:07:38.819> that<00:07:38.939> stuff<00:07:39.269> look<00:07:39.479> at<00:07:39.569> the<00:07:39.659> detail

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:40.229 
rear of that stuff look at the detail

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:42.079 
rear of that stuff look at the detail
and<00:07:40.439> so<00:07:41.099> he's<00:07:41.339> going<00:07:41.459> to<00:07:41.519> be<00:07:41.610> following<00:07:41.969> this

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.089 
and so he's going to be following this

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:44.749 
and so he's going to be following this
kb1<00:07:42.449> now<00:07:42.990> as<00:07:43.110> you're<00:07:43.259> looking<00:07:43.379> at<00:07:43.649> this<00:07:44.219> KP<00:07:44.610> one

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 
kb1 now as you're looking at this KP one

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:48.709 
kb1 now as you're looking at this KP one
seems<00:07:45.059> to<00:07:45.180> be<00:07:45.269> moving<00:07:45.419> pretty<00:07:45.779> quickly<00:07:46.169> um<00:07:47.719> to

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:48.719 
seems to be moving pretty quickly um to

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:51.019 
seems to be moving pretty quickly um to
the<00:07:48.959> level<00:07:49.229> of<00:07:49.289> detail<00:07:49.349> that<00:07:49.709> the<00:07:50.129> trees<00:07:50.610> the

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:51.029 
the level of detail that the trees the

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:53.509 
the level of detail that the trees the
