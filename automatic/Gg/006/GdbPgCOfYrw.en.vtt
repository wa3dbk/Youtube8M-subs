00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
I think this should be safe but I don't

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.389 
I think this should be safe but I don't
know<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.140> first<00:01:54.350> time<00:01:54.530> doing<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:54.920> maybe<00:01:55.189> I'll

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
know so first time doing it maybe I'll

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.510 
know so first time doing it maybe I'll
throw<00:01:55.610> these<00:01:55.729> top<00:01:56.060> ones<00:01:56.299> off<00:01:57.159> because<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.280> see

now maybe we'll do a video on that but
right<00:05:23.939> now<00:05:24.059> as<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.300> lacto-fermented<00:05:24.900> pickles<00:05:25.710> I

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
right now as a lacto-fermented pickles I

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.640 
right now as a lacto-fermented pickles I
believe<00:05:26.069> you<00:05:26.189> could<00:05:26.309> call<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.569> fermented

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
believe you could call it fermented

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.989 
believe you could call it fermented
carrots<00:05:28.909> and<00:05:29.909> peppers<00:05:31.370> and<00:05:32.809> so<00:05:33.809> this<00:05:34.289> is

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:34.999 
carrots and peppers and so this is

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.179 
carrots and peppers and so this is
basically<00:05:35.999> to<00:05:36.360> wild<00:05:36.719> fermentation<00:05:36.930> it's<00:05:37.889> just

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
basically to wild fermentation it's just

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.600 
basically to wild fermentation it's just
using<00:05:38.550> what's<00:05:38.789> on<00:05:39.539> the<00:05:39.870> produce<00:05:40.680> itself<00:05:41.309> and

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
using what's on the produce itself and

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.480 
using what's on the produce itself and
from<00:05:42.479> the<00:05:42.569> air<00:05:42.749> around<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.949> know<00:05:44.069> when<00:05:44.279> I<00:05:44.309> was

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
from the air around you know when I was

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.119 
from the air around you know when I was
making<00:05:44.909> this<00:05:45.059> and<00:05:45.360> you<00:05:45.960> know<00:05:46.110> so<00:05:46.379> that's<00:05:46.860> all

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
making this and you know so that's all

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.920 
making this and you know so that's all
that's<00:05:47.339> called<00:05:47.610> wild<00:05:47.789> fermentation<00:05:48.059> so

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
that's called wild fermentation so

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.020 
that's called wild fermentation so
pretty<00:05:51.930> cool
