when I wanted to mechanical keyboard I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.430

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
did a lot of research and I ended up

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.900 
did a lot of research and I ended up
picking<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.829> Das<00:00:41.010> Keyboard<00:00:41.219> because<00:00:41.760> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
picking the Das Keyboard because it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940 
picking the Das Keyboard because it
seemed<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.480> best<00:00:42.590> overall<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
seemed like the best overall and I

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
seemed like the best overall and I
didn't<00:00:44.190> read<00:00:44.550> any<00:00:44.760> problems<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
didn't read any problems now with the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.410 
didn't read any problems now with the
Razer<00:00:46.590> BlackWidow<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.850> found<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.360> just

Razer BlackWidow I have found not just

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
Razer BlackWidow I have found not just
one<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.050> several<00:00:49.469> people<00:00:49.890> saying

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
one or two but several people saying

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.709 
one or two but several people saying
they<00:00:50.430> had<00:00:50.550> issues<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> keyboard<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
they had issues with the keyboard and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.290 
they had issues with the keyboard and
the<00:00:52.379> main<00:00:52.559> complaint<00:00:52.949> was<00:00:53.100> sticky<00:00:53.730> keys<00:00:54.030> or

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the main complaint was sticky keys or

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.500 
the main complaint was sticky keys or
keys<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.690> pressed<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.110> other<00:00:55.379> keys<00:00:56.390> seems<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
keys that pressed on other keys seems to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.119 
keys that pressed on other keys seems to
be<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> pretty<00:00:57.870> well-documented<00:00:58.410> issue<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
be a pretty well-documented issue and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
be a pretty well-documented issue and
the<00:00:59.250> reason<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.690> keys

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the reason for that is because the keys

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.979 
the reason for that is because the keys
are<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.010> close<00:01:02.399> together<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:03.780> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
are so so so close together that it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.289 
are so so so close together that it's
way<00:01:04.199> too<00:01:04.260> easy<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:05.010> key<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.640> push<00:01:05.909> down

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
way too easy for one key to push down

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.580 
way too easy for one key to push down
the<00:01:06.360> edge<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.900> another<00:01:07.080> key<00:01:07.350> when<00:01:07.500> you're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
keyboard means that for you the typing

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
keyboard means that for you the typing
experience<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.700> most<00:01:53.880> important<00:01:54.299> thing

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
experience is the most important thing

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.209 
experience is the most important thing
you<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> highest<00:01:54.960> quality<00:01:55.229> keys<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you with the highest quality keys and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.789 
you with the highest quality keys and
key<00:01:56.340> presses<00:01:57.110> looking<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> dots<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.680> know

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
key presses looking at the dots you know

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
key presses looking at the dots you know
if<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.950> push<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> upper<00:01:59.969> corner<00:02:00.689> as

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
if I push this in the upper corner as

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.080 
if I push this in the upper corner as
far<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.079> possible<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.680> key<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.460> still<00:02:02.850> totally

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
far as possible the key is still totally

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.560 
far as possible the key is still totally
100%<00:02:03.960> functional<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:05.670> any<00:02:06.090> key<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
100% functional or any key on the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.080 
100% functional or any key on the
keyboard<00:02:06.750> totally<00:02:07.439> fine<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.849> you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
keyboard totally fine but this one you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.359 
keyboard totally fine but this one you
know

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
know

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.330 
know
getting<00:02:11.360> stuck<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.140> pushing<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> other<00:02:13.010> key

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
getting stuck and pushing the other key

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.059 
getting stuck and pushing the other key
down<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.970> messes<00:02:14.959> up<00:02:15.080> your<00:02:15.230> your<00:02:15.739> speed<00:02:15.950> of

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
don't even want to exchange it because I

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.869 
don't even want to exchange it because I
do<00:02:33.049> not<00:02:33.260> believe<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:35.410> flaw<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.440> my

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
do not believe that this is a flaw in my

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.680 
do not believe that this is a flaw in my
keyboard<00:02:37.879> specifically<00:02:38.420> they've<00:02:38.569> been

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
keyboard specifically they've been

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.479 
keyboard specifically they've been
manufacturing<00:02:39.349> these<00:02:39.470> for<00:02:39.739> how<00:02:39.860> long<00:02:40.069> now

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
manufacturing these for how long now

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.780 
manufacturing these for how long now
and<00:02:41.530> more<00:02:42.530> than<00:02:42.709> one<00:02:42.829> person's<00:02:43.190> had<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.519> issue

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and more than one person's had the issue

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.360 
and more than one person's had the issue
so<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:45.049> shows<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.829> flaw<00:02:46.069> in<00:02:46.220> the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
so it shows that it's a flaw in the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.850 
so it shows that it's a flaw in the
design<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.569> random<00:02:47.860> happening

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
design and not just a random happening

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.000 
design and not just a random happening
some<00:02:49.280> people<00:02:49.519> might<00:02:49.640> get<00:02:49.790> lucky<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:51.079> know

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
some people might get lucky and you know

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.890 
some people might get lucky and you know
it<00:02:52.250> works<00:02:52.459> OK<00:02:52.819> for<00:02:52.880> them<00:02:53.090> or<00:02:53.360> they<00:02:53.569> just<00:02:53.599> have<00:02:53.870> a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
it works OK for them or they just have a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.930 
it works OK for them or they just have a
better<00:02:54.440> typing<00:02:55.280> posture<00:02:55.640> or<00:02:55.760> they<00:02:55.849> don't

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
better typing posture or they don't

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.390 
better typing posture or they don't
press<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.209> key<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.690> bad<00:02:56.870> area<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:58.190> there's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
press that key in a bad area but there's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.920 
press that key in a bad area but there's
not<00:02:58.579> supposed<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:58.940> be<00:02:59.060> any<00:02:59.209> compromise<00:02:59.510> it's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
not supposed to be any compromise it's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.259 
not supposed to be any compromise it's
$140<00:03:00.680> keyboard<00:03:01.099> if<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.670> doesn't<00:03:01.910> work<00:03:02.030> 100%

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
$140 keyboard if it doesn't work 100%

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.690 
$140 keyboard if it doesn't work 100%
then<00:03:03.019> don't<00:03:03.799> deal<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.099> it<00:03:04.310> that's<00:03:04.430> all<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:04.640> can

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
then don't deal with it that's all I can

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.900 
then don't deal with it that's all I can
say<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.599> hopefully<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.680> warning<00:03:07.310> gets<00:03:07.730> out

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
say so hopefully this warning gets out

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.240 
say so hopefully this warning gets out
and<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:09.290> guys<00:03:09.440> choose<00:03:09.769> wisely

and you guys choose wisely
if<00:03:10.430> you're<00:03:10.640> thinking<00:03:11.150> about<00:03:11.269> getting<00:03:11.420> this

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
if you're thinking about getting this

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.069 
if you're thinking about getting this
keyboard<00:03:11.840> or<00:03:12.200> there's<00:03:12.620> something<00:03:12.890> similar
