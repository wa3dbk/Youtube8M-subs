it's<00:00:25.050> not<00:00:25.170> too<00:00:25.410> exciting<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.640> back<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
it's not too exciting but the back is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
it's not too exciting but the back is
the<00:00:28.109> new<00:00:28.289> version<00:00:28.740> which<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.010> not<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.490> like

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the new version which I do not like like

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.580 
the new version which I do not like like
I<00:00:29.789> shouldn't<00:00:30.060> ask<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.539> review<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I shouldn't ask in that review and you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
I shouldn't ask in that review and you
can<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.059> such<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> pain<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.390> open<00:00:33.690> they

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
can see that such a pain to open they

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.030 
can see that such a pain to open they
should<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:33.989> believed<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> original<00:00:34.649> way

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
should have believed it the original way

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
should have believed it the original way
but<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> had<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:36.000> punch<00:00:36.210> hole<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.570> this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
but I had a little punch hole on this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
but I had a little punch hole on this
whole<00:00:36.870> outline<00:00:37.500> right<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.950> even<00:00:38.700> though

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
whole outline right here even though

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.130 
whole outline right here even though
it's<00:00:38.969> still<00:00:39.149> hard<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> open<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> way

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it's still hard to open this is way

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.590 
it's still hard to open this is way
harder<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.710> damages<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> box<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.300> there's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
harder and damages the box so there's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.729 
harder and damages the box so there's
that<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.260> course<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.649> an

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that and then of course you get an

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.229 
that and then of course you get an
instruction<00:00:44.100> booklet<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:45.059> don't<00:00:45.120> think

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
instruction booklet and I don't think

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.760 
instruction booklet and I don't think
I've<00:00:45.420> showed<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.930> connect<00:00:46.260> review

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
I've showed this in this connect review

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.250 
I've showed this in this connect review
but<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:48.059> instruction<00:00:48.420> booklet<00:00:48.570> does<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
but the instruction booklet does have a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
but the instruction booklet does have a
new<00:00:49.620> checklist<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.879> there's

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
new checklist and you can see there's

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.069 
new checklist and you can see there's
basically<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> minifigures<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
Ferdie and Skynet count as lion so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.810 
Ferdie and Skynet count as lion so
that's<00:00:57.539> kind<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.750> interesting<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.609> they<00:00:59.609> show

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
which is cool and then the combination

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
which is cool and then the combination

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it's not anything too exciting but I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.480

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
think that's pretty clear and see yeah

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.060 
think that's pretty clear and see yeah
that's<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.990> analysis<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> cards<00:01:13.439> so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that's it for that analysis of cards so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
that's it for that analysis of cards so
here<00:01:14.369> are<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.000> cards<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.479> set<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> course<00:01:16.020> you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
of a similar torso print and then they

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.100 
of a similar torso print and then they
can<00:02:18.040> kind<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:18.940> similar<00:02:19.210> faces<00:02:19.840> with<00:02:19.990> the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
can kind of have similar faces with the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.650 
can kind of have similar faces with the
beard<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.460> see<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.850> what<00:02:22.150> his<00:02:22.300> normal

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
beard you can see it what his normal

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.700 
beard you can see it what his normal
headpiece<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.320> there

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
headpiece on you there

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.470 
headpiece on you there
so<00:02:24.160> Alma<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:24.580> probably<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.030> me<00:02:25.150> or<00:02:25.360> they

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
so Alma it's probably just me or they

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.090 
so Alma it's probably just me or they
made<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.200> he<00:02:26.350> looks<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.740> little<00:02:26.980> bit

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
made it so he looks like a little bit

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.740 
made it so he looks like a little bit
like<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> sparring<00:02:27.760> but<00:02:28.270> I<00:02:28.300> think<00:02:28.600> that's

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
like a sparring but I think that's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.910 
like a sparring but I think that's
pretty<00:02:28.870> cool<00:02:29.110> because<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.410> party's<00:02:29.860> a

cut<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.630> set<00:03:22.810> doesn't<00:03:23.140> want<00:03:23.260> two<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.530> these

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
cut it the set doesn't want two of these

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.730 
cut it the set doesn't want two of these
so<00:03:23.830> you<00:03:23.860> can<00:03:23.950> use<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.340> as<00:03:24.640> actually<00:03:24.880> piece<00:03:25.270> and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
so you can use it as actually piece and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.050 
so you can use it as actually piece and
then<00:03:26.740> his<00:03:27.010> little<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.340> guess<00:03:27.400> blade<00:03:27.880> or

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
then his little I guess blade or

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.760 
then his little I guess blade or
whatever<00:03:28.330> kind<00:03:28.990> of<00:03:29.080> base<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.440> that's<00:03:29.620> so

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
whatever kind of base it that's so

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.250 
whatever kind of base it that's so
pretty<00:03:29.980> cool<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.270> here<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.690> this<00:03:31.840> bead<00:03:32.080> or

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
pretty cool and so here is this bead or

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.590 
pretty cool and so here is this bead or
you<00:03:32.950> can<00:03:33.040> see<00:03:33.190> there's<00:03:33.400> probably<00:03:34.210> this<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.420> one

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
you can see there's probably this is one

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.060 
you can see there's probably this is one
of<00:03:34.630> my<00:03:34.750> favorite<00:03:35.110> speeders<00:03:35.470> along<00:03:35.920> were

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
of my favorite speeders along were

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.070 
of my favorite speeders along were
skinned<00:03:36.340> EPS<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:36.730> ferdy's<00:03:37.510> which<00:03:37.690> comes<00:03:37.900> out

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
skinned EPS and ferdy's which comes out

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.900 
skinned EPS and ferdy's which comes out
later<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.440> year<00:03:38.500> because<00:03:39.160> it's<00:03:39.310> really<00:03:39.670> cool

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
later this year because it's really cool

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.540 
later this year because it's really cool
to<00:03:40.060> have<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.180> golden<00:03:40.660> speeder<00:03:41.020> so<00:03:41.860> I<00:03:42.160> think<00:03:42.430> that

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
to have a golden speeder so I think that

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.820 
to have a golden speeder so I think that
looks<00:03:42.700> really<00:03:43.000> nice<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:44.320> see<00:03:44.500> there's<00:03:44.680> lots

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
looks really nice you see there's lots

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.100 
looks really nice you see there's lots
of<00:03:44.980> pearl<00:03:45.940> gold<00:03:46.270> but<00:03:46.480> it's<00:03:46.600> still<00:03:46.720> pretty<00:03:46.840> cool

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
of pearl gold but it's still pretty cool

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.350 
of pearl gold but it's still pretty cool
and<00:03:47.470> it's<00:03:48.070> a<00:03:48.130> nice<00:03:48.310> front<00:03:48.610> detail<00:03:49.060> with<00:03:49.210> the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
and it's a nice front detail with the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.450 
and it's a nice front detail with the
fangs<00:03:50.170> or<00:03:50.380> whatever<00:03:50.620> right<00:03:50.800> there<00:03:50.980> at<00:03:51.070> teeth

these little teeth or whatever and I
don't<00:04:02.620> like<00:04:03.070> how<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.370> kind<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.820> pushes<00:04:04.390> out<00:04:04.630> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
don't like how it kind of pushes out the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.630 
don't like how it kind of pushes out the
Cape<00:04:04.930> but<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.350> think<00:04:05.650> it's<00:04:05.800> still<00:04:06.040> fun<00:04:06.280> at<00:04:06.490> least

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
Cape but I think it's still fun at least

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.640 
Cape but I think it's still fun at least
it<00:04:06.760> doesn't<00:04:06.880> like<00:04:07.060> damage<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.630> Cape<00:04:07.840> I'll<00:04:08.470> just

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
it doesn't like damage to Cape I'll just

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.200 
it doesn't like damage to Cape I'll just
stretch<00:04:08.860> it<00:04:09.010> out<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.160> little<00:04:09.340> bit<00:04:09.520> so<00:04:09.910> he<00:04:10.000> fits

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
stretch it out a little bit so he fits

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.060 
stretch it out a little bit so he fits
on<00:04:10.330> there<00:04:10.420> pretty<00:04:10.600> well<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.140> he<00:04:11.680> does<00:04:11.860> come

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
on there pretty well and he does come

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.730 
on there pretty well and he does come

with a yellow rip cord so here is Roose

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.979 
with a yellow rip cord so here is Roose
and<00:04:14.950> does<00:04:15.130> come<00:04:15.280> with<00:04:15.340> six<00:04:15.640> Chi<00:04:16.000> crystals<00:04:16.720> and

I<00:04:17.590> forgot<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.859> show<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:18.280> Tuscon<00:04:18.640> at<00:04:18.820> review

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
I forgot to show it in Tuscon at review

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.569 
I forgot to show it in Tuscon at review

six of these chic crystals and you kind

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.189 
six of these chic crystals and you kind
of<00:04:22.919> see<00:04:23.099> here's<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.430> 360<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.750> breaks<00:04:24.990> into

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
of see here's a 360 and it breaks into

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.600 
of see here's a 360 and it breaks into
separate<00:04:25.620> parts<00:04:25.889> which<00:04:26.039> will<00:04:26.220> show<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.430> little

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
separate parts which will show a little

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.640 
separate parts which will show a little
bit<00:04:26.759> later<00:04:26.819> see<00:04:27.629> there's<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.930> nice<00:04:28.139> perfect

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
bit later see there's that nice perfect

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.230 
bit later see there's that nice perfect
piece<00:04:28.860> which<00:04:29.159> are<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.520> little<00:04:29.729> bit<00:04:29.849> common

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
piece which are a little bit common

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.339 
piece which are a little bit common
nowadays<00:04:30.360> but<00:04:30.719> it's<00:04:30.840> always<00:04:30.930> nice<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.169> get

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
nowadays but it's always nice to get

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.159 
nowadays but it's always nice to get
those<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:32.250> these<00:04:32.460> nice<00:04:32.729> little<00:04:32.969> big<00:04:33.840> slopes

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
those and these nice little big slopes

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.040 
those and these nice little big slopes
in<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:36.110> echo<00:04:37.110> alliance<00:04:37.800> lion<00:04:38.729> yellow<00:04:39.270> which

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
in the echo alliance lion yellow which

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.830 
in the echo alliance lion yellow which
it<00:04:40.349> comes<00:04:40.650> like<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.919> I<00:04:41.069> think<00:04:41.129> in<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:42.060> ultra

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
it comes like this I think in the ultra

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.570 
it comes like this I think in the ultra
the<00:04:42.900> speed<00:04:43.139> or<00:04:43.259> battle<00:04:43.560> I'm<00:04:43.620> not<00:04:43.770> exactly<00:04:44.370> sure

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
the speed or battle I'm not exactly sure

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.409 
the speed or battle I'm not exactly sure
and<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:46.770> part<00:04:47.009> that<00:04:47.189> can<00:04:47.460> be<00:04:47.639> taken<00:04:47.969> apart<00:04:48.060> is

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
and the part that can be taken apart is

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.059 
and the part that can be taken apart is
this<00:04:48.569> top<00:04:48.810> part<00:04:49.080> we're<00:04:49.379> told<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.860> little

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
this top part we're told is a little

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.999 
this top part we're told is a little
cheap<00:04:50.400> right<00:04:51.150> there<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:52.409> it<00:04:52.500> kind<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.680> fits<00:04:52.889> in

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
cheap right there and it kind of fits in

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.689 
cheap right there and it kind of fits in
kind<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.490> like<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.789> a<00:04:54.060> little<00:04:54.509> bit<00:04:54.719> like<00:04:54.960> the

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
kind of like that a little bit like the

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.330 
kind of like that a little bit like the
the<00:04:56.699> ice<00:04:56.849> tower<00:04:57.210> set<00:04:57.599> from<00:04:57.870> spring<00:04:58.349> and<00:04:59.069> here's

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
the ice tower set from spring and here's

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.800 
the ice tower set from spring and here's
this<00:04:59.699> sector<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:00.120> could<00:05:00.360> be<00:05:00.449> taken<00:05:00.719> apart

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
this sector that could be taken apart

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.990 
this sector that could be taken apart
then<00:05:01.650> these<00:05:01.889> two<00:05:02.159> could<00:05:02.310> be<00:05:02.430> separated<00:05:02.669> so

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
then these two could be separated so

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.499 
then these two could be separated so
that<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.449> really<00:05:03.690> cool<00:05:04.039> nice<00:05:05.039> little<00:05:05.940> break<00:05:06.330> up

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
that is really cool nice little break up

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.749 
that is really cool nice little break up
right<00:05:06.659> there<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.310> you<00:05:08.310> can<00:05:08.430> kind<00:05:08.610> of<00:05:08.639> see

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
right there and you can kind of see

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.459 
right there and you can kind of see
there's<00:05:08.940> some<00:05:09.060> gold<00:05:09.240> pieces<00:05:09.509> hold<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.169> part

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
there's some gold pieces hold that part

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.290 
there's some gold pieces hold that part
so<00:05:10.710> there's<00:05:10.889> some<00:05:11.039> nice<00:05:11.190> detail<00:05:11.580> inside<00:05:12.029> there

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
so there's some nice detail inside there

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.350 
so there's some nice detail inside there
and<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:13.919> main<00:05:14.129> point<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:14.729> how<00:05:14.879> to<00:05:14.940> play<00:05:15.180> this

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
and the main point on how to play this

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.959 
and the main point on how to play this
is<00:05:15.599> it's<00:05:16.379> a<00:05:16.500> little<00:05:16.620> bit<00:05:16.710> basic<00:05:17.159> and<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.759> little

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:17.969 
is it's a little bit basic and a little

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.439 
is it's a little bit basic and a little
bit<00:05:18.060> like<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.569> ice<00:05:18.689> tower<00:05:19.129> G<00:05:20.129> game<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:21.330> what

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
bit like the ice tower G game and what

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.869 
bit like the ice tower G game and what
you<00:05:21.509> got<00:05:21.629> to<00:05:21.719> do<00:05:21.840> is<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.020> put<00:05:22.259> this<00:05:22.879> record

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 
you got to do is you put this record

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.899 
you got to do is you put this record
right<00:05:24.210> there<00:05:25.039> and<00:05:26.039> you<00:05:26.250> got<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.400> knock<00:05:26.669> that

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
right there and you got to knock that

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:35.740 
right there and you got to knock that
over<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.509> my<00:05:28.440> first<00:05:33.409> let<00:05:34.409> me<00:05:34.500> see<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:35.099> last<00:05:35.340> one

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
over so my first let me see the last one

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.209 
over so my first let me see the last one
okay<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:37.289> ever<00:05:37.440> grabbed<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.830> ball<00:05:37.949> first

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
okay you ever grabbed the ball first

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.879 
okay you ever grabbed the ball first
wins<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:39.210> that's<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.509> for<00:05:39.629> the<00:05:39.719> game<00:05:39.889> and

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
wins so that's it for the game and

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.339 
wins so that's it for the game and
Malins<00:05:41.339> fun<00:05:41.550> route<00:05:41.789> overall<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.960> think<00:05:43.050> that

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
Malins fun route overall I think that

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.079 
Malins fun route overall I think that
this<00:05:43.469> is<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:43.650> really<00:05:43.979> fantastic<00:05:44.219> set<00:05:44.849> it's

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.089 
this is a really fantastic set it's

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.980 
this is a really fantastic set it's
going<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.330> be<00:05:45.389> another<00:05:45.599> one<00:05:45.779> though<00:05:45.900> it's

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
going to be another one though it's

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.689 
going to be another one though it's
highly<00:05:46.259> sought-after<00:05:46.589> speedor<00:05:47.129> is<00:05:47.219> much<00:05:47.520> like

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
highly sought-after speedor is much like

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.790 
highly sought-after speedor is much like
this<00:05:47.819> king<00:05:48.029> that<00:05:48.150> one<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.599> even<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.379> corazon

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
this king that one and even the corazon

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.829 
this king that one and even the corazon
one<00:05:49.979> which<00:05:50.159> we'll<00:05:50.310> get<00:05:50.400> into<00:05:50.460> later<00:05:50.669> and<00:05:51.120> I

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
one which we'll get into later and I

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.110 
one which we'll get into later and I
think<00:05:52.080> all<00:05:52.319> three<00:05:52.650> of<00:05:52.830> them<00:05:53.009> of<00:05:53.219> the<00:05:53.339> $15<00:05:53.940> ones

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
think all three of them of the $15 ones

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.730 
think all three of them of the $15 ones
are<00:05:54.210> where<00:05:54.300> we<00:05:54.389> sought<00:05:54.569> after<00:05:54.690> except<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.259> 21

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
are where we sought after except the 21

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.839 
are where we sought after except the 21
one<00:05:55.949> I<00:05:55.979> don't<00:05:56.190> think<00:05:56.339> it's<00:05:56.430> going<00:05:56.610> to<00:05:56.669> be<00:05:56.729> as

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
one I don't think it's going to be as

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.170 
one I don't think it's going to be as
popular<00:05:57.150> and<00:05:57.860> this<00:05:58.860> set<00:05:59.159> is<00:05:59.370> really<00:05:59.699> cool

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
popular and this set is really cool

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.730 
popular and this set is really cool
especially<00:06:00.419> because<00:06:00.750> it'll<00:06:01.050> gravis<00:06:01.469> I<00:06:01.560> think

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
especially because it'll gravis I think

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.990 
especially because it'll gravis I think
the<00:06:01.800> lagravis<00:06:02.279> minifigure<00:06:02.729> is<00:06:02.849> just

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
the lagravis minifigure is just

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.740 
the lagravis minifigure is just
exceptional

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
exceptional

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.540 
exceptional
and<00:06:03.930> this<00:06:04.409> is<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.680> cheapest<00:06:05.009> way<00:06:05.099> to<00:06:05.129> get<00:06:05.430> it

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
and this is the cheapest way to get it

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.700 
and this is the cheapest way to get it
it's<00:06:05.729> only<00:06:05.849> other<00:06:06.060> way<00:06:06.210> you<00:06:06.270> get<00:06:06.690> them<00:06:06.839> is<00:06:06.990> in

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
it's only other way you get them is in

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.850 
it's only other way you get them is in
the<00:06:07.740> $120<00:06:08.669> line<00:06:09.389> temple<00:06:10.020> so<00:06:10.229> this<00:06:10.440> is<00:06:10.560> one<00:06:10.710> me

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
the $120 line temple so this is one me

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.829 
the $120 line temple so this is one me
like<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.490> said<00:06:11.669> really<00:06:11.879> popular<00:06:12.389> because<00:06:12.599> a<00:06:12.629> lot

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:12.839 
like I said really popular because a lot

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.290 
like I said really popular because a lot
of<00:06:12.900> people<00:06:13.110> love<00:06:13.229> lagravis<00:06:13.830> as<00:06:14.039> proven<00:06:15.000> by<00:06:15.029> my

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
of people love lagravis as proven by my

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.649 
of people love lagravis as proven by my
I<00:06:15.930> think<00:06:16.529> it<00:06:16.620> was<00:06:16.710> a<00:06:16.740> Chima<00:06:17.069> lion<00:06:17.879> temple<00:06:18.180> video

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
I think it was a Chima lion temple video

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.170 
I think it was a Chima lion temple video
which<00:06:19.379> I<00:06:19.560> felt<00:06:19.770> lagravis<00:06:20.250> is<00:06:20.490> a<00:06:20.610> little<00:06:20.969> face

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
which I felt lagravis is a little face

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.209 
which I felt lagravis is a little face

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
the pieces in the set aren't the coolest

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.510

really like the minifigure because it

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.280 
really like the minifigure because it
kind<00:07:14.430> of<00:07:14.490> reminds<00:07:14.760> me<00:07:14.850> of<00:07:15.060> the<00:07:15.270> Spartan<00:07:15.660> so

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.290
