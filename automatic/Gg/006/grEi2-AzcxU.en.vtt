 19 horizontal in corner not famous 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:25.439
 meatballs cartoon today we prepare 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.869
 a second very simple alternative to 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.060
 make seitan meatballs 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.700
 raisins and almonds let's look at the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.640
 ingredients ingredients for about 4 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.300
 people 300 g of seitan cut a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.559
 cubes 2 tablespoons of chickpea flour 50 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.289
 g of raisins 50 g of almonds half chicken 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.960
 sliced extra virgin olive oil of 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.899
 how much olive salt pepper how much 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.660
 therefore we will first go to 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.000
 test our almond trees we will do it in 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.399
 a fairly large and above all 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.670
 the flame must not be non-stick 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.489
 excessively high the toasting will serve 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 ad alli in particular flavor 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.010
 I also remind you that almonds are 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.869
 rich in calcium for your bones and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.090
 phosphorus for your mind we change 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.220
 pan and in a little oil we will go to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.220
 braise the leek for a few seconds 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:39.119
 now let's say our site that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:40.909
 we cut into cubes and immediately after 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.740
 the raisins we have previously 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:54.390
 soaked in warm water and then 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:57.840
 Now wrinkle our silk with the pores 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.039
 and the raisins are cooked we go to pour them 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.039
 in our food processor 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.720
 so now let's go to mount ours 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.220
 food processor and let's chop 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.069
 all very well mind 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.959
 our mixture is well chopped and it 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.959
 we are going to pour into a catch bowl 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.599
 we help each other perhaps with a clear in the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.420
 bowl now we're going to add then 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.730
 the other ingredients of the recipe la 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.590
 our chickpea flour the almonds that 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.450
 we have previously and toasted e 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.450
 chopped salt and pepper to read 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.800
 now that we have our ingredients well 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.799
 mixed to mix with a spoon 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.709
 and we help and train small e 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.360
 meatballs the truth that size 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.160
 Then after you can choose to 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.250
 depending on what you like best 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.340
 you can also formal medallions or if 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.130

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.810
 let's go and put it on a baking tray 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.489
 that I covered with baking paper 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.750

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 that of names tell you a little hands 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.640
 in this way the dough is not 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.799
 will glue too much to your palm and 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.799
 meatballs will look good 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.150
