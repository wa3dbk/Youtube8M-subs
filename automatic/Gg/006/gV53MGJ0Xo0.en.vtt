color with green glitter and I didn't

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
put gloss over and I found that if i put

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.130 
put gloss over and I found that if i put
gloss<00:04:52.970> over<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.360> would<00:04:53.480> make<00:04:53.600> it<00:04:53.720> muddy<00:04:53.960> and

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
gloss over to would make it muddy and

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.230 
gloss over to would make it muddy and
then<00:04:54.290> take<00:04:54.470> away<00:04:54.680> all<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:54.830> sparkle<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:56.090> this

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
then take away all that sparkle and this

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.120 
then take away all that sparkle and this
stays<00:04:56.510> much<00:04:56.870> nicer<00:04:57.320> without<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.680> gloss<00:04:57.860> on

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130
