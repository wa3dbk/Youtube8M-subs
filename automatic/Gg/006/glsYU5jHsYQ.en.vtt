00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.700
 I greet you friends on the fourth 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:10.310
 lesson on the development of games in the flash 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.550
 today topic event handler 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.180
 keyboard create a new document with 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.180
 frame rate 60 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.580
 we draw three squares which us 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.510
 useful to keep track of 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.510
 keyboard events 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.930
 let's call the first square a button 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.940
 next square let's call the button down a 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.550
 the third box is called the button button 3 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.450
 now let's move on to the code 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.980
 write stop now do the handler 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.239
 event write state and listener 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.170
 choose the keyboard body 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:07.130
 keyboard and kay down event 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.860
 when you press the button and set the function dima 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:17.720
 f gave now write the function itself 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:21.410
 function of dawn and write here 3 3 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.360
 will display us event information 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.070
 keyboard 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.350
 as far as we can see in the output field 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.340
 key code denotes a key that we 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.390
 we press 65 it turns out when pressing 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.930
 keys 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.960
 and the English code 40 is obtained when 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.580
 press the down key now write 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.600
 condition 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.670
 if the button is pressed and then 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:54.460
 move the green square which 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:57.530
 is called the button but for now the dates are y + 2 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.200
 let's see what happened press the button 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.780
 ok the box is moving great now 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.850
 do the same for the button down on 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.440
 how much do we know about the button down 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.440
 code 40 therefore we write code for it and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.060
 move the button down the y coordinate 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.280
 also 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.330
 press the button down the blue squares 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.590
 there is a push button and the green box 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.220
 ok, let's do the handler now 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.709
 events to release a button when pressed 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:37.220
 buttons down we will move purple 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:39.260
 square to the right write function from 1 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.989
 it will differ only in that instead 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.989
 keydown key about write function 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:56.450
 set the conditions if the button is pressed down 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:00.380
 then we will move button 3 to the right by 20 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.450
 points we will demonstrate we press at 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.520
 pressing the blue squares these down when 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.870
 button is pressed purple square 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.680
 drives off right principle all on this 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.200
 the lesson is over 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.160
 the next lesson will be dedicated 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.160
 mouse event handler
