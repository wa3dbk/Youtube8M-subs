00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.840
 Hello, how are you today? 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.509
 make a delicious recipe with about 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.380
 very simple ingredients a few steps very 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:25.429
 easy and an exquisite result what 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:28.060
 better than it's made in the microwave a 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:33.400
 medium size pork tenderloin 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:36.500
 oil wine to cook salt pepper 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.190
 ham taquitos a couple of tomatoes 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.470
 ripe a red pepper onion 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.470
 carrot and laurel 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.140
 I'm going to use this container to 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.290
 microwave that has a function on its lid 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.230
 grill we chop the carrot the pepper and 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.220
 the onion in small cubes and we throw them 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.220
 inside the container 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.770
 we put a couple of bay leaves 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:10.190
 cutting the pieces 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.060
 we add a dribble of oil 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.060
 we mix 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.350
 we cover 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.640
 and we take the microwave to power 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.340
 maximum about 6 or 7 minutes 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.690
 while the sofrito is going 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.690
 to scratch the tomatoes 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.240
 beware of fingers worth 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.990
 we can also season the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.490
 sirloin that we will have cut in 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.130
 medallions 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.990
 the seven minutes have already passed but 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.360
 before opening the microwave we leave 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.680
 stew the stew five minutes before 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.810
 open it 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.510
 because the container takes advantage of the heat 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.130
 to continue cooking 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.670
 here you see how everything is poached now 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.670
 we add the pieces of sirloin 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.670
 we mix 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.750
 we cover 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.140
 and we take it to the microwave another 6 or 7 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.140
 minutes 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.980
 After a while we let rest a little 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 and we take out of the microwave 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.430
 and this is taking color whistle 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.940
 we add the tomato 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:55.130
 we cover and bring back 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.130
 microwave but this time 10 minutes 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.430
 after this time we let rest 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.430
 we take out of the microwave 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:19.470
 and we add a little salt and a little trickle 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.470
 of wine we mix 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.990
 and we're going to give you now 7 minutes of 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.990
 micro 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.930
 After the time we retire 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.930
 i 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.860
 we add the ham taquitos and cover 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.110
 the flavor of the ham will mix with the 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.220
 of the stew but now it is not necessary 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.220
 take to the microwave 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.660
 and we have this delicious dish ready 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.080

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.840
