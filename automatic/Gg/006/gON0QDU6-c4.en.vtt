00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.610 
think it's exciting to be in the car
industry<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.750> always<00:00:58.109> developing

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
industry because it's always developing

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.580 
industry because it's always developing
like<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.969> different<00:01:00.840> obviously<00:01:01.109> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
like you can have different obviously in

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.429 
like you can have different obviously in
areas<00:01:02.070> change<00:01:02.879> completely<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.320> can

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
areas change completely to what you can

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
areas change completely to what you can
do<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.040> always<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.549> changing<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
exciting to be involved in it I think a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.660 
exciting to be involved in it I think a
car<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.890> 20-25<00:01:11.820> would<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.400> really<00:01:14.400> tech

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
car in 20-25 would be and really tech

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.190 
car in 20-25 would be and really tech
and<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:14.970> loads<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.390> gadgets<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> you'd<00:01:16.080> be

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and have loads of gadgets and you'd be

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
and have loads of gadgets and you'd be
able<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.439> fly<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> wall<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
able to fly in them and go on the wall I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
able to fly in them and go on the wall I
think<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.259> would<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.530> much<00:01:19.830> safer<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
think it would be much safer for the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.370 
think it would be much safer for the
passion<00:01:20.939> witches<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> driver<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.200> it'll

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
passion witches and the driver and it'll

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.700 
passion witches and the driver and it'll
have<00:01:22.530> lots<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.520> gadgets<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> profession

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
have lots more gadgets as a profession

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
have lots more gadgets as a profession
and<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> would<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.729> amazing<00:01:27.689> being<00:01:28.200> an

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and I think it would be amazing being an

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
engineering at Exeter University

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.789 
engineering at Exeter University
followed<00:02:03.180> by<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> master's<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.049> advanced

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
followed by a master's in advanced

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
followed by a master's in advanced
materials<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.430> cranfield<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.299> thing<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
materials at cranfield the thing that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.880 
materials at cranfield the thing that
attracted<00:02:06.990> me<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> Jaguar<00:02:07.680> Land<00:02:07.829> Rover

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
attracted me to the Jaguar Land Rover

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.830 
attracted me to the Jaguar Land Rover
graduate<00:02:08.429> scheme<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.849> both<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> size<00:02:09.390> but

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
graduate scheme was both the size but

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.510 
graduate scheme was both the size but
also<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.289> variety<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> scheme

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
also the variety of the scheme

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.310 
also the variety of the scheme
so<00:02:11.760> for<00:02:11.910> example<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.330> got<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.630> do<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> placement

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
so for example I got to do a placement

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.050 
so for example I got to do a placement
in<00:02:13.440> both<00:02:13.590> body<00:02:13.770> engineering<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.580> reliability

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
in both body engineering and reliability

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.630 
in both body engineering and reliability
and<00:02:15.420> durability<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:16.230> also<00:02:16.710> did<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> placement<00:02:17.460> on

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and durability I also did a placement on

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.160 
and durability I also did a placement on
the<00:02:17.670> track<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.120> think<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.450> really<00:02:18.690> important

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the track I think it's really important

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.930 
the track I think it's really important
that<00:02:19.260> Jaguar<00:02:19.740> Land<00:02:19.920> Rover<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.400> engineering

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
that Jaguar Land Rover and engineering

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.910 
that Jaguar Land Rover and engineering
companies<00:02:21.510> across<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> country<00:02:21.990> can<00:02:22.590> attract

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
companies across the country can attract

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.130 
companies across the country can attract
young<00:02:23.130> people<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.270> engineering<00:02:24.660> sector

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
young people to the engineering sector

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.690 
young people to the engineering sector
because<00:02:25.410> we're<00:02:25.590> really<00:02:25.860> short<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.310> engineers

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
because we're really short of engineers

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.860 
because we're really short of engineers
at<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.880> moment<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.480> only<00:02:27.600> young<00:02:27.840> people

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
at the moment and it's only young people

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.270 
at the moment and it's only young people
are<00:02:28.380> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.590> be<00:02:28.650> able<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.920> solve<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
are going to be able to solve the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.740 
are going to be able to solve the
problems<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.730> tomorrow<00:02:30.090> there's<00:02:30.450> no<00:02:30.570> such
