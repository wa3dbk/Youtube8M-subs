00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.740 
although I knew we had the bolt off top
obviously<00:02:39.220> because<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:39.880> saw<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.450> here

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750

with monuments all sorts of things and
this<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.959> definitely<00:02:56.590> not<00:02:57.010> how<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.459> deck

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
this is definitely not how the deck

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.759 
this is definitely not how the deck
generally<00:02:58.269> works<00:02:58.480> by<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.750> way<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.200> just<00:02:59.260> wanted

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
generally works by the way I just wanted

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.030 
generally works by the way I just wanted
to<00:02:59.830> show<00:03:00.069> that<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:01.110> can<00:03:02.110> grind<00:03:02.319> out<00:03:02.530> games<00:03:02.769> and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
to show that it can grind out games and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.880 
to show that it can grind out games and
that's<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.310> pure<00:03:03.549> purpose<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.890> i'll

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
that's the pure purpose of this I i'll

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.100 
that's the pure purpose of this I i'll
post<00:03:06.220> another<00:03:06.430> video<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:07.000> just<00:03:07.510> kind<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.810> how

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
post another video of just kind of how

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.289 
post another video of just kind of how
it<00:03:08.260> explodes<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.819> game<00:03:10.000> could<00:03:10.180> have

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
it explodes and this game could have

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.670 
it explodes and this game could have
gone<00:03:10.390> either<00:03:10.420> way<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.840> mean<00:03:10.959> he<00:03:11.290> could<00:03:11.440> easily

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
gone either way I mean he could easily

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.229 
gone either way I mean he could easily
won<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:13.560> could<00:03:14.560> because<00:03:15.400> we<00:03:15.430> come<00:03:15.760> down<00:03:15.970> near

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
won this could because we come down near

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.780 
won this could because we come down near
top<00:03:16.480> deck<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.470> mean<00:03:17.680> he's<00:03:17.859> got<00:03:18.040> counters<00:03:18.489> in

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
top deck and I mean he's got counters in

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.970 
top deck and I mean he's got counters in
Jace's<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:19.510> most<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.230> time<00:03:20.440> he'd<00:03:20.709> probably

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
Jace's so most of the time he'd probably

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.789 
Jace's so most of the time he'd probably
win<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.400> but<00:03:22.079> that's<00:03:23.079> not<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.350> point<00:03:23.380> like<00:03:23.769> I

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
win this but that's not the point like I

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.500 
win this but that's not the point like I
said<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.130> just<00:03:24.250> want<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.640> show<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.329> can

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
said I just want to show it that it can

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.330 
said I just want to show it that it can
bust<00:03:26.049> out<00:03:26.760> wins<00:03:27.760> without<00:03:28.769> throwing<00:03:29.769> down<00:03:30.070> like

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
bust out wins without throwing down like

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.310 
bust out wins without throwing down like
a<00:03:30.370> Elspeth<00:03:30.880> or<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> conqueror's<00:03:31.780> pledge<00:03:31.840> or

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
whatever this play is interesting I

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.680

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
wanted to get rid of his manland so i

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.460 
wanted to get rid of his manland so i
tacked<00:03:38.260> into<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:38.980> journeyed<00:03:40.260> kind<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.320> man

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
tacked into it and journeyed kind of man

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.680 
tacked into it and journeyed kind of man
and<00:03:41.620> screwing<00:03:42.040> him<00:03:42.190> again<00:03:42.489> because<00:03:43.450> i'm

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
and screwing him again because i'm

here<00:03:52.060> i<00:03:52.090> could<00:03:52.480> have<00:03:52.780> just<00:03:53.380> attacked<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:54.250> it

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
here i could have just attacked and it

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.370

probably<00:03:54.880> would<00:03:55.180> have<00:03:55.269> been<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.569> play<00:03:55.780> just

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
probably would have been the play just

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.319 
probably would have been the play just
hit<00:03:56.530> him<00:03:56.620> for<00:03:56.769> five<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.609> make<00:03:57.970> him<00:03:58.180> do

hit him for five and make him do

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.240 
hit him for five and make him do
something<00:03:58.359> so<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.380> might<00:03:59.799> have<00:03:59.890> been<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.010> Miss

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
something so that might have been a Miss

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.240 
something so that might have been a Miss
play<00:04:00.690> because<00:04:01.690> he<00:04:02.019> actually<00:04:02.140> does<00:04:02.769> have<00:04:03.100> the

site<00:04:09.609> and<00:04:09.639> that<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.389> most<00:04:10.600> recent<00:04:11.109> list<00:04:11.350> so

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
site and that is the most recent list so

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.059 
site and that is the most recent list so
that's<00:04:13.540> really<00:04:13.720> all<00:04:13.870> they<00:04:14.079> could<00:04:14.139> do<00:04:14.440> although

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
that's really all they could do although

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.219 
that's really all they could do although
he<00:04:15.519> made<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.730> mistake<00:04:15.910> he<00:04:16.630> really<00:04:16.959> should<00:04:17.139> have

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
he made a mistake he really should have

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.219 
he made a mistake he really should have
hit<00:04:17.410> my<00:04:17.590> steering<00:04:18.010> Wildwood<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.489> think<00:04:19.229> even

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
hit my steering Wildwood I think even

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.750 
hit my steering Wildwood I think even
though<00:04:20.440> he<00:04:20.530> couldn't<00:04:20.739> have<00:04:20.890> used<00:04:21.039> it<00:04:21.310> just<00:04:21.340> to

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
though he couldn't have used it just to

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.460 
though he couldn't have used it just to
not<00:04:22.570> take<00:04:22.870> five

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
not take five

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.460 
not take five
because<00:04:24.060> although<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.510> didn't<00:04:26.170> know<00:04:26.260> what<00:04:26.380> it

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
because although I didn't know what it

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.860 
because although I didn't know what it
was<00:04:26.890> in<00:04:27.070> his<00:04:27.190> hand<00:04:27.490> but<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:28.060> actually<00:04:28.450> ended<00:04:28.720> up

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
was in his hand but it actually ended up

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.930 
was in his hand but it actually ended up
being<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.410> Jace<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:32.160> you<00:04:33.160> know<00:04:33.280> he's<00:04:33.580> got<00:04:33.790> the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
being a Jace so you know he's got the

there<00:05:13.840> it's<00:05:14.470> tier<00:05:14.830> 1<00:05:15.040> capable<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.820> then<00:05:16.090> some

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
there it's tier 1 capable and then some

there it's tier 1 capable and then some
it<00:05:17.710> slows<00:05:18.190> down<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.580> ratchet<00:05:18.910> bomb<00:05:19.060> and

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
it slows down to ratchet bomb and

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.480 
it slows down to ratchet bomb and
pyroclasm<00:05:19.660> like<00:05:19.990> everyone<00:05:20.320> says<00:05:20.560> but<00:05:20.919> those

pyroclasm like everyone says but those

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.720 
pyroclasm like everyone says but those
aren't<00:05:21.790> auto<00:05:22.090> wind<00:05:22.419> cards<00:05:22.900> so<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:24.190> that<00:05:24.400> this
