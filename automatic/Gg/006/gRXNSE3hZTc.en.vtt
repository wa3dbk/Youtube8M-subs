00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.220
 4 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.800
 came 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:24.230
 simon and just own the set of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.380
 our new music video that the gambler 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.810
 and the gambler is in principle the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.559
 great-grandfather over that is the song 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.050
 written and said okay okay 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.399
 We make the music video to 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.930
 the great-grandfather has to the century 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.370
 you will be right as the dog is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.640
 and was playing and now we are thinking 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.559
 just that around this music video 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.309
 is all about this one smith 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.480
 to turn 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.280
 and yes we have been looking for and have long 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.850
 then finally mentally where the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.589
 Grandfather has experienced the customer and that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:15.050
 is really crazy schmid so the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:15.050
 first really matters 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.290
 it is then in pictures and the franz 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.950
 lies in its historical play 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.600
 actually fast construction makes that 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.200
 one his knives his garden fences 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.200
 flipped and made to be completely followed 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.450
 actually have from the beginning already clear 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.280
 that quality is quite high 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.819
 just be very visual 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.909
 everything should be the whole video and 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.229
 That's why we have a camera 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.569
 the decided a high framerate 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.600
 so we can have many 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.100
 many settings became 215 seconds 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.289
 that means we are super beautiful 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.019
 slow motion shots in the forge 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.540
 and that's what we have to do 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.400
 good camera line and therefore more drum 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.959
 around because the is relatively big then 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.480
 just too big accordingly 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.880
 equipment so a steadicam that we 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.459
 that we all run this beautiful 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.269
 make everything nice without much 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.280
 Luckily rows and cameras unfortunately where 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.620
 to take beautiful beautiful dita is 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.620
 can just make calm colors 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.599
 reported forges 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.770
 and so 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.590
 so 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:24.430
 high stone on our point and resembles 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.890
 to the mountain 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.890
 for cheap appeal 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.760
 With 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.239
 I have no room behind him 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.310
 or could follow topic 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:39.740
 It is already hovering in French 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.740
 I am aware of 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.389
 now comes the showdown 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.669
 it is the stefan 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:02.180
 the said rather cool we are at it myself 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.180
 put it well for disposal 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.960
 his janitor of the fabrics 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.040
 office bags 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.580
 si 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.590
 Franz in the direction 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.590
 Yes exactly 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.020
 It's falling 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.570
 came
