00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
playing with my Canon 40d earlier and I

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.960 
playing with my Canon 40d earlier and I
really<00:00:23.920> got<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.189> bug<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.610> shoot<00:00:24.790> some<00:00:24.939> video

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

but the Canon 40d doesn't shoot video so

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.780 
but the Canon 40d doesn't shoot video so
I<00:00:31.840> said<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.110> myself<00:00:32.259> hmm<00:00:32.920> what<00:00:33.130> can<00:00:33.310> I<00:00:33.430> do

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
I said to myself hmm what can I do

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.840 
I said to myself hmm what can I do
just<00:00:34.750> shoot<00:00:34.900> video<00:00:35.200> so<00:00:36.130> I<00:00:36.190> looked<00:00:36.400> into<00:00:36.550> a<00:00:36.640> few

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
just shoot video so I looked into a few

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.170 
just shoot video so I looked into a few
different<00:00:36.880> options<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:39.010> those<00:00:39.220> was<00:00:39.970> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
different options one of those was the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.440 
different options one of those was the
magic<00:00:40.600> lantern<00:00:40.810> software<00:00:42.149> however<00:00:43.149> I<00:00:43.180> saw<00:00:43.420> a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
magic lantern software however I saw a

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.819 
magic lantern software however I saw a
few<00:00:43.660> negative<00:00:44.050> things<00:00:44.230> about<00:00:44.350> it<00:00:44.620> I<00:00:44.680> heard

few negative things about it I heard

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.950 
few negative things about it I heard
about<00:00:45.010> some<00:00:45.190> people<00:00:45.489> brick<00:00:45.760> in<00:00:45.910> their<00:00:46.090> CMOS

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
about some people brick in their CMOS

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.349 
about some people brick in their CMOS
sensors<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:50.910> personally<00:00:51.910> didn't<00:00:52.179> feel

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
sensors I personally didn't feel

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.380 
sensors I personally didn't feel
comfortable<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:54.340> installing<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.059> magic

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
comfortable with installing the magic

comfortable with installing the magic
lantern<00:00:55.570> software<00:00:56.350> I<00:00:57.210> chose<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:58.420> go<00:00:58.539> with<00:00:58.570> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
lantern software I chose to go with the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.810 
lantern software I chose to go with the
eos<00:01:00.789> camera<00:01:01.239> movie<00:01:01.870> recorder<00:01:02.410> software<00:01:05.820> what

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
eos camera movie recorder software what

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.660 
eos camera movie recorder software what
that<00:01:07.000> does<00:01:07.240> how<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.660> differs<00:01:07.930> from<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
that does how that differs from the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.080 
that does how that differs from the
magic<00:01:10.060> lantern<00:01:10.330> software<00:01:11.080> is<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:12.090> instead

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
magic lantern software is that instead

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.930 
magic lantern software is that instead
of<00:01:14.580> using<00:01:15.580> aftermarket<00:01:16.390> firmware<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.850> it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
of using aftermarket firmware what it

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.270 
of using aftermarket firmware what it
does<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.420> through<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:19.780> USB<00:01:20.350> cable<00:01:20.560> plugs<00:01:21.070> in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
does is it through a USB cable plugs in

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.890 
does is it through a USB cable plugs in
to<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.970> PC<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:26.430> captures<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.900> canons

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
to a PC and then it captures the canons

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.730 
to a PC and then it captures the canons
live<00:01:29.230> view<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.500> don't<00:01:32.500> pretend<00:01:32.980> to<00:01:33.310> know

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
live view so I don't pretend to know

live view so I don't pretend to know
whether<00:01:35.740> it's<00:01:36.010> better<00:01:36.280> or<00:01:36.940> not<00:01:37.270> as<00:01:37.450> good<00:01:37.720> or

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
whether it's better or not as good or

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.390 
whether it's better or not as good or
whether<00:01:39.220> I'm<00:01:39.430> still<00:01:39.670> going<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.270> run<00:01:40.420> into<00:01:41.400> CMOS

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
whether I'm still going to run into CMOS

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.810 
whether I'm still going to run into CMOS
problems<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.890> don't<00:01:44.890> pretend<00:01:45.160> to<00:01:45.220> be<00:01:45.310> educated

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
problems I don't pretend to be educated

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.760 
problems I don't pretend to be educated
enough<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.060> know<00:01:46.210> whether<00:01:46.960> it's<00:01:47.200> gonna<00:01:47.500> be<00:01:47.680> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
enough to know whether it's gonna be the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.820 
enough to know whether it's gonna be the
same<00:01:47.950> or<00:01:48.400> different<00:01:48.430> or<00:01:49.030> better<00:01:49.150> or<00:01:49.480> worse<00:01:49.830> but

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.130 
same or different or better or worse but
I<00:01:51.130> figured<00:01:51.970> for<00:01:52.120> the<00:01:52.180> price<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.660> paid<00:01:52.900> for

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140

I figured for the price that I paid for
my<00:01:53.230> Canon<00:01:53.530> 40d<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:55.090> when<00:01:55.330> I<00:01:55.360> paid<00:01:55.690> for<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.080> and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
my Canon 40d and when I paid for it and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.910 
my Canon 40d and when I paid for it and
the<00:01:56.920> use<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:57.310> I've<00:01:57.400> gotten<00:01:57.670> from<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.920> I'm

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the use that I've gotten from it I'm

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.510 
the use that I've gotten from it I'm
willing<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.280> risk<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.900> Canon<00:02:02.200> Mark<00:02:02.520> the

uh I decided

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.000 
uh I decided
amen<00:02:37.880> now<00:02:37.910> with<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:39.410> know<00:02:39.530> if<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.770> breaks
