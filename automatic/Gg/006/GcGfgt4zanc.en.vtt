00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
entertaining gameplay I mean I'm sure a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.570 
entertaining gameplay I mean I'm sure a
lot<00:04:21.210> of<00:04:21.270> people's<00:04:21.800> idea<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.860> entertaining<00:04:23.460> is

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
lot of people's idea of entertaining is

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.800

seeing someone go 142 and 3 but

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.560 
seeing someone go 142 and 3 but
I<00:04:26.930> can't<00:04:27.590> do<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:28.190> think<00:04:28.610> I've<00:04:29.030> never<00:04:29.360> been

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
I can't do that I think I've never been

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.140 
I can't do that I think I've never been
able<00:04:29.660> to<00:04:29.780> do<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.169> so<00:04:30.410> my<00:04:30.590> whole<00:04:30.830> idea<00:04:31.130> I<00:04:31.880> guess

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
able to do that so my whole idea I guess

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.250 
able to do that so my whole idea I guess
of<00:04:32.300> what<00:04:32.450> entertainment<00:04:32.900> will<00:04:32.990> be<00:04:33.110> is

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
of what entertainment will be is

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.550 
of what entertainment will be is
bringing<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:34.300> decent<00:04:35.300> -<00:04:35.570> good<00:04:35.780> gameplay<00:04:36.260> with

bringing you decent - good gameplay with
good<00:04:37.370> commentary<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.210> mean<00:04:38.480> this<00:04:38.630> is<00:04:38.840> my<00:04:39.650> first

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
good commentary I mean this is my first

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.490 
good commentary I mean this is my first
attempt<00:04:40.250> this<00:04:40.460> is<00:04:40.580> go<00:04:40.730> number<00:04:40.970> one<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.510> I<00:04:42.230> feel

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
attempt this is go number one and I feel

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.610 
attempt this is go number one and I feel
it's<00:04:42.620> going<00:04:42.860> rather<00:04:43.220> okay<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.480> time<00:04:45.290> as<00:04:45.590> I

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
it's going rather okay so in time as I

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.290 
it's going rather okay so in time as I
progressively<00:04:46.490> do<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.730> more<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.030> more<00:04:47.180> and

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
progressively do it more and more and

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.060 
progressively do it more and more and
more<00:04:47.419> I<00:04:47.660> will<00:04:48.050> get<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.320> hang<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.770> and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
more I will get the hang of it and

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.340 
more I will get the hang of it and
things<00:04:49.400> will<00:04:49.550> go<00:04:49.700> a<00:04:50.000> bit<00:04:50.389> more<00:04:50.419> smoothly<00:04:50.870> but

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
things will go a bit more smoothly but

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.900 
things will go a bit more smoothly but
um<00:04:51.530> I<00:04:52.419> guess<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:54.770> wrap<00:04:54.800> up<00:04:55.190> things<00:04:55.430> because<00:04:55.700> the

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
um I guess to wrap up things because the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.320 
um I guess to wrap up things because the
game<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.210> almost<00:04:56.720> done<00:04:56.900> here<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:57.350> um<00:04:58.330> you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
game is almost done here is that um you

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.730 
game is almost done here is that um you
