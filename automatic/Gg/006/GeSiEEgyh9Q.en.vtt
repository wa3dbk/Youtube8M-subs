there's a lot of really interesting

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.130 
there's a lot of really interesting
architecture<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.400> check<00:04:47.610> out<00:04:47.790> here<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.990> I'm

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
architecture to check out here and I'm

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.840 
architecture to check out here and I'm
just<00:04:49.320> fascinated<00:04:49.500> by<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.070> little<00:04:50.460> ornaments

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850

and<00:04:50.940> stuff<00:04:51.030> on<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.450> building

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
and stuff on the building

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.270 
and stuff on the building
it<00:04:53.900> gives<00:04:54.080> me<00:04:54.259> something<00:04:54.470> else<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.770> focus<00:04:54.860> on

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
it gives me something else to focus on

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.730 
it gives me something else to focus on
other<00:04:55.490> than<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:56.000> run<00:04:56.229> so<00:04:57.229> I'm<00:04:57.500> sure<00:04:57.710> that

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
other than the run so I'm sure that

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.590 
other than the run so I'm sure that
there<00:04:58.100> are<00:04:58.190> some<00:04:58.310> interesting<00:04:58.490> places<00:04:59.030> to

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
there are some interesting places to

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.779 
there are some interesting places to
look<00:04:59.930> at<00:05:00.110> where<00:05:00.289> you<00:05:00.410> live<00:05:00.620> as<00:05:00.740> well<00:05:00.949> go

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
explore ago go look at things in detail

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.499 
explore ago go look at things in detail
how<00:05:04.100> often<00:05:04.520> if<00:05:04.639> you<00:05:04.669> actually<00:05:04.880> looked<00:05:05.270> at<00:05:05.419> the

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
how often if you actually looked at the

how often if you actually looked at the
details<00:05:06.050> in<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.500> building's<00:05:06.860> really
