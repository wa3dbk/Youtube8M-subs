going good and all i need is 91 first

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.270 
going good and all i need is 91 first
then<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.420> can't<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.719> gay<00:02:00.930> i<00:02:01.229> already<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
then we can't be gay i already got the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.149 
then we can't be gay i already got the
Derrick's<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.990> stats<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.920> bad

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
Derrick's and my stats are like not bad

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.709 
Derrick's and my stats are like not bad
i<00:02:05.189> mean<00:02:05.490> my<00:02:05.640> strength<00:02:05.969> could<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> lot<00:02:06.509> higher

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
i mean my strength could be a lot higher

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.260 
i mean my strength could be a lot higher
but<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.469> least<00:02:07.590> i<00:02:07.740> got<00:02:07.829> 70<00:02:08.280> attack<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.819> defense

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
but at least i got 70 attack and defense

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.570 
but at least i got 70 attack and defense
and<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:10.080> rest<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.410> strength<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> guess<00:02:11.190> this

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and the rest is strength so I guess this

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.580 
and the rest is strength so I guess this
is<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> pretty<00:02:12.360> good<00:02:12.540> account<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.080> guess

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
is a pretty good account I guess

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.380 
is a pretty good account I guess
I<00:02:13.650> mean<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.280> yet<00:02:14.550> but<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:14.849> going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.239> be<00:02:15.360> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I mean not yet but it's going to be a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.809 
I mean not yet but it's going to be a
pretty<00:02:15.629> good<00:02:15.810> account<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.890> there<00:02:17.099> we<00:02:17.190> go<00:02:17.220> done

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819

was saying i got a left click empty
option<00:03:52.200> which<00:03:52.349> means<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.769> pretty<00:03:52.950> much<00:03:53.099> like

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
option which means it's pretty much like

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.000 
option which means it's pretty much like
a<00:03:53.340> looking<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:54.780> only<00:03:54.989> bad<00:03:55.290> thing<00:03:55.349> about<00:03:55.680> this

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
a looking the only bad thing about this

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.159 
a looking the only bad thing about this
is<00:03:56.069> that<00:03:56.280> your<00:03:56.760> inventory<00:03:57.510> doesn't<00:03:57.900> have<00:03:57.989> like

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
is that your inventory doesn't have like

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.530 
is that your inventory doesn't have like
an<00:03:58.319> F<00:03:58.530> key<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.250> get<00:03:59.459> there<00:03:59.669> which<00:04:00.180> means<00:04:00.359> you

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
an F key to get there which means you

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.479 
an F key to get there which means you
still<00:04:00.720> have<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.019> click<00:04:01.319> you<00:04:01.500> can't<00:04:01.739> really<00:04:02.099> do

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
still have to click you can't really do

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.780 
still have to click you can't really do
this<00:04:02.669> while<00:04:04.010> watching<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.130> video<00:04:05.370> or<00:04:05.549> something

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
this while watching a video or something

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.720 
this while watching a video or something
like<00:04:06.480> it's<00:04:06.840> it's<00:04:07.590> pretty<00:04:07.859> difficult<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.549> do

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
like it's it's pretty difficult to do

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.400 
like it's it's pretty difficult to do
that<00:04:08.970> because<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.419> gotta<00:04:09.599> focus<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.319> little

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
that because you gotta focus a little

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.140 
that because you gotta focus a little
bit<00:04:10.650> because<00:04:10.919> you<00:04:11.190> still<00:04:11.400> got<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.700> go<00:04:11.819> to<00:04:11.880> your

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
bit because you still got to go to your

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150 
bit because you still got to go to your
invent<00:04:12.630> with<00:04:12.900> your<00:04:13.049> mouth<00:04:13.319> just<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.829> click

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
invent with your mouth just to click

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.620 
invent with your mouth just to click
there<00:04:14.400> which<00:04:14.639> means<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.120> have<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.299> watch<00:04:15.599> your

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
there which means you have to watch your

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.409 
there which means you have to watch your
screen<00:04:16.200> which<00:04:16.560> kind<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:16.950> sucks<00:04:17.400> it's<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.180> little

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
screen which kind of sucks it's a little

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.719 
screen which kind of sucks it's a little
bit<00:04:18.539> worse<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.079> l<00:04:19.229> king<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:20.010> it's<00:04:20.160> faster

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
bit worse and l king but it's faster

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.760 
bit worse and l king but it's faster
than<00:04:20.820> l<00:04:21.030> king<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:21.840> i<00:04:21.870> guess<00:04:22.260> that's<00:04:22.469> a<00:04:22.620> good

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
than l king so i guess that's a good

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.820 
than l king so i guess that's a good
thing<00:04:23.599> well<00:04:24.599> it's<00:04:24.750> it's<00:04:24.960> pretty<00:04:25.620> much<00:04:25.770> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
thing well it's it's pretty much the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.350 
thing well it's it's pretty much the
same<00:04:26.219> actually<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.820> not<00:04:26.909> really

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
same actually it's not really

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.890 
same actually it's not really
stir<00:04:27.659> but<00:04:28.020> it's<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.229> same<00:04:28.379> XP<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.780> there<00:04:30.780> we

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
stir but it's the same XP and there we

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.589
