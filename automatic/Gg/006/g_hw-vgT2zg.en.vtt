00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
with the Maybach 210 let me see if

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.599 
with the Maybach 210 let me see if
this<00:02:09.749> beta<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.829> glitchy<00:02:11.159> and<00:02:11.430> let

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:11.609 
this beta is going to be glitchy and let

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.360 
this beta is going to be glitchy and let
me<00:02:11.790> show<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:13.170> what<00:02:13.469> this<00:02:13.709> final

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
me show you what this final

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.179 
me show you what this final
configuration<00:02:14.579> is<00:02:15.030> no<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.420> will<00:02:15.659> not<00:02:15.989> well<00:02:16.829> the

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
configuration is no it will not well the

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.009 
configuration is no it will not well the
final<00:02:17.579> configuration<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.480> won't<00:02:18.659> show<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
final configuration it won't show the

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.170 
final configuration it won't show the
bit<00:02:19.409> properly<00:02:19.980> because<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.370> beta<00:02:20.579> hood

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
bit properly because it's a beta hood

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.770 
bit properly because it's a beta hood
makes<00:02:21.450> sense<00:02:21.829> but<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:24.239> final<00:02:24.569> configuration

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
makes sense but the final configuration

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.300 
makes sense but the final configuration
is<00:02:25.579> the<00:02:26.579> pretty<00:02:27.450> much<00:02:27.629> something<00:02:28.200> similar<00:02:28.739> you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
is the pretty much something similar you

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.399 
is the pretty much something similar you
get<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.909> be<00:02:30.269> it's<00:02:30.569> actually<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.019> more<00:02:31.230> powerful

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
get I be it's actually a more powerful

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.289 
get I be it's actually a more powerful
engine<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.159> more<00:02:32.370> powerful<00:02:32.549> engine<00:02:33.150> so

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
engine get a more powerful engine so

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.349 
engine get a more powerful engine so
you're<00:02:33.480> basically<00:02:33.569> making<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.170> trade<00:02:34.409> off<00:02:34.650> uh

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
you're basically making the trade off uh

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.319 
you're basically making the trade off uh
for<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.480> l<00:02:36.629> 56<00:02:36.959> 88<00:02:37.829> millimeter<00:02:38.040> gun<00:02:38.549> now<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.120> l

used<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.389> the<00:02:42.510> tiger<00:02:43.370> pretty<00:02:44.370> much<00:02:45.019> you're

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
used on the tiger pretty much you're

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.539 
used on the tiger pretty much you're
choosing<00:02:46.709> what<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.129> want<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:47.519> with

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
choosing what you want to go with

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.970 
choosing what you want to go with
between<00:02:48.329> those<00:02:48.510> two<00:02:48.780> I've<00:02:49.019> seen<00:02:49.530> some<00:02:49.709> people

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
between those two I've seen some people

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.830 
between those two I've seen some people
run<00:02:50.159> that<00:02:50.310> option<00:02:50.699> but<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:51.000> recommend<00:02:51.389> this<00:02:51.780> one

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
run that option but I recommend this one

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.619 
run that option but I recommend this one
personally<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:53.400> find<00:02:53.879> it<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.090> be<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.480> most

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
personally I find it to be the most

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.679 
personally I find it to be the most
effective<00:02:55.109> between<00:02:55.980> those<00:02:56.189> two

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
effective between those two

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.140 
effective between those two
configurations<00:02:57.689> and<00:02:58.379> this<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.489> primarily<00:02:59.760> why

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
configurations and this is primarily why

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.689 
configurations and this is primarily why
this<00:03:00.209> tank<00:03:00.719> does<00:03:00.959> not<00:03:01.139> have<00:03:01.379> very<00:03:01.949> great<00:03:02.430> hull

gameplay guys you'll note with this tank
as<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.620> was<00:03:19.739> talking<00:03:19.979> about<00:03:20.129> earlier<00:03:20.159> it<00:03:20.579> is

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
as I was talking about earlier it is

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.929 
as I was talking about earlier it is
dirt<00:03:21.030> slow<00:03:21.389> bone<00:03:21.989> stock<00:03:22.409> isn't<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.430> very<00:03:23.639> quick

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
dirt slow bone stock isn't a very quick

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.589 
dirt slow bone stock isn't a very quick
tank<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.900> once<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.769> upgrade<00:03:25.979> this<00:03:26.699> tank<00:03:27.090> will

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
tank but once you upgrade this tank will

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.379 
tank but once you upgrade this tank will
move<00:03:27.900> pretty<00:03:28.560> quick<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:29.069> will<00:03:29.489> not<00:03:29.669> run<00:03:29.970> stride

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
move pretty quick it will not run stride

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.740 
move pretty quick it will not run stride
for<00:03:30.659> stride<00:03:31.099> with<00:03:32.099> light<00:03:32.400> tanks<00:03:32.879> but<00:03:33.509> it<00:03:33.599> is

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
for stride with light tanks but it is

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.599 
for stride with light tanks but it is
quick<00:03:34.019> enough<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.349> you<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:34.799> keep<00:03:35.040> up<00:03:35.250> with

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
quick enough that you can keep up with

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.429 
quick enough that you can keep up with
them<00:03:35.879> now<00:03:36.479> as<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.840> was<00:03:36.989> talking<00:03:37.259> about<00:03:37.290> earlier

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
the high piercing values it has is more

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.140 
the high piercing values it has is more
than<00:05:10.620> enough<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:11.009> make<00:05:11.159> up<00:05:11.370> for<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.940> lack<00:05:12.090> of

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
raw damage that an 88 millimeter gun can

morning<00:05:33.569> enough<00:05:33.840> speed<00:05:34.050> here<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.319> almost<00:05:34.680> hit

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
morning enough speed here I almost hit

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.770 
morning enough speed here I almost hit
60<00:05:35.310> kilometers<00:05:35.849> an<00:05:35.969> hour<00:05:36.060> just<00:05:36.210> coming<00:05:36.750> down

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
60 kilometers an hour just coming down

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.129 
60 kilometers an hour just coming down
that<00:05:37.110> hill<00:05:37.289> that's<00:05:38.120> good<00:05:39.120> enough<00:05:39.419> in<00:05:39.750> most

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
that hill that's good enough in most

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.230 
that hill that's good enough in most
cases<00:05:40.289> and<00:05:40.860> I<00:05:40.919> sustained<00:05:41.460> it<00:05:41.639> even<00:05:41.909> when<00:05:42.029> i<00:05:42.060> hit

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
cases and I sustained it even when i hit

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.110 
cases and I sustained it even when i hit
flat<00:05:42.599> around<00:05:42.990> so<00:05:43.520> you're<00:05:44.520> more<00:05:44.729> than<00:05:44.880> quick

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
flat around so you're more than quick

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.260 
flat around so you're more than quick
enough<00:05:45.389> I<00:05:45.630> feel<00:05:46.169> with<00:05:46.349> the<00:05:47.150> second<00:05:48.150> to<00:05:48.240> last

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
enough I feel with the second to last

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.629 
enough I feel with the second to last
option<00:05:48.840> with<00:05:49.259> this<00:05:49.440> tank<00:05:49.770> it's<00:05:50.279> more<00:05:50.580> than

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
option with this tank it's more than

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.499 
option with this tank it's more than
adequate<00:05:51.300> for<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.569> job<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:52.319> l<00:05:52.500> 70<00:05:53.099> is<00:05:53.509> perfect

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
adequate for the job the l 70 is perfect

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.249 
adequate for the job the l 70 is perfect
I<00:05:54.630> of<00:05:54.960> and<00:05:55.319> I'm<00:05:55.979> thinking<00:05:56.340> more<00:05:56.729> in<00:05:56.789> line<00:05:57.120> with

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
I of and I'm thinking more in line with

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.620 
I of and I'm thinking more in line with
situations<00:05:58.259> where<00:05:58.620> you<00:05:59.180> might<00:06:00.180> have<00:06:00.419> some

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
situations where you might have some

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.200 
situations where you might have some
distance<00:06:01.050> between<00:06:01.229> you<00:06:01.680> and<00:06:01.889> a<00:06:01.919> t29<00:06:02.520> or<00:06:02.909> even

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
distance between you and a t29 or even

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.589 
distance between you and a t29 or even
dare<00:06:03.419> I<00:06:03.449> say<00:06:04.460> another<00:06:05.460> a<00:06:05.580> heavy<00:06:06.090> tank<00:06:06.389> like<00:06:06.569> a

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
dare I say another a heavy tank like a

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.620 
dare I say another a heavy tank like a
tiger<00:06:07.169> and<00:06:07.520> you<00:06:08.520> might<00:06:08.729> have<00:06:09.000> to<00:06:09.240> hit<00:06:09.449> the

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
tiger and you might have to hit the

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.290 
tiger and you might have to hit the
machine<00:06:10.020> gun<00:06:10.229> port<00:06:10.590> on<00:06:10.740> those<00:06:10.979> tanks<00:06:11.460> just<00:06:12.120> to

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
machine gun port on those tanks just to

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.969 
machine gun port on those tanks just to
hit<00:06:12.509> hurt<00:06:12.810> them<00:06:13.050> because<00:06:13.349> if<00:06:13.469> you<00:06:13.620> hit<00:06:13.830> the

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
hit hurt them because if you hit the

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.909 
hit hurt them because if you hit the
hull<00:06:14.190> armor<00:06:14.460> with<00:06:14.699> an<00:06:14.819> l<00:06:14.940> 56<00:06:15.500> that<00:06:16.500> frontal

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
going to shrug it off and probably look

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.170 
going to shrug it off and probably look
at<00:06:20.099> you<00:06:20.279> like<00:06:20.520> what<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.819> hell<00:06:20.969> were<00:06:21.060> you

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
at you like what the hell were you

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.700 
at you like what the hell were you
thinking<00:06:21.509> then<00:06:21.630> shoot<00:06:21.870> the<00:06:21.990> living<00:06:22.259> crap<00:06:22.440> out

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
thinking then shoot the living crap out

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.459 
thinking then shoot the living crap out
with<00:06:23.610> this<00:06:23.849> gun<00:06:24.120> you're<00:06:24.479> at<00:06:24.599> least<00:06:24.840> you're

with this gun you're at least you're
capable<00:06:25.800> of<00:06:26.250> hitting<00:06:26.520> that<00:06:26.759> machine<00:06:27.180> gun<00:06:27.389> port

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719 
capable of hitting that machine gun port

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.910 
capable of hitting that machine gun port
with<00:06:27.900> some<00:06:28.159> reasonable<00:06:29.159> degree<00:06:29.279> of

with some reasonable degree of

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.490 
with some reasonable degree of
see<00:06:30.310> I<00:06:30.550> take<00:06:31.030> that<00:06:31.120> back<00:06:31.180> in<00:06:31.450> even<00:06:31.840> reasonable

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
see I take that back in even reasonable

see I take that back in even reasonable
it<00:06:32.620> is<00:06:33.390> consistent<00:06:34.440> actors<00:06:36.240> but<00:06:37.240> this<00:06:37.480> is<00:06:37.660> the

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
it is consistent actors but this is the

it is consistent actors but this is the
best<00:06:37.930> possible<00:06:38.530> option<00:06:38.680> with<00:06:39.100> this<00:06:39.280> tank<00:06:39.520> and

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
best possible option with this tank and

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.490 
best possible option with this tank and
this<00:06:39.790> is<00:06:39.940> how<00:06:40.060> you<00:06:40.090> want<00:06:40.510> to<00:06:40.630> use<00:06:40.750> it<00:06:41.140> you<00:06:41.290> want
