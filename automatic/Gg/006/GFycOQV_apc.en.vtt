leading up into the into the frame which
cuts<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.599> engine<00:03:13.870> when<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.080> sidestand<00:03:14.500> is

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
cuts the engine when the sidestand is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.590 
cuts the engine when the sidestand is
down<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.060> can't<00:03:16.239> start<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:19.239> problem

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
down so you can't start it the problem

down so you can't start it the problem
came<00:03:19.959> when<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.350> started<00:03:20.650> killing<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.070> engine

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
came when it started killing the engine

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.530 
came when it started killing the engine
the<00:03:22.120> day<00:03:22.299> after<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.810> got<00:03:23.049> it<00:03:23.549> while<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.700> was<00:03:24.820> up

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
nuisance but once I figured out what it

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.699 
nuisance but once I figured out what it
was<00:03:45.190> all<00:03:45.400> out<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.670> do<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:45.910> disconnect<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.709> plug

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
was all out to do is disconnect the plug

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.190 
was all out to do is disconnect the plug
from<00:03:48.310> underneath<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.239> panel<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.780> just

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
from underneath that panel and just

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.599 
from underneath that panel and just
start<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.739> up<00:03:50.799> again<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.980> yeah<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.220> might<00:03:54.459> want

start it up again so yeah you might want

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.039 
start it up again so yeah you might want

over here is my money home trying to
sell<00:04:56.070> yes<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:57.400> think<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.360> was<00:04:58.540> got<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.720> top

cruising<00:04:59.440> speed<00:04:59.620> of<00:04:59.770> 50<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:01.240> takes

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
cruising speed of 50 and it takes

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.690 
cruising speed of 50 and it takes
corners<00:05:01.960> yes<00:05:02.470> take<00:05:02.740> corners<00:05:03.070> fairly<00:05:03.220> slow<00:05:03.550> on

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
corners yes take corners fairly slow on

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.770 
corners yes take corners fairly slow on
that<00:05:03.850> because<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.120> leading<00:05:04.360> angles<00:05:04.630> not

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
that because the leading angles not

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.420 
that because the leading angles not
great<00:05:05.020> on<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:06.040> one

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
great on this one

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.980 
great on this one
leaning<00:05:06.940> angle<00:05:07.210> is<00:05:07.330> much<00:05:07.720> better<00:05:09.720> I've<00:05:10.720> read

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
leaning angle is much better I've read

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.570 
leaning angle is much better I've read
that<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.230> engine<00:05:11.470> is<00:05:11.560> counterweighted<00:05:12.190> and

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
that the engine is counterweighted and

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.970 
that the engine is counterweighted and
not<00:05:13.450> really<00:05:13.630> sure<00:05:13.810> that<00:05:13.840> means<00:05:14.170> but<00:05:14.620> uh<00:05:14.650> I

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
not really sure that means but uh I

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.890 
not really sure that means but uh I
think<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.730> has<00:05:15.820> something<00:05:15.970> to<00:05:16.090> do<00:05:16.240> with<00:05:16.270> the

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
think it has something to do with the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.560 
think it has something to do with the
way<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.140> handles<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:18.150> think<00:05:19.150> I'm<00:05:19.210> gonna<00:05:19.330> have<00:05:19.480> to

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
way it handles I think I'm gonna have to

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.230 
way it handles I think I'm gonna have to
adjust<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:20.080> headlamp<00:05:20.500> because<00:05:21.490> some<00:05:21.880> reason

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
adjust the headlamp because some reason

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.220 
adjust the headlamp because some reason
the<00:05:22.750> beam<00:05:22.990> points<00:05:23.620> upwards<00:05:24.370> into<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:24.910> sky<00:05:25.240> and

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
the beam points upwards into the sky and

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.680 
the beam points upwards into the sky and
I<00:05:26.710> can't<00:05:27.220> really<00:05:27.340> see<00:05:27.580> where<00:05:28.150> I'm<00:05:28.300> going<00:05:28.570> at

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
I can't really see where I'm going at

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.750 
I can't really see where I'm going at
night<00:05:28.810> very<00:05:29.080> well<00:05:29.320> unless<00:05:29.920> it's<00:05:30.070> on<00:05:30.280> low<00:05:30.520> beam

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
night very well unless it's on low beam

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.420 
night very well unless it's on low beam
which<00:05:31.270> still<00:05:31.630> isn't<00:05:31.750> great<00:05:32.050> but<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:33.280> high

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
which still isn't great but the high

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.270 
which still isn't great but the high
beams<00:05:33.670> on<00:05:33.850> reason<00:05:34.120> points<00:05:34.870> upwards<00:05:35.280> looks

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
beams on reason points upwards looks

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.670 
beams on reason points upwards looks
like<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:37.480> headlamp<00:05:37.840> casing<00:05:38.230> is<00:05:38.350> pointing

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
like the headlamp casing is pointing

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.180 
like the headlamp casing is pointing
upwards<00:05:38.950> as<00:05:39.040> well<00:05:39.190> which<00:05:39.940> would<00:05:40.150> explain<00:05:40.450> it

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
upwards as well which would explain it

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.070 
upwards as well which would explain it
so<00:05:42.190> yeah<00:05:42.310> overall<00:05:42.670> I'm<00:05:43.210> very<00:05:43.420> satisfied<00:05:43.630> with

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
so yeah overall I'm very satisfied with

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.160 
so yeah overall I'm very satisfied with
this<00:05:44.140> bike<00:05:44.410> it's<00:05:44.650> an<00:05:45.160> improvement<00:05:45.520> over<00:05:45.820> my

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
this bike it's an improvement over my

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.410 
this bike it's an improvement over my
pointing<00:05:47.170> out<00:05:48.030> I<00:05:49.530> would<00:05:50.530> recommend<00:05:50.890> it<00:05:51.060> but<00:05:52.060> as

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
pointing out I would recommend it but as

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.270 
pointing out I would recommend it but as
with<00:05:52.660> all<00:05:52.780> brand<00:05:53.260> new<00:05:53.410> bikes<00:05:53.650> particularly

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
with all brand new bikes particularly

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.580 
with all brand new bikes particularly
Chinese<00:05:54.550> ones<00:05:54.850> give<00:05:55.030> it<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.150> bit<00:05:55.270> of<00:05:55.330> TLC<00:05:55.590> take

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
Chinese ones give it a bit of TLC take

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.240 
Chinese ones give it a bit of TLC take
it<00:05:56.710> out<00:05:56.800> for<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:57.010> test<00:05:57.040> ride<00:05:57.490> before<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.510> do<00:05:58.900> any

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
absorbers are adjustable so if you're if

you're a bit too tall for the default

position you can adjust it or if you're

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
too short whatever this bike I am a

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.950 
too short whatever this bike I am a
little<00:06:18.730> bit<00:06:18.910> too<00:06:19.030> tall<00:06:19.270> for<00:06:19.300> this<00:06:19.510> bike<00:06:19.720> but

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
little bit too tall for this bike but

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.960 
little bit too tall for this bike but
it's<00:06:20.080> not<00:06:20.230> a<00:06:20.260> problem<00:06:20.470> which<00:06:21.430> means<00:06:21.669> after<00:06:21.820> I

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
it's not a problem which means after I

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.970 
it's not a problem which means after I
had<00:06:22.090> to<00:06:22.180> adjust<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.570> mirrors<00:06:22.840> to<00:06:23.770> point

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
had to adjust the mirrors to point

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.290 
had to adjust the mirrors to point
upwards<00:06:25.950> one<00:06:26.950> thing<00:06:27.190> I<00:06:27.310> am<00:06:27.430> anticipating<00:06:27.730> is

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
upwards one thing I am anticipating is

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.710 
upwards one thing I am anticipating is
this<00:06:28.480> spark<00:06:28.780> plug<00:06:29.430> my<00:06:30.430> Hani<00:06:30.940> I<00:06:31.030> had<00:06:31.390> one<00:06:31.570> just

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
this spark plug my Hani I had one just

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.250 
this spark plug my Hani I had one just
like<00:06:31.840> it<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.350> about<00:06:33.540> six<00:06:34.540> months<00:06:34.600> after<00:06:34.930> I<00:06:35.110> got

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
like it and about six months after I got

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.880 
like it and about six months after I got
it<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.680> we<00:06:36.640> had<00:06:36.940> some<00:06:36.970> heavy<00:06:37.600> sleet<00:06:37.990> and<00:06:38.290> I<00:06:38.800> was

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:38.890 
it the we had some heavy sleet and I was

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.920 
it the we had some heavy sleet and I was
riding<00:06:39.190> in<00:06:39.280> it<00:06:39.370> it<00:06:39.970> started<00:06:40.450> sleeting<00:06:40.630> as<00:06:40.840> I

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
riding in it it started sleeting as I

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.060 
riding in it it started sleeting as I
was<00:06:41.020> riding<00:06:41.290> I<00:06:41.350> didn't<00:06:41.590> I<00:06:41.680> wasn't<00:06:41.890> stupid

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
was riding I didn't I wasn't stupid

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.500 
was riding I didn't I wasn't stupid
enough<00:06:42.310> to<00:06:42.370> go<00:06:42.490> out<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:42.790> sleep<00:06:42.970> but<00:06:43.330> you<00:06:43.450> know

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
enough to go out and sleep but you know

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.640 
enough to go out and sleep but you know
it<00:06:43.600> starts<00:06:43.870> deleting<00:06:44.230> while<00:06:44.350> I<00:06:44.380> was<00:06:44.500> riding

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
it starts deleting while I was riding

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.790 
it starts deleting while I was riding
home<00:06:44.890> and<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:46.840> spark<00:06:47.110> plug<00:06:47.320> shorted<00:06:47.710> out

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
home and the spark plug shorted out

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.990 
home and the spark plug shorted out
because<00:06:48.070> these<00:06:48.220> metal<00:06:48.580> ones<00:06:48.760> aren't

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
because these metal ones aren't

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.120 
because these metal ones aren't
waterproof<00:06:49.510> I<00:06:49.750> don't<00:06:50.110> think

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
waterproof I don't think

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.750 
waterproof I don't think
they<00:06:52.260> in<00:06:53.260> particularly<00:06:53.680> heavy<00:06:54.040> rain<00:06:54.250> these<00:06:54.550> do

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
they in particularly heavy rain these do

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
they in particularly heavy rain these do
tend<00:06:55.090> to<00:06:55.120> short<00:06:55.420> out<00:06:55.570> from<00:06:55.960> my<00:06:56.080> experience<00:06:57.780> so

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
tend to short out from my experience so

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.750 
tend to short out from my experience so
there<00:06:58.960> you<00:06:59.050> go<00:06:59.230> I've<00:06:59.920> got<00:07:00.100> I<00:07:00.340> just<00:07:00.580> got<00:07:00.670> it

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760 
there you go I've got I just got it

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.550 
there you go I've got I just got it
replaced<00:07:01.030> with<00:07:01.210> a<00:07:01.240> better<00:07:01.840> one<00:07:02.080> on<00:07:02.110> that<00:07:02.410> one

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
replaced with a better one on that one

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.760 
replaced with a better one on that one
but<00:07:02.830> there<00:07:03.070> you<00:07:03.130> go

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
but there you go
