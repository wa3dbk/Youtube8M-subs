00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
line right down the middle of it gets

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.540 
line right down the middle of it gets
the<00:04:57.260> inside<00:04:57.410> part<00:04:57.620> of<00:04:57.890> that<00:04:58.010> equator<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.430> just

the inside part of that equator and just

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.740 
the inside part of that equator and just
kind<00:04:58.670> of<00:04:58.700> flips<00:04:58.940> his<00:04:59.090> hand<00:04:59.270> around<00:04:59.390> it<00:04:59.570> real

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
kind of flips his hand around it real

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.990 
kind of flips his hand around it real
quick<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.890> with<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.550> figure-eight

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
quick and it with that figure-eight

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.940 
quick and it with that figure-eight
swing<00:05:02.540> it<00:05:02.900> almost<00:05:03.260> looks<00:05:03.530> like<00:05:03.620> it's

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
swing it almost looks like it's

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.190 
swing it almost looks like it's
impossible<00:05:04.640> for<00:05:04.670> him<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.060> pull<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.780> ball<00:05:05.900> left
