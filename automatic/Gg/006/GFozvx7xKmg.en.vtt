don't<00:00:16.410> know<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> new<00:00:17.070> Disney<00:00:17.400> Channel<00:00:17.699> TV

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
don't know the new Disney Channel TV

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.179 
don't know the new Disney Channel TV
show<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.390> started<00:00:18.810> only<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.740> recently<00:00:20.100> I

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
show that started only really recently I

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.250 
show that started only really recently I
think<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> UK<00:00:21.060> we've<00:00:21.240> had<00:00:21.390> three<00:00:21.689> episodes

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
think in the UK we've had three episodes

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.009 
think in the UK we've had three episodes
and<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:23.519> not<00:00:23.640> sure<00:00:23.699> whether<00:00:24.390> we're<00:00:24.689> I

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and so I'm not sure whether we're I

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
and so I'm not sure whether we're I
think<00:00:25.619> maybe<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.920> were<00:00:25.980> behind<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.580> US<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:26.970> I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
think maybe we were behind the US but I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.580 
think maybe we were behind the US but I
don't<00:00:27.210> really<00:00:27.300> know<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.960> wait<00:00:28.109> really<00:00:28.349> it's

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
don't really know but I wait really it's

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
don't really know but I wait really it's
just<00:00:28.740> pretty<00:00:28.980> new<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.550> started<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
just pretty new it just started on the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.100 
just pretty new it just started on the
Disney<00:00:30.359> Channel<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.399> don't<00:00:32.759> know

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
Disney Channel and and if you don't know

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.330 
Disney Channel and and if you don't know
there<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> TV<00:00:34.380> show<00:00:34.620> called<00:00:34.649> boy<00:00:35.130> meets

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
there was a TV show called boy meets

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310 
there was a TV show called boy meets
world<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.360> actually<00:00:36.570> should<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.170> looked

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
world and I actually should have looked

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.660 
world and I actually should have looked
her<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.440> when<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> began<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.430> finished

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
her up when it began when it finished

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.180 
her up when it began when it finished
but<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> didn't<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.230> may<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.379> began<00:00:40.829> in

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
but I didn't I think it may be began in

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
but I didn't I think it may be began in
the<00:00:41.250> early<00:00:41.850> 90s<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.809> patient<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> tooth<00:00:43.350> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the early 90s and patient the tooth I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.080 
the early 90s and patient the tooth I
think<00:00:43.800> finished<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.190> two<00:00:44.340> thousand<00:00:44.760> naturally

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
think finished in two thousand naturally

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.400 
think finished in two thousand naturally
don't<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.629> why<00:00:45.750> I've<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.230> head

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
now I know how to stay young and stuff

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.689 
now I know how to stay young and stuff
but<00:04:29.229> it's<00:04:29.680> really<00:04:29.830> really<00:04:30.099> cute<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.460> it<00:04:30.490> just

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
but it's really really cute in it just

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.219 
but it's really really cute in it just
deals<00:04:30.879> with<00:04:30.969> all<00:04:31.240> different<00:04:31.629> things<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.169> you

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
deals with all different things that you

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.899 
deals with all different things that you
would<00:04:32.409> expect<00:04:32.500> in<00:04:32.979> this<00:04:33.460> kind<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.759> situation

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
would expect in this kind of situation

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.959 
would expect in this kind of situation
and<00:04:34.419> I<00:04:34.960> just<00:04:35.199> think<00:04:35.439> that<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:36.550> know<00:04:36.669> if<00:04:36.849> you

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
and I just think that you know if you

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.010 
and I just think that you know if you
like<00:04:37.150> this<00:04:37.300> kind<00:04:37.479> of<00:04:37.569> things<00:04:37.750> like<00:04:37.930> for

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
like this kind of things like for

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.830 
like this kind of things like for
example<00:04:38.250> i'm<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.310> big<00:04:39.490> fan<00:04:39.639> of<00:04:39.699> full<00:04:39.939> house<00:04:40.180> and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
example i'm a big fan of full house and

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.600 
example i'm a big fan of full house and
I<00:04:41.020> think<00:04:41.259> if<00:04:41.349> you<00:04:41.439> love<00:04:41.710> full<00:04:41.979> house<00:04:42.159> this<00:04:42.460> is

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
I think if you love full house this is

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.249 
I think if you love full house this is
kind<00:04:42.819> of<00:04:42.909> you<00:04:43.060> know<00:04:43.090> all<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.629> same<00:04:43.780> roots<00:04:44.050> as

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
kind of you know all the same roots as

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.290 
kind of you know all the same roots as
that<00:04:44.469> and<00:04:45.099> of<00:04:45.340> course<00:04:45.370> one<00:04:45.789> thing<00:04:46.030> reaches

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
that and of course one thing reaches

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.360 
that and of course one thing reaches
whoa<00:04:46.419> meets<00:04:46.599> world<00:04:46.780> as<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.139> say<00:04:47.710> I'm<00:04:47.889> not<00:04:47.919> too

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
whoa meets world as I say I'm not too

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.010 
whoa meets world as I say I'm not too
familiar<00:04:48.819> with<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.210> one<00:04:49.449> but<00:04:49.629> obviously<00:04:49.960> I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
familiar with that one but obviously I

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.350 
familiar with that one but obviously I
presume<00:04:50.439> it's<00:04:50.620> pretty<00:04:50.979> similar<00:04:51.189> else<00:04:52.030> yeah<00:04:52.330> i

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
presume it's pretty similar else yeah i

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.580 
presume it's pretty similar else yeah i
totally<00:04:52.599> recommend<00:04:52.719> it<00:04:53.139> if<00:04:53.259> you<00:04:53.349> don't<00:04:53.439> really

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590
