let's<00:01:09.900> say<00:01:10.020> when<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.260> watch<00:01:10.409> The<00:01:10.530> Daily<00:01:10.680> Show

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
let's say when you watch The Daily Show

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.469 
let's say when you watch The Daily Show
they<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.250> fair<00:01:11.549> use<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> time<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.390> they

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
they do fair use all the time where they

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.170 
they do fair use all the time where they
just<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:13.140> commenting<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.180> something

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
just like are commenting on something

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.420 
just like are commenting on something
that<00:01:15.299> exists<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.159> think

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that exists out there and I think

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
that exists out there and I think
because<00:01:17.610> Star<00:01:18.030> Wars<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> news<00:01:18.869> they

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
because Star Wars is in the news they

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.350 
because Star Wars is in the news they
have<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> leg<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> stand<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.700> fair<00:01:21.330> use

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
have more of a leg to stand on fair use

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
have more of a leg to stand on fair use
is<00:01:21.689> interesting<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.310> cost<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.670> lot

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
is interesting and it could cost a lot

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
is interesting and it could cost a lot
of<00:01:23.939> money<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.240> fair<00:01:24.540> use<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> defense

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of money because fair use is a defense

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.210 
of money because fair use is a defense
when<00:01:25.710> someone<00:01:26.070> Sue's<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:28.100> nothing<00:01:29.100> about

that<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:29.670> minute<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.270> judge

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that for one minute and they judge

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.719 
that for one minute and they judge
whether<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> case<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
whether they have a case and that

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.920 
whether they have a case and that
determines<00:01:32.729> whether<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.210> gonna<00:01:33.390> sue<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
determines whether they're gonna sue you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.090 
determines whether they're gonna sue you
and<00:01:34.110> there's<00:01:34.320> something<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and there's something with when you

parody<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.700> your<00:01:35.880> parodies<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.470> not

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
parody if your parodies then you do not

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.929 
parody if your parodies then you do not
need<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> get<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> permission<00:01:38.520> from<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
need to get the permission from the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
need to get the permission from the

person who has the copyright yeah so

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.399 
person who has the copyright yeah so
when<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.070> read<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> Star<00:01:41.700> Wars<00:01:41.939> response

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
when you read the Star Wars response

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.840 
when you read the Star Wars response
that<00:01:43.409> Star<00:01:43.710> Wars<00:01:43.740> response<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.610> think

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that Star Wars response I don't think

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.399 
that Star Wars response I don't think
was<00:01:45.000> them<00:01:45.180> saying<00:01:45.450> we're<00:01:45.600> gonna<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.229> guys

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
was them saying we're gonna see you guys

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
was them saying we're gonna see you guys
I<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.640> them<00:01:47.880> saying<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I think that was them saying we have to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
I think that was them saying we have to
be<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.110> record<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.649> saying<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:49.979> hey<00:01:50.520> yeah<00:01:50.670> we

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
be on record and saying like hey yeah we

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.490 
be on record and saying like hey yeah we
don't<00:01:50.909> agree<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:51.899> whatever<00:01:52.170> yeah
