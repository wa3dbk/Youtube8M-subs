glass to be made it was developed in

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
glass to be made it was developed in
this<00:01:25.399> country<00:01:25.819> too

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
this country too

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.639 
this country too
it<00:01:28.350> changed<00:01:29.009> everything<00:01:29.970> virtually<00:01:30.509> all

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
it changed everything virtually all

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.260 
it changed everything virtually all
skyscrapers<00:01:31.649> are<00:01:31.770> made<00:01:31.920> using<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.520> it's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
skyscrapers are made using it it's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.120 
skyscrapers are made using it it's
called<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> float<00:01:33.990> glass<00:01:34.020> process<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
called the float glass process and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.200 
called the float glass process and
Pilkington's<00:01:36.000> invented<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.920> 1952<00:01:37.939> it<00:01:38.939> was

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
Pilkington's invented it in 1952 it was

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.289 
Pilkington's invented it in 1952 it was
theirs<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:39.840> theirs<00:01:40.500> alone<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.909> took<00:01:42.090> them

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
theirs and theirs alone and it took them

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.870 
theirs and theirs alone and it took them
from<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.049> being<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> pack<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.310> being

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
from just being one of the pack to being

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:57.859 
from just being one of the pack to being
well<00:01:45.240> out<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.659> front<00:01:56.000> sin<00:01:57.000> Helens<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
well out in front sin Helens is the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.320 
well out in front sin Helens is the
greatest<00:01:58.470> center<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.100> glass<00:01:59.399> making<00:01:59.759> in<00:02:00.179> the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
greatest center of glass making in the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.249 
greatest center of glass making in the
world<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> let's<00:02:02.009> begin<00:02:02.220> with<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:04.110> of

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
world so let's begin with this kind of

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.419 
world so let's begin with this kind of
glass<00:02:04.880> until<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.179> romantic<00:02:07.110> story<00:02:07.409> are<00:02:08.069> one

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
glass until the romantic story are one

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.270 
glass until the romantic story are one
of<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.940> greatest<00:02:09.239> industrial<00:02:10.160> inventions<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
of the greatest industrial inventions of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:20.120 
of the greatest industrial inventions of
the<00:02:11.340> age<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.319> float<00:02:13.319> glass<00:02:13.620> process

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.090 

before<00:02:21.030> float<00:02:21.420> glass<00:02:21.690> panes<00:02:22.440> were<00:02:22.710> made<00:02:22.920> by

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
before float glass panes were made by

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.350 
before float glass panes were made by
pouring<00:02:23.400> molten<00:02:23.760> glass<00:02:24.240> onto<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.900> plate<00:02:26.360> but

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
pouring molten glass onto a plate but

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.480 
pouring molten glass onto a plate but
there<00:02:27.570> was<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> problem<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.740> glass<00:02:29.010> produced

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
there was a problem the glass produced

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.300 
there was a problem the glass produced
was<00:02:29.820> rough<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.330> uneven<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:31.560> had<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.980> ground

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
was rough and uneven it had to be ground

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.040 
was rough and uneven it had to be ground
and<00:02:32.550> polished<00:02:33.030> by<00:02:33.210> giant<00:02:33.840> industrial

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and polished by giant industrial

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.520 
and polished by giant industrial
machines<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:36.120> process<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:37.080> hugely

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
machines and this process was hugely

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.059 
machines and this process was hugely
expensive

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.670

after the Second World War the demand

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.069 
after the Second World War the demand
for<00:02:43.920> housing<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.519> cars<00:02:44.819> created<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.870> massive

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
for housing and cars created a massive

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.559 
for housing and cars created a massive
need<00:02:46.439> for<00:02:46.739> glass<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.519> was<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.879> race<00:02:48.150> for

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
need for glass it was a race for

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.050 
need for glass it was a race for
manufacturers<00:02:49.230> worldwide<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:50.549> develop<00:02:50.939> a
