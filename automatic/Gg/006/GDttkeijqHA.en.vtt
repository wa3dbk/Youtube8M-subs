00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.179
 the cabriolet season has finally arrived 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.230
 almost 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.059
 that's why we decided 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.809
 to oppose two major players in 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.940
 premium segment 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.100
 on one side we have the audi a3 cabriolet 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.990
 who is in his second generation and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.220
 on the other the all new bmw series 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 two cabriolets 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.240
 so which of these two models is the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 more fun to live for this summer you 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.220
 said that right away see stone a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.359
 cabriolet this before all a look is there 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.489
 for once, it's pretty successful 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.809
 yes then it's not extremely original 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.550
 a ca it remains a line 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.320
 audi that is consistent with the rest of the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.030
 range but she has a balanced profile 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.129
 she has a touch of elegance more 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 a touch of sport brought by 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.520
 the pack s line and this red paint 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.520
 Of the nicest effect 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.210
 on the side of the bmw it's already less won 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.770
 level look then actually there is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.390
 a big difference between ass butt 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.960
 and there you were you see it's a little 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 little damage 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.590
 as far as the front is very successful it is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.600
 sports aggressiveness as much 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.520
 the back is really missed is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.780
 any dish you should know that this series 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.670
 of cabrol is a new car to 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.229
 she replaces the cabriolet lock then 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.090
 at bmw it's a little convoluted 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.750
 the odd numbers for the 3 doors 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.030
 and 5 doors 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.400
 even numbers for cabriolets 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.950
 and cut them except for the thorel asset to 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.509
 Grandport Here we go quickly on 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.830
 inside since that's exactly the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.320
 same as that of the series of one goes 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.780
 test the habitability for that we placed 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 the seats way as if it's a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.350
 lambda driver one meter 80 who 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.479
 place and there right now for 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 the impression is a little bit short at 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.439
 knee level there are goods of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.479
 forms to place his kneecaps in 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.250
 but with the hard plastic it's not 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.180
 super comfortable sees the same thing at 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.320
 level of the elbows we are still 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.700
 pretty close intimate 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.380
 we console ourselves with a trunk 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 which is superior to that of the three with 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.240
 280 liters once the hood retracts 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.710
 and 335 liters once in place for the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.049
 it's almost the same time 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.509
 at audi and at bmw to deploy it 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.950
 you need 20 seconds and up to 50 km 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.689
 now has the equipment that is 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.219
 specific to the cabriolet this is the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.570
 presence of a winch stop that is delivered 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.149
 serial is very simple to put in 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.719
 place and rather efficient and the seats 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.930
 Heated 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.500
 let's move on to the audi a3 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.000
 punishment 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.760
 a ride in the back and you'll tell me 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.050
 right away what are you thinking then bah 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.450
 it's exactly the same thing to 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.290
 grains the same punishment as you say by 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.040
 against it is a little better to 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.240
 shoulders yeah 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.100
 on the other hand it is a little less well 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.200
 at the volume of the chest counted 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.870
 twenty liters less it's 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.910
 even less if we opted for 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.130
 transmission quattro question options and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.480
 equipment for a cabriolet specifies 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.640
 down is almost all the options 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.650
 whatever the level of finishing the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.140
 heated seats its 400 euros the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.730
 neck warmer is 545 euros and the wind 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.560
 top it will depend on the finishing levels 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.260
 but in all cases at 400 euros it's 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.660
 more expensive at home once on the road 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.760
 let's start with the audi a3 level first 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.220
 engines we start very low at 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.730
 110 horses up to 184 horses in 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.070
 diesel 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.870
 as is the case here our model 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.980
 test which in addition equip the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.190
 four-wheel quattro transmission 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.470
 So motor and dsg box to six 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.450
 reports on the gasoline side it starts at a hundred 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.550
 in horses and it goes up to 180 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.960
 horses waiting for s3 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.210
 at the level are these driving people all 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.310
 immediately see is more oriented comfort 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.960
 it's flexible, it's sailing a little bit 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.430
 it's a convertible that's made for the 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.590
 walk it is seen immediately 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.670
 now at the level of perceptions me 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.620
 I think it's well isolated 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.720
 windtop does the job anyway and we 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.090
 is not subject to big bursts of 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.470
 wind turbulence and the little heater 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.760
 neck is still appreciable when 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.350
 the temperatures they are are a 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.510
 little bit we go squarely 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.440
 it helps with the heated seat 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 makes a good combination 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.850
 so we can take advantage of 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.440
 pleasure of a convertible even when 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.670
 temperatures are close to zero 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.680
 so welcome to see the series of 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.930
 cabriolets then even punishment the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.880
 power levels ranges from 136 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.910
 horses with a 3 cylinders this time 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.860
 up to 326 horses there for the 235 n 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.680
 even the f3 this level of power 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.330
 rivaled by his muscles and it's violent 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.760
 so we chose the heart of the range 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.490
 to deal with the summer says one to a 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.660
 2 liters diesel of 190 horses 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.580
 its only fault is that it is noisy 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.530
 that's the problem of this engine that 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.090
 is rather full at low speeds and the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.190
 relaunch rather well it suits the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.050
 philosophy we're going to say versatile the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.880
 car now to driving it's 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.919
 firmer in suspension chassis 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.470
 following exactly so kitty firmer 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.120
 says more precisely we have something 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.680
 much more direct at the level of the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.440
 direction so that has a character 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.600
 really pronounced more athletic precisely 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.850
 this four- cylinder diesel is equipped 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.960
 an 8-speed automatic transmission that 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.940
 is really excellent 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.830
 regarding insulation I know 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.990
 not what you think I find it a 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.850
 little bit better in the still audi 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.500
 yeah that's right but better isolate 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.910
 some dealers agree me I 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.230
 did not find it rather bad but 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.550
 now that you say after trying 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.050
 two it is true that there is a little bit 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.810
 better on the audit that fits a little 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.730
 to the philosophy more comfort of the audi 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.870
 facing the bmw sports quite 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.639
 so it was an extremely tough match 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.110
 tight it took out the photo finish 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.210
 time the two German builders 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.950
 are close in terms of benefits 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.450
 so to choose the winner we had to 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.010
 do this at the stroke of heart and the blow of 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.580
 heart it's okay with a car 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.470
 pleasure 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.270
 and on this plane there is the beautiful blue 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.639
 but that ends with a very slight 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.900
 advance given by his dynamism and his 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.900
 excellent automatic gearbox 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.940
 2 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.830
