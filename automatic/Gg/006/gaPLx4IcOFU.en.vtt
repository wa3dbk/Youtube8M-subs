00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi here is nice that you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.670
 come back to me right now 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.660
 probably just seem that way 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.639
 flown 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.950
 I have only one before 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.900
 bit bred because I noticed 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.020
 have that beta tournament tomorrow yes 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.119
 already starts and I somehow even 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.529
 not so well prepared for it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.330
 I decided spontaneously for it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.789
 it was still a while to gamble 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.189
 I have some traxlers here yet 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.349
 good dvs had bred but one 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 foreign with in pension so 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.820
 theoretically times so the method and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.960
 I thought yes you start the recording 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.550
 when it comes to a shiny you are annoyed 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.920
 Otherwise, if you did not take it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.649
 I actually had that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.110
 thought but somehow the recording is 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 not there I do not know what I already have 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.649
 definitely fabricated again 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.860
 the live recording is not there 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.140
 That's why I only have this recording 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.930
 Here after hatching but you have to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.149
 believe me it was really the seventh 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.940
 I have taken out of the pension 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.260
 that was this shiny draxler up here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.049
 the first slot you see that 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.880
 foreign because I'm there because I'm straight 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.010
 the foreign with a new one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.479
 had replaced hatched and therefore 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.060
 makes it all the more crass 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.890
 because the seventh hatched here 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.540
 that was also the last egg of that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.549
 foreign and I thought so 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.189
 is doing so now when the bills 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.890
 that would be the madness somehow and then 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.259
 was it actually seems it has kathi 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.470
 defense and special defense 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.970
 at 31 and generally outstanding 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.560
 Potential is therefore definitely 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 usable i would play it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.420
 At least I seem or shit there 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.840
 on it a few values ​​somehow not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.490
 quite as optimal are yes and I'm happy 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.229
 me also later tournament even if it 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.649
 somehow not in time for me 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.869
 kram fits, but when did that happen 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.590
 ever an online tournament with me 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.229
 somehow really done 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.479
 I can not remember it that way 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.240
 that's definitely seems to 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.619
 rassler i hope this short video has 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.599
 I like you thank you for that 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.599
 watching it will be good until then bye
