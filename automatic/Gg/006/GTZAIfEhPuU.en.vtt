00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 let's take advantage of this one workout 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.760
 methodology that takes inspiration from a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.690
 famous crisis training I go into 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.089
 we're going to do a mixed job in 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.609
 to which we call for strength e 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.410
 we continue with a hypertrophic work in 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.220
 we particularly have the first one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 defined exercise thinking and where 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.199
 let's play a tra car 5 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.050
 we then have a job in 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.350
 three sets very challenging and it's a job 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.719
 purely inter-trophic we then have a 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.969
 exercise that is called speciano 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.100
 this particular to go to work 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 in a targeted manner some muscles of the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.750
 our body and let's finish 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.370
 training with a job more 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.860
 network oriented 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
 so happy with particular repetitions 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.940
 so in this case 50 repetition there 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.940
 can give of itself in attracting all of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.410
 then row first heavy exercise 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.870
 we have a 3 set 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 we have a special exercise and we have 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 50 repetitions 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.920
 today I show you on day 3 of this 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.070
 special programming in which we go to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.790
 work with the dorsal ridges there 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.030
 very important group that the goal 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.549
 will be to try to wide there 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.580
 riccardi give more muscle mass a 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:27.200
 this important muscle group that 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.200
 gives the appearance of no let's say some 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.810
 type of in appearance like that of 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.729
 one we feed those who live behind when 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.430
 you have more developed sanipoli tours 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.979
 sees this angular shape these see 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.170
 these two big golden salts that you 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.940
 draw the back first exercise 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.140
 as we said we are going to stimulate strength 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.420
 here we have to do the tractions to 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.560
 reverse handlebar armchairs in 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.009
 phase your level a bit too 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.920
 athletic going up rare with a weight 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.289
 let's do a 35 later 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.050
 we go to make the tris and reserves 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.060
 consisting of the rocker brick king 8 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.270
 repetitions then immediately after 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.239
 went to fly by sitting 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.220
 with two dumbbells at 38 repetitions and then 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.280
 immediately after, without pause, I went to do the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.950
 pool and with eight more repetitions 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.989
 at the end of these three exercises 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.989
 recover two minutes and repeat for a 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.840
 total three times then 8 first 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.579
 eight the second 8 to the third all in a row 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.680
 very challenging because you come to the 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.560
 very destructive end, very good companion 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.380
 on the back paola gho minutes aristide tea 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.750
 we have that exercise three times 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.870
 special in this case we are going to do 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.090
 a reverse pull down at the bar 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.890
 or you can go for a pull 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.799
 Reverse down is too challenging for 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.400
 you as an exercise classic pullover 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.799
 with the handlebars 36 the special army of 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.829
 instead say 3x6 then 336 indicates 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.859
 however a force-oriented work 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.160
 recovery 2 minutes last exercise 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.260
 I want to listen to 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.690
 because it is easier to do these jobs 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.300
 to the car with more possibilities than 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.520
 go to adjust the weight you have to go 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.500
 to do the letter machine forward or the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.050
 set the traction where you go to 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.330
 perform a series of 50 repetitions in 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.840
 this case the goal is to try to 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.960
 pull these 50 repetitions and get there 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.380
 at the end in the shortest possible time 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.020
 start with a low load if you notice a 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.880
 at some point maybe you are at 30 40 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.050
 fatigue comes , you can't do it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.350
 that continue made a small one 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.490
 10 15 second pause and continue up 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.280
 to get to 50 repetitions recovered 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.420
 well and go to the exercises 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.970
 later this day in 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.950
 the session ends particularly 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.500
 then going to work with the biceps 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.720
 with seven others it seems a long series 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.390
 fifty editions and then with a job 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.440
 on the body and on the oblique so this 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.840
 represents the third session present 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.490
 of the eighth weight training cycle that 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.770
 found inside the born guide 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.020
 at least milly volume 1 and in this 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.220
 case we make a force call and 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.209
 we continue with our work 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.209
 hypertrophic
