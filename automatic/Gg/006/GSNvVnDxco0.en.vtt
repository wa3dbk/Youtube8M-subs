00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.770
 map of the east bastion that is on Mars 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.350
 as in the destination there is a theater mode ni 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.869
 a way to play free or something like that 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.759
 well run if there is but I still do not 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.739
 I open marte if any problem I still 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.730
 I do not open Tuesday I go in venus and also 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.390
 dog 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.370
 As I was saying, I had to put this 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.739
 confrontational game that good at 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.809
 this game in this game mode of 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.180
 confrontation is where you are 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.300
 I have not seen the map in other places 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.650
 I was playing rescue and control but in 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.140
 confrontation is where I got this 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.080
 court more often so good since 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.170
 be in this court see here is what 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.430
 that seems to be a pelican I was 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.670
 also being in some forums that 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.009
 said it was a ship of this the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.660
 destination that there was a ship that came out in 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.990
 marte not that see how this type of ships 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.789
 but others say yes and by the way 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.310
 they saw this formation in heaven that 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.530
 They are like crosses and as they are already 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.479
 giving shots is not that is the war is 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.270
 the pure good war as I said here 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.649
 there is the pelican and I do not know how 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.450
 I was in multiplayer because you have to 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.310
 be concentrated in the game at the same 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.789
 time I recorded a secret which is 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.009
 very strange if I've never had the 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.810
 first time that I do this as 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.720
 can see in the images normally 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.490
 in the halo not in the halo 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.690
 you find these movies 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.810
 crashed 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:51.790
 You do not find one on the beach and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.590
 sergio very strange but good you 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.390
 you find on the beach that gives you this way 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.670
 as heals and ammunition and there are 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.580
 dead marines in halo 3 also in 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.470
 the 4 I imagine that if for example they see 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.140
 this part not here as this part here 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.150
 where I get it seems like the part where 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.369
 get off the pelican that you go as well as 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.410
 Bogota while he could be like this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.660
 gate and what most called me the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.870
 Attention were the wings on the sides 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.220
 how good can you see in the image 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.870
 have these things like flexing 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.480
 not when the pelican is seen to park 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.030
 always like lowering those things and already 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.740
 it pulls out like the turbines and besides that 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.560
 has like this thing back does not have like 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.660
 this one poked back that's interesting that 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.030
 have put it on as well as shocked not 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.090
 because it was something very characteristic of 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.330
 milestone now that bungie because no longer no longer 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.020
 they do it but I do not know that's what 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.340
 the truth was very interesting to me 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.590
 this about this secret I know that in the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.319
 destiny there is more secret I know that there will be 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.140
 more because people Bungie and people 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.999
 normally they like to put this secret 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.609
 no call of duty had secrets had 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:03:00.099
 many secrets and some that I also 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.459
 what 3 had a lot and if it can be 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.040
 everything would only be the beginning not of 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.500
 this but also everything happened I hope that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.870
 he liked the secret that they have 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.709
 fun with this secret and that is 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.590
 have interested in this the secrets 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.169
 truth and how do you know if they come out more 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.099
 secrets because I will continue to see it 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.680
 channel 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.319

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.530
