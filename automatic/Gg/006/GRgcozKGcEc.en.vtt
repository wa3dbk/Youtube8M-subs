undead and that has no actual link or
anything<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.590> with<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:14.160> could<00:00:14.400> be<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
anything to do with what could be the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.000 
anything to do with what could be the
second<00:00:15.150> zombie<00:00:15.480> map<00:00:15.690> from<00:00:16.410> map<00:00:16.619> back<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
second zombie map from map back to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.790 
second zombie map from map back to
that's<00:00:17.490> that's<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.180> an<00:00:18.449> idea<00:00:18.900> okay<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.439> this

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
that's that's just an idea okay but this

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
that's that's just an idea okay but this
video<00:00:20.730> will<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:22.670> judging<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.789> pretty<00:00:24.240> good

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
video will be judging a pretty good

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.080 
video will be judging a pretty good
guess<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.859> map<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.609> now<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.970> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
guess at what the map can be now as you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
guess at what the map can be now as you
can<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> video<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.470> playing<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
level is where this most of these these

level is where this most of these these
Easter<00:00:39.270> Egg<00:00:39.450> codes<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.379> revealed<00:00:40.739> which

Easter Egg codes are revealed which

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.440 
Easter Egg codes are revealed which
gives<00:00:41.340> us<00:00:41.520> some<00:00:41.760> sort<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.530> idea<00:00:43.530> onto<00:00:44.329> what<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
gives us some sort of idea onto what it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.770 
gives us some sort of idea onto what it
could<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.280> when<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.510> chair

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
could be so when we get out of the chair

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.920 
could be so when we get out of the chair
and<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.410> walking<00:00:50.180> if<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.329> pause<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> game

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and we are walking if you pause the game

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.630 
and we are walking if you pause the game
you<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:53.160> ascension<00:00:54.710> 918<00:00:55.710> 823

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you will see this ascension 918 823

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.510 
you will see this ascension 918 823
rollover<00:00:57.059> bar<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:58.039> hasn't<00:00:59.039> been<00:00:59.190> altered

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
rollover bar this hasn't been altered

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.729 
rollover bar this hasn't been altered
since<00:01:00.059> ascension<00:01:00.719> came<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.500> played

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
since ascension came out if you played

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.880 
since ascension came out if you played
the<00:01:01.920> campaign<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.670> day<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.930> did

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the campaign on day one and you did

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
the campaign on day one and you did
pause<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> game<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.330> see

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
pause the game at this bit you would see

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.670 
pause the game at this bit you would see
ascension<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:08.040> yeah<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.240> through<00:01:09.680> into

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
ascension but yeah as we go through into

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160 
ascension but yeah as we go through into
more<00:01:11.460> into<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> level<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.600> ascension

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
more into the level the ascension

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
more into the level the ascension
disappears<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> bunch<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
disappears and you can see a bunch of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.260 
disappears and you can see a bunch of
numbers<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.680> if<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:17.040> even<00:01:17.070> further<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:18.060> see

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
numbers and if we go even further we see

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.030 
numbers and if we go even further we see
ascension<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:18.960> again<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.500> some<00:01:19.680> numbers

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
ascension back again with some numbers

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.749 
ascension back again with some numbers
but<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.060> next<00:01:21.360> crucial<00:01:21.900> bit<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:23.369> bit

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
but this next crucial bit is the bit

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.830 
but this next crucial bit is the bit
that<00:01:24.470> gives<00:01:25.470> away<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:27.060> second<00:01:27.420> zombie<00:01:27.659> mount

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that gives away the second zombie mount

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.039 
that gives away the second zombie mount
as<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.009> says<00:01:29.600> echo<00:01:30.600> lon<00:01:30.869> I'm

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
as you can see here it says echo lon I'm

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.510 
as you can see here it says echo lon I'm
not<00:01:31.320> sure<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:31.710> how<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.890> pronounce<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
not sure if that's how you pronounce it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.179 
not sure if that's how you pronounce it
but<00:01:32.790> yeah<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.270> says<00:01:33.810> echo<00:01:34.079> long<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:35.130> just

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
but yeah it says echo long and it's just

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
but yeah it says echo long and it's just
after<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.299> discover<00:01:36.720> Rezanov<00:01:37.200> has<00:01:37.380> been<00:01:37.530> dead

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
after you discover Rezanov has been dead

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
after you discover Rezanov has been dead
for<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.950> long<00:01:38.009> time<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> nervous<00:01:39.299> 6

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
for a long time and that the nervous 6

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
for a long time and that the nervous 6
project<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.829> sunken<00:01:41.369> rusalka<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.950> see

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
project is on sunken rusalka and you see

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.020 
project is on sunken rusalka and you see
air<00:01:44.430> :

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
air :

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.830 
air :
now<00:01:45.810> yet<00:01:46.500> echo<00:01:46.799> lon<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:48.000> may<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.240> wondering

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
now yet echo lon they may be wondering

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.710 
now yet echo lon they may be wondering
where<00:01:49.259> echo<00:01:49.560> long<00:01:49.799> could<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.159> set<00:01:50.490> well<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.149> you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
where echo long could be set well as you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.380 
where echo long could be set well as you
see<00:01:53.899> from<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.259> cinematic<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.390> probably

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
see from the cinematic it's probably

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.149 
see from the cinematic it's probably
somewhere<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> sunken<00:01:58.799> rusalka

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
somewhere to do with the sunken rusalka

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.300 
somewhere to do with the sunken rusalka
in<00:01:59.399> cuba<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.170> now<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.409> reason<00:02:01.649> i<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
in cuba and now one reason i think this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.090 
in cuba and now one reason i think this
is<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:03.060> when<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.899> objective

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
is because when you get to the objective

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.280 
is because when you get to the objective
on<00:02:05.100> where<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.520> shows<00:02:05.700> up<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.840> after<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
on where it shows up it's just after you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.350 
on where it shows up it's just after you
found<00:02:07.469> out<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> nova<00:02:08.039> 6<00:02:08.280> project<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
found out the nova 6 project is on the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.520 
found out the nova 6 project is on the
rusalka

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
rusalka

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.350 
rusalka
and<00:02:10.679> there's<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.100> other<00:02:11.250> reason<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.300> don't

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and there's one other reason and I don't

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.390 
and there's one other reason and I don't
know<00:02:12.690> how<00:02:13.260> these<00:02:13.440> people<00:02:13.650> managed<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.190> find

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
know how these people managed to find

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.670 
know how these people managed to find
this<00:02:14.520> out<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.660> there's<00:02:16.110> some<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.410> weird

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
this out but if there's some like weird

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.410 
this out but if there's some like weird
glitch<00:02:17.010> should<00:02:17.220> be<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.490> theater<00:02:18.000> mode<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
glitch should be going theater mode and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.050 
glitch should be going theater mode and
you<00:02:19.020> search<00:02:19.350> for<00:02:19.380> maps<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.340> shows<00:02:20.580> up<00:02:20.819> all

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you search for maps and it shows up all

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.990 
you search for maps and it shows up all
the<00:02:21.750> maps<00:02:21.959> like<00:02:22.319> when<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.950> say<00:02:23.220> all<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> maps<00:02:23.760> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
the maps like when I say all the maps I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 
the maps like when I say all the maps I
mean<00:02:24.209> all<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> multiplier<00:02:25.230> Maps<00:02:25.470> out<00:02:25.650> right

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
mean all the multiplier Maps out right

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.030 
mean all the multiplier Maps out right
now<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.459> future<00:02:27.180> maps<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.410> one<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.770> them<00:02:28.890> is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
now and future maps and one of them is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.809 
now and future maps and one of them is
called<00:02:29.220> Cuba<00:02:29.730> town<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.350> as<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:32.040> it's

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
called Cuba town and as you if it's

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.330 
called Cuba town and as you if it's
obvious<00:02:33.180> ascension<00:02:33.860> was<00:02:34.860> based<00:02:35.100> off<00:02:35.310> of

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
obvious ascension was based off of

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.880 
obvious ascension was based off of
launched<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.480> now<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.930> eklund<00:02:37.500> could<00:02:37.770> be

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
launched and now this eklund could be

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.030 
launched and now this eklund could be
based<00:02:38.100> off<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:39.239> Cuba<00:02:39.510> town<00:02:39.930> which<00:02:40.590> could<00:02:40.920> be

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
based off of Cuba town which could be

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.670 
based off of Cuba town which could be
coming<00:02:41.280> out<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> map<00:02:41.670> pack<00:02:41.910> 2<00:02:42.120> or<00:02:42.330> map<00:02:43.200> pack<00:02:43.410> 3

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
coming out a map pack 2 or map pack 3

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.130 
coming out a map pack 2 or map pack 3
wherever<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.640> um<00:02:44.820> yeah<00:02:45.360> that's<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.690> Maya

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
wherever but um yeah that's just Maya

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.250 
wherever but um yeah that's just Maya
that's<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.310> my<00:02:47.430> little<00:02:47.580> theory<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that's just my little theory and if you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.620 
that's just my little theory and if you
want<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.560> check<00:02:49.709> out<00:02:49.860> more<00:02:50.070> about<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.630> codes

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
want to check out more about the codes

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.220 
want to check out more about the codes
