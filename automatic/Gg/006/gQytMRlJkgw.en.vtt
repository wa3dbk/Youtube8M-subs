00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.680
My name is Matt Brumbelow.  I'm one of

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.180
the research engineers here at the

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.910
Insurance Institute.  A few years ago we

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.250
did a study of frontal crashes and

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.590
vehicles that had a good rating in our

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.109
frontal crash test and how people in

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.090
those vehicles who were belted and had

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.220
airbag deployments were still being

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.590
injured or killed, and a lot of those

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.660
crashes that we found were into the

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.480
backs of large trucks.   We wanted to look

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.180
more closely at those and see what could

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.010
be done to try and make those crashes

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.310
more survivable. And there is a federal

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.010
regulation for the guards that have to

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.620
be put on the rears of large trailers,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.320
but it turns out that regulation is not

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.910
working well to prevent underride

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.329
crashes.  As we thought about ways that we

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.739
might be able to improve the situation

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.960
we thought that it would make sense to

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.750
compare how different designs do in the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.719
exact same crash conditions, so we took

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.280
trailers from the eight largest

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.430
manufacturers by sales volume in the U.S.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.250
and we tested each of those trailers in

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.440
three different conditions, all at 35

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.290
miles an hour.  By doing this we were able to

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.390
show that some guards already perform

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.909
much better than others.  We've conducted

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.830
all these trailer underride tests with

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.650
the same passenger vehicle.  It's a 2010

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.470
Chevy Malibu, and we chose it just

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.720
because it is a typical midsize sedan

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.670
and because it's a good performer in

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.820
frontal crash tests at this speed.  What we

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.650
really wanted to highlight is that it's

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.390
the trailer design that needs to be

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.490
improved and changed, not the passenger

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.898
vehicle design.

00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:43.150
I'm Sean O'Malley, senior

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.259
test coordinator at the Insurance

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.930
Institute for Highway Safety.  For this

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.790
test we purchased eight brand new semi-

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.829
trailers.  We will first put it in

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.900
position in the crash hall, take

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.909
measurements of each component of the

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.920
back of the trailer; the frame rails, underride

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.690
guard, door opening,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.340
then we will load the trailer with 38

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.040
thousand pounds of concrete blocks.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.990
We've tested them at a full width where a car

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.970
hits the center of the trailer at 35

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.510
miles an hour, we then tested 50 percent overlap

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.000
where only half of the car hits the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.190
trailer, and then again we ran it at

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.510
30 percent overlap.  Post-crash we

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.220
will measure the trailer again with

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.110
these measurements.  We determine how far

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.470
things have bent and moved.  After this

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.360
test we will remove the car from the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.510
trailer and place it in the photo studio.  In the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.240
studio we will do a detailed analysis to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.000
determine dummy contact points inside

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.580
the vehicle before we measure the door

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.920
and window openings to determine how far

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.420
the trailer intruded into the vehicle.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.940
Manufacturers have been really receptive

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.250
by and large to the testing that we've

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.260
been doing.  Most of them have never been

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.760
able to see how their guards would

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.160
perform in a crash test.  What we're

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.170
hoping is that as they get their results

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.000
and go back and compare how they've done

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.250
relative to their competitors that they

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.170
might be able to make improvements just

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.450
on their own initiative but in the long

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.790
run there's a chance that the regulation

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.100
could even be rewritten to require a lot

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.920
of these improvements.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.720
