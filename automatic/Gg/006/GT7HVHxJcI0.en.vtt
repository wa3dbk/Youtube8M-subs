00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.560 
really be able to see the shimmer too
much<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.700> even<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> black<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
much on this even with the black one I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.600 
much on this even with the black one I
still<00:02:03.810> had<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.920> multiple<00:02:05.399> lines

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
still had to actually do multiple lines

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.139 
still had to actually do multiple lines
and<00:02:05.909> build<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.719> able<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.110> get<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
and build it up to be able to get a

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.940 
and build it up to be able to get a
somewhat<00:02:09.149> opaque<00:02:09.599> formula<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.709> part

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
somewhat opaque formula and I think part

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.770 
somewhat opaque formula and I think part
of<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.670> they<00:02:11.910> might<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.270> mixed

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
of that is is they might have mixed

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.870 
of that is is they might have mixed
purple<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.410> black<00:02:13.590> together<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.430> that's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
purple in the black together and that's

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.150 
purple in the black together and that's
why<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.090> overall<00:02:15.840> called<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.709> black<00:02:16.920> one

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
why the overall called and the black one

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.309 
why the overall called and the black one
is<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.640> gray<00:02:17.850> which<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.840> bummer

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
is in that gray which is a bummer

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.090 
is in that gray which is a bummer
because<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:21.319> heard<00:02:22.319> good<00:02:22.470> things<00:02:22.530> about<00:02:22.800> this

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
because I heard good things about this

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.809 
because I heard good things about this
and<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.640> does<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.230> potential<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.980> it

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
and it does have potential it just it

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.190 
and it does have potential it just it
isn't<00:02:28.069> lives<00:02:29.069> up<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.310> said<00:02:29.970> potentials<00:02:30.660> so

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
isn't lives up to said potentials so

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.830 
isn't lives up to said potentials so
