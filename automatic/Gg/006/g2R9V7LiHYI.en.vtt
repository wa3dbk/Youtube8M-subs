like that things but were they keeping

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.220 
like that things but were they keeping
like<00:00:42.980> gasoline<00:00:43.220> up<00:00:43.610> there<00:00:43.790> is<00:00:43.910> not<00:00:44.330> easy<00:00:44.540> brick

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
like gasoline up there is not easy brick

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.790 
like gasoline up there is not easy brick
stone<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.309> not<00:00:46.489> gonna<00:00:46.809> have<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:48.019> yeah<00:00:48.620> but

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
stone it's not gonna have to yeah but

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.530 
stone it's not gonna have to yeah but
the<00:00:48.890> roof<00:00:49.100> complete<00:00:49.580> roof<00:00:49.790> is<00:00:49.970> like<00:00:50.150> wood<00:00:50.510> I

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
the roof complete roof is like wood I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.350

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
think yeah but the structure is so god I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.470 
think yeah but the structure is so god I
hope<00:00:53.540> this<00:00:53.660> doesn't<00:00:53.839> get<00:00:53.989> farther

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.430 

they<00:01:03.480> don't<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.840> seem<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.170> they're

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
they don't really seem like they're

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.080 
they don't really seem like they're
doing<00:01:04.620> very<00:01:04.800> is<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.610> stream<00:01:05.940> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
doing very is that little stream of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.200 
doing very is that little stream of
water<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.540> doing<00:01:06.900> anything

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.780 

VMI<00:01:11.870> wins<00:01:12.080> is<00:01:12.200> right<00:01:12.350> there<00:01:12.560> oh<00:01:12.770> they<00:01:13.490> must

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
VMI wins is right there oh they must

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.930 
VMI wins is right there oh they must
have<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.090> back<00:01:14.120> feel<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.720> heat<00:01:14.930> I<00:01:15.380> know<00:01:15.950> well

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
have it back feel the heat I know well

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.160 
have it back feel the heat I know well
you<00:01:17.180> can<00:01:17.300> see<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.510> fire<00:01:17.690> alarm<00:01:17.960> over<00:01:18.230> there

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.840 

I've<00:01:24.170> never<00:01:24.440> seen<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.770> fire<00:01:25.040> but<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.520> thought

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
I've never seen a fire but I thought

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.320 
I've never seen a fire but I thought
like<00:01:26.150> firefighters<00:01:26.870> will<00:01:27.020> be<00:01:27.140> doing<00:01:27.320> stuff

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
like firefighters will be doing stuff

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.060 
like firefighters will be doing stuff
there<00:01:29.330> spraying<00:01:30.050> stuff<00:01:30.290> we'll<00:01:30.770> just<00:01:30.950> that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
there spraying stuff we'll just that

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.070 
there spraying stuff we'll just that
it's<00:01:31.250> not<00:01:31.310> doing<00:01:31.610> anything<00:01:31.970> are<00:01:32.750> they<00:01:32.840> just

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
it's not doing anything are they just

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.960 
it's not doing anything are they just
letting<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.590> burn<00:01:33.800> down<00:01:34.040> as<00:01:34.280> much<00:01:34.430> as<00:01:34.610> they<00:01:34.730> can

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
letting it burn down as much as they can

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.910 
letting it burn down as much as they can
look<00:01:35.600> at<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> water<00:01:36.020> it's<00:01:36.290> not<00:01:36.470> really<00:01:36.740> doing

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
look at the water it's not really doing

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.350 
look at the water it's not really doing
a<00:01:37.040> whole<00:01:37.070> lot<00:01:37.220> other<00:01:37.610> than<00:01:37.820> keeping<00:01:38.120> it<00:01:38.240> from

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
a whole lot other than keeping it from

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.880 
a whole lot other than keeping it from
that<00:01:38.570> side<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:39.110> don't<00:01:39.230> think<00:01:39.590> they're<00:01:39.740> trying

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
that side I don't think they're trying

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.890 
that side I don't think they're trying
to<00:01:40.100> put<00:01:40.400> that<00:01:40.550> out<00:01:40.610> right<00:01:40.970> now<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.360> know<00:01:41.540> there

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
to put that out right now you know there

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.790 
to put that out right now you know there
you're<00:01:42.020> probably<00:01:42.050> just<00:01:42.350> going<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.560> let<00:01:42.710> it

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
you're probably just going to let it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.710 
you're probably just going to let it
burn<00:01:42.890> itself<00:01:43.130> out<00:01:43.430> it's<00:01:44.330> going<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.570> eventually

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
burn itself out it's going to eventually

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.430 
burn itself out it's going to eventually
run<00:01:45.110> out<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.520> what<00:01:46.520> they<00:01:46.869> probably<00:01:47.869> should<00:01:48.260> be

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
run out of what they probably should be

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.810 
run out of what they probably should be
doing<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.800> like<00:01:48.979> spraying<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.430> side<00:01:49.640> this

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
doing is like spraying the side this

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.190 
doing is like spraying the side this
side<00:01:50.060> just<00:01:50.360> keep<00:01:50.510> it<00:01:50.630> from<00:01:50.750> jumping

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
side just keep it from jumping

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.840 
side just keep it from jumping
well<00:01:51.590> that's<00:01:51.800> right<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.190> good<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.670> it's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
well that's right it's good that it's

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.510 
well that's right it's good that it's
it's<00:01:55.850> good<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.290> all

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:32.870 

I<00:02:30.680> think<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.799> structured<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.400> groove<00:02:32.730> is

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
I think that structured that groove is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.580 
I think that structured that groove is
going<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:34.610> we<00:02:35.610> couldn't<00:02:36.079> look<00:02:37.079> they<00:02:37.290> got<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
going in we couldn't look they got the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.250 
going in we couldn't look they got the
cops<00:02:37.829> all<00:02:38.010> across<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:39.569> street

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
cops all across the street

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:51.710 
cops all across the street
just<00:02:42.260> stop

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.700
