00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just think that's like a big factor but

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.640 
just think that's like a big factor but
you<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.939> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> got<00:01:27.869> myself<00:01:28.049> used<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the xbox controller a bit and that's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.859

console just for call of duty i don't

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.550 
console just for call of duty i don't
think<00:03:09.030> any<00:03:09.330> other<00:03:09.420> games<00:03:09.870> really<00:03:10.140> matter<00:03:10.440> i

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
think any other games really matter i

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.530 
think any other games really matter i
play<00:03:10.800> battlefield<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.550> both<00:03:11.760> consoles<00:03:12.300> and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
play battlefield on both consoles and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.199 
play battlefield on both consoles and
they're<00:03:12.720> both<00:03:12.959> just<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.470> same<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.160> i<00:03:14.940> think

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
they're both just the same and i think

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.910 
they're both just the same and i think
call<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.510> duty<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.840> only<00:03:16.020> game<00:03:16.320> where<00:03:16.590> it's

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
call of duty is the only game where it's

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.580 
call of duty is the only game where it's
kind<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.430> better<00:03:17.640> on<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.940> xbox<00:03:18.330> 360<00:03:18.930> not<00:03:19.410> only

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
kind of better on the xbox 360 not only

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.880 
kind of better on the xbox 360 not only
that<00:03:19.680> call<00:03:20.520> xbox<00:03:21.180> also<00:03:21.660> gets<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.020> dlc<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
that call xbox also gets the dlc and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.130 
that call xbox also gets the dlc and
every<00:03:23.670> update<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:24.270> bit<00:03:24.510> earlier<00:03:24.900> than<00:03:25.020> the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140

playstation as well so that's another
