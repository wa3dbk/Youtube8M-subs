00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello my name is the name of the game and this episode 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.370
 number 24 of the bible blog are you 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.320
 probably already noticed those 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.960
 stickers that many people use 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 cars that cite biblical passages well 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.300
 out of context or sometimes the passage 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.439
 In life it is not if it was not already 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.090
 enough we still have a lot of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.609
 people doing this kind of thing inside 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.140
 of the church and thus the original meaning of 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.140
 tickets is being raped 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.050
 Of course I do not want this video 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.059
 become a biologist for a person who 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.800
 dollar brings shapes even because I am the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.079
 author of a word but without shadow of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.090
 There are no doubts about the interpretation of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.379
 passages when we try to bring her 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.870
 for a given cultural context 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.399
 an absolute truth when withdrawn from 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.039
 their context can become a great 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.379
 lie or examples know that talk 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.780
 that the Lord our God is going to 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.610
 put with head and not with syrup 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.050
 passage is a specific promise the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.760
 israel people when doing the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.280
 pilgrimage from egypt to earth 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.100
 Israel is the people of God a 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.470
 a chosen nation among all nations 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.479
 God's covenant with this people is soup 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.070
 of what Christ would bring to the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.080
 the whole of humanity through its 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.140
 sacrifice in the same way as 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.189
 we are not hit by the curses 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.110
 of law 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.750
 we can not bring our own 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 reality the blessings that were only 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.670
 shoulder of what would be the manifestation 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.890
 of grace through Christ Jesus and all 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 was taken literally without chain 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.119
 nothing in what will happen but we will 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.920
 having to stone adult women will 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.200
 have to kill homosexuals and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.119
 obviously this has nothing to do with 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 overview of the gospel 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.229
 curse can hit the Christian's life 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.909
 and a sense of being blessed is very 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.770
 broader than many people have said 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.570
 we can suffer persecution we 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.860
 We can be tortured until we can 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.899
 to be one of the dead 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.610
 yet no curse is upon 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.649
 our life dying for the gospel is a 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.360
 privilege takes a peek into the lives of 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.399
 first century Christians of the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.590
 look at the life of the apostles all 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.079
 they finished the second concept this world 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.329
 very bad but according to the concept of God 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.369
 were blessed men another passage 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.000
 very excited damn trusting man 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.710
 in the young man wes 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.170
 this passage is not speaking of a 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.030
 person trusts another person but she 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.550
 is talking about a person relying on 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.060
 strength of your arm or trust you 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.490
 same 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.370
 The curse lies in thinking we are 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.200
 self-sufficiency we can achieve 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.910
 self-help salvation 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.490
 The truth is that we all need 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.190
 desperately of God and his grace 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.630
 alone can not do nothing 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.520
 also everything that you call in the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.260
 earth will be bound in heaven and all that 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.430
 disconnect on the ground will also be 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.050
 off in the sky 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.630
 in this passage of Jesus is speaking with 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.040
 Pedro about the nature of his church and 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.260
 he made it very clear that the church 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.959
 has a key that is the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.510
 responsibility to signal the kingdom of 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.670
 God hampering the passage 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.100
 of people but it is worth remembering that 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.770
 the key is more important than the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.230
 that the door and with stewards of grace 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.690
 Of Christ We Will Accounts To God 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.700
 every time we turn off something that 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.750
 should be connected to the church does not have the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.239
 power 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.560
 the church has another responsibility 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.540
 passage is between the favorites 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.340
 of those who are looking for the word 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.720
 things that come to satisfy the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.040
 your own interests 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.860
 I can do all things through him who gives me strength. 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.299
 It is very easy to do well when 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.040
 accounts are in good standing when 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.290
 lacking food when we are 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.390
 but thriving when the cow goes to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.610
 the swamp no one wants to quote this passage 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.590
 if you are the 12th verse that 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.600
 immediately preceding that you go 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.090
 realize that he is speaking exactly 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.450
 of bad things and not just things 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.090
 Good is talking about sadness about hunger. 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.430
 about not having many things 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.470
 psalm 23 also completes the idea of this 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.299
 felipe's text made you are my 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.799
 pastor and nothing will I lack 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.200
 observe the two truths that are 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.170
 Implicit in this statement is the first of 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.660
 that we recognize that you are the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.910
 our pastor ie have full control 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.220
 about our life he knows what is good 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.650
 for us more than ourselves 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.510
 the second truth is that nothing will be lacking 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.730
 that is, if the pastor thinks 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.920
 certain thing is good for our life 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.140
 no matter our will for it 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.700
 Jesus gives so many promises to those 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.830
 What do your disciples want? 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.260
 it is very clear that will not miss the 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.789
 persecution that will not lack fights that 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.860
 there will be no lack of death 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.169
 the will of the one shepherd to our 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.090
 life is that none of the things faupe 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.410
 those that are necessary for the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.810
 people achieve salvation 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.450
 it also has that letter kills but 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.789
 spirit checks and paulo is not 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.500
 referring in no way to the concept 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.450
 that we have of the Bible today even because 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.330
 life had not even been compiled into that 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.390
 time he is defending the idea that 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.360
 the interpretation of the law without revelation 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.890
 of the spirit brings only death and has 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.020
 also the one who believes in the Lord Jesus 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.430
 I'll jump home 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.990
 this text is by no means a 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.030
 promise for the life of all 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.220
 Christians, but it is something specific to 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.289
 The life of a Christ man can save 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.479
 all your family all your light house 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.150
 but individual salvation is not 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.760
 some commitment of God to their 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.479
 when a person has or has 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.460
 salvation 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.979
 even because Jesus said that on that day 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.080
 there will be 12 in a bed in will be taken and 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.060
 where he was left when this is taught 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.820
 in a wrong way what happens 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.680
 to create an expectation that the whole 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.110
 Your family will congregate in a church. 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.289
 there lives the guy's father is in crisis 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.729
 because god failed in his promises 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.820
 perceived subtleties of the problem 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.380
 and that 4d did not want at the height of the Lord and 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.900
 speak the phrase for the first time is 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.780
 davi and he is referring to the health that 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.789
 had been anointed by King 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.130
 However, this sense of a 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.870
 Sir, it's no good for the new 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.240
 testament because the holy spirit does not 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.500
 is restricted but only the life of 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.289
 certain people 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.919
 In fact Christ means exactly the 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:02.050
 anointed or is close to Christ all of us 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.870
 We're just brothers and we're all brothers. 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.450
 only ordinary people recognize that 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.849
 Jesus is the Christ is to recognize that he is 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.800
 a spin and not enough all the 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.599
 references that are out of context 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.180
 also have those verses that neither in the 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.289
 The Bible is a thousand will pass the 2000 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.849
 reach 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.849
 tell me who you walk with and I'll tell you 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.949
 Who are you ignorant of? 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.020
 inherit the kingdom of heaven that guy 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.669
 This bullshit is not in the bible and has 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.889
 many people letting themselves be carried away by this 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.229
 mistaken teaching increasingly makes it 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.300
 The teaching of Jesus who says 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.169
 that we will know the truth the truth in 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.879
 will release 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.309
 It is always good to remember that Christ came 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:39.509
 to take away our sin and not our 

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:40.919
 intelligence 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.629
 I thank all those who have 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.939
