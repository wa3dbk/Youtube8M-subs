00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
which I haven't really had a chance to

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.640 
which I haven't really had a chance to
do<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.519> all<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.720> first<00:00:30.960> thing<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.560> you

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
others above mortality as soon as he has

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.789 
others above mortality as soon as he has
that<00:01:51.270> buff<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.110> ahead<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.470> tame<00:01:52.649> him

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.830 
that buff you just go ahead and tame him
and<00:01:53.340> he's<00:01:53.460> doing<00:01:53.640> very<00:01:53.759> very<00:01:54.090> minimal<00:01:54.630> damage

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and he's doing very very minimal damage

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.539 
and he's doing very very minimal damage
and<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.470> level<00:01:55.649> 90<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> would<00:01:56.310> say<00:01:56.490> you
