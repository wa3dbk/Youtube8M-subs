00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 i 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.270
 and subscribe to be subscribe is 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.500
 good the mushrooms in the following video 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.500
 but not much 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.930
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.350
 old civilians I occupy 7 you can 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.809
 occupy those who want ribbon 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.520
 silicone gun decals sheets 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.560
 colors 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.560
 and little things to decorate ok 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.710
 let's start with a series of two 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.310
 dimples two perforations to the iris 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.610
 It can be with a hot dog for 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.409
 they have this useful and we are going to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.479
 have them with a bit of wire to 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.909
 that they turn and there is something left 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.430
 so the wire should be a bit big 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.230
 so that when it comes to decorating the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.350
 everyone does not get stuck 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.090
 then in a piece of foami in a 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.190
 com sheet and we will draw the silhouette 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.160
 of mickey mouse we can use the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.730
 we can do forgiveness with the citi and a 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.980
 glass to make the ears ok let's go to 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.280

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.830
 look something like this since we have this 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.010
 let's take a red sheet and let's 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.710
 trace a red circle like this 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.710
 fold in half and we will provide it 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.299
 when we have this then we are going to have 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.299
 more or less two bits in order 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.469
 What we are going to do now is paste it in 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.899
 the bottom of our circle is 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.019

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.230
 we are going to hit like this we are going to do the same 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.910
 with the other piece that we have and we will 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.310
 stay like this 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.770

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.580
 pieces in civilians that will be in the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.620
 part of the front in the back 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.910
 we will have something like that 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.770
 It is already beginning to look very nice 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.480
