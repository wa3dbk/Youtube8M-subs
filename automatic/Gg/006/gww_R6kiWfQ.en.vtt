00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.990 
inner frame of the master grade aged one
normal<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:13.190> hopefully<00:04:13.489> you<00:04:13.549> can<00:04:13.640> tell<00:04:13.879> that

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
normal and hopefully you can tell that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.190 
normal and hopefully you can tell that
I'm<00:04:14.120> using<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.390> different<00:04:14.540> camera<00:04:14.810> from<00:04:15.170> the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
I'm using a different camera from the

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.259 
I'm using a different camera from the
first<00:04:15.530> part<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.890> video<00:04:16.130> hopefully<00:04:17.000> it

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
first part of the video hopefully it

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.879 
first part of the video hopefully it
will<00:04:17.570> be<00:04:17.720> a<00:04:17.750> vast<00:04:18.019> improvement<00:04:18.169> over<00:04:18.739> the

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
will be a vast improvement over the

as<00:04:20.810> far<00:04:21.109> as<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.560> zoom<00:04:21.889> and<00:04:22.160> focus<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.970> stuff

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
as far as the zoom and focus and stuff

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.450 
as far as the zoom and focus and stuff
goes<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:23.570> we'll<00:04:23.690> see<00:04:23.840> how<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:23.960> works<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:25.190> anyway

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
goes so we'll see how it works so anyway

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.040 
goes so we'll see how it works so anyway
what<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.120> inner<00:04:26.240> frame<00:04:26.389> is<00:04:26.600> pretty<00:04:26.810> complete

are on separate pieces that's to allow
for<00:05:10.639> I<00:05:10.669> guess<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.240> other<00:05:11.530> versions<00:05:12.530> of<00:05:12.680> the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
for I guess the other versions of the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
separate on the front and deck and it

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.350 
separate on the front and deck and it
doesn't<00:05:18.710> seem<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.949> add<00:05:19.070> any<00:05:19.340> stability<00:05:20.060> issues

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
doesn't seem to add any stability issues

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.060 
doesn't seem to add any stability issues
it<00:05:20.930> holds<00:05:21.199> together<00:05:21.320> pretty<00:05:21.620> well<00:05:21.740> when

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
it holds together pretty well when

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.920 
it holds together pretty well when
everything<00:05:22.160> is<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.520> place<00:05:22.760> and<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.660> voice<00:05:23.780> is

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
everything is in place and the voice is

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.810 
everything is in place and the voice is
pretty<00:05:24.050> unique<00:05:24.260> all<00:05:24.470> around<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:25.430> way<00:05:25.610> they

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
pretty unique all around the way they

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.909 
pretty unique all around the way they
are<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.300> way<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:26.690> side<00:05:27.020> skirts<00:05:27.349> attached<00:05:27.650> to

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
are the way the side skirts attached to

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.760 
are the way the side skirts attached to
the<00:05:28.039> the<00:05:28.370> waist<00:05:28.550> is<00:05:28.789> pretty<00:05:29.030> cool

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
the the waist is pretty cool

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.110 
the the waist is pretty cool
this<00:05:30.770> whole<00:05:30.979> this<00:05:31.490> whole<00:05:31.550> separate<00:05:31.940> piece

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
this whole this whole separate piece

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.320 
this whole this whole separate piece
here<00:05:32.330> are<00:05:32.870> for<00:05:33.260> the<00:05:33.440> white<00:05:33.650> pieces<00:05:34.070> and<00:05:34.330> then

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
here are for the white pieces and then

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.450 
here are for the white pieces and then
the<00:05:35.419> yellow<00:05:35.690> sticks<00:05:35.990> on<00:05:36.199> here<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.889> the<00:05:36.919> actual

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
the yellow sticks on here to the actual

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.719 
the yellow sticks on here to the actual
torso<00:05:38.030> itself<00:05:38.919> and<00:05:39.919> for<00:05:40.849> the<00:05:40.880> hips<00:05:41.349> there's<00:05:42.349> a

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
torso itself and for the hips there's a

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.300 
torso itself and for the hips there's a
moving<00:05:43.960> hip<00:05:44.960> joint<00:05:45.260> there<00:05:45.500> that<00:05:45.710> allows<00:05:45.919> for

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
moving hip joint there that allows for

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.550 
moving hip joint there that allows for
different<00:05:46.639> levels<00:05:47.020> so<00:05:48.020> if<00:05:48.110> you<00:05:48.229> want<00:05:48.380> to<00:05:48.440> have

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
different levels so if you want to have

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.379 
different levels so if you want to have
one<00:05:48.770> higher<00:05:48.949> than<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.159> other<00:05:49.250> one<00:05:50.000> leg<00:05:50.180> higher

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
one higher than the other one leg higher

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:51.839 
one higher than the other one leg higher
than<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:50.599> other<00:05:50.690> you<00:05:50.870> can<00:05:50.990> do<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.229> by

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
than the other you can do that by

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.550 
than the other you can do that by
rotating<00:05:52.849> that<00:05:53.030> piece<00:05:53.240> so<00:05:53.570> each<00:05:53.780> hip<00:05:54.020> gets<00:05:54.260> one

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
rotating that piece so each hip gets one

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.820 
rotating that piece so each hip gets one
of<00:05:54.650> these<00:05:54.710> joints<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:57.169> cockpits<00:05:57.590> pretty

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
of these joints the cockpits pretty

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.980 
of these joints the cockpits pretty
unique<00:05:58.039> you<00:05:58.490> can<00:05:58.639> pull<00:05:59.000> it<00:05:59.060> down<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.479> then

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
unique you can pull it down and then

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.689 
unique you can pull it down and then
pull<00:06:00.260> it<00:06:00.349> out<00:06:00.440> reminds<00:06:01.220> me<00:06:01.370> a<00:06:01.430> lot<00:06:01.520> of<00:06:01.580> the

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
pull it out reminds me a lot of the

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.209 
pull it out reminds me a lot of the
master<00:06:02.030> grade<00:06:02.270> turn<00:06:03.169> a<00:06:03.289> Gundam<00:06:03.650> with<00:06:04.099> the
