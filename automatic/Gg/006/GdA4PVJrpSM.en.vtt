figures and I decided to pick this one
up<00:00:19.859> at<00:00:20.100> Toys<00:00:20.550> R<00:00:20.730> Us<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.630> cost<00:00:21.900> about<00:00:22.080> twenty

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.980 
up at Toys R Us it cost about twenty
dollars<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.369> figure<00:00:23.760> looks<00:00:24.060> awesome

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
dollars but this figure looks awesome

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
dollars but this figure looks awesome
and<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.560> says<00:00:25.800> right<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> box<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and it says right here on the box I

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.970 
and it says right here on the box I
probably<00:00:27.480> can't<00:00:27.810> read<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> video

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
probably can't read it on on the video

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.540 
probably can't read it on on the video
but<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.550> says<00:00:29.789> 34<00:00:30.480> points<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.990> articulation

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
but it says 34 points of articulation

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.010 
but it says 34 points of articulation
which<00:00:32.550> sounds<00:00:33.059> amazing

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
which sounds amazing

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.850

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
articulation on this figure I mean just

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
articulation on this figure I mean just
starting<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.060> feet<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.170> see

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
starting with the feet there you can see

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.160 
starting with the feet there you can see
the<00:01:10.950> toes<00:01:11.220> move<00:01:11.990> individually<00:01:12.990> each

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the toes move individually each

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.700 
the toes move individually each
individual<00:01:14.100> toe<00:01:14.340> moves<00:01:14.729> by<00:01:15.090> itself

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
individual toe moves by itself

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.090 
individual toe moves by itself
like<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.090> very<00:01:18.659> cool<00:01:19.020> you've<00:01:19.920> also

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
like that which is very cool you've also

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.850 
like that which is very cool you've also
got<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.939> articulation<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.170> which

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
got the articulation right here which

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.510 
got the articulation right here which
also<00:01:23.159> joint<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> knee<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.520> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880 
also joint and the knee there and you
see<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.880> line<00:01:27.270> right<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> leg<00:01:28.590> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
see this line right here on the leg that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.999 
see this line right here on the leg that
is<00:01:29.070> also<00:01:29.520> another<00:01:30.150> joint<00:01:30.650> it's<00:01:31.650> kind<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.890> have

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
is also another joint it's kind of have

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.170 
is also another joint it's kind of have
to<00:01:32.159> hold<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.320> pull<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
to hold it so you can pull up like that

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
to hold it so you can pull up like that
but<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.360> very<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:37.020> cool<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.409> mean<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.829> look

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
but it's very very cool I mean just look

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560 
but it's very very cool I mean just look
at<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.220> their<00:01:38.400> articulation<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
at all their articulation just in the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.310 
at all their articulation just in the
legs<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.520> then<00:01:41.520> we've<00:01:41.759> got<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.630> body<00:01:42.869> here

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
legs and then we've got the body here

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.560 
legs and then we've got the body here
which<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> actually<00:01:43.890> two<00:01:44.340> separate<00:01:44.729> pieces<00:01:44.909> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
which is actually two separate pieces so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
which is actually two separate pieces so
that<00:01:45.600> he<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.049> move<00:01:46.200> around<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:47.790> part

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that he can move around the top part

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.990 
that he can move around the top part
moves<00:01:48.270> separately<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.790> there's<00:01:50.790> his

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
moves separately and there's his

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.660 
moves separately and there's his
nunchucks<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> back<00:01:52.280> now<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
nunchucks on the back now that's the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.780 
nunchucks on the back now that's the
only<00:01:53.790> thing<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.750> will<00:01:55.110> say<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.790> negative

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
only thing that I will say is negative

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
only thing that I will say is negative
about<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.180> figure<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.960> doesn't<00:01:58.439> hold<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
about this figure it doesn't hold the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.969 
about this figure it doesn't hold the
nunchucks<00:01:59.460> very<00:01:59.759> well<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.930> they<00:02:01.409> still<00:02:01.710> seem

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
nunchucks very well they they still seem

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.530 
nunchucks very well they they still seem
to<00:02:02.009> kind<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.430> fall<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.939> his<00:02:03.030> hands<00:02:03.270> which

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
to kind of fall out of his hands which

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.789 
to kind of fall out of his hands which
is<00:02:03.689> why<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> went<00:02:04.049> ahead<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.409> set<00:02:04.560> him<00:02:04.649> back

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
is why I went ahead and set him back

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.150 
here but he does have really good

individual fingers move the joints are a
little<00:02:16.240> stiff<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:16.840> they<00:02:16.930> don't<00:02:17.110> move<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.530> whole

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710
