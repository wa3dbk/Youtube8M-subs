00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.830
 good evening in this video tutorial we will talk about the nations of the martyrs als 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.040
 i'm 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.610
 in blender we know everything and noble soul 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.369
 wells exist hippo curves for just about anything 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.869
 TV set up is no exception so let's see how 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.659
 selected an object we create for the same a branch of bassano if not 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:21.739
 it already exists 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.849
 at bottom 1 we leave the default values ​​for the flow color e 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.439
 the intensity of the same 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.160
 we click with the right mouse button 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.740
 sure tango lo with widespread heart 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.499
 from the menu that appears at the crossroads 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:36.140
 we select the first time 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.270
 ie insert key frames 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.880
 in this way we are recording the flow color 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.080
 as in the values ​​of the rgb components of the same 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.040
 as we'll see 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.770
 for frames 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.890
 now let's move over 250 for example 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.860
 change the intensity value 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.220
 shaded hours of melt 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.740
 portanova for example 1 but we don't insert who takes for this element 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.680
 I will tell you soon for you 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.670
 always extreme 150 we want the flow color hey we repeat the operation of 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.240
 multiframe entry 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.010
 by clicking the right mouse button 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.830
 sure tango the ok of the color and selecting inserts who france 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.560
 we have realized interpolation 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.530
 animation of the spindle color of the material and sending it into execution 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.299
 the preview of the animation we will actually see is an object change 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.320
 color 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.390
 not all animations can be displayed during preview 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.170
 for example it is not possible to observe any variations in color 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.560
 mirror the object in this preview 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 but they are in the process of rendering their own 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.119
 whenever we insert a who presses for an item of the material panel 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.270
 we insert it only for that item 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.720
 not for all the settings of the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 to confirm this 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130
 let's look at the various moments of the animation 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.060
 the intensity value refers to a widespread seller 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.700
 we changed it 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.330
 and we set a take for the color 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.660
 but not for this field so since there were no other this thread 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.420
 for this field blender will use the last value set manually 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.589
 in this case 1 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:14.489
 with the color that is a gentle interpolation in the sense that one passes 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.120
 gradually from a set of rgb colors to a car 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.899
 during the animation 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.969
 but for other voices it is not so 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.299
 for example we can set funky frames for the type of an eater of 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.019
 fonso 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.019
 move to another frame change the type of shaded hours set a ti 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.719
 frames for this field 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.089
 but in this case the passage will be snapshots 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.340
 if you cannot gradually switch between two different types of shading 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.950
 you can only have 1 follow-through in a given live time 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.230
 this is generally true 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.469
 for the selected items of your combo 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.599
 just like the type of shaded king 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.380
 opel wasyjet box 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.729
 there is the castle to select home 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.470
 while when dealing with numerical values 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.419
 then you can make a smooth transition 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:06.689
 let's take a look at the graphic of the pure of the grandchildren of the material to see 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.999
 what can you do d 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.030
 in previous versions of blender, come to the hip hop window 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.030
 now instead we have to change an infographic window 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.229
 Once the graphic window has been opened we should be able to find a menu 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.409
 raise for the object since we have already inserted kisses - for the materials 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.970
 to the right 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.439
 in the graph containing time blender values 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.930
 they should be present 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.529
 for the same reason as e. info 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.749
 let us expand hymen to the left by clicking with the left mouse button on the 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:38.299
 arrow next to the mazingaz label 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.789
 and we also express the matirial menu 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.909
 at this point we will have a list of the fields for which there are info 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.489
 that is in our case the values ​​of the rgb channels 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.759
 Wednesday 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.839
 and the widespread field shellello montello 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.560
 we can select an info curve in this minimum 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.900
 peppa change it manually in the right part of the window 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.669
 or we can make it invisible to simplify the graph 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.610
 in the presence of more cube info, it could become too much for other channels 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.049
 crowded 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.269
 selected a curve on the right side we could then select the points of 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.019
 control 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.949
 by clicking on them with the right mouse button 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.739
 such individual points night iframe and curve 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.630
 and we could for example move them 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.160
 I am not giving values ​​but also over time, thus changing the animation of 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.610
 that curve 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.069
 we can then move rotate and scale the control points 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.309
 selecting the right mouse button 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:37.249
 or by pressing visa and defining a selection area with the mouse 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:38.789
 or still awful a 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.139
 select them and select them all 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.040
 then pressing g 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.820
 r and they to perform tessellation rotations tester 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.169
 the rotation of the brakes assent to modify the curvature of the 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.300
 interpolation 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.000
 which then translates into more or less rapid changes in the value controlled by the 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.639
 curve 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.940
 let's remember that this is a graph where the x-axis is time 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.850
 the x young axis is the value 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.670
 so the shape of the curve indicates how the value will change over time 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.979
 resizing a control point means scaling its length 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:11.630
 handles 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.389
 and this operation also affects the body 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.939
 sund trend of the info curve 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.600
 and then you can do other operations on the hip hop forms 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.949
 manipulating the vertices 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:22.910
 extending of 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.319
 changing the type of hand control 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.770
 brand and so on 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.680
 but that of the manipulation of hip hop tips is precisely the subject 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.980
 different that should be treated as porter 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.009
 we can't talk about it here 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.559
 as a last observation we verify what was said before by examining the 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.170
 polverini po the diffuser shed modena 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.740
 that is the type of shaded hours of melt 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.990
 it is a bit of typhoid threshold the value changes abruptly 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.130
 control points cannot be rotated 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.730
 there are no handles 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.180
 therefore it is not possible even scalar iframe and translation operations 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.349
 embedding 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.490
 it is free along the time axis 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.979
 while proceeding vertically 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.610
 but this type of curve should never be vertically moved 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.990
 because this could lead to incredible results 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.770
 the manipulation of the kind curve of the albino genus and therefore you find line with 

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:14.450
 what was said above 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.460
 on the animation of these slightly more particular elements 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.009
 for this video it's all as you always find this and other video tutorial
