those<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:01.020> work<00:02:01.049> great<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.710> sometimes

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
those can work great but sometimes

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
those can work great but sometimes

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
to point out some of the features how

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.280 
to point out some of the features how
this<00:02:45.870> works

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
this works

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.930 
this works
um<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> first<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.430> use<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.760> on

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
um the first is that you can use this on

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.180 
um the first is that you can use this on
either<00:02:48.269> ear<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.590> see<00:02:49.859> how<00:02:50.129> the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
either ear and you can see how the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.309 
either ear and you can see how the
swivels<00:02:50.760> back<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.209> forth<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.200> what

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
swivels back and forth and this is what

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.110 
swivels back and forth and this is what
allows<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.739> get<00:02:52.829> such<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> nice<00:02:53.370> fit<00:02:53.940> is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
allows you to get such a nice fit is

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.449 
allows you to get such a nice fit is
that<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.810> can<00:02:55.049> just<00:02:55.440> swivel<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.980> however<00:02:56.310> you

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
that you can just swivel it however you

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.890 
that you can just swivel it however you
need<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.120> make<00:02:57.299> sure<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.540> sits<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.870> your

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900

ear just right you also get the three of
these<00:03:01.319> ear<00:03:01.650> gels<00:03:01.890> here<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.909> is<00:03:03.090> one<00:03:03.299> and

volume up and down this is also used to

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.069 
volume up and down this is also used to
advance<00:03:23.549> tracts<00:03:24.000> forward<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.599> backward<00:03:24.959> if

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
advance tracts forward and backward if

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.289 
advance tracts forward and backward if
you're<00:03:25.200> listening<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.769> music<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:27.030> see

you're listening to music you can see

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.940 
you're listening to music you can see
this<00:03:27.450> little<00:03:27.750> flashing<00:03:28.260> light<00:03:28.650> here

this little flashing light here

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.009 
this little flashing light here
occasionally<00:03:29.250> that's<00:03:29.760> what<00:03:30.000> lets<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.840> know

occasionally that's what lets you know

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.009 
occasionally that's what lets you know
it's<00:03:31.230> on<00:03:31.470> also<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:33.090> you're<00:03:33.299> turning<00:03:33.629> it<00:03:33.870> off

all-purpose button all of these are

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.650 
all-purpose button all of these are
really<00:03:58.799> easy<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.370> use<00:03:59.579> and<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.359> found<00:04:00.569> they

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
really easy to use and I found they

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.330 
really easy to use and I found they
worked<00:04:00.840> great<00:04:01.139> also<00:04:01.349> there's<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.859> enough<00:04:02.220> of

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
worked great also there's just enough of

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.580 
worked great also there's just enough of
a<00:04:02.459> tactile<00:04:03.030> feel<00:04:03.449> so<00:04:04.139> that<00:04:04.349> you're<00:04:04.470> not

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
a tactile feel so that you're not

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.289 
a tactile feel so that you're not
guessing<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.519> know<00:04:05.639> if<00:04:05.730> you're<00:04:05.849> pressing<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
guessing you know if you're pressing the

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.150 
guessing you know if you're pressing the
right<00:04:06.480> button<00:04:06.870> or<00:04:07.019> not<00:04:07.169> or<00:04:07.410> trying<00:04:07.949> to<00:04:08.010> even

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
right button or not or trying to even

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.789 
right button or not or trying to even
find<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.579> button<00:04:08.849> they're<00:04:09.720> all<00:04:09.840> located<00:04:10.410> very

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
find the button they're all located very

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.520 
find the button they're all located very
intuitively<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:12.359> makes<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.900> really<00:04:13.410> easy

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
intuitively and it makes it really easy

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.589 
intuitively and it makes it really easy
to<00:04:13.889> use<00:04:14.160> on<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.760> back<00:04:14.910> here<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.299> is<00:04:15.480> where

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
to use on the back here this is where

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.629 
to use on the back here this is where
you<00:04:15.690> can<00:04:15.840> see<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.169> input<00:04:16.859> for<00:04:17.070> charging<00:04:17.609> the

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
you can see the input for charging the

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.210 
you can see the input for charging the
device<00:04:18.180> with<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.630> micro<00:04:18.930> USB<00:04:19.099> charger<00:04:20.099> and

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
device with the micro USB charger and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.969 
device with the micro USB charger and
the<00:04:20.729> full<00:04:20.910> charge<00:04:21.090> takes<00:04:21.180> 2<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.659> 3<00:04:21.989> hours<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.590> I

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
the full charge takes 2 to 3 hours and I

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.100 
the full charge takes 2 to 3 hours and I
found<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.400> be<00:04:23.430> fairly<00:04:23.760> accurate

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
found that to be fairly accurate

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.770 
found that to be fairly accurate
regarding<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.200> battery<00:04:25.620> life<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:26.010> get<00:04:26.250> about

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
regarding the battery life you get about

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.450 
regarding the battery life you get about
hours<00:04:27.080> of<00:04:27.110> talk<00:04:27.470> time<00:04:27.500> are<00:04:27.920> listening<00:04:28.250> to

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
hours of talk time are listening to

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.790 
hours of talk time are listening to
music<00:04:28.670> and<00:04:29.090> then<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.139> get<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.290> hundred<00:04:30.650> and

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
music and then you get a hundred and

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.950 
music and then you get a hundred and
fifty<00:04:31.130> hours<00:04:31.430> of<00:04:31.550> standby<00:04:31.940> time<00:04:32.030> so<00:04:32.840> you

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
fifty hours of standby time so you

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.500 
fifty hours of standby time so you
really<00:04:33.230> can<00:04:33.500> use<00:04:33.530> these<00:04:34.010> all<00:04:34.250> day<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:35.330> found

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
really can use these all day and I found

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.420 
really can use these all day and I found
that<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.720> be<00:04:35.900> very<00:04:36.320> accurate

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
that to be very accurate

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.280 
that to be very accurate
now<00:04:37.610> once<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.120> battery<00:04:38.480> starts<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.900> get<00:04:39.050> too

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
now once the battery starts to get too

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.710 
now once the battery starts to get too
low<00:04:39.530> you'll<00:04:40.010> hear<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> tone<00:04:40.610> once<00:04:41.180> every<00:04:41.510> minute

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
low you'll hear a tone once every minute

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.570 
low you'll hear a tone once every minute
and<00:04:41.990> that's<00:04:42.590> letting<00:04:42.889> you<00:04:43.040> know<00:04:43.190> it's<00:04:43.340> time<00:04:43.550> to

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
and that's letting you know it's time to

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.730 
and that's letting you know it's time to
charge<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.210> battery<00:04:44.510> so<00:04:44.960> it's<00:04:45.350> kind<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.620> nice

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
charge the battery so it's kind of nice

any drops or anything like that one

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.960 
any drops or anything like that one
thing<00:06:29.990> to<00:06:30.080> be<00:06:30.200> aware<00:06:30.440> of<00:06:30.500> though<00:06:30.800> is<00:06:30.979> when<00:06:31.850> your

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
thing to be aware of though is when your

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.240 
thing to be aware of though is when your
battery<00:06:32.330> starts<00:06:32.600> to<00:06:32.750> get<00:06:32.930> low<00:06:33.169> you<00:06:33.470> will<00:06:34.039> get<00:06:34.220> a

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
battery starts to get low you will get a

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.279 
battery starts to get low you will get a
tone<00:06:34.490> every<00:06:34.820> minute<00:06:35.150> starting<00:06:35.810> to<00:06:35.900> beep<00:06:36.110> and

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
tone every minute starting to beep and

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.779 
tone every minute starting to beep and
then<00:06:36.440> and<00:06:36.590> you<00:06:36.650> know<00:06:36.680> it's<00:06:36.979> definitely<00:06:37.190> time

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
then and you know it's definitely time

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:40.360 
then and you know it's definitely time
to<00:06:37.820> change<00:06:38.060> the<00:06:38.240> battery<00:06:38.599> if<00:06:39.500> at<00:06:39.770> that<00:06:39.800> time<00:06:40.190> or

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
to change the battery if at that time or

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.600 
to change the battery if at that time or
right

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
right

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.369 
right
before<00:06:40.909> you<00:06:41.090> noticed<00:06:41.479> you<00:06:41.629> are<00:06:41.900> starting<00:06:42.259> to

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:42.379 
before you noticed you are starting to

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.080 
before you noticed you are starting to
get<00:06:42.469> some<00:06:42.740> some<00:06:43.069> drops<00:06:43.340> or<00:06:43.550> disconnects

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
get some some drops or disconnects

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.119 
get some some drops or disconnects
that's<00:06:44.659> probably<00:06:45.110> an<00:06:45.199> indication<00:06:45.620> again<00:06:46.039> that

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:46.129 
that's probably an indication again that

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:47.800 
that's probably an indication again that
the<00:06:46.250> battery<00:06:46.610> just<00:06:46.639> needs<00:06:47.000> to<00:06:47.120> be<00:06:47.240> charged<00:06:47.599> up

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
the battery just needs to be charged up

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.350 
the battery just needs to be charged up
so<00:06:48.319> bottom<00:06:48.680> line<00:06:48.889> this<00:06:49.280> is<00:06:49.340> a<00:06:49.490> really<00:06:50.090> great

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
so bottom line this is a really great

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.450
