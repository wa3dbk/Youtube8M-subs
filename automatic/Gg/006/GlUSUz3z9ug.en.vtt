00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
little Ridge that it goes into over here

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.020 
little Ridge that it goes into over here
as<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.709> see<00:02:28.859> you<00:02:29.310> see<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.609> lower<00:02:29.790> Ridge

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
as you can see you see that lower Ridge

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.550 
as you can see you see that lower Ridge
it<00:02:30.269> goes<00:02:30.420> into<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> thing<00:02:31.019> over<00:02:31.170> your<00:02:31.319> on<00:02:31.470> with

bit of sandpaper now if Evan you switch

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.090 
bit of sandpaper now if Evan you switch
obviously<00:05:44.900> putting<00:05:45.140> your<00:05:45.350> switch<00:05:45.590> in<00:05:45.800> can

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
obviously putting your switch in can

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.160 
obviously putting your switch in can
have<00:05:46.250> good<00:05:46.460> terminals<00:05:46.970> nice<00:05:47.630> which<00:05:47.840> is<00:05:47.960> good

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170
