little bit so now just bear and looks
cooler<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.630> anyway<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.289> what<00:00:25.890> we're<00:00:26.039> going

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
cooler but anyway and what we're going

cooler but anyway and what we're going
to<00:00:26.220> be<00:00:26.250> building<00:00:26.640> today<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.640> better

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
to be building today is like a better

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.600 
to be building today is like a better
version<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.380> like<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> ladder<00:00:32.160> it's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
version of like it's like a ladder it's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.260 
version of like it's like a ladder it's
a<00:00:32.730> water<00:00:33.030> water<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.989> will<00:00:34.200> look<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:35.270> so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
a water water and will look like this so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.340 
a water water and will look like this so
if<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> ladder<00:00:37.730> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> slow<00:00:39.350> takes

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
if we go up a ladder kind of slow takes

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.950 
if we go up a ladder kind of slow takes
a<00:00:40.469> while<00:00:41.329> if<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> war<00:00:43.050> lotta<00:00:44.960> really

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
a while if we go up a war lotta really

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.220 
a while if we go up a war lotta really
fast<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.559> basically<00:00:50.899> i'm<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
fast like that so basically i'm going to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.740 
fast like that so basically i'm going to
show<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.350> how<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> build<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.629> start<00:00:54.629> off

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
show you how to build this and start off

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.560 
show you how to build this and start off
with<00:00:54.989> overnight<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.550> bucket<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.940> war<00:00:57.180> really

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
with overnight is a bucket of war really

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.139 
with overnight is a bucket of war really
won<00:00:57.690> bucket<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.680> war<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.609> could<00:00:59.730> use<00:00:59.910> more

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
won bucket of war and you could use more

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.959 
won bucket of war and you could use more
i<00:01:00.420> guess<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
i guess but and we're just going to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
i guess but and we're just going to
build<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> over<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.850> first<00:01:06.119> thing

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
build it over here the first thing

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.920 
build it over here the first thing
you're<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> need<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.840> note<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:08.930> for

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you're going to need to note is that for

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
you're going to need to note is that for
this<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.200> need<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> water<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.250> flowing<00:01:11.729> in

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
this you need to water to be flowing in

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.530 
this you need to water to be flowing in
the<00:01:12.180> north<00:01:12.420> direction<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.049> thing<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:15.299> Sun

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.960 
sets in the west I think I'm not really
sure<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.340> West<00:01:20.790> or<00:01:21.150> anything<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you're going to have to look 90 degrees

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.789 
you're going to have to look 90 degrees
to<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> right<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.710> the

to the right and that's what that's the
way<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> water<00:01:32.340> has<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.640> flowing<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.390> I

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
way the water has to be flowing so I

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.990 
way the water has to be flowing so I
want<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.920> dig<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.310> little<00:01:35.610> hole<00:01:35.759> down<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.789 

for<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.509> an<00:01:42.930> example<00:01:45.439> yeah<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.680> it's

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
going to look like this and I will need

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.639 
going to look like this and I will need
some<00:01:49.200> ladders<00:01:49.500> first<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> it's

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
some ladders first for this so it's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.069 
some ladders first for this so it's
gonna<00:01:55.829> look<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.670> now<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.750> we're

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
gonna look like that just now and we're

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.460 
gonna look like that just now and we're
going<00:01:58.229> to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.030 

go<00:02:03.470> up<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.890> second<00:02:04.369> top<00:02:04.520> thing<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.920> put<00:02:06.920> in

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
go up to the second top thing and put in

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.480 
go up to the second top thing and put in
a<00:02:07.070> ladder<00:02:07.340> right<00:02:07.520> next<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:09.490> picking

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
a ladder right next to it and picking

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.320 
a ladder right next to it and picking
pit<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:11.330> bucket<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.780> war<00:02:11.990> like<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:13.330> then

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
pit in one bucket of war like that then

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.820 
pit in one bucket of war like that then
you're<00:02:14.420> going<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.569> take<00:02:14.780> away<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.230> look<00:02:15.850> and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
you're going to take away that look and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.740 
you're going to take away that look and
degree<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:23.450> water<00:02:23.630> should

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
degree that and and the water should

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.070 
degree that and and the water should
come<00:02:23.930> out<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.200> put<00:02:24.319> on<00:02:24.440> another<00:02:24.830> ladder<00:02:25.100> and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
come out and put on another ladder and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.750 
come out and put on another ladder and
we<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.230> go<00:02:27.319> up<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.470> ladder<00:02:27.590> or<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.370> can<00:02:28.489> go<00:02:28.640> up

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
we can go up the ladder or we can go up

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.650 
we can go up the ladder or we can go up
the<00:02:28.970> war<00:02:29.319> as<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.440> can<00:02:30.530> see<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.480> do<00:02:32.540> this

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
the war as you can see you can do this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.610 
the war as you can see you can do this
is<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.900> really<00:02:33.410> deep<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.370> guess<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.470> keep

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
is a really deep I guess so just keep

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.110 
is a really deep I guess so just keep
doing<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.340> keep<00:02:40.459> repeating<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.970> process

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
doing to keep repeating the process

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.840 
doing to keep repeating the process
pretty<00:02:41.570> much<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:48.130> what<00:02:49.130> I'm<00:02:49.250> going<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.459> do<00:02:49.610> is

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
pretty much and what I'm going to do is

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.170 
pretty much and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.150> replace<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.989> ladders<00:02:51.940> with<00:02:52.940> a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
I'm going to replace the ladders with a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:01.690 
I'm going to replace the ladders with a
book<00:02:54.610> like<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:58.220> because<00:02:58.580> it's<00:02:58.760> a<00:03:00.700> just

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
book like that just because it's a just

book like that just because it's a just
bear<00:03:01.940> i<00:03:01.970> guess<00:03:02.300> looks<00:03:02.870> better<00:03:03.290> than<00:03:04.220> having

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
bear i guess looks better than having

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.280 
bear i guess looks better than having
like<00:03:04.790> random<00:03:05.090> ladders<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.930> can't<00:03:06.140> see

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
