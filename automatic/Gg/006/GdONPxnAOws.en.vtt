you soul put together despite the fact
that<00:05:17.760> I'm<00:05:17.940> not<00:05:18.150> much<00:05:18.390> of<00:05:18.420> a<00:05:18.750> grunt<00:05:19.080> builder<00:05:19.620> in

that I'm not much of a grunt builder in

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.650 
that I'm not much of a grunt builder in

the<00:05:21.750> Federation<00:05:22.410> but<00:05:22.980> this<00:05:23.130> guy<00:05:23.280> comes<00:05:23.520> across

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
the Federation but this guy comes across

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.520 
the Federation but this guy comes across
as<00:05:24.000> looking<00:05:24.300> pretty<00:05:24.540> sharp<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.020> a<00:05:25.110> big<00:05:25.320> reason

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
as looking pretty sharp and a big reason

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.930 
as looking pretty sharp and a big reason
for<00:05:25.740> that<00:05:25.920> is<00:05:26.220> that<00:05:26.340> he's<00:05:26.490> going<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.670> be<00:05:26.790> going

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
for that is that he's going to be going

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.230 
for that is that he's going to be going
back<00:05:27.210> to<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.570> classic<00:05:28.110> almost<00:05:28.950> gym<00:05:29.850> colors

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
back to the classic almost gym colors

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.150 
back to the classic almost gym colors
the<00:05:30.780> bright<00:05:30.960> bright<00:05:31.230> green<00:05:31.500> is<00:05:31.680> definitely

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
the bright bright green is definitely

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.650 
the bright bright green is definitely
going<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.340> make<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.580> NEEMO<00:05:32.850> stand<00:05:33.180> out<00:05:33.360> here

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
going to make the NEEMO stand out here

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.390 
going to make the NEEMO stand out here
and<00:05:33.780> if<00:05:34.230> you<00:05:34.320> don't<00:05:34.500> go<00:05:34.620> back<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.010> old<00:05:35.160> baby

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
and if you don't go back to the old baby

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.250 
and if you don't go back to the old baby
blue<00:05:35.670> green<00:05:35.940> that<00:05:36.090> we<00:05:36.180> saw<00:05:36.360> in<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.570> gyms<00:05:36.780> we've

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
blue green that we saw in the gyms we've

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.990 
blue green that we saw in the gyms we've
just<00:05:37.500> seen<00:05:37.650> so<00:05:37.920> many<00:05:38.040> different<00:05:38.370> ones<00:05:38.700> over

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
just seen so many different ones over

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.640 
just seen so many different ones over
the<00:05:39.090> years<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.360> double-o<00:05:39.660> 83<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.440> things

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
the years and double-o 83 and things

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.890 
the years and double-o 83 and things
like<00:05:40.830> that<00:05:40.890> with<00:05:41.610> actual<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.210> white<00:05:42.450> and<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.720> blue

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
like that with actual a white and a blue

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.390 
like that with actual a white and a blue
color<00:05:43.170> scheme<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.680> think<00:05:43.800> this<00:05:44.040> is<00:05:44.100> going<00:05:44.340> to

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
color scheme so I think this is going to

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.400 
color scheme so I think this is going to
be<00:05:44.520> fitting<00:05:44.880> in<00:05:45.000> quite<00:05:45.150> nicely<00:05:45.510> and<00:05:45.990> I

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
be fitting in quite nicely and I

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.170 
be fitting in quite nicely and I
wouldn't<00:05:46.680> necessarily<00:05:47.250> say<00:05:47.640> it's<00:05:47.850> gonna<00:05:47.970> be

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
wouldn't necessarily say it's gonna be

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.880 
wouldn't necessarily say it's gonna be
desert<00:05:48.570> fit<00:05:48.960> though<00:05:49.110> as<00:05:49.290> it<00:05:49.410> doesn't<00:05:49.680> quite

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
desert fit though as it doesn't quite

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.770 
desert fit though as it doesn't quite
scream<00:05:50.280> desert<00:05:50.670> Brown<00:05:50.880> there<00:05:51.150> but<00:05:51.660> it's

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
scream desert Brown there but it's

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.940 
scream desert Brown there but it's
definitely<00:05:51.930> going<00:05:52.200> to<00:05:52.260> be<00:05:52.320> more<00:05:52.590> along<00:05:52.800> the

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
definitely going to be more along the

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.530 
definitely going to be more along the
lines<00:05:53.130> of<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.400> easy<00:05:53.580> eight<00:05:53.910> in<00:05:54.120> terms<00:05:54.360> of

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
the way the gray is going to be

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.030 
the way the gray is going to be
providing<00:06:45.510> the<00:06:45.600> cheek<00:06:45.810> and<00:06:46.020> ears<00:06:46.530> there<00:06:46.830> as

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
providing the cheek and ears there as

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.770 
providing the cheek and ears there as
opposed<00:06:47.729> to<00:06:47.820> the<00:06:47.940> blue<00:06:48.150> not<00:06:48.419> that<00:06:48.540> it<00:06:48.630> looks

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
opposed to the blue not that it looks

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.810 
opposed to the blue not that it looks
bad<00:06:48.990> on<00:06:49.020> the<00:06:49.260> old<00:06:49.380> one<00:06:49.590> but<00:06:49.830> it's<00:06:49.950> neat<00:06:50.220> that

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
bad on the old one but it's neat that

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.860 
bad on the old one but it's neat that
they've<00:06:50.970> actually<00:06:51.210> got<00:06:51.540> the<00:06:51.660> color

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
they've actually got the color

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.010 
they've actually got the color
difference<00:06:52.260> reflected<00:06:52.830> here<00:06:53.990> overall<00:06:54.990> I

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
difference reflected here overall I

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.690 
difference reflected here overall I
think<00:06:55.200> then<00:06:55.470> I<00:06:55.500> get<00:06:55.770> a<00:06:55.800> lot<00:06:55.979> of<00:06:56.100> things<00:06:56.280> right

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
think then I get a lot of things right

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.430 
think then I get a lot of things right
with<00:06:56.940> this<00:06:57.180> the<00:06:57.450> white<00:06:57.690> color<00:06:57.930> scheme<00:06:58.110> is

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
with this the white color scheme is

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.719 
with this the white color scheme is
going<00:06:58.500> to<00:06:58.620> be<00:06:58.740> great<00:06:59.040> if<00:06:59.220> you<00:06:59.310> want<00:06:59.460> to<00:06:59.520> paint
