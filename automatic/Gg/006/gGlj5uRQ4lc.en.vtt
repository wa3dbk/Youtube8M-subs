00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.630
 hello everyone happy to see you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.550
 on paris turf tv for your daily 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.980
 received five out of five missions the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.660
 quinté plus and 5-5 to accompany me 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.170
 today a lot of pleasure from 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 to receive 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.449
 guillaume dalifard hello guillaume 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.289
 boehler philippe this wednesday direction 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.760
 St Malo because of a small month 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.980
 hesitation the hippodrome of saint-malo 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.019
 with the eighth step of the gnt a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 test for horses from 5 to 10 years on 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.090
 the 2850 meters before anything 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 guillaume the malouin plot a 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.410
 particularity it is a great track 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.850
 selective generally the good ones 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 horses finally manages to make the finish 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.950
 okay so logically the basics of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.570
 solid foundation from this 5 5 if 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.469
 there is no counter performance it must 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.120
 do one two three I will not go that far 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 let's be crazy let's be optimistic go 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.399
 let's be optimistic we were talking about 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.750
 bases 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.850
 I asked you to do a little 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.100
 recall your selection right away 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.239
 so I placed in the lead on the 14th of the prince 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.609
 in front of the new 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.640
 it's pretty and say this tornado of 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.659
 digeon the twist set of the valley xiii 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.780
 tornado bello 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.090
 las at teatro leucate thunder margins and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 to and finally the 15 starter of rib ok 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.479
 guillaume good game a little 8 years lay the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.439
 reminder of his selection he can not be 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.930
 a reminder since we are not yet 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.330
 given so here we are attacking and that 14 of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.820
 logical favorite prince who stays on two 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.549
 brilliant successes to vichy his mentor has 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.299
 jumped two commitments to run that 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.659
 logically it's the horse to beat 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.850
 the race 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.400
 yes a lot more and he really 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.420
 passed a plateau in recent months he has 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.909
 been very 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.310
 very punchy gingham at his two 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.850
 victories he had two inquiries 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.780
 occasions 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.970
 I think it's a little bit 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.560
 Excessive me frankly that it me 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.700
 really liked it had run very well 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.939
 previously in near new york was 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.009
 second of napoleon bar here is a 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.909
 priori makes it faces a very beautiful 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.140
 bareback engagement of hindquarters 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.880
 entrusted to franck nivard 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.049
 I see it a very first chance 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.700
 thanks and the pass of the race one is 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.380
 of agreement wanted to logically contrast the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.990
 number 9 urfer jewelry so that's 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.390
 a pure right handed she won the stage 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.899
 of ageas this gnt 2014 it was in april 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.509
 latest 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.729
 good there as it is logical to instead 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.350
 and in opposition to favorites but refuge 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.030
 with her jeans in class she gives birth 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.450
 I think he has 17 rope wins 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.519
 to the right 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.600
 so as you said it's a 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.250
 real specialist 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.319
 she gets along wonderfully with with 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.430
 damian good and you finally made it 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.470
 was referring to the races at 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.370
 the stage of agen she had punctured 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.140
 the screen that day she had made a 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.950
 fault shortly after departure it had not 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.019
 prevented from coming back win 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.209
 frankly I see that prince 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.459
 to be able to get ahead of it so we'll see 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.380
 the result Wednesday in the afternoon 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.580
 but I really like both of them 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.319
 competitors the bank had prince and 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.359
 have agreed you feel 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.760
 confident in third position the number 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.190
 7 tomas of the digeon his only attempt 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.709
 on the malouin track this ended up 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.540
 a deferred success of the four ball jmb 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.609
 also unavoidable yes unavoidable 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.650
 jmb does not necessarily prove a great 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.440
 optimistic he sees a chance but not 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.480
 no longer a first chance 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.220
 you lygia gingham so included the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.350
 city ​​council she found that 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.120
 prince for 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.980
 to block the road to success 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.780
 since we can assume that she was 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.460
 prepared for this beautiful race 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.440
 unfastened all four feet as you 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.900
 say the win has already won to saint 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.340
 malo me I trust jean michel 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.990
 bazire to bring him to these idiots but 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.850
 the arrival we can not discard it in 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.860
 fourth position the number 7 twist of 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.350
 the valley so before you leave the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.150
 say guillaume jérémy lévis to veterans 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.680
 was at the meeting name of eric raffin 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:40.760
 who tells us about the chances of his 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:42.080
 partner we listen to them she ran 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.970
 twice rope right there which one 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.740
 times 2 ulysses were placed I think 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.740
 that it can be discovered 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.580
 the activity of luck 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.580
 a cut to the precious prince and his 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.020
 lover 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.640
 he is much better in mind we had 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.650
 saw a little difficulty in living at 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.280
 cassis exceeded on the avivo I was not 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.280
 well out 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.760
 it is true that it is a horse that I 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.500
 come of good it will be understood it is 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.690
 not the big big confidence in the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.220
 flank of eric raffin now him the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.660
 discover right she has already done well 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.970
 right should not your problem 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.139
 it's a question of departure if the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.610
 horse is well right now that 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.500
 logically it can completely conclude 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.270
 on arrival ben yes as much it was 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.470
 disappointing at in the gnt stage of 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.150
 marseille vivaux as much as it is 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.919
 totally rehabilitated fifteen days more 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.680
 late in enghien so it was not no 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.110
 plus a quinté super well composed there 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.759
 is still there is lot there is 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.670
 heavy in this in this step of gnt 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.200
 so 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.820
 I see him participating at the finish 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.830
 but not necessarily not necessarily 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.480
 win while knowing that this 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.410
 small reservation concerning the rope to 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.880
 right the show the yard or twice 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.470
 as did not say on dreams 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.360
 here I am third and it is not 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.920
 quite the same but we have to 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.870
 trust again tandem 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.940
 war to all rafa it's clear in 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.980
 fifth position of number 13 tornado 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.990
 bello second on this course in 2011 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.420
 so his mentor announces the color 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.950
 it's a bit of a good target race 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.230
 a little more mixed on the plateau of i o 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.400
 yeah because I think we can 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.410
 to affirm that it is the only horse of 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.520
 class bike lot not forget 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.580
 who had ranked fifth of 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.200
 Criterium of 5 years he gave me a little 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.040
 left on my hunger in the stage in 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.600
 the race won by a race in Vichy 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.490
 it's true that you have a little bit left over 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.750
 there in the straight line before 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.760
 content with fourth place 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.780
 good last time it was 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.370
 well enghien but he also did not 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.270
 the race on Venus was contented 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.680
 to let slip to finish 6th I know 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.180
 not if it's the best basle tournament 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.150
 we're dealing with right now 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.920
 always is he the object of 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.450
 give him credit the bear be not the 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.620
 totally good see me again I do not see him 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.090
 inevitably win me it's a place 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.070
 but so we have to make him 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.610
 trust anyway okay we're not going 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.630
 stop there 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.590
 guillaume since I know you have a 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.600
 little gamble in the race 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.410
 wanted the number 15 starter rib 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.960
 what can you tell us 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.280
 but I slip them in very last 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.380
 position of the selection but it's true 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.050
 I really like his candidacy he has 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.340
 better run than it appeared recently at 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.570
 cabourg it's always complicated in the 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.640
 distance on this racetrack there 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.790
 previously grain it is almost 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.830
 made 50 m he was equipped with a fourth 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.090
 in a very beautiful action 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.550
 it is very confirmed rope right joel 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.680
 seems to be pretty confident j of the 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.320
 court makes little noise but gets 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.190
 do very well with sulky 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.720
 I would not be surprised if they come 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.980
 spice up reports on arrival no 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.410
 it can not be a fourth place and 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.510
 I remember that it is on the turf tv 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.050
 to play fourth place and is 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.640
 paid 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.440
 so we will be wary why not 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.000
 number 15 some of the rhythm thank you 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.280
 many youm for all this info on 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.780
 will leave with one this time a 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.820
 reminder of your selection and then a 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.220
 game board thank you very much and make 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.960
 you tomorrow on the set and that 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.910

 thank you guillaume thank you flowers 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.180
