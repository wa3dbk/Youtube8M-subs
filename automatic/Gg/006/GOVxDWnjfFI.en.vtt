 wonderful that little paper that leaves 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.480
 We stay very home at the moment. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.020
 to take that religious soup and that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.670
 when you get off the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.359
 your blankets 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.449
 your duvet so now is that time 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.460
 You always ask me what I do. 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.160
 with my blanket for that smell 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 saved 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.420
 so it's a centerpiece care of the hour 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.870
 to wash the ideal is to wash the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.230
 blanket at least twice a year 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.440
 but it is not always practical or always 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 good because our machine normally 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 It does not support the weight of a blanket and she 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 not without having wrinkles very well then 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.309

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.440
 Laundry time work said 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.360
