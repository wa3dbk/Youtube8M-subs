00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.620
 very good friends we are back here 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.050
 in the garage we are going to talk now about 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.679
 the new seat toledo 2013 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.310
 good look at the east toledo of this new 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.399
 generation of toledo arrives for 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.279
 replace a car that is surely 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.750
 you will prefer to forget it the generation 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.300
 previous of toledo 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.399
 it was a failure 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.190
 aesthetically the car was very little 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.510
 graceful was not a car that did not 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.149
 it defined like that was 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.160
 a sedan a minivan a minivan a 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.469
 a crossover climbs nobody knew 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.390
 exactly what it was was the toledo had 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.949
 even a double-tone version does not 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.280
 half of the body down a 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.989
 color up another one looked 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.969
 downright weird and it did not sell or 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.649
 even in Spain when a seat does not 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.110
 sells not even in Spain ' 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.240
 it's because things go wrong but 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.600
 finally they come back and come back with this 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.289
 car much more traditional than the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.679
 previous is not a car that has the 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.409
 form of a traditional sedan or with three 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.869
 volumes or two and a half volumes if 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.940
 you want because let's say the trunk is 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:32.539
 small but in reality the car is a 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.880
 hatchback since when we open the 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.220
 trunk opens it also gets up 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.480
 also the back glass and that's a 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.390
 entrance to the car 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.850
 what gives it a lot of practicality but 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.370
 let's talk about its practical side a 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.350
 shortly after aesthetically I like 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.240
 I also like this color is not a 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.000
 color will be difficult to maintain by 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.340
 for dark but it's a nice car 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.510
 like the shape of the skulls of the car 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.150
 not the silhouette is fine the size 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.760
 compact nice many venice is a 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.790
 jetta is not smaller than a jetta 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.390
 fact is not exactly the same car 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.320
 At some point in Toledo, the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.660
 same car 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.910
 this car competes forgiveness shares 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.380
 platform with some skoda obviously 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.080
 some vehicles also from 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.530
 volkswagen but that's not the platform 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.860
 of the jet 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.110
 its price in mexico is a very 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.920
 wide because it starts at 209 thousand 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.580
 weights and goes up to 280 so many there 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.100
 three engines the basic is the highest 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.739
 displacement 1.6 liters with 105 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.550
 horses sucked that I do not like I do not 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.040
 it seems a good engine this forgiveness the most 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.430
 expensive is an engine is the same engine as 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.270
 One's study is not the driving force 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.880
 volkswagen golf has 1.4 liter turbo 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.880
 with 122 horses this one 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.110
 is the only version with this engine that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.080
 It is 1.2 four-cylinder 1.2 liters with 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.030
 105 turbo horses is the same power 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.950
 of the basic but this is turbo and 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.890
 feels very good in the cart 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.900
 the acceleration is good this is only 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.690
 available with manual version if you 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.910
 you want the automatic box dsg you have 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.310
 that go to the most expensive and the magnet 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.739
 immediately more expensive this is worth 252 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.550
 thousand pesos the immediately more expensive already 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:40.050
 with 122 horsepower of 1.4 already 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.060
 costs 275 are 23 thousand pesos more than this 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.760
 it's a lot of money 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.690
 ok then half let's say there's 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.980
 divided between box half the half goes 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.349
 for the price of the box the other for 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.810
 the engine probably have a bit of 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.180
 different team 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.200
 this car sets 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.739
 locates him as a competitor of honda 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.599
 civic toyota corolla ford focus and so on 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.599
 I do not think so 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.540
 get in the car and I see a board 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:20.260
 conservative in its lines 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.300
 with suitable materials not wonderful 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.850
 look hard duritos here at the doors 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.690
 you feel this part at least where 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:36.060
 goes the elbow goes goes well does not hurt the skin 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.060
 but everything else feels plastic 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.060
 coarse 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:49.560
 I have a good team level and I have 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.050
 here a good stereo and with usb input and 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.180
 auxiliary here back I have double bag of 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.189
 air that's the only thing that I have lava the 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.990
 basic only has one airbag this 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.879
 has 2 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.490
 I already have abs brakes and I have brakes 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:05.159
 back disc the basic has only 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.039
 drum back but they already have bs no 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:13.250
 I have a sunroof but then if lights here 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:15.930
 reading and one imports lenses 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.789
 grab bars in the four squares which 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.969
 it's okay the space is good is 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.009
 nice a armrest what I 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:26.460
 it seems very good very good 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:30.440
 who puts it on and to the bottle holder in 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.440
 the doors 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:35.369
 here an attempt at cup holders but 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:39.689
 frankly it's going to fit here a can 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:41.909
 little girl and nothing else one back is 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.919
 different back there's already at least one 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.799
 carries a cup holder a little more 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.369
 decent that this one and the space is 

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:52.289
 pretty good I have the seat 

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:54.809
 adjusted for me I still over 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.999
 space up to the sides two people 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:06:01.889
 We are going to travel or will travel very well 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:04.589
 here in the middle because I also go with a lot 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.149
 space for head fortunately there is 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:08.309
 the difficulty of the tunnel of the 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:10.169
 transmission and that is very high can 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:13.079
 have to have one leg on each side 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:16.800
 obvious but as there is a lot of space 

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:19.319
 backwards I can enter and exit without 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.050
 biggest problems then it's a car 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.759
 that offers a good level of space but 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.539
 in this segment and all cars do not 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:32.060
 offer life offers the central offers 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:34.700
 the bersa offers it the site offers 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.750
 I think this car is more like that 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.400
 it's a car that competes against city 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.300
 sonic 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.220
 cabbage and sedano's from that level seat 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.259
 It puts a little higher priced 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.720
 little bit more above I do not think 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.310
 frankly, if I was thinking 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.630
 buy a segment car between this 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.000
 light and I saw that I'm going for the civic 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.310
 right but between this and a city 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.530
 I thought this is a little bit more expensive 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.449
 I go for this especially this version that 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.320
 it seems to me the best balanced one of 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:07.610
 all because of the feeling of the engine that is 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.979
 I feel great without horses 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.860
 few but with the turbo will see it 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:15.800
 they feel pretty pretty good we're going to 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:19.050
 one more cut and we come back with the focus 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.580
 st the most fun car 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.740
 that progress has been made in Mexico in the 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.740
 last two months the region 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.509
 Y 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.540
 are
