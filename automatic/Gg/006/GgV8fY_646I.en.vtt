hitter<00:05:05.780> power<00:05:06.500> hand<00:05:06.830> really<00:05:07.190> helped<00:05:07.690> just<00:05:08.690> for

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
hitter power hand really helped just for

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.770 
hitter power hand really helped just for
the<00:05:09.020> simple<00:05:09.319> fact<00:05:09.349> that<00:05:09.560> it's<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.860> 21<00:05:10.310> hitter<00:05:10.780> it

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
the simple fact that it's a 21 hitter it

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.930 
the simple fact that it's a 21 hitter it
stopped<00:05:12.740> because<00:05:13.159> there's<00:05:13.400> a<00:05:13.460> lot<00:05:13.639> of<00:05:13.669> light

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
stopped because there's a lot of light

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.080 
stopped because there's a lot of light
and<00:05:14.090> dark<00:05:14.409> cards<00:05:15.409> at<00:05:15.590> law<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:16.430> negates<00:05:16.699> the

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
and dark cards at law it negates the

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.930 
and dark cards at law it negates the
effects<00:05:17.509> of<00:05:17.650> light<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:18.919> dark<00:05:19.310> monsters<00:05:19.819> that

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
effects of light and dark monsters that

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.390 
effects of light and dark monsters that
it<00:05:20.060> battles<00:05:20.360> during<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:20.750> battle<00:05:21.050> phase<00:05:21.400> malt

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
it battles during the battle phase malt

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.110 
it battles during the battle phase malt
remains<00:05:22.789> face-up<00:05:22.970> on<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.389> field<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:25.120> that's

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
remains face-up on the field so that's

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.450 
remains face-up on the field so that's
actually<00:05:26.270> so<00:05:26.750> say<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.680> monsters<00:05:28.280> got<00:05:28.400> a

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
actually so say the monsters got a

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.149 
actually so say the monsters got a
continuous<00:05:29.000> effect<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:29.990> you<00:05:30.289> know<00:05:30.650> deals

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
continuous effect that you know deals
