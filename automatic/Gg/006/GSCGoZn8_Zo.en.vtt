00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.730 

okay<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.840> our<00:00:18.869> shot<00:00:19.140> set<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.680> we

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
okay so we have our shot set up and we

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.019 
okay so we have our shot set up and we
have<00:00:19.859> our<00:00:19.949> scene<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:20.880> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
have our scene just the way we like it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.740 
have our scene just the way we like it
and<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:21.210> we're<00:00:21.300> gonna<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:21.539> into<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
and now we're gonna get into the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.880 
and now we're gonna get into the
technical<00:00:22.140> side<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> how<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> actually<00:00:22.740> run

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
technical side of how to actually run

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.830 
technical side of how to actually run
the<00:00:23.250> time-lapse<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.330> I'm<00:00:24.390> gonna<00:00:24.539> bring<00:00:24.689> in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the time-lapse so I'm gonna bring in

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.800 
the time-lapse so I'm gonna bring in
Kyle<00:00:25.019> Roderick<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:25.710> he's<00:00:25.859> my<00:00:26.010> assistant

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
Kyle Roderick here he's my assistant

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.210 
Kyle Roderick here he's my assistant
and<00:00:27.810> first<00:00:28.349> we're<00:00:28.470> gonna<00:00:28.529> pick<00:00:28.769> our<00:00:28.890> start

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and first we're gonna pick our start

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.349 
and first we're gonna pick our start
point<00:00:29.369> right<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.210> we're<00:00:30.300> gonna

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
point right here that we're gonna

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
point right here that we're gonna
program<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:32.130> we're<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.369> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
program it in and then we're going to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.910 
program it in and then we're going to
mark<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.390> some<00:00:33.540> tape<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.800> usually

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
mark it with some tape like we usually

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.790 
mark it with some tape like we usually
do<00:00:35.660> put<00:00:36.660> some<00:00:36.780> tape<00:00:36.989> right<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.710> know

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
do put some tape right there so we know

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.549 
do put some tape right there so we know
not<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:39.270> then<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.510> actually<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.530> our

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
not to go and then we actually do our

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.240 
not to go and then we actually do our
end<00:00:40.860> points

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.410 

okay<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:49.040> we'll<00:00:49.220> mark<00:00:49.490> the<00:00:49.670> end<00:00:49.880> point<00:00:50.210> right

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
okay and we'll mark the end point right

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.530 
okay and we'll mark the end point right
here<00:00:51.520> and<00:00:52.520> we<00:00:52.760> just<00:00:52.910> want<00:00:53.060> to<00:00:53.090> make<00:00:53.210> sure<00:00:53.270> we

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
here and we just want to make sure we

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.180 
here and we just want to make sure we
double-check<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.080> setting<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:55.100> the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
double-check the setting in the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.190 
double-check the setting in the
composition<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.330> then<00:00:56.600> we<00:00:56.810> just<00:00:56.990> want<00:00:57.140> to

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
composition and then we just want to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.560 
composition and then we just want to
adjust<00:00:57.560> it<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.770> little<00:00:57.800> bit<00:00:58.100> if<00:00:58.340> we<00:00:58.490> need<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:58.820> to

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
adjust it a little bit if we need to to

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.810 
adjust it a little bit if we need to to
make<00:00:59.600> sure<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.980> composition<00:01:01.310> is<00:01:01.580> just

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
make sure the the composition is just

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.540 
make sure the the composition is just
right<00:01:02.060> and<00:01:02.990> then<00:01:03.140> we<00:01:03.620> actually<00:01:03.770> set<00:01:04.160> whichever

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
right and then we actually set whichever

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.270 
right and then we actually set whichever
whichever<00:01:04.940> access<00:01:05.540> we<00:01:05.690> move<00:01:05.960> if<00:01:06.140> we<00:01:06.290> move<00:01:06.530> this

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
whichever access we move if we move this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.570 
whichever access we move if we move this
access<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:09.260> then<00:01:09.380> we<00:01:09.530> want<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.800> set<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.160> marker

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
access and then we want to set a marker

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.990 
access and then we want to set a marker
right<00:01:10.730> here<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.430> if<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:13.460> actually<00:01:13.640> move<00:01:13.910> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
right here and if we actually move the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.400 
right here and if we actually move the
other<00:01:14.030> access<00:01:14.480> and<00:01:14.630> we<00:01:14.690> set<00:01:14.900> another<00:01:15.080> marker

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
other access and we set another marker

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.320 
other access and we set another marker
right<00:01:15.560> there<00:01:15.770> well<00:01:16.550> we<00:01:16.640> set<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.910> markers<00:01:17.180> cuz

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
right there well we set the markers cuz

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.760 
right there well we set the markers cuz
that's<00:01:17.510> how<00:01:17.600> we<00:01:17.690> record<00:01:18.050> our<00:01:18.170> move<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:18.560> want<00:01:18.710> to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's how we record our move we want to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.900 
that's how we record our move we want to
set<00:01:18.920> our<00:01:19.010> start<00:01:19.250> point<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:19.610> set<00:01:19.700> our<00:01:19.790> end

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
set our start point and set our end

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.310 
set our start point and set our end
point<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.330> then<00:01:20.630> that's<00:01:20.780> how<00:01:20.869> we<00:01:20.960> figure<00:01:21.229> it

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
point and then that's how we figure it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.900 
point and then that's how we figure it
out<00:01:23.020> let<00:01:24.020> me<00:01:24.110> go<00:01:24.229> back<00:01:24.380> up<00:01:27.430> okay<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:28.490> we<00:01:28.670> picked

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
out let me go back up okay so we picked

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.130 
out let me go back up okay so we picked
our<00:01:29.000> start<00:01:29.300> point<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.630> we<00:01:29.750> picked<00:01:29.930> our<00:01:30.020> end

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
our start point and we picked our end

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.630 
our start point and we picked our end
point<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.530> now<00:01:30.770> we're<00:01:30.950> actually<00:01:31.040> gonna<00:01:31.280> set

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
point and now we're actually gonna set

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.430 
point and now we're actually gonna set
the<00:01:31.790> smart<00:01:32.090> lapse<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.450> program<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.050> move<00:01:33.200> in

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
the smart lapse and program to move in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.609 
the smart lapse and program to move in
so<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.550> go<00:01:34.640> ahead<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:34.850> do<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.500> okay<00:01:36.500> now

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
so you can go ahead and do that okay now

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.020 
so you can go ahead and do that okay now
what<00:01:36.770> it's<00:01:36.890> doing<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.220> its<00:01:37.369> programming<00:01:37.790> each

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
what it's doing is its programming each

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.210 
what it's doing is its programming each
individual<00:01:38.960> stop<00:01:39.290> point<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:39.920> that's<00:01:40.009> what

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
individual stop point so that's what

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.469 
individual stop point so that's what
each<00:01:40.400> one<00:01:40.580> of<00:01:40.640> those<00:01:40.700> clicks<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.119> hear<00:01:41.360> it's

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
each one of those clicks you hear it's

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.090 
each one of those clicks you hear it's
right<00:01:41.690> where<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.900> stops<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:42.860> gonna<00:01:42.979> be

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
right where it stops and it's gonna be

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.160 
right where it stops and it's gonna be
taking<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.430> picture<00:01:43.930> one<00:01:44.930> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.050> most

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
taking a picture one of the most

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.359 
taking a picture one of the most
important<00:01:45.470> things<00:01:45.619> you'll<00:01:45.740> come<00:01:45.860> across<00:01:45.979> when

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
important things you'll come across when

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.440 
important things you'll come across when
actually<00:01:46.580> setting<00:01:46.790> up<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.910> time<00:01:47.090> lapse<00:01:47.119> is

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
actually setting up a time lapse is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.030 
actually setting up a time lapse is
stability<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:48.410> want<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.680> most<00:01:48.860> stable

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
stability you want the most stable

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.680 
stability you want the most stable
rigging<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.550> possibly<00:01:49.970> gets<00:01:50.150> so<00:01:50.270> here<00:01:50.510> we

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
rigging a possibly gets so here we

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.570 
rigging a possibly gets so here we
actually<00:01:50.930> have<00:01:51.080> one<00:01:51.230> of<00:01:51.350> our<00:01:51.470> cases<00:01:51.680> strapped

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
actually have one of our cases strapped

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.980 
actually have one of our cases strapped
on<00:01:52.730> to<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.970> back<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.240> tripods<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.780> really

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
on to the back of the tripods to really

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.630 
on to the back of the tripods to really
weigh<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.260> down<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.130> there's<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:55.370> little

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
weigh it down so there's this little

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.730 
weigh it down so there's this little
shake<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.300> vibration<00:01:56.840> as<00:01:56.900> possible<00:01:57.380> any

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
shake and vibration as possible any

shake at all whatsoever
an<00:02:00.550> entire<00:02:01.550> five<00:02:01.820> hour<00:02:02.030> time<00:02:02.240> lapse<00:02:02.390> will<00:02:02.570> be

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
an entire five hour time lapse will be

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.770 
an entire five hour time lapse will be
ruined<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.530> any<00:02:04.370> light<00:02:04.670> any<00:02:05.180> stray<00:02:05.420> light<00:02:05.570> for

that matter and a five hour time lapse
will<00:02:07.310> be<00:02:07.430> ruined<00:02:07.760> okay<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.239> now<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:08.479> our

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
will be ruined okay and now that our

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.120 
will be ruined okay and now that our
move<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.840> set<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.320> it's<00:02:09.350> programmed<00:02:09.800> into<00:02:09.950> the

move is set and it's programmed into the
Oracle<00:02:10.369> controllers<00:02:10.880> we're<00:02:10.970> gonna<00:02:11.090> go<00:02:11.300> back

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
Oracle controllers we're gonna go back

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.170 
Oracle controllers we're gonna go back
to<00:02:11.480> our<00:02:11.690> start<00:02:12.019> point<00:02:13.000> we're<00:02:14.000> gonna<00:02:14.120> get

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
to our start point we're gonna get

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.090 
to our start point we're gonna get
started<00:02:14.390> with<00:02:14.540> our<00:02:14.690> shot<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.410> rig<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.769> all<00:02:15.920> set

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
started with our shot the rig is all set

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.640 
started with our shot the rig is all set
up<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.400> Kessler<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:17.120> these<00:02:17.630> joysticks<00:02:18.560> and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
up the Kessler all these joysticks and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.320 
up the Kessler all these joysticks and
stuff<00:02:18.830> like<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.160> good<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.400> go<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:20.180> main

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
stuff like that is good to go the main

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.610 
stuff like that is good to go the main
thing<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.049> settings<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.590> camera

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
thing is is the settings in the camera

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.940 
thing is is the settings in the camera
now<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.549> a<00:02:22.580> couple<00:02:23.170> little<00:02:24.170> tricks<00:02:24.560> that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
now I have a couple little tricks that

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.100 
now I have a couple little tricks that
I've<00:02:25.040> learned<00:02:25.310> over<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.970> number<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.540> bad<00:02:26.780> time

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
I've learned over a number of bad time

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.350 
I've learned over a number of bad time
lapses<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.739> really<00:02:28.280> helps<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:28.670> get<00:02:29.150> that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
lapses that really helps you get that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240 
lapses that really helps you get that
flicker<00:02:29.690> out<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:30.110> your<00:02:30.200> shots<00:02:30.440> now<00:02:30.950> number<00:02:31.220> one

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
flicker out of your shots now number one

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.039 
flicker out of your shots now number one
is<00:02:31.580> auto<00:02:31.850> lighting<00:02:32.239> optimizer<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.840> want<00:02:32.989> to

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
is auto lighting optimizer you want to

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.180 
is auto lighting optimizer you want to
take<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.350> off<00:02:33.620> entirely

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
take that off entirely

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.520 
take that off entirely
number<00:02:35.150> two<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> mirror<00:02:35.780> lock-up<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.380> want

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
number two is a mirror lock-up you want

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.920 
number two is a mirror lock-up you want
to<00:02:36.620> actually<00:02:36.980> engage<00:02:37.970> mirror<00:02:38.510> lock-up<00:02:38.630> so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
to actually engage mirror lock-up so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.630 
to actually engage mirror lock-up so
that<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.110> mirror<00:02:39.350> doesn't<00:02:39.530> open<00:02:40.340> every

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
that the mirror doesn't open every

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.630 
that the mirror doesn't open every
single<00:02:40.790> time<00:02:41.410> number<00:02:42.410> three<00:02:42.650> noise<00:02:43.310> reduction

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
single time number three noise reduction

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.949 
single time number three noise reduction
you<00:02:43.940> want<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.150> take<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:44.390> off<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.810> do<00:02:44.930> not

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
you want to take that off you do not

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.229 
you want to take that off you do not
want<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.410> camera<00:02:45.709> processing<00:02:46.220> noise<00:02:46.880> on<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
want the camera processing noise on the

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.390 
want the camera processing noise on the
fly<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:48.049> much<00:02:48.350> want<00:02:48.560> much<00:02:48.739> rather<00:02:48.890> do<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.280> in

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
fly you much want much rather do that in

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.770 
fly you much want much rather do that in
After<00:02:49.640> Effects<00:02:49.850> but<00:02:50.269> then<00:02:50.360> last<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:50.660> not

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
After Effects but then last but not

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.750 
After Effects but then last but not
least<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.440> most<00:02:51.590> important<00:02:51.980> thing<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.250> feel<00:02:52.519> is

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
least the most important thing I feel is

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760 
least the most important thing I feel is
is<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.510> aperture<00:02:53.870> lock<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.560> where<00:02:54.680> you

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
is the aperture lock this is where you

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.410 
is the aperture lock this is where you
grab<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.099> depth<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.400> field<00:02:55.580> button<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
grab the depth of field button and the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.690 
grab the depth of field button and the
lens<00:02:56.810> release<00:02:57.020> button<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:58.010> twist<00:02:58.459> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
lens release button and you twist the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.160 
lens release button and you twist the
lens<00:02:58.940> just<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.540> little<00:02:59.750> bit<00:02:59.870> so<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.020> the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
lens just a little bit so that the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.850 
lens just a little bit so that the
sensor

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
sensor

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.649 
sensor
disconnect<00:03:01.580> from<00:03:01.700> each<00:03:01.819> other<00:03:02.000> basically

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
disconnect from each other basically

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.539 
disconnect from each other basically
allowing<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.349> camera<00:03:03.620> not<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:03.980> recalibrate

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
allowing the camera not to recalibrate

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.580 
allowing the camera not to recalibrate
every<00:03:05.269> single<00:03:05.629> shot<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.319> aperture

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
every single shot so that the aperture

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.170 
every single shot so that the aperture
stays<00:03:06.920> consistent<00:03:07.430> all<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.610> way<00:03:07.790> through<00:03:08.030> but

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
stays consistent all the way through but

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.729 
stays consistent all the way through but
before<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.599> do<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.080> have<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.560> have<00:03:09.650> your

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
before you do this you have to have your

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.470 
before you do this you have to have your
aperture<00:03:09.980> set<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.760> have<00:03:10.849> to<00:03:10.940> have<00:03:11.030> your<00:03:11.120> focus

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
aperture set you have to have your focus

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.380 
aperture set you have to have your focus
set<00:03:11.690> all<00:03:11.900> your<00:03:12.230> settings<00:03:12.409> must<00:03:12.650> be<00:03:12.799> dead-on

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
set all your settings must be dead-on

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.190 
set all your settings must be dead-on
okay<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.450> now<00:03:14.599> we're<00:03:14.690> going<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.840> set<00:03:15.049> all<00:03:15.170> of

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
okay so now we're going to set all of

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.780 
okay so now we're going to set all of
our<00:03:15.349> intro<00:03:15.680> meter<00:03:16.069> settings<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.549> we're<00:03:16.700> going

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
our intro meter settings so we're going

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.270 
our intro meter settings so we're going
to<00:03:16.849> set<00:03:17.120> our<00:03:17.239> delay<00:03:17.920> we're<00:03:18.920> actually<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.220> to

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
to set our delay we're actually going to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.430 
to set our delay we're actually going to
set<00:03:19.430> our<00:03:19.519> our<00:03:20.209> shutter<00:03:20.540> speed<00:03:20.629> first<00:03:21.079> which<00:03:21.319> is

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
set our our shutter speed first which is

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.589 
set our our shutter speed first which is
about<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.980> thirtieth<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.670> second<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.480> it's

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
about a thirtieth of a second so it's

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.880 
about a thirtieth of a second so it's
going<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.750> take<00:03:23.900> about<00:03:24.079> two<00:03:24.349> seconds<00:03:24.680> for<00:03:24.799> the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
going to take about two seconds for the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.100 
going to take about two seconds for the
shot<00:03:25.129> and<00:03:25.310> we<00:03:25.400> want<00:03:26.090> about<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.329> two-second

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
shot and we want about a two-second

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.080 
shot and we want about a two-second
delay<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:27.409> that<00:03:27.769> it's<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.400> stops<00:03:28.760> shaking

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
delay so that it's it stops shaking

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.119 
delay so that it's it stops shaking
every<00:03:29.420> single<00:03:29.629> time<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.870> moves<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.829> now<00:03:31.069> we

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
every single time it moves and now we

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.680 
every single time it moves and now we
just<00:03:31.459> choose<00:03:31.640> how<00:03:31.849> many<00:03:32.030> pictures<00:03:32.209> we<00:03:32.299> want<00:03:32.510> so

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
just choose how many pictures we want so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.360 
just choose how many pictures we want so
in<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.900> case<00:03:33.109> we're<00:03:33.290> going<00:03:33.379> to<00:03:33.440> do<00:03:33.560> about<00:03:33.650> 400

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
in this case we're going to do about 400

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.789 
in this case we're going to do about 400
which<00:03:34.970> should<00:03:35.180> give<00:03:35.269> us<00:03:35.359> about<00:03:35.480> 16<00:03:36.349> seconds

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
which should give us about 16 seconds

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.190 
which should give us about 16 seconds
and<00:03:37.069> we<00:03:37.250> could<00:03:37.400> speed<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.760> up<00:03:38.000> in<00:03:38.209> post<00:03:38.629> maybe

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
and we could speed it up in post maybe

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.110 
and we could speed it up in post maybe
give<00:03:39.379> us<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.560> nice<00:03:39.709> five-second<00:03:40.670> shot<00:03:40.700> in<00:03:41.030> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
give us a nice five-second shot in the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.460 
give us a nice five-second shot in the
end<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.510> there<00:03:41.599> are<00:03:41.720> lots<00:03:42.049> of<00:03:42.140> dynamic
