they<00:01:28.320> did<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.180> give<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.689> carload<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:32.240> 4

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
they did this so I give this carload a 4

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.420 
they did this so I give this carload a 4
out<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.450> 5

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
out of 5

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.410 
out of 5
you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.490> why<00:01:35.579> four<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> half<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.299> five

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you know why four and a half out of five

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.140 
you know why four and a half out of five
for<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> reason<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.259> these<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:37.860> two

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
for the reason because these little two

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.420 
for the reason because these little two
blade<00:01:39.150> looking<00:01:39.570> things<00:01:40.070> sometimes<00:01:41.070> they<00:01:41.280> will

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
blade looking things sometimes they will

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.600 
blade looking things sometimes they will
slip<00:01:41.820> out<00:01:41.939> onto<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> wheel<00:01:42.860> not<00:01:43.860> allowing<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
slip out onto the wheel not allowing it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.899 
slip out onto the wheel not allowing it
to<00:01:45.140> spin<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.380> well<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.189> interferes<00:01:47.520> with

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
to spin as well and it interferes with

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.990 
to spin as well and it interferes with
the<00:01:48.180> cars<00:01:49.100> moving<00:01:50.100> capabilities<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the cars moving capabilities you see the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.550 
the cars moving capabilities you see the
tires<00:01:54.000> move<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.540> all<00:01:54.750> sides<00:01:55.640> pretty<00:01:56.640> good<00:01:57.560> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
tires move on all sides pretty good so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.280 
tires move on all sides pretty good so
now<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.430> stop<00:01:59.640> talking<00:02:00.119> about<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.869> load

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
now I will stop talking about the load

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.770 
now I will stop talking about the load

on the bottom have these heels here it's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.360 
on the bottom have these heels here it's
kind<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.690> hard<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.930> pull<00:02:38.319> out<00:02:38.470> sometimes<00:02:38.980> but

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
kind of hard to pull out sometimes but

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.259 
kind of hard to pull out sometimes but
it's<00:02:40.120> time<00:02:40.300> it's<00:02:40.450> fairly<00:02:40.660> easy<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:43.060> waist

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
it's time it's fairly easy the waist

next you want to take up the front hood

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.910 
next you want to take up the front hood
which<00:02:46.420> open<00:02:46.720> these<00:02:46.870> will<00:02:47.110> become<00:02:47.290> eventually

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
which open these will become eventually

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.850 
which open these will become eventually
the<00:02:48.250> arms<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.720> want<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.959> pop<00:02:50.290> these<00:02:50.560> up

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
over at the hood over onto itself which

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.080 
over at the hood over onto itself which
will<00:03:19.480> make<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.840> arms<00:03:20.310> they<00:03:21.310> don't<00:03:21.579> just<00:03:21.910> kind

this little peg into that hole on the
wheel<00:04:12.010> it's<00:04:12.910> kind<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.180> hard<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.390> do<00:04:13.600> that

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
wheel it's kind of hard to do that

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.410 
wheel it's kind of hard to do that
sometimes<00:04:14.200> just<00:04:14.560> kind<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:14.920> kind<00:04:15.190> of<00:04:15.280> do<00:04:16.180> some

sometimes just kind of kind of do some
sort<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:16.660> triangulation<00:04:17.470> thing<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.459> so

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
sort of triangulation thing to it so

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.350 
sort of triangulation thing to it so
push<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.980> in<00:04:23.940> got<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:24.970> little<00:04:25.180> light

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
autumn more feet look like his hand

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.550 
autumn more feet look like his hand
transforms<00:04:40.419> into<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.750> gun<00:04:40.900> like<00:04:41.080> it<00:04:41.230> doesn't

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
transforms into the gun like it doesn't

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.909 
transforms into the gun like it doesn't

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
now his head can go full 360 go up and

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.960 
now his head can go full 360 go up and
down<00:06:49.230> you<00:06:49.830> know<00:06:49.920> be<00:06:50.190> a<00:06:50.220> headbanger<00:06:50.610> to

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
down you know be a headbanger to

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.110 
down you know be a headbanger to
continue<00:06:52.010> but<00:06:53.010> so<00:06:53.310> overall<00:06:53.670> I<00:06:53.790> give<00:06:53.970> this

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
continue but so overall I give this

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.460 
continue but so overall I give this
whole<00:06:54.330> figure<00:06:54.660> a<00:06:54.720> four<00:06:55.230> out<00:06:55.380> of<00:06:55.410> five<00:06:56.210> so<00:06:57.470> and

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
whole figure a four out of five so and

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.020 
whole figure a four out of five so and
he's<00:06:58.590> only<00:06:58.800> he's<00:06:59.250> only<00:06:59.430> a<00:06:59.520> target<00:06:59.940> exclusive

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
he's only he's only a target exclusive

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.380 
he's only he's only a target exclusive
so<00:07:00.600> you<00:07:00.660> can<00:07:00.870> only<00:07:01.110> get<00:07:01.350> him<00:07:01.620> at<00:07:01.830> Target<00:07:02.310> so<00:07:03.120> if

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.390 
so you can only get him at Target so if

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.440 
so you can only get him at Target so if
you<00:07:03.870> see<00:07:04.110> him<00:07:04.350> pick<00:07:05.070> him<00:07:05.250> up<00:07:05.400> because<00:07:05.670> most

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
you see him pick him up because most

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.300 
you see him pick him up because most
likely<00:07:06.690> he<00:07:06.990> will<00:07:07.110> fly<00:07:07.470> off<00:07:07.620> the<00:07:07.770> shelves<00:07:08.040> like

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
likely he will fly off the shelves like
