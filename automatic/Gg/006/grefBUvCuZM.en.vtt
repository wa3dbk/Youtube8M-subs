00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:09.770
 Yes, I have always discharged 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.770
 I have already disassembled the camera 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.259
 It looks like this 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:25.460
 separately his 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:30.650
 Here, for this, I starred it all well 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:35.510
 almost not washed well 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.079
 you cleared 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.079
 removed 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:49.739
 Well, in short did the marafet completely and here 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.250
 so vacuumed without vacuuming everything 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.269
 manually all such chopsticks 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:02.550
 watts each each even each nest 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:04.699
 wiped the cooler like this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.699
 way 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.990
 but then 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:20.860
 rubbed motherboard to ter all layer 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:24.420
 oil rubbed the screen is made now 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.420
 I will collect it back 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.680
 we have 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:44.469
 in order to collect it back to me 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.950
 it is necessary here these wiring 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.079
 attach to them where they were not 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.170
 need this meander 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:02:00.890
 at least estimate where they were for 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.049
 begin begin so well it is clear that one 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.729
 this one was 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:12.530
 right here this little one was right here 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:16.579
 here was one big one here 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.000
 this is the button of the wires he answers here 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:26.930
 he goes is a long time that he answers 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:31.430
 for including this posting it goes 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.250
 somewhere but he goes only to he goes 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.880
 only here here it is only here 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.420
 there is and here we have a touchpad on what he 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.170
 responsible for the touchpad and this is what we have here 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:51.620
 this keyboard means everything is clear everything 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.519
 understandably try this when you connect 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.519
 in some way 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.860
 as usual 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:09.060
 Internet buggy I did not understand how not 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.060
