00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
on a discussion that we started on

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.730 
on a discussion that we started on
Monday<00:00:17.640> when<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:17.880> looked<00:00:18.210> at<00:00:18.480> work<00:00:19.080> by<00:00:19.290> local

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
Monday when we looked at work by local

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.860 
Monday when we looked at work by local
which<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.040> new<00:00:20.220> york-based

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
which is a new york-based

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.400 
which is a new york-based
architecture<00:00:21.870> firm<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.170> they<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
architecture firm and they did a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.260 
architecture firm and they did a
renovation<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.280> an<00:00:23.370> apartment<00:00:23.610> locked<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
renovation to an apartment locked and

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.640 
renovation to an apartment locked and
they<00:00:24.360> had<00:00:24.510> an<00:00:24.600> interesting<00:00:24.900> piece<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
they had an interesting piece of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.310 
they had an interesting piece of
millwork<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.420> front<00:00:27.690> entry<00:00:27.990> there<00:00:28.140> kind

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
millwork at the front entry there kind

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.840 
millwork at the front entry there kind
of<00:00:28.350> blurred<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.770> line<00:00:28.949> between<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.520> work<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
of blurred the line between the work and

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.250 
of blurred the line between the work and
built-in<00:00:30.119> furnitures<00:00:30.600> so<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.869> thought<00:00:31.050> we

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
built-in furnitures so we thought we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.990 
built-in furnitures so we thought we
would<00:00:31.380> take<00:00:31.860> that<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.099> step<00:00:32.219> further<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.730> look

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
would take that a step further and look

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.459 
would take that a step further and look
at<00:00:33.120> some<00:00:33.329> millwork<00:00:33.629> that<00:00:33.840> blurs<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.199> line

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
at some millwork that blurs the line

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.899 
at some millwork that blurs the line
with<00:00:34.739> stairs<00:00:35.129> that's<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.699> haven't

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:35.909 
with stairs that's right we haven't

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.579 
with stairs that's right we haven't
really<00:00:35.999> talked<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.449> stairs<00:00:36.899> very<00:00:37.019> much<00:00:37.409> or

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
really talked about stairs very much or

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:39.110 
really talked about stairs very much or
not<00:00:37.679> for<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> long<00:00:38.190> time<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.760> thought<00:00:38.789> today

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
not for a long time so we thought today

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.639 
not for a long time so we thought today
would<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.539> good<00:00:39.719> opportunity<00:00:40.019> to<00:00:40.319> do<00:00:40.499> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
would be a good opportunity to do that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.439 
would be a good opportunity to do that
and<00:00:40.859> got<00:00:41.339> a<00:00:41.370> few<00:00:41.579> projects<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.089> look<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.359> and

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
and got a few projects to look at and

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:43.880 
and got a few projects to look at and
the<00:00:42.510> first<00:00:42.659> one<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.019> by<00:00:43.140> splice<00:00:43.559> from

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the first one is by splice from

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.130 
the first one is by splice from
Vancouver<00:00:44.429> I<00:00:44.640> really<00:00:45.089> like<00:00:45.269> this<00:00:45.479> project<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
Vancouver I really like this project and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
Vancouver I really like this project and
I<00:00:46.199> really<00:00:46.409> like<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.769> stair<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.819> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
I really like this stair because it's a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.759 
I really like this stair because it's a
stair<00:00:48.269> but<00:00:48.449> it's<00:00:48.569> also<00:00:48.809> doing<00:00:49.229> a<00:00:49.350> whole<00:00:49.530> lot<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
stair but it's also doing a whole lot of

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.770 
stair but it's also doing a whole lot of
other<00:00:50.010> things<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.519> we<00:00:50.699> look<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.329> start<00:00:51.539> off

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
other things so we look to start off

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
other things so we look to start off
with<00:00:52.019> we've<00:00:52.199> got<00:00:52.229> the<00:00:52.530> stair<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.039> goes<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
with we've got the stair that goes up to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.989 
with we've got the stair that goes up to
the<00:00:54.389> second<00:00:55.019> floor<00:00:55.319> there<00:00:55.589> now<00:00:56.549> we<00:00:56.609> can<00:00:56.819> see<00:00:56.909> it

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
the second floor there now we can see it

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.539 
the second floor there now we can see it
actually<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> also<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.199> storage<00:00:58.769> cabinet<00:00:59.069> so

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
actually is also a storage cabinet so

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.969 
actually is also a storage cabinet so
those<00:00:59.819> that<00:01:00.209> some<00:01:01.049> of<00:01:01.139> those<00:01:01.229> openings<00:01:01.739> some

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
those that some of those openings some

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.529 
those that some of those openings some
of<00:01:02.039> those<00:01:02.129> reveals<00:01:02.459> are<00:01:02.609> actually<00:01:02.969> doors<00:01:03.299> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
of those reveals are actually doors that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.139 
of those reveals are actually doors that
open<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.710> step<00:01:05.010> back<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.000> we've

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
open up we step back we see that we've

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.399 
open up we step back we see that we've
actually<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.399> stair<00:01:08.399> that<00:01:08.729> goes<00:01:09.049> up<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
actually got a stair that goes up and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.359 
actually got a stair that goes up and
over<00:01:10.920> top<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:12.090> no<00:01:12.750> work<00:01:12.960> piece<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.950> sits<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
over top of a no work piece that sits in

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
over top of a no work piece that sits in
the<00:01:14.460> room<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.729> has<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> fireplace<00:01:15.539> in<00:01:15.719> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the room that has the fireplace in it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
the room that has the fireplace in it
that's<00:01:16.140> unusual<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.159> you're<00:01:17.340> clever<00:01:17.579> yeah<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that's unusual as you're clever yeah I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
that's unusual as you're clever yeah I
think<00:01:18.149> it's<00:01:18.270> very<00:01:18.420> clever<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.259> can

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
think it's very clever and then you can

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
think it's very clever and then you can
see<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:19.859> ends<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:21.000> there

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
see that it actually ends right there

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
see that it actually ends right there
and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.719> there's<00:01:21.869> another<00:01:22.079> stair<00:01:22.710> that's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and then there's another stair that's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.580 
and then there's another stair that's
glass<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.909> actually<00:01:24.329> gets<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:25.079> to<00:01:25.469> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
glass that actually gets you up to the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.039 
glass that actually gets you up to the
top<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.070> you've<00:01:26.490> got<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.570> pretty<00:01:27.750> sure

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
top so you've got to be pretty sure

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
top so you've got to be pretty sure
footed<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> use<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.219> stair<00:01:29.609> but<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.820> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
footed I think to use the stair but I I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
footed I think to use the stair but I I
think<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:31.020> nice<00:01:31.350> innovative<00:01:32.100> way<00:01:32.219> of

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
think it's a very nice innovative way of

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.639 
think it's a very nice innovative way of
thinking<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:33.030> about<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.719> stair<00:01:34.109> it's<00:01:34.469> very

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
thinking about about a stair it's very

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.230 
thinking about about a stair it's very
interesting<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.399> these<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.909> some<00:01:36.119> more

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
interesting so then these are some more

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.649 
interesting so then these are some more
typical<00:01:36.810> ways<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.560> merging<00:01:38.509> millwork<00:01:39.509> with

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
typical ways of merging millwork with

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
typical ways of merging millwork with
stairs<00:01:39.929> and<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> project<00:01:41.219> from<00:01:41.520> Sonoma

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
stairs and this is a project from Sonoma

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.849 
stairs and this is a project from Sonoma
County<00:01:42.149> in<00:01:42.240> California<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.350> merges<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
County in California and that merges a

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.849 
County in California and that merges a
bookshelf<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:45.390> loaf<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.740> what

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
bookshelf and a loaf and really what

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:47.870 
bookshelf and a loaf and really what
it's<00:01:46.979> doing<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.399> getting<00:01:47.640> rid<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.789> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
it's doing is it's getting rid of the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's doing is it's getting rid of the
guard<00:01:48.119> rail<00:01:48.329> right<00:01:48.570> yeah<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.320> bookshelf

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
guard rail right yeah the the bookshelf

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.319 
guard rail right yeah the the bookshelf
is<00:01:50.039> acting<00:01:50.429> as<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> guard<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:50.969> you<00:01:51.149> need

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
is acting as the guard because you need

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.209 
is acting as the guard because you need
that<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.749> don't<00:01:51.929> fall<00:01:52.109> over<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.189> a

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
that so you don't fall over this is a

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.620 
that so you don't fall over this is a
project<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.759> does<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> same<00:01:54.060> thing<00:01:54.270> in

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
project that does the same thing in

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
project that does the same thing in
Montreal<00:01:55.109> a<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.499> more<00:01:55.649> norm<00:01:55.859> it<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
Montreal a little bit more norm it a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.380 
Montreal a little bit more norm it a
little<00:01:56.219> bit<00:01:56.399> more<00:01:56.490> normative<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.999> goes<00:01:57.119> floor

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
little bit more normative it goes floor

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.819 
little bit more normative it goes floor
to<00:01:57.479> ceiling<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.289> stringer<00:01:58.679> in

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
to ceiling you can see the stringer in

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
to ceiling you can see the stringer in
the<00:01:58.950> background<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.609> it<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.819> acting<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the background so it is acting as the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.609 
the background so it is acting as the
guard<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.109> careful<00:02:01.469> though<00:02:01.590> that

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
guard you have to be careful though that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.429 
guard you have to be careful though that
you<00:02:01.890> still<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.869> minimal<00:02:03.869> distances

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you still have your minimal distances

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.950 
you still have your minimal distances
somehow<00:02:05.340> handled<00:02:05.850> from<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.569> building<00:02:06.840> code

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
somehow handled from a building code

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.809 
somehow handled from a building code
point<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.289> view<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.859> is<00:02:07.920> Battersby<00:02:08.520> howl<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
point of view this is Battersby howl and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.219 
point of view this is Battersby howl and
also<00:02:09.149> from<00:02:09.300> Vancouver<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.810> what<00:02:10.050> they've

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
also from Vancouver and what they've

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.080 
also from Vancouver and what they've
done<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.590> they've<00:02:10.740> merged<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.310> stair<00:02:11.640> with

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
done is they've merged the stair with

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
done is they've merged the stair with
the<00:02:12.240> kitchen<00:02:12.660> millwork<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.350> they've<00:02:13.800> taken<00:02:14.070> it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the kitchen millwork so they've taken it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.770 
the kitchen millwork so they've taken it
one<00:02:14.760> step<00:02:14.970> further<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.360> stop

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
one step further you can stop

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.180 
one step further you can stop
back<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> little<00:02:16.230> bit<00:02:16.380> here<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.650> their<00:02:16.740> housing

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
back a little bit here in their housing

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.699 
back a little bit here in their housing
kitchen<00:02:17.760> cabinetry<00:02:18.060> comes<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.200> it's

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
kitchen cabinetry comes out and it's

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.570 
kitchen cabinetry comes out and it's
really<00:02:19.950> interesting<00:02:20.130> because<00:02:20.370> they've

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
really interesting because they've

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.600 
really interesting because they've
overhung<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.630> stair<00:02:22.560> riser<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.130> stringer

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
overhung the stair riser and stringer

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.900 
overhung the stair riser and stringer
has<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> three-quarter<00:02:25.020> inch<00:02:25.170> strip<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.190> wood

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
has a three-quarter inch strip of wood

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.730 
has a three-quarter inch strip of wood
and<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.569> actually<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> stair<00:02:28.530> it's<00:02:28.650> like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
and that actually is the stair it's like

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.680 
and that actually is the stair it's like
a<00:02:28.770> ribbon<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.910> remember<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.480> this

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
a ribbon so you have to remember on this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.110 
a ribbon so you have to remember on this
normally<00:02:31.530> particularly<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.370> Canada<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.819> cold

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
normally particularly in Canada in cold

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.910 
normally particularly in Canada in cold
climates<00:02:33.540> you've<00:02:33.660> got<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> stair<00:02:34.140> going<00:02:34.380> up<00:02:34.590> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
climates you've got a stair going up and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.170 
climates you've got a stair going up and
you<00:02:35.100> got<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.280> stair<00:02:35.489> going<00:02:35.700> down<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
you got to stair going down to the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.390 
you got to stair going down to the
basement<00:02:36.330> those<00:02:36.780> usually<00:02:37.200> are<00:02:37.350> on<00:02:37.560> top<00:02:38.190> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
basement those usually are on top of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.620 
basement those usually are on top of
each<00:02:38.520> other<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.090> makes<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.420> very

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
each other and it makes it very

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.870 
each other and it makes it very
difficult<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.410> do<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:40.950> kind<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.430> thing<00:02:41.730> where

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
difficult to do this kind of thing where

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.520 
difficult to do this kind of thing where
you<00:02:41.910> actually<00:02:42.360> inhabit<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.380> space

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
you actually inhabit the space

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.710 
you actually inhabit the space
underneath<00:02:44.130> with<00:02:44.610> some<00:02:44.819> kind<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.270> function

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
underneath with some kind of function

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.570 
underneath with some kind of function
here<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.560> no<00:02:46.800> stairs<00:02:47.130> no<00:02:47.220> because<00:02:47.430> it's

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
here there is no stairs no because it's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.580 
here there is no stairs no because it's
a<00:02:47.670> loft<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.290> loft<00:02:49.500> space

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
a loft so it's a it so it's a loft space

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.590 
a loft so it's a it so it's a loft space
so<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.040> works<00:02:50.280> particularly<00:02:50.790> well<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
so this works particularly well in that

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.570 
so this works particularly well in that
example<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.380> our<00:02:52.560> last<00:02:53.400> example

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
example and this is our last example

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.130 
example and this is our last example
this<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.090> from<00:02:54.239> Switzerland<00:02:54.480> you're<00:02:54.930> gonna

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
this is from Switzerland you're gonna

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.140 
this is from Switzerland you're gonna
try<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.560> pronounce<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.430> can't<00:02:56.790> there's

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
try and pronounce that I can't there's

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.390 
try and pronounce that I can't there's
two<00:02:57.330> e<00:02:57.360> constants<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.590> was<00:02:59.070> trying<00:02:59.370> to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
two e constants in it I was trying to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.250 
two e constants in it I was trying to
practice<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.910> before<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.300> went<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.870> arid<00:03:01.170> I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
practice that before we went to arid I

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.900 
practice that before we went to arid I
could<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.650> couldn't<00:03:01.920> spit<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.250> out<00:03:02.340> but<00:03:02.760> this

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
could I couldn't spit it out but this

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.430 
could I couldn't spit it out but this
one's<00:03:03.120> interesting<00:03:03.569> because<00:03:03.720> what<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.319> does

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
one's interesting because what it does

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.220 
one's interesting because what it does
is<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:05.069> really<00:03:05.430> merges<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.660> guard<00:03:06.930> it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
is it it's really merges the guard it

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.580 
is it it's really merges the guard it
merges<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.340> stair<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.269> storage<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.050> also

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
merges the stair the storage and also

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.250 
merges the stair the storage and also
this<00:03:11.040> ceiling<00:03:11.790> plane<00:03:12.090> where<00:03:12.690> they've<00:03:12.810> lived

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
this ceiling plane where they've lived

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.559 
this ceiling plane where they've lived
above<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.190> loft<00:03:14.400> above<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.880> all<00:03:15.060> becomes<00:03:15.450> one

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
above the loft above it all becomes one

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.420 
above the loft above it all becomes one
object<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> really<00:03:17.310> beautiful

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
object so this is a really beautiful

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.000 
object so this is a really beautiful
detail<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.420> Battersby<00:03:18.989> how<00:03:19.080> it's<00:03:19.290> example<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
detail in Battersby how it's example the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.940

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
the three-quarter inch wood planking

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.920 
the three-quarter inch wood planking
overhung<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.000> work<00:03:24.150> here<00:03:24.390> it's<00:03:24.540> flush

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
overhung and the work here it's flush

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.140 
overhung and the work here it's flush
but<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.799> actually<00:03:25.920> read<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.820> stair

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
but you can actually read the stair

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.220 
but you can actually read the stair
against<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.840> mower

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
against the mower

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.720 
against the mower
yeah<00:03:28.320> it's<00:03:28.620> lovely<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.100> see<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.579> that

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
yeah it's lovely to see that that

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.420 
yeah it's lovely to see that that
actually<00:03:29.940> comes<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.780> becomes<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:32.190> top

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
actually comes and becomes the the top

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.520 
actually comes and becomes the the top
of<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.760> credenza<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.840> looking<00:03:34.140> out<00:03:34.350> in

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
of that credenza and just looking out in

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.690 
of that credenza and just looking out in
the<00:03:34.650> background<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.160> can<00:03:35.220> see<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.610> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
the background you can see that the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.810 
the background you can see that the
stair<00:03:35.940> actually<00:03:36.570> also<00:03:36.840> goes<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:38.190> aligns

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
stair actually also goes and and aligns

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.970 
stair actually also goes and and aligns
