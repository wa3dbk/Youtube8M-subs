00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.450
 but it is understood by 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.549
 a new financial and economic center of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.799
 São Paulo is the avenue luís carlos 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.030
 berrini I needed to create a 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.640
 more familiar space 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.630
 of the toy library integrated with off 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.060
 that this office is inside the tv room 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.530
 this was in a way a challenge 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.829
 our thousand customers are our 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.829
 Preferred 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.409
 we are looking for a commercial language 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.799
 clinton we insert brushstrokes of a 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.100
 golden a black the color ends up appearing 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.220
 the details by raising and valuing the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.350
 main material 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.720

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.210
 to enhance a coating enhance 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.659

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.060
 people want to highlight is a great ally 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.519
 of the design solutions the layout that goes 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.890
 create these integrations 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.140
 or these segregations within the same 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.030
 environment so that the space 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.459
 always the same in the most trying to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.569
 apartments is different then 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.290
 have some items that transmit the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.349
 personality of the apartment dweller 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.500
 people want more and more to add 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.290
 the function to add value to the client at the time 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.209
 that he buys a property he wants 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.209
