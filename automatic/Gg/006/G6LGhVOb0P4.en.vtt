00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
attack in the first place so we've been

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.610 
attack in the first place so we've been
using<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.550> statin<00:02:13.000> medications<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:14.050> more

recently as higher doses and using the

recently as higher doses and using the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
prevent a heart attacks better than just

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.770 
prevent a heart attacks better than just

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.040 
see this fall some new trials suggesting
that<00:02:44.409> many<00:02:44.680> more<00:02:45.129> patients<00:02:45.909> should<00:02:46.360> be<00:02:46.420> taking

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
that many more patients should be taking

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.130 
that many more patients should be taking
