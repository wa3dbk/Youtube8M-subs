00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.590
 sorry uribe that better start 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.340
 could you have a team 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.920
 obviously happy with the first 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.340
 our field by closing a game of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.529
 this way and prove that toluca has 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.869
 campus to be fighting the two 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.840
 fast fronts came to the first 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.070
 day and in the cup m good thanks to 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.510
 God 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.780
 be the first match in our field 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.790
 our people and hopefully the beginning of 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.170
 very big things I think it was 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.940
 positive because of three quarters of 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 court followed we greatly improved the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.220
 time like I was a bit hard not 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.129
 it cost us to acclimatize ourselves in the game 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.379
 necaxa closed the spaces well 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.360
 we had space to generate much 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.380
 advantage of three quarters cancer court 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.630
 backward 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.910
 defensively it seems to me that we 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.530
 missed more than the offensive then 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.150
 then we coordinate second time and the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.040
 spectacular game team the truth that 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.410
 I really liked the coordination or 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.260
 brambila was adapted very played much better 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.820
 very well rivers and after 29 it gives you 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.040
 an important balance in the area of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.720
 dance and worry maybe the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.550
 Mexican soccer player you have to 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.040
 follow it closely to continue working 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.290
 already with us today he made a very game 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.760
 important and it's a cent for goal I 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.240
 I think it will make a difference 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.549
 we work inaugurating 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.280
 as we talk to him with me he plays the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.600
 that the one who trains the one who is well does not 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.970
 age very important by your name 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.130
 not the truth imagine the debut something very 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.479
 father that I have dreamed since I was a child 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.939
 Best of the best that you have the most 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.470
 important of my life from my career to 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.140
 my future 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.610
 the coach told him that very well 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.070
 to continue down that same path 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.560
 getting in and running and then thanks to 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.640
 God, we have to follow him, not yes, thanks to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.460
 God, if possible, could be written down but 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.830
 it is important to note for all 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.300
 all the forwards so you have to 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.979
 highlight also the situations that 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.340
 created the team so that we can 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.340
 mark
