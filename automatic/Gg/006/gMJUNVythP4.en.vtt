00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.110
 after a terrible avalanche near the 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.390
 field 1 carlos soria accompanied by 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.429
 have a little window and the sherpas return to 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.230
 base camp there because the abulense 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.179
 analyzes in the last days where 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.480
 they came to sleep in field 3 of the 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.480
 annapurna 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.930
 in others 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.100
 that yes we have lowered the first and 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.609
 slow 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.609
 how are you doing? 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:01.440
 we have seen pure wool these days it 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.440
 he has shown in all his power 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.590
 but it's okay I did not want to go up 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.869
 sleep this one did not go to the summit for the 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.490
 union suits us well 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:17.020
 this vegetable to know as always 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.020
 he liked it and he's already 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:37.880
 in the store was a scare and screams of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.500
 night is high the world half covered up your 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.729
 world came out half naked in the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.220
 hand boots come outside me 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.000
 I prefer the avalanche to leave without 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.240
 boots 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.240
 total record of putting on our boots 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.020
 an avalanche we come to a place 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.570
 great to do the camp and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.630
 had I followed the route first for a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 part of snow and then it became like 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.840
 passes and goes up 2 to 3 several times in 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.600
 an ice wall practically and not 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.640
 I did not seem to have fallen much 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.850
 but black enough as there has been 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.350
 chop a lot to put them then if you have 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.380
 spent the hillside 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.370
 when we arrived he said there I do not like that 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.720
 can double this morning we will go in the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.910
 galen is an avalanche that there has been a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.160
 strong snow shift because yesterday 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.560
 even though I've seen it said it was going to 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.780
 drop some cubes that years more than half 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.180
 Meter of snow half meters drop here 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.310
 fell more than a span star and in addition 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.810
 when it stopped snowing 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.410
 a wind 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.720
 Seeing me, efforts have changed all the 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.980
 that must follow the sites 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.260
 it seems that the Indians who would raise 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.569
 towards the summit and the others that we are 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.840
 decided to relax that there is not a 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.390
 absolutely infernal night 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.540
 that is the key it is cold without sleep 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.890
 bad postures a simplicity can not be 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.530
 rush the summit without having slept 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.430
 when you have two days left and also 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.620
 asleep more than that is that 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.060
 but I will raise later I do not 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.879
 I'm going to let go by an influence 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.829
 negative if people are encouraged to be 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:31.760
 anime I would cheer up 10.901 they were very 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.760
 comedy the day we left 2003 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:43.219
 but we'll talk about it later, it's worth it 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.219
 marta change, a mouse rests on each 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.219
 shoe 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.260
 and they have stained on the string but always 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.260
 it is a disaster
