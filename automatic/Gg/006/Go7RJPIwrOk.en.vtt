it<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.010> depends<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:39.239> tone<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649

where<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.210> no<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.230> three

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
where it's like no these are like three

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
where it's like no these are like three
scientific<00:00:56.160> experiments<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.940> now

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
scientific experiments that have now

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.430 
scientific experiments that have now
gone<00:00:57.390> amok<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.930> got<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> bring<00:00:58.260> these

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
gone amok and we got to bring these

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
gone amok and we got to bring these
things<00:00:58.649> down<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.100> also<00:00:59.280> wink<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.789> little<00:01:00.030> bit

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
things down but also wink a little bit

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
things down but also wink a little bit
at<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> camera<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.410> could

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
at the camera here and there that could

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650 
at the camera here and there that could
be<00:01:01.859> really<00:01:02.190> good<00:01:02.399> having<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> rock<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.480> there

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
be really good having the rock in there

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.090 
be really good having the rock in there
this<00:01:03.899> seems<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.409> type<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> film<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this seems like the type of film that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.440 
this seems like the type of film that
would<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.309> good<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.549> him<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> see<00:01:05.970> he<00:01:06.210> would<00:01:06.330> be

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
would be good for him to see he would be

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
would be good for him to see he would be
a<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:06.659> fridge<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.049> something<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.650> um

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
a good fridge for something like this um

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.240 
a good fridge for something like this um
so<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:09.420> once<00:01:09.780> again<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.560> hard<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> say

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
so it once again it's so hard to say

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
so it once again it's so hard to say
without<00:01:11.400> knowing<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> tone<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> try<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
without knowing the tone if you try to
go<00:01:12.869> pure<00:01:13.229> Godzilla<00:01:13.799> tone<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> dark

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640

Godzilla<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:37.409> any<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.650> those<00:01:37.829> guys<00:01:38.009> right<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
Godzilla or any of those guys right and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
Godzilla or any of those guys right and
I<00:01:38.610> think<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> rock<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.500> saw<00:01:40.680> him

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I think with the rock we just saw him

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.310 
I think with the rock we just saw him
lead<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> movie<00:01:41.850> about<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.689> things<00:01:43.020> getting

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
lead a movie about like things getting

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.600 
lead a movie about like things getting
destroyed<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:44.009> didn't<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
destroyed they didn't really have a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
destroyed they didn't really have a
story<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.240> that's<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:45.930> assume

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
story so that's what I'm gonna assume

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.370 
story so that's what I'm gonna assume
mean<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.890> gonna<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.640> yeah<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:48.960> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
mean this is gonna be and yeah I just I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
mean this is gonna be and yeah I just I
think<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> good<00:01:50.399> good<00:01:51.119> movie

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
think it's gonna be a good good movie

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.389 
think it's gonna be a good good movie
into<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:52.710> saying<00:01:52.979> about

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
into if they do what you're saying about

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.550 
into if they do what you're saying about
the<00:01:53.640> tone<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.720> they<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.049> Pacific

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the tone with like if they do a Pacific

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289 
the tone with like if they do a Pacific
Rim<00:01:55.770> type<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.159> thing<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.549> think<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.180> do

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
Rim type of thing I think they can do

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.330 
Rim type of thing I think they can do
well<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.229> better<00:01:58.439> analogy<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.189> there

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
well that's a better analogy and there

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.800 
well that's a better analogy and there
was<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> story<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> San<00:02:00.119> Andreas<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.689> was

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
was a story to San Andreas it was

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
was a story to San Andreas it was
Alexander<00:02:01.200> d'addario's<00:02:01.890> bikini<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.430> was

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
Alexander d'addario's bikini that was

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.550 
Alexander d'addario's bikini that was
the<00:02:02.640> story<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> movie<00:02:03.180> anyway<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:04.350> it's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the story the movie anyway I think it's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.980 
the story the movie anyway I think it's
a<00:02:04.649> great<00:02:04.890> idea<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.640> love<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.060> game<00:02:06.210> rampage<00:02:06.719> I

a great idea I love the game rampage I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.630 
a great idea I love the game rampage I
used<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> play<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.680> time<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.610> to

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

used to play it all the time I like to
be<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> ape<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.360> Godzilla<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.080> wolf<00:02:10.259> guy<00:02:10.440> was

be the ape or Godzilla the wolf guy was

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.479 
be the ape or Godzilla the wolf guy was
my<00:02:10.800> least<00:02:11.009> favorite

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
my least favorite

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.300 
my least favorite
but<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
but the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.589 
but the
the<00:02:12.430> best<00:02:12.849> thing<00:02:13.000> about<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.360> you're

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
the best thing about this is you're

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.390 
the best thing about this is you're
basically<00:02:14.170> destroying<00:02:14.709> buildings<00:02:15.010> and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
basically destroying buildings and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400 
basically destroying buildings and
eating<00:02:15.670> people<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.150> that's<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.780> entire<00:02:17.110> game

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
eating people and that's the entire game

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.229 
eating people and that's the entire game
you're<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.590> climbing<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.610> smashing

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
you're just climbing and smashing

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.760 
you're just climbing and smashing
buildings<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.870> punching<00:02:20.230> them<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.500> jumping

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
buildings and punching them and jumping

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.350 
buildings and punching them and jumping
from<00:02:20.890> building<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.250> building<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.760> that's<00:02:22.239> the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
from building a building and that's the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.500 
from building a building and that's the
whole<00:02:22.510> game<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.319> if<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:24.069> rock<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:25.180> of

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
whole game so if the rock is one of

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.479 
whole game so if the rock is one of
these<00:02:25.870> three<00:02:26.200> creatures<00:02:26.470> because<00:02:27.250> your<00:02:27.400> are

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
these three creatures because your are

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.220 
these three creatures because your are
that<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.060> know<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.270> get<00:02:28.510> transported<00:02:28.989> back

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
that you know you get transported back

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.170 
that you know you get transported back
you<00:02:29.410> turn<00:02:29.709> into<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.040> little<00:02:30.220> human<00:02:30.640> before<00:02:30.970> you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you turn into a little human before you

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.990 
you turn into a little human before you
die<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.750> I'm<00:02:32.349> imagining<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.400> could<00:02:33.819> see

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
die so I'm imagining that I could see

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.610 
die so I'm imagining that I could see
this<00:02:34.150> as<00:02:34.300> war<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.660> Gargantuas<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.470> have

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
this as war the Gargantuas and you have

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.009 
this as war the Gargantuas and you have
them<00:02:35.800> doing<00:02:36.340> suplex<00:02:37.000> jumps<00:02:37.510> off<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.660> buildings

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
them doing suplex jumps off of buildings

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.350 
them doing suplex jumps off of buildings
I<00:02:38.349> mean<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.530> could<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.830> have<00:02:39.069> three<00:02:39.670> characters

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
I mean you could I have three characters

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
I mean you could I have three characters
fighting<00:02:40.750> each<00:02:40.959> other<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.709> could<00:02:41.800> be<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> giant

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
fighting each other it could be a giant

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.220 
fighting each other it could be a giant
really<00:02:42.700> fun<00:02:42.940> film<00:02:43.209> see<00:02:43.599> that's<00:02:43.780> interesting

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
really fun film see that's interesting

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.890 
really fun film see that's interesting
is<00:02:44.319> my<00:02:44.860> assumption<00:02:45.310> has<00:02:45.670> been<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.480> rock<00:02:46.690> will

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
is my assumption has been the rock will

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.080 
is my assumption has been the rock will
be<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.230> hero<00:02:47.530> out<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.069> stop<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.549> monsters<00:02:48.970> but

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
be the hero out to stop the monsters but

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.910 
be the hero out to stop the monsters but
the<00:02:49.269> but<00:02:49.930> you're<00:02:50.049> right<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.319> mean<00:02:50.470> there<00:02:50.769> is<00:02:50.890> a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
the but you're right I mean there is a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.680 
the but you're right I mean there is a
possibility<00:02:51.370> here<00:02:51.640> he<00:02:51.790> could<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.239> one<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.600> them

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
possibility here he could be one of them

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.660 
possibility here he could be one of them
we<00:02:52.780> could<00:02:52.930> bring<00:02:53.110> two<00:02:53.319> other<00:02:53.560> big<00:02:53.920> action

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
we could bring two other big action

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.130 
we could bring two other big action
stars<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.450> they<00:02:55.510> transform<00:02:56.080> into

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
stars in and they transform into

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.710 
stars in and they transform into
monsters<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.709> just<00:02:56.860> destroy<00:02:57.549> cities<00:02:57.910> oh<00:02:58.330> my

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
monsters and just destroy cities oh my

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.190

action cousin crank T remember he was

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.309 
action cousin crank T remember he was
already<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.630> giant<00:03:05.080> version<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.500> themselves

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
already a giant version of themselves

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.960
