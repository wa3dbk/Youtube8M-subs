00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello to everyone if we meet 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.190
 with three new spoilers the future 1.8 and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.629
 also the 2 points 7.6 and good before 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.860
 it means that if we melt ott we isolate a 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.600
 bit weird is that I'm a little bit 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.920
 I'm very sorry but I had 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.080
 want to about this video and I'm 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.580
 recording it and well you have not said this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.830
 say that first after I'm going to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 teach about the 1.8 is the spoiler that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.770
 He put dinner bonus on his twitter 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.660
 Minecraft developer for everything 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.460
 He who does not know and well the first 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 image that he put on his twitter is this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.610
 that is seeing on screen that is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.040
 basically that is adding more 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.780
 information for the debut screen already 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.030
 you know that in the f 3 so we press efe 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 3 will make us the information that they are 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.600
 seeing on the screen both the fps that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.149
 you have in the america version in the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.399
 that you find the coordinates on 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.930
 biome etcetera and to the right what 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.790
 is implementing he is more information 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.680
 as you see if you point a block tells you 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.940
 what block is what is a door in 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.739
 question says if it's open is not 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 open in this case is closed by 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.600
 that says open says falls as closed 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.920
 it also tells you where it is pointing and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.180
 other is information that is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.130
 implementing for people who are 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.869
 dedicate to create maps because I have 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.620
 information that block is putting 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.980
 and where 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.330
 stretching any 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.770
 use that can be given to this 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.090
 information also put the following 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.060
 image and in this case it is with a forgiveness 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.320
 bone powder restored and as you can see 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.360
 the right thinks about the block that is 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.920
 rest in dice says where is 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.780
 pointing to the north towards the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.130
 east to west like the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.840
 power that has that powder in question 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.030
 as we see to be sense and has a 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.470
 power of 13 as I say this 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.120
 information is lost to people who are 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.560
 dedicate to create adventure maps or 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.930
 any type of map 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.790
 matt baker and it's pretty good I think 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.070
 that this will help people a lot 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.470
 that is dedicated to it and you will see how 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.940
 these coordinates will be used and this 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.740
 information because this is only the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.810
 image and you'll see how it stays 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.790
 final and good seconds then read good 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.290
 the third spoiler better said good 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.730
 this really is considered a spoiler 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.930
 They are two photos but well I said to the 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.420
 principle three spoiler but good 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.460
 let's leave it in two spoiler the next 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.080
 spoiler extracted by seeger which is another 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.240
 developer of minecraft and has 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.190
 informed that the 1.8 will have changes 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.810
 in survival that is very important there 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.160
 that know what the water point is going to be 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.900
 rather changes in the south saw in the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.790
 part of everything that we have brought this 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.350
 week to back there have been many 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.150
 changes especially for the most makers 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.970
 like road 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.799
 there has been a big change in the code 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.590
 but the two points 7.6 instead it's going to 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.329
 implement the uv and I'll explain 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.950
 what and the ski change a new 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.290
 ski system that already explained in others 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.909
 videos that basically more complicated 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.439
 than the previous skin skin system 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.230
 but what improves is who allows 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.329
 establish better design in our skin 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.099
 3d skin is to say if you have a jacket 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.170
 so have a low top blouse 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.720
 of your skin another jacket as it is a 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.519
 deep tone we'll see how this 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.739
 skin system has already been tested and 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.780
 It's pretty cool and good about the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.129
 flight is basically a system of 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.010
 record inside minecraft so 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.530
 say it every user user as you want 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.709
 call will have your ideas a code by 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.120
 so to say it and for example if you want 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.109
 be a server you can get a 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.519
 server with another name 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.500
 this is the name change system 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.819
 that I already explained other videos also and 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.980
 Go back server because have for 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.500
 example, my name is minecraft 2 or 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.730
 youtube and you receive another server from 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.099
 Incognito form I'm going to call 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.139
 suddenly blue is the daddy I know 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.750
 why to say something we go but 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.849
 I will continue to be bleu of fame and you because 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.780
 my original name and without server 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.100
 I'm going 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.720
 Well, as much as I changed my name 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.760
 I will always be that way 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.590
 server that is to say the one of always 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.390
 will log once I entered the server 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.130
 then you can change the name that 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.690
 but of course if you want it to 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.610
 theme I read with any name through 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.110
 of what I change is basically that's a 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.080
 security system so to speak 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.150
 to help some some people 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.580
 so to speak he likes to play in 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.500
 servers also and for being so 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.330
 say the famous ones within youtube not 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.489
 they can play easily because of that 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.230
 that suddenly they see who that person is 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.150
 famous on youtube and starts to annoy you 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.620
 between the server and with this system what 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.420
 what is avoided is that you put on another 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.670
 name you do not know what are you after 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.510
 put others who also suppose and so 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.970
 which, so to speak, camouflages you and that's it 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.190
 the wii system is for a record 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.600
 universal for each person they receive 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.209
 all servers in the entire system 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.010
 minecraft but logically if you go in 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.049
 a server you will not be able to tarnish by 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.700
 much that you change the name and good 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.580
 nothing more guys tomorrow day safe Thursday 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.490
 that the nation leaves the 14 w 10a to see what 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.500
 it brings us, many changes may already be 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.640
 you will see it will look the same if you liked the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.470
 video thank you very much for your like and 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.510

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.770
 practicing without you I know but I do not feel 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.170
 a lot had to record the video had 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.150
 a lot of enthusiasm and support 56 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.530
 more until circumstances that I am 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.960
 I really like to talk to oneself 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.910
 but he tried and nothing else 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.530
