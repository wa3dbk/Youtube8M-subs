always saying the same exact thing that

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.799 
always saying the same exact thing that
it's<00:00:41.929> really<00:00:42.289> difficult<00:00:42.499> to<00:00:43.489> pick<00:00:44.210> one<00:00:44.420> tattoo

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
it's really difficult to pick one tattoo

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.860 
it's really difficult to pick one tattoo
that<00:00:45.079> we<00:00:45.320> love<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.679> most<00:00:45.890> because<00:00:46.870> they're

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
that we love the most because they're

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.380 
that we love the most because they're
all<00:00:48.109> like<00:00:48.440> all<00:00:48.649> my<00:00:48.980> tattoos<00:00:49.550> have<00:00:50.359> a

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
all like all my tattoos have a

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.630 
all like all my tattoos have a
significant<00:00:51.199> meaning<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.890> I<00:00:52.129> think<00:00:52.519> most

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
significant meaning and I think most

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.729 
significant meaning and I think most
people's<00:00:53.059> tattoos<00:00:53.479> like<00:00:53.690> do<00:00:53.899> but<00:00:54.229> I<00:00:54.260> mean<00:00:54.530> some

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
people's tattoos like do but I mean some

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.669 
people's tattoos like do but I mean some
people<00:00:54.979> just<00:00:55.190> get<00:00:55.339> random<00:00:55.699> tattoos<00:00:56.089> but<00:00:56.679> every

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
people just get random tattoos but every

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.410 
people just get random tattoos but every
single<00:00:57.979> one<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.129> my<00:00:58.219> tattoos<00:00:58.699> mean<00:00:59.059> something

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
single one of my tattoos mean something

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.110 
single one of my tattoos mean something
really<00:00:59.809> really<00:00:59.960> important<00:01:00.649> has<00:01:01.159> multiple

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
really really important has multiple

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.439 
really really important has multiple
meanings<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.749> it<00:01:03.729> but<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:04.760> probably<00:01:05.150> would<00:01:05.360> have

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
meanings to it but I probably would have

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.850 
meanings to it but I probably would have
to<00:01:05.630> say<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.870> one<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.380> have<00:01:06.590> right<00:01:06.799> here
