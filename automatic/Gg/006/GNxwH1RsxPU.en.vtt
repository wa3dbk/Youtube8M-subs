00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
know I'm going to let it cook again and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.559 
know I'm going to let it cook again and
covered<00:03:28.829> for<00:03:29.159> about<00:03:29.250> two<00:03:29.909> to<00:03:30.209> three<00:03:30.329> minutes

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
covered for about two to three minutes

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.220 
covered for about two to three minutes
just<00:03:31.439> so<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.799> some<00:03:32.189> of<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.489> water

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
just so that some of this water

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.420 
just so that some of this water
evaporates<00:03:34.230> because<00:03:34.620> next<00:03:34.920> we<00:03:35.040> are<00:03:35.069> going<00:03:35.159> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
evaporates because next we are going to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.240 
evaporates because next we are going to
add<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.819> coconut<00:03:36.030> mixture<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.980> just

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
add the coconut mixture to it and I just

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.339 
add the coconut mixture to it and I just
don't<00:03:38.430> want<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:38.909> be<00:03:39.090> too<00:03:39.120> watery<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:40.200> I'm

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
don't want it to be too watery so I'm

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.349 
don't want it to be too watery so I'm
letting<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.889> water<00:03:41.040> evaporate<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.819> little<00:03:42.209> bit

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
letting the water evaporate a little bit

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.690 
letting the water evaporate a little bit
so<00:03:42.870> about<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.290> would<00:03:43.590> say<00:03:43.709> 20<00:03:44.099> minutes<00:03:44.459> or<00:03:44.669> so

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
so about I would say 20 minutes or so

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.789 
so about I would say 20 minutes or so
let<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.900> has<00:03:46.079> been<00:03:46.319> simmering<00:03:46.620> for

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
let it so it has been simmering for

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.149 
let it so it has been simmering for
