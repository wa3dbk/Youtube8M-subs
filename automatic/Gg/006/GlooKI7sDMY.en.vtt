00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.550 
bodywork is that it has a belly pan
which<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.159> catch<00:01:47.400> all<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> fluids<00:01:49.350> if

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
which will catch all of the fluids if

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560 
which will catch all of the fluids if
something<00:01:50.040> were<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.190> happen<00:01:50.340> while<00:01:51.240> you're<00:01:51.420> on

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
something were to happen while you're on

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.850 
something were to happen while you're on
the<00:01:51.720> track<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> way<00:01:52.470> you're<00:01:52.620> not<00:01:52.650> going

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the track and that way you're not going

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.350 
the track and that way you're not going
to<00:01:52.950> spill<00:01:53.159> any<00:01:53.310> fluids<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.790> track<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
to spill any fluids on the track and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.690 
to spill any fluids on the track and
cause<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> problem<00:01:54.930> when<00:01:55.290> you're<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.500> there

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
cause a problem when you're out there

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.080 
cause a problem when you're out there
and<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.890> much<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.280> affordable<00:01:59.729> option

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and it is much more affordable option

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.630 
and it is much more affordable option
and<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.540> don't<00:02:00.720> need<00:02:00.900> be<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.190> lights<00:02:02.400> or

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and you don't need be the lights or

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.250 
and you don't need be the lights or
anything<00:02:02.790> else<00:02:03.030> anyway<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.720> just<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.140> rid

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
anything else anyway so you just get rid

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.860 
anything else anyway so you just get rid
of<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> another<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.720> race

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
of that so another thing about the race

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.899 
of that so another thing about the race
bodywork<00:02:07.290> too<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:08.190> pretty<00:02:08.340> easy<00:02:08.549> to<00:02:08.700> take

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
bodywork too is it's pretty easy to take

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.080 
bodywork too is it's pretty easy to take
off<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.019> can<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.799> also<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.849> quick
