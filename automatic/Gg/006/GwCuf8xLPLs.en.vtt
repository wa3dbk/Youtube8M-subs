I would say we have loads of notebooks
somewhere<00:00:17.500> in<00:00:17.770> the<00:00:18.010> basement<00:00:18.580> or<00:00:18.789> something

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
somewhere in the basement or something

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.290 
somewhere in the basement or something
which<00:00:20.050> are<00:00:20.290> notebooks<00:00:20.920> full<00:00:21.370> of<00:00:21.760> Joseph's

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.390 
which are notebooks full of Joseph's
drawings<00:00:22.720> they<00:00:22.990> weren't<00:00:23.380> always<00:00:23.830> close<00:00:24.130> but<00:00:24.370> a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
drawings they weren't always close but a

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.350 
drawings they weren't always close but a
lot<00:00:24.640> of<00:00:24.670> them<00:00:24.970> were<00:00:25.210> close<00:00:25.600> and<00:00:26.020> they<00:00:26.530> actually

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
lot of them were close and they actually

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.280 
lot of them were close and they actually
probably<00:00:28.380> started<00:00:29.970> maybe<00:00:30.970> around<00:00:31.290> eight

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
probably started maybe around eight

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.250 
probably started maybe around eight
years<00:00:32.619> old<00:00:33.129> nine<00:00:33.340> years<00:00:33.579> old<00:00:33.790> ten<00:00:34.260> something

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
years old nine years old ten something

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.660 
years old nine years old ten something
like<00:00:35.379> that<00:00:35.559> when<00:00:35.739> you<00:00:35.860> really<00:00:36.129> got<00:00:36.309> into<00:00:36.489> the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
like that when you really got into the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.060 
like that when you really got into the
Bell<00:00:36.820> egg<00:00:37.030> thing<00:00:37.359> my<00:00:38.260> designing<00:00:38.769> is<00:00:38.859> very

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
Bell egg thing my designing is very

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.849 
Bell egg thing my designing is very
drawing<00:00:39.429> based<00:00:39.730> at<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.329> beginning<00:00:40.780> so<00:00:41.499> I<00:00:41.530> draw

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
drawing based at the beginning so I draw

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.959 
drawing based at the beginning so I draw
for<00:00:42.159> like<00:00:42.309> five<00:00:42.579> to<00:00:42.789> six<00:00:43.030> weeks<00:00:43.149> and<00:00:43.690> then<00:00:44.969> we

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
for like five to six weeks and then we

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.790 
for like five to six weeks and then we
moved<00:00:46.239> in<00:00:46.420> when<00:00:46.899> you<00:00:47.019> move<00:00:47.260> into<00:00:47.440> three

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
moved in when you move into three

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.770 
moved in when you move into three
dimensional<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:50.079> know<00:00:50.199> tailoring<00:00:51.010> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
dimensional you know tailoring and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.469 
dimensional you know tailoring and
draping<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.399> you<00:00:54.909> kind<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.149> go<00:00:55.359> from

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
draping and and you kind of go from

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.410 
draping and and you kind of go from
there<00:00:55.749> and<00:00:55.809> usually<00:00:56.440> it<00:00:56.530> does<00:00:56.800> change<00:00:57.420> when

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
there and usually it does change when

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.340 
there and usually it does change when
you<00:00:58.600> start<00:00:58.929> fitting<00:00:59.199> so<00:01:00.159> when<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:00.489> was<00:01:01.319> when<00:01:02.319> I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
you start fitting so when I was when I

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.809 
you start fitting so when I was when I
started<00:01:02.649> developing<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.370> collection

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
started developing the collection

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.640 
started developing the collection
actually<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.239> first<00:01:04.570> piece<00:01:04.839> I<00:01:04.989> design<00:01:05.379> was

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
actually the first piece I design was

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
actually the first piece I design was
this<00:01:05.830> one<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> lot<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.900> it<00:01:08.049> had<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.259> do<00:01:08.590> with

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
this one so a lot of it had to do with

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.880 
this one so a lot of it had to do with
how<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:09.729> dressed<00:01:10.329> for<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.990> city<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.860> the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
how you dressed for the city and in the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.459 
how you dressed for the city and in the
city<00:01:12.219> and<00:01:12.640> so<00:01:13.570> there<00:01:13.780> was<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:13.990> idea<00:01:14.170> of

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
city and so there was this idea of

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.609 
city and so there was this idea of
backpacks<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:16.829> sport<00:01:17.829> as<00:01:18.009> well<00:01:18.219> that<00:01:18.880> started

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
backpacks of sport as well that started

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.100 
backpacks of sport as well that started
to<00:01:20.619> be<00:01:20.649> developed<00:01:21.310> through<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.880> process<00:01:22.450> look

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
to be developed through the process look

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.109 
to be developed through the process look
I<00:01:23.259> didn't<00:01:23.770> go<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:23.950> fashion<00:01:24.340> school<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:25.090> I

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
I didn't go to fashion school so I

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.810 
I didn't go to fashion school so I
worked<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.689> worked<00:01:26.020> at<00:01:26.320> Marc<00:01:26.770> Jacobs<00:01:27.219> and<00:01:27.490> then

collection the idea of I think of nature
was<00:02:17.190> also<00:02:17.489> really<00:02:18.200> interesting<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.769> way

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
was also really interesting and the way

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.670 
was also really interesting and the way
that<00:02:20.459> kind<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.420> city<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:24.690> related<00:02:25.530> to

that kind of the city is related to

nature or how they view nature and so it

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.990 
nature or how they view nature and so it
came<00:02:30.540> into<00:02:31.110> play<00:02:31.769> really<00:02:32.310> when<00:02:32.489> we<00:02:32.640> started

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
came into play really when we started

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.640 
came into play really when we started
looking<00:02:33.120> at<00:02:33.450> Hawaiian<00:02:33.959> shirts

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650

I think there's been kind of an

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.530 
I think there's been kind of an
interesting<00:02:39.440> renewal<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.430> as<00:02:42.090> well<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.510> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
interesting renewal and and as well as a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.350 
interesting renewal and and as well as a
kind<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.380> shift<00:02:43.730> generational<00:02:44.730> shift<00:02:45.030> in

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
kind of shift generational shift in

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
print within kind of more of a I guess

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.520 
print within kind of more of a I guess
more<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.280> cultural<00:03:32.730> value<00:03:33.200> was<00:03:34.200> really

more of a cultural value was really

more of a cultural value was really
interesting<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.280> me<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:36.359> lot<00:03:36.389> of<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.959> had<00:03:37.230> to

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
interesting to me and a lot of it had to

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.450 
interesting to me and a lot of it had to
do<00:03:37.680> we

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
do we

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.980 
do we
kind<00:03:39.460> of<00:03:39.640> these<00:03:39.940> sports<00:03:40.270> that<00:03:40.630> were<00:03:40.780> very

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
kind of these sports that were very

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.190 
kind of these sports that were very
aggressive<00:03:41.640> but<00:03:42.640> also<00:03:42.820> where<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.810> needed<00:03:44.140> a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
aggressive but also where you needed a

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.420 
aggressive but also where you needed a
lot<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.380> protective<00:03:45.190> gear<00:03:46.800> well<00:03:47.800> I<00:03:47.830> think<00:03:47.950> she

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
lot of protective gear well I think she

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.180 
lot of protective gear well I think she
helps<00:03:48.820> me<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.870> know<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.110> same<00:03:50.350> way<00:03:50.530> any<00:03:50.800> kind

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
helps me you know the same way any kind

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.550 
helps me you know the same way any kind
of<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:52.000> know<00:03:52.030> business<00:03:52.720> support<00:03:53.230> would

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
of you know business support would

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.200 
of you know business support would
ultimately<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.470> happens<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.130> she's<00:03:58.000> my

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
ultimately it so happens that she's my

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.300 
ultimately it so happens that she's my
mother<00:03:58.450> but<00:03:59.200> there<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.980> know<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.160> think

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
mother but there is you know I think

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.510 
mother but there is you know I think
that<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.410> mean<00:04:02.710> I<00:04:02.740> would<00:04:02.980> say<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
that the I mean I would say that the

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.900 
that the I mean I would say that the
support<00:04:03.970> itself<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.690> is<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:06.430> know<00:04:06.460> it's<00:04:06.790> a

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
support itself is is you know it's a

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.690 
support itself is is you know it's a
very<00:04:07.150> collaborative<00:04:08.020> effort<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.340> when<00:04:09.550> we

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
very collaborative effort and when we

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.760 
very collaborative effort and when we
started<00:04:10.320> basically<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.800> two<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.130> us<00:04:12.280> together

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
started basically the two of us together

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.050 
started basically the two of us together
except<00:04:14.770> I<00:04:14.890> was<00:04:15.070> an<00:04:15.220> intern<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:17.200> think<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.459> the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
except I was an intern I think the the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.870 
except I was an intern I think the the
challenge<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.660> really<00:04:19.900> finding<00:04:20.650> pieces<00:04:21.489> which

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
challenge is really finding pieces which

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.960 
challenge is really finding pieces which
women<00:04:22.210> will<00:04:22.420> want<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.990> wear<00:04:23.580> but<00:04:24.580> that<00:04:24.640> they'll

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
women will want to wear but that they'll

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.940 
women will want to wear but that they'll
be<00:04:25.150> able<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.420> incorporate<00:04:26.230> with<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.740> much

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
be able to incorporate with the much

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.010 
be able to incorporate with the much
lighter<00:04:27.280> pieces<00:04:27.580> in<00:04:27.910> their<00:04:28.120> wardrobe<00:04:28.570> because

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
lighter pieces in their wardrobe because

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.370 
lighter pieces in their wardrobe because
we<00:04:29.320> do<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:30.370> know<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.520> think<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:31.330> think<00:04:32.260> what

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
we do you know I think I think what

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.760 
we do you know I think I think what
really<00:04:32.560> interests<00:04:33.070> me<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:34.410> designing<00:04:35.410> things

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
really interests me is designing things

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.960 
really interests me is designing things
that<00:04:35.920> women<00:04:36.040> don't<00:04:36.340> have<00:04:36.640> in<00:04:36.790> their<00:04:36.910> wardrobe

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
that women don't have in their wardrobe

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.750 
that women don't have in their wardrobe
already
