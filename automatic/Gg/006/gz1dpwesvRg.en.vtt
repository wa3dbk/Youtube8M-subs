00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I go through them but so the three game

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
I go through them but so the three game
types<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.510> blitz<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.260> told<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
types are going to be blitz I told you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.360 
types are going to be blitz I told you
so<00:00:47.600> domination<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.989> search<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> destroy<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
so domination and search and destroy and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.920 
so domination and search and destroy and
so<00:00:50.610> these<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:50.969> basically<00:00:51.390> i<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> was

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so these are basically i think it was

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.110 
so these are basically i think it was
golden<00:00:52.320> boy<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:53.039> predicted<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
golden boy that predicted this and this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.610 
golden boy that predicted this and this
is<00:00:54.270> exactly<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:54.809> he<00:00:54.930> said<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.440> like

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
is exactly what he said it would be like

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.069 
is exactly what he said it would be like
two<00:00:55.890> weeks<00:00:56.070> ago<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.420> agreed<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.719> him<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
two weeks ago and I agreed with him I

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
two weeks ago and I agreed with him I
didn't<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.440> search<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.010> rescue<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.460> going

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
didn't think search and rescue was going

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.740 
didn't think search and rescue was going
to<00:00:59.640> make<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> cut<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.390> search<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
to make the cut because search and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.090 
to make the cut because search and
destroy<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.500> sure<00:01:01.649> gonna<00:01:01.770> make<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
destroy it was for sure gonna make the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.640 
destroy it was for sure gonna make the
cut<00:01:02.280> interestingly<00:01:03.270> enough<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.110> maps<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
cut interestingly enough the maps that

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.969 
cut interestingly enough the maps that
they're<00:01:04.799> playing<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.470> same<00:01:07.740> five

watched<00:01:45.030> competitive<00:01:45.869> call<00:01:46.020> duty<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.439> back

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
watched competitive call duty way back

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.580 
watched competitive call duty way back
in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.890> black<00:01:47.100> ops<00:01:47.369> 1<00:01:47.460> days<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:49.200> might

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
in the black ops 1 days you might

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.210 
in the black ops 1 days you might
remember<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:50.250> Puckett<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.950> Cory<00:01:52.950> done

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
remember like Puckett and Cory done

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.240 
remember like Puckett and Cory done
being<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.729> Kappa<00:01:54.329> casters<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.979> used<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
being the Kappa casters they used to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.969 
being the Kappa casters they used to
have<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> add<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.630> score<00:01:57.990> while<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.799> game

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
have to add up the score while the game

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.350 
have to add up the score while the game
was<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.000> would<00:02:00.180> know

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
was going on and so they would know

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
was going on and so they would know
almost<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.020> hard<00:02:01.290> point<00:02:01.530> when<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.280> going

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
almost like hard point when it was going

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.399 
almost like hard point when it was going
to<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.780> mathematically<00:02:03.780> impossible<00:02:03.899> for

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
to be mathematically impossible for

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.709 
to be mathematically impossible for
another<00:02:04.890> team<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.130> win<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:06.060> did<00:02:06.270> make<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.479> more

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
another team to win it did make it more

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.119 
another team to win it did make it more
exciting<00:02:07.020> doing<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.680> way<00:02:07.710> though<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
exciting doing it that way though and

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.199 
exciting doing it that way though and
you<00:02:08.220> always<00:02:08.340> had<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> chance<00:02:08.849> when<00:02:09.119> they

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
you always had a chance when they

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.710 
you always had a chance when they
switched<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.459> maybe<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:12.270> may

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
switched it like that so maybe they may

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
switched it like that so maybe they may
be<00:02:12.780> infinity<00:02:13.230> word<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.590> do

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
be infinity word can do

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.920 
be infinity word can do
what<00:02:14.130> they<00:02:14.670> did<00:02:14.850> on<00:02:14.880> black<00:02:15.180> ops<00:02:15.360> 2<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.780> just

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
what they did on black ops 2 and just

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.140 
what they did on black ops 2 and just
make<00:02:16.110> two<00:02:16.350> rounds<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.430> land<00:02:17.640> settings<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
make two rounds in the land settings I

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.460 
make two rounds in the land settings I
don't<00:02:18.300> know<00:02:18.390> they<00:02:18.930> said<00:02:19.110> there's<00:02:19.260> going<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.440> be

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
don't know they said there's going to be

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.960 
don't know they said there's going to be
some<00:02:19.740> kind<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.920> an<00:02:20.040> update<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.760> think

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
some kind of an update but I think

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.370 
some kind of an update but I think
they've<00:02:21.090> been<00:02:21.240> waiting<00:02:21.570> for<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.840> rule<00:02:22.110> set

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
they've been waiting for this rule set

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.470 
they've been waiting for this rule set
to<00:02:22.560> exist<00:02:23.010> before<00:02:23.580> they<00:02:23.850> could<00:02:23.910> create<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
to exist before they could create the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.440 
to exist before they could create the
update<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.700> domination<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.880> blitz<00:02:27.240> are

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
update and so domination and blitz are

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.470 
update and so domination and blitz are
going<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.840> freight<00:02:28.430> octane<00:02:29.480> sovereign

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
going to be on freight octane sovereign

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.530 
going to be on freight octane sovereign
strike<00:02:31.230> zone<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.800> warhawk<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.420> know

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
strike zone and warhawk and so I know

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.970 
strike zone and warhawk and so I know
right<00:02:33.810> now<00:02:33.960> some<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.290> guys<00:02:34.380> might<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.650> like

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.730 
right now some of you guys might be like
I<00:02:35.190> don't<00:02:35.220> know<00:02:35.430> what<00:02:35.700> maps<00:02:35.970> those<00:02:36.210> are<00:02:36.740> but

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
I don't know what maps those are but

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.340 
I don't know what maps those are but
just<00:02:38.460> when<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.690> back<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:39.900> look<00:02:40.140> at<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
just when you go back and look at the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.900 
just when you go back and look at the
map<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.770> want<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:40.980> guys<00:02:41.100> let<00:02:41.400> me<00:02:41.430> know<00:02:41.550> what

map so I want you guys let me know what

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.600 
map so I want you guys let me know what
you<00:02:42.030> think<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.420> know<00:02:42.480> Freight<00:02:43.190> octane<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.460> mean

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
you think I know Freight octane I mean

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.400 
you think I know Freight octane I mean
all<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:44.910> these<00:02:45.180> strike<00:02:45.510> zone<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.930> definitely<00:02:46.380> a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
all of these strike zone is definitely a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.680 
all of these strike zone is definitely a
competitive<00:02:46.920> map<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.850> think<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.330> maps<00:02:48.510> they

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
competitive map I think the maps they

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.150 
competitive map I think the maps they
picked<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.020> really<00:02:49.200> good<00:02:49.500> these<00:02:49.710> are<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.950> 5

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
picked a really good these are the 5

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.030 
picked a really good these are the 5
best<00:02:50.550> maps<00:02:50.850> for<00:02:51.750> competitive<00:02:52.470> call<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.770> duty

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
best maps for competitive call of duty

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.740 
best maps for competitive call of duty
in<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.460> game<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.880> my<00:02:54.060> mind<00:02:54.300> if<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.570> guys<00:02:54.720> think

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
in the game in my mind if you guys think

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.690 
in the game in my mind if you guys think
another<00:02:55.140> map<00:02:55.710> should<00:02:55.920> be<00:02:56.040> added<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.550> there

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
another map should be added in there

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.100 
another map should be added in there
like<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.750> are<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.310> fan<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.630> gigantic<00:03:00.630> open

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
like you just are a fan of gigantic open

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.560 
like you just are a fan of gigantic open
castle<00:03:01.590> scenes<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.190> want<00:03:02.480> stonehaven<00:03:03.480> to

castle scenes and you want stonehaven to

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.720 
castle scenes and you want stonehaven to
make<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.930> dubs<00:03:04.260> don't<00:03:04.770> even<00:03:05.010> did<00:03:05.160> not<00:03:05.310> make<00:03:05.550> it

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
make it dubs don't even did not make it

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.590 
make it dubs don't even did not make it
and<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.570> two<00:03:06.780> things<00:03:07.110> they<00:03:07.260> banned<00:03:07.710> actually

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
and the two things they banned actually

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.990 
and the two things they banned actually
so<00:03:09.600> far<00:03:09.870> are<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.830> riot<00:03:11.040> shield<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.580> overkill

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
so far are the riot shield and overkill

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640 
so far are the riot shield and overkill
and<00:03:12.150> some<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.480> guys<00:03:12.600> may<00:03:12.840> know<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.230> today

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
and some of you guys may know that today

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.370 
and some of you guys may know that today
right<00:03:13.980> now<00:03:14.010> they<00:03:14.850> are<00:03:15.030> testing<00:03:15.360> playing<00:03:16.170> with

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
right now they are testing playing with

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.960 
right now they are testing playing with
kill<00:03:16.590> streaks<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.070> don't<00:03:17.400> think<00:03:17.580> kill<00:03:17.760> streaks

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
kill streaks I don't think kill streaks

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.540 
kill streaks I don't think kill streaks
are<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> make<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.890> actually<00:03:19.890> someone

but I think they're going to end up

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.430 
but I think they're going to end up
banning<00:03:54.600> killstreaks<00:03:55.020> I<00:03:55.110> don't<00:03:55.290> think

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
banning killstreaks I don't think

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.420

they're<00:03:55.530> going<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.680> be<00:03:55.830> in<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.070> tournament
