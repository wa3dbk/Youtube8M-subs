00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:15.709
 and we are good chips and we 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.260
 We dedicate to make sweets buffet for 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.570
 weddings and events we are for the first time 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.230
 at the wedding fair that organizes the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.190
 hotel will love square and well then we give a 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.350
 touch of color and originality to the wedding 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.059
 and we are doing something a little bit 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 different so that the boyfriends also 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.020
 have something different to offer their 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:43.579
 guests and especially so that the 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:45.950
 can surprise a little bit of the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.600
 service that we offer more or the one 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.270
 more people like are the buffet 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.820
 of sweets for weddings we have different 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.950
 formats we have a designed buffet that 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.410
 we call explosion of color that is 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.969
 spectacular and you will see then we have 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.829
 also another that we call buffet 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.060
 elaborate that has a cake of sweets 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.280
 four-story 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.620
 and a little bit we play depending on what 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.500
 that the boyfriends want we offer those 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.940
 two types of buffet as something standard 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.260
 but then depending on the idea that 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.650
 they have we can customize them 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.930
 There are those who tell me to go to Nagore 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.910
 we want this that we see in the photo but 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.800
 We really like black licorice 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.720
 they like very much the prosistas of pica pica 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.150
 and as we elaborate everything in the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.250
 moment the same week of the wedding and 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.370
 taking into account the taste of the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.840
 boyfriends then we can customize it and the 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.270
 truth is that it's something you 're liking 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.140
 much 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.140
 bye 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.530
 actually the first buffet that we put 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.370
 for a wedding I remember that we 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.410
 came the waitresses who asked us 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.960
 what's up with this ball there are many children 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.300
 In this fashion, not the most 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.610
 we eat sweets at a wedding at least 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.550
 we are the elders we love to catch 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.560
 our little glass and suddenly it's like 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.350
 we go back to childhood we are again 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.570
 children and we have a table in front of us 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.810
 full of sweets and we go crazy 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.520
 joy in sweets and we worry or 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.650
 we give the option that the day of the wedding 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.650
 be an especially sweet day 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.489
 note 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.489
