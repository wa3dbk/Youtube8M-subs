have not gotten any bounties that I
really<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.379> quote<00:01:04.860> unquote<00:01:04.949> harder<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
really think or quote unquote harder I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.370 
really think or quote unquote harder I
would<00:01:06.360> say<00:01:06.570> they're<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> only

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
would say they're really the only

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
would say they're really the only
difference<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.400> are<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.850> time

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
difference is they are more time

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.780

consuming<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.780> somewhat<00:01:10.619> more<00:01:10.770> boring<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
consuming and somewhat more boring the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.600 
consuming and somewhat more boring the
the<00:01:12.299> hardest<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.310> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the hardest one that I got you know so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.789 
the hardest one that I got you know so
to<00:01:14.670> speak<00:01:14.939> anyway<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.869> having<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> kill<00:01:16.590> 200

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to speak anyway was having to kill 200

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.249 
to speak anyway was having to kill 200
fallen<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.549> headshots<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.259> obviously

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
fallen with headshots and obviously

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.450 
fallen with headshots and obviously
that's<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.560> something<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.009> legitimately

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that's not something that's legitimately

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.499 
that's not something that's legitimately
difficult<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.240> something<00:01:21.479> that's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
difficult it's just something that's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.899 
difficult it's just something that's
time<00:01:21.840> consuming<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.580> hopefully<00:01:23.580> they

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
time consuming so hopefully they

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.490 
time consuming so hopefully they
actually<00:01:24.270> end<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.479> coming<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:24.900> values<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
actually end up coming out values that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.840 
actually end up coming out values that
are<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.740> difficult<00:01:26.250> because<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.640> would<00:01:26.759> be

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
are more difficult because that would be

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.980 
are more difficult because that would be
something<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.180> would<00:01:27.330> make<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.750> more

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
something that would make this more

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.840 
something that would make this more

game prior to this update I'm not sure

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.949 
game prior to this update I'm not sure
if<00:03:27.640> you're<00:03:27.790> guaranteed<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:28.510> get<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.690> piece<00:03:28.930> of

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
gear or not I would like to think that

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.819 
gear or not I would like to think that
you<00:03:31.540> could<00:03:31.660> at<00:03:31.810> least<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:32.140> guaranteed<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.650> piece

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
you could at least be guaranteed a piece

you could at least be guaranteed a piece
of<00:03:32.859> rare<00:03:33.190> gear<00:03:33.519> because<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.209> not<00:03:34.359> that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
of rare gear because it's not that

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.630 
of rare gear because it's not that
amazing<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.500> as<00:03:35.620> far<00:03:35.799> as<00:03:35.859> legendary<00:03:36.310> goes

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
amazing but as far as legendary goes

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.160 
amazing but as far as legendary goes
it's<00:03:37.000> unlikely<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.540> you're<00:03:37.810> actually<00:03:37.930> going

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
it's unlikely that you're actually going

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.660 
it's unlikely that you're actually going
to<00:03:38.260> be<00:03:38.290> guaranteed<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.950> piece<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.250> legendary
