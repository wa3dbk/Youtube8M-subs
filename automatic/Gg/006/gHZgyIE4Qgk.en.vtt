00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
spotlight function so all these
different<00:01:29.700> keys<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.990> said<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
different keys up here like I said a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.719 
different keys up here like I said a
look<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:31.590> very<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:32.130> similar<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
look that's very very similar to the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.960 
look that's very very similar to the
apple<00:01:33.180> keyboard<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.200> looking<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:35.820> see

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
apple keyboard so looking back you see

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
apple keyboard so looking back you see
it's<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.119> rounded<00:01:36.540> up<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.930> flat<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it's not rounded up here it is flat this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.440 
it's not rounded up here it is flat this
is<00:01:37.710> sort<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> wired<00:01:39.210> one

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
is sort of like I think the wired one

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.300 
is sort of like I think the wired one
where<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.439> these<00:01:40.680> would<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.009> USB

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
where I think these would be like USB

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
where I think these would be like USB
ports<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:41.850> something<00:01:42.210> has<00:01:42.659> sort<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.020> more<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
ports or something has sort of more that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.929 
ports or something has sort of more that
look<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.829> rather<00:01:43.979> than<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.369> bluetooth<00:01:44.759> lon

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
look to it rather than the bluetooth lon

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.969 
look to it rather than the bluetooth lon
roads<00:01:45.149> rounded<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> is

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
roads rounded but as you can see it is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.490 
roads rounded but as you can see it is
very<00:01:47.040> thin<00:01:47.670> indeed<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.810> believe<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.290> takes

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
very thin indeed and I believe it takes

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.940 
very thin indeed and I believe it takes
like<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:50.220> triple<00:01:50.820> A's<00:01:51.500> yeah<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.619> looks<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> be

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
like two triple A's yeah it looks to be

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.510 
like two triple A's yeah it looks to be
to<00:01:53.820> triple-a<00:01:54.390> batteries<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> can

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
to triple-a batteries here so as you can

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
to triple-a batteries here so as you can
see<00:01:56.670> there's<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.149> also<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> power<00:01:57.930> switch<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
see there's a also a power switch on and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.590 
see there's a also a power switch on and
off<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.460> connect<00:01:59.820> button<00:02:00.030> bluetooth

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
off and a connect button bluetooth

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
off and a connect button bluetooth
keyboard<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:01.920> pretty

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
keyboard and there you go pretty

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.819 
keyboard and there you go pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:03.170> so<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.439> real<00:02:04.590> quick<00:02:04.799> just

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
self-explanatory so just real quick just

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.639 
self-explanatory so just real quick just
for<00:02:05.219> fun<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.000> guess<00:02:06.390> we'll<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.229> keyboard

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
for fun I guess we'll have this keyboard

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.229 
for fun I guess we'll have this keyboard
and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> actual<00:02:08.819> apple

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and then here is the actual apple

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.320 
and then here is the actual apple
keyboard<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.470> we'll<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.979> ahead<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
keyboard so we'll go ahead and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.910 
keyboard so we'll go ahead and
flip<00:02:11.960> these<00:02:12.110> around<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.710> Freight<00:02:12.890> on

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
flip these around just Freight on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.370 
flip these around just Freight on
comparison<00:02:13.850> gotta<00:02:14.780> say<00:02:14.990> they<00:02:15.140> look<00:02:15.320> very

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
comparison gotta say they look very

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.470 
comparison gotta say they look very
similar<00:02:15.770> especially<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.760> terms<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.060> thickness

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
similar especially in terms of thickness

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.960 
similar especially in terms of thickness
I<00:02:17.690> think<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.470> actually<00:02:19.070> plastic<00:02:19.760> it's

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
I think this is actually plastic it's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.360 
I think this is actually plastic it's
hard<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.390> tell<00:02:20.630> that's<00:02:20.870> aluminum<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.560> pretty

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
hard to tell that's aluminum I pretty

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.670 
hard to tell that's aluminum I pretty
sure<00:02:22.550> it's<00:02:22.730> plastic<00:02:23.210> though<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:24.200> overall<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
sure it's plastic though but overall the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.470 
sure it's plastic though but overall the
look<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.070> very<00:02:25.160> identical<00:02:26.170> between<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:28.040> two

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
look is very identical between the two

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.210 
look is very identical between the two
so<00:02:29.480> there<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.690> go<00:02:29.750> there's<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.380> just

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
so there you go there's that just

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.080 
so there you go there's that just
thought<00:02:31.370> that'd<00:02:31.520> be<00:02:31.670> kind<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:31.910> interesting

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
thought that'd be kind of interesting

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.120 
thought that'd be kind of interesting
for<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.510> guys<00:02:32.690> alright<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.830> can<00:02:34.010> see<00:02:34.100> I

triple a batteries in here it doesn't d

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.510 
triple a batteries in here it doesn't d
take<00:02:38.720> two<00:02:38.960> of<00:02:39.140> them<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:39.980> we're<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.220> simply

right there flip it to on alright so we

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.300 
right there flip it to on alright so we
have<00:02:46.670> an<00:02:46.820> LED<00:02:47.770> now<00:02:48.770> I'm<00:02:48.890> going<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.070> go<00:02:49.160> into

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
have an LED now I'm going to go into

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.380 
have an LED now I'm going to go into
settings<00:02:50.590> try<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.709> do<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.940> little<00:02:53.150> bit

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
settings try to do this a little bit

will try and will pair this one alright
so<00:03:07.010> as<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.160> see<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.400> it's<00:03:07.550> told<00:03:07.820> us<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.300> enter

so as you see you it's told us to enter

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.100 
so as you see you it's told us to enter
a<00:03:08.630> pin<00:03:09.100> 5<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.459> 8<00:03:10.790> 1<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:13.300> just<00:03:14.300> like<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.480> we<00:03:14.690> are

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
a pin 5 to 8 1 and just like that we are
