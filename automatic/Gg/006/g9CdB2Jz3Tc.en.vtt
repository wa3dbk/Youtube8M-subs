00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
revive won a lot of this stuff was

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.979 
revive won a lot of this stuff was
patched<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.489> game<00:03:21.640> for<00:03:21.820> free<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.660> I

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
patched in to the game for free and I

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.210 
patched in to the game for free and I
just<00:03:23.230> haven't<00:03:23.380> been<00:03:23.560> playing<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.950> very<00:03:23.980> much

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
just haven't been playing it very much

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.740 
just haven't been playing it very much
on<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.400> ps4<00:03:24.640> version<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.300> I'm<00:03:25.390> not<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.570> hundred

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
on the ps4 version so I'm not a hundred

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.890 
on the ps4 version so I'm not a hundred
percent<00:03:25.870> sure<00:03:26.050> what's<00:03:26.410> new<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:27.720> dark<00:03:28.720> world

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
percent sure what's new in dark world

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.080 
percent sure what's new in dark world
and<00:03:29.110> what's<00:03:29.260> already<00:03:29.739> there<00:03:29.890> for<00:03:30.220> free<00:03:30.370> one

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
and what's already there for free one

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.729 
and what's already there for free one
thing<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.299> do<00:03:31.360> know<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.870> new<00:03:32.049> are<00:03:32.230> these<00:03:32.380> two<00:03:32.590> new

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
thing I do know is new are these two new

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.800 
thing I do know is new are these two new
arrow<00:03:32.980> types<00:03:33.280> trigger<00:03:33.730> arrows<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.360> prism

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
arrow types trigger arrows and prism

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.750 
arrow types trigger arrows and prism
arrows<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.950> I've<00:03:36.100> got<00:03:36.250> some<00:03:36.400> footage<00:03:36.670> of

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
arrows and I've got some footage of

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.490 
arrows and I've got some footage of
those<00:03:36.940> showing<00:03:37.239> them<00:03:37.360> off<00:03:37.480> but<00:03:37.720> they<00:03:37.959> add<00:03:38.170> some

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
those showing them off but they add some

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.789 
those showing them off but they add some
pretty<00:03:38.680> cool<00:03:39.150> mechanics<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.799> gameplay

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
pretty cool mechanics to the gameplay

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.039 
pretty cool mechanics to the gameplay
that<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:43.000> didn't<00:03:43.420> understand<00:03:43.900> at<00:03:44.019> first

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
that I didn't understand at first

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.070 
that I didn't understand at first
there's<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.799> lot<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.340> accidental<00:03:45.940> death<00:03:46.150> going

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
there's a lot of accidental death going

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.190 
there's a lot of accidental death going
on<00:03:47.260> four<00:03:47.860> new<00:03:47.890> maps<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.640> in<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.209> DLC<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:50.110> of

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
on four new maps in in the DLC one of

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.680 
on four new maps in in the DLC one of
which<00:03:50.549> Cataclysm<00:03:51.549> is<00:03:51.820> procedurally

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
which Cataclysm is procedurally

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.350 
which Cataclysm is procedurally
generated<00:03:53.110> yeah<00:03:54.040> this<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.489> in<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:54.940> haven't

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
generated yeah this is in so I haven't

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.610 
generated yeah this is in so I haven't
played<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.660> single-player<00:03:56.049> of<00:03:56.290> dark<00:03:56.500> world

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
played the single-player of dark world

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.990 
played the single-player of dark world
yet<00:03:56.799> but<00:03:56.890> I've<00:03:56.980> played<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.280> multiplayer<00:03:57.400> and

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
yet but I've played the multiplayer and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.850 
yet but I've played the multiplayer and
like<00:03:58.269> if<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.870> hadn't<00:03:59.230> told<00:03:59.380> me<00:03:59.500> that

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
like if you hadn't told me that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.470 
like if you hadn't told me that
Cataclysm<00:04:00.190> was<00:04:00.519> procedurally<00:04:01.000> generated<00:04:01.330> I

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
Cataclysm was procedurally generated I

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.670 
Cataclysm was procedurally generated I
never<00:04:01.660> would<00:04:01.810> have<00:04:01.870> known<00:04:02.049> because<00:04:02.260> they<00:04:02.380> feel

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
never would have known because they feel

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.620 
never would have known because they feel
like<00:04:02.890> such<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.190> solid<00:04:03.640> tower<00:04:03.910> for<00:04:04.120> maps<00:04:04.330> yeah

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
like such a solid tower for maps yeah

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.080 
like such a solid tower for maps yeah
yeah<00:04:05.140> there's<00:04:05.320> no<00:04:05.500> there's<00:04:05.980> nothing<00:04:06.640> crummy

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
yeah there's no there's nothing crummy

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.699 
yeah there's no there's nothing crummy
nothing<00:04:07.540> I've<00:04:07.660> hit<00:04:07.840> that's<00:04:08.020> crummy<00:04:08.319> so<00:04:08.470> far

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
nothing I've hit that's crummy so far

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.620 
nothing I've hit that's crummy so far
it's<00:04:09.640> different<00:04:09.970> every<00:04:10.180> time<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:10.360> play<00:04:10.599> it

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
it's different every time you play it

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.940 
it's different every time you play it
there<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:11.110> a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
there is a

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.280 
there is a
seed<00:04:12.520> code<00:04:12.849> that<00:04:13.150> it<00:04:13.239> generates<00:04:13.599> at<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.080> end

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
seed code that it generates at the end

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.770 
seed code that it generates at the end
of<00:04:14.500> each<00:04:14.739> match<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:16.239> if<00:04:16.389> you<00:04:16.480> really<00:04:16.660> really

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
of each match so if you really really

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.539 
of each match so if you really really
liked<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.380> can<00:04:17.530> write<00:04:18.130> down<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.400> seed

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
liked it you can write down the seed

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.159 
liked it you can write down the seed
code<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.000> then<00:04:19.180> instead<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.840> randomly

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
code and then instead of randomly

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.960 
code and then instead of randomly
generating<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.769> you<00:04:20.919> can<00:04:21.190> pick<00:04:21.669> from<00:04:21.700> that

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
generating it you can pick from that

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.400 
generating it you can pick from that
scene<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.450> play<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.750> same<00:04:22.900> map<00:04:23.050> over<00:04:23.260> again

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
scene and play that same map over again

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.909 
scene and play that same map over again
so<00:04:23.860> this<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.700> match<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.720> lightning<00:04:26.680> quick

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
so this this match is lightning quick

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.890 
so this this match is lightning quick
but<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.520> shows<00:04:27.669> off<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.970> prism<00:04:28.270> arrows<00:04:28.570> if<00:04:28.780> you

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
but it shows off the prism arrows if you

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.390 
but it shows off the prism arrows if you
catch<00:04:29.139> them<00:04:29.440> you<00:04:29.590> are<00:04:29.740> trapped<00:04:30.040> in<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.250> prison

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
catch them you are trapped in a prison

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.140 
catch them you are trapped in a prison
and<00:04:30.790> are<00:04:31.780> vulnerable<00:04:32.200> okay<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:33.610> if<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.000> get

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
and are vulnerable okay so if you get

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.430 
and are vulnerable okay so if you get
hit<00:04:34.300> by<00:04:34.450> them<00:04:34.600> your<00:04:34.750> body<00:04:34.900> dissolves

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
hit by them your body dissolves

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.230 
hit by them your body dissolves
instantly<00:04:35.560> which<00:04:36.040> negates<00:04:36.460> trigger<00:04:36.850> corpses

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
instantly which negates trigger corpses

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.920 
instantly which negates trigger corpses
but<00:04:37.419> check<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.570> out

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
but check it out

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.480 
but check it out
this<00:04:38.139> guy<00:04:38.290> gets<00:04:38.350> catches<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.100> prism<00:04:39.370> arrow

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
this guy gets catches the prism arrow

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.210 
this guy gets catches the prism arrow
which<00:04:39.729> catches<00:04:40.090> him<00:04:40.180> in<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.330> prison<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.900> the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
which catches him in a prison and the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.920 
which catches him in a prison and the
the<00:04:42.220> trap<00:04:42.520> there<00:04:42.790> hits<00:04:43.060> him<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.270> kills<00:04:43.510> him<00:04:43.690> a

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
the trap there hits him and kills him a

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.900 
the trap there hits him and kills him a
beautiful<00:04:44.710> replay<00:04:45.040> it's<00:04:45.250> pretty<00:04:45.610> radical

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
beautiful replay it's pretty radical

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.760 
beautiful replay it's pretty radical
it's<00:04:46.389> pretty<00:04:46.630> such<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:47.050> good<00:04:47.200> mechanic<00:04:47.350> because

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
it's pretty such a good mechanic because

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.010 
it's pretty such a good mechanic because
you<00:04:48.040> have<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.370> treat<00:04:48.669> them<00:04:48.880> like<00:04:49.020> towerfall

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
you have to treat them like towerfall

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.570 
you have to treat them like towerfall
good<00:04:50.350> powerful<00:04:50.740> players<00:04:50.950> have<00:04:51.130> been<00:04:51.220> trained

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
good powerful players have been trained

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.250 
good powerful players have been trained
for<00:04:51.850> like<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.030> year<00:04:52.060> now<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.479> dodge<00:04:52.870> in<00:04:53.139> the

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
for like a year now to dodge in the

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.570 
for like a year now to dodge in the
arrows<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.770> catch<00:04:53.950> them<00:04:54.130> out<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.280> midair<00:04:54.400> no

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
arrows and catch them out of midair no

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.430 
arrows and catch them out of midair no
matter<00:04:54.729> what<00:04:54.940> romero's<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.930> have<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.139> do<00:04:56.320> it

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
matter what romero's you have to do it

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.320 
matter what romero's you have to do it
completely<00:04:56.650> backwards<00:04:57.430> we're<00:04:57.580> just<00:04:57.760> so<00:04:57.970> like

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
completely backwards we're just so like

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.900 
completely backwards we're just so like
right<00:04:58.870> if<00:04:59.260> you<00:04:59.380> hit<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.620> prism<00:04:59.979> arrow<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.460> you

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
right if you hit a prism arrow and you

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.190 
right if you hit a prism arrow and you
catch<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.120> you're<00:05:01.419> gonna<00:05:01.540> be<00:05:01.690> screwed<00:05:01.930> for<00:05:02.139> a

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
catch it you're gonna be screwed for a

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.450 
catch it you're gonna be screwed for a
few<00:05:02.380> seconds<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:02.770> doesn't<00:05:02.950> last<00:05:03.040> very<00:05:03.130> long

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
few seconds it doesn't last very long

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.940 
few seconds it doesn't last very long
things<00:05:04.210> can<00:05:04.419> pass<00:05:04.600> into<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.139> prison<00:05:05.560> but<00:05:05.830> you

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
things can pass into the prison but you

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.219 
things can pass into the prison but you
can't<00:05:06.280> leave<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.669> prison<00:05:07.000> alright<00:05:07.780> your

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
can't leave the prison alright your

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.540 
can't leave the prison alright your
arrows<00:05:08.500> can<00:05:08.680> still<00:05:08.889> present<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:09.190> I've<00:05:09.370> been

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
arrows can still present so I've been

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.120 
arrows can still present so I've been
like<00:05:09.700> trapped<00:05:10.000> in<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.180> prism<00:05:10.510> arrow<00:05:11.169> prism

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
like trapped in a prism arrow prism

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.790 
like trapped in a prism arrow prism
before<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.960> still<00:05:13.960> managed<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.380> kill<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.710> guy

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
before and still managed to kill the guy

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.500 
before and still managed to kill the guy
who<00:05:14.830> trapped<00:05:15.220> me<00:05:15.310> in<00:05:15.400> there<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.820> just<00:05:16.180> waited

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
who trapped me in there and just waited

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.000 
who trapped me in there and just waited
it<00:05:16.630> out<00:05:16.720> which<00:05:16.960> is<00:05:17.080> also<00:05:17.200> a<00:05:17.350> thing<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:17.770> can<00:05:17.889> do

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
it out which is also a thing you can do

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.909 
it out which is also a thing you can do
this<00:05:18.910> is<00:05:19.389> another<00:05:19.690> new<00:05:19.900> map<00:05:20.080> we're<00:05:20.740> playing

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
this is another new map we're playing

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.610 
this is another new map we're playing
with<00:05:21.010> trigger<00:05:21.250> arrows<00:05:21.669> which<00:05:22.450> explode<00:05:23.289> after

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
with trigger arrows which explode after

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.640 
with trigger arrows which explode after
you<00:05:24.010> press<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.639> fire<00:05:24.970> button<00:05:25.000> again<00:05:25.750> so<00:05:26.289> this

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
you press the fire button again so this

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.080 
you press the fire button again so this
matches<00:05:26.889> like<00:05:27.250> everybody<00:05:27.639> just<00:05:27.669> kills

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
matches like everybody just kills

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.610 
matches like everybody just kills
themselves<00:05:28.419> because<00:05:28.750> again<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.200> goes<00:05:29.320> against

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
themselves because again it goes against

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.440 
themselves because again it goes against
your<00:05:29.740> powerful<00:05:29.979> impulse<00:05:30.400> of<00:05:30.639> if<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.240> have<00:05:31.330> so

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
your powerful impulse of if you have so

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.180 
your powerful impulse of if you have so
many<00:05:31.539> in<00:05:31.660> your<00:05:31.780> sights<00:05:32.020> hit<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.830> fire<00:05:33.160> button

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
many in your sights hit the fire button

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.710 
many in your sights hit the fire button
a<00:05:33.490> bunch<00:05:33.669> because<00:05:34.150> they're<00:05:34.300> not<00:05:34.419> gonna<00:05:34.510> catch

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
a bunch because they're not gonna catch

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.230 
a bunch because they're not gonna catch
all<00:05:34.900> of<00:05:35.110> them<00:05:35.229> right<00:05:35.580> this<00:05:36.580> stage<00:05:36.910> is<00:05:37.090> also

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
all of them right this stage is also

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.540 
all of them right this stage is also
radical<00:05:38.080> because<00:05:38.620> of<00:05:38.770> those<00:05:38.919> green<00:05:39.160> floating

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
radical because of those green floating

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.980 
radical because of those green floating
orbs<00:05:39.850> which<00:05:39.970> are<00:05:40.060> kind<00:05:40.210> of<00:05:40.240> like<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.450> purple

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
orbs which are kind of like the purple

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.990 
orbs which are kind of like the purple
orbs<00:05:41.289> and<00:05:41.440> then<00:05:41.590> whatever<00:05:41.979> midnight<00:05:42.520> call

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
orbs and then whatever midnight call

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.260 
orbs and then whatever midnight call
level<00:05:43.410> except<00:05:44.410> these<00:05:44.620> explode<00:05:45.220> so<00:05:45.970> when<00:05:46.150> they

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
level except these explode so when they

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.909 
level except these explode so when they
touch<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:46.660> ground<00:05:46.780> they<00:05:46.990> explode<00:05:47.410> and<00:05:47.440> it's<00:05:47.830> a

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
touch the ground they explode and it's a

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.440 
touch the ground they explode and it's a
lot<00:05:48.130> easier<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.580> get<00:05:48.669> environmental<00:05:49.270> kills

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
lot easier to get environmental kills

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.300 
lot easier to get environmental kills
with<00:05:49.600> them<00:05:49.780> which<00:05:50.410> even<00:05:50.710> trigger<00:05:50.950> arrows<00:05:51.190> on

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
with them which even trigger arrows on

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.350 
with them which even trigger arrows on
this<00:05:51.400> stage<00:05:51.610> basically<00:05:51.850> just<00:05:52.120> turns<00:05:52.300> the

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
this stage basically just turns the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.400 
this stage basically just turns the
whole<00:05:52.479> thing<00:05:52.660> into<00:05:52.780> like<00:05:52.930> a<00:05:52.960> goddamn

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
whole thing into like a goddamn

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.650 
whole thing into like a goddamn
exploding<00:05:53.919> nightmare<00:05:54.389> and<00:05:55.389> it's<00:05:55.479> totally

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
exploding nightmare and it's totally

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.830 
exploding nightmare and it's totally
radical<00:05:56.700> triggered<00:05:57.700> corpses<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.090> course<00:05:58.450> my

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
radical triggered corpses of course my

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.469 
radical triggered corpses of course my
probably<00:05:59.320> my<00:05:59.380> favorite<00:05:59.830> variant<00:06:00.330> but<00:06:01.330> yeah

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
probably my favorite variant but yeah

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.600 
probably my favorite variant but yeah
but<00:06:01.720> well<00:06:02.050> well-placed<00:06:02.740> like<00:06:03.130> well<00:06:03.340> used

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
but well well-placed like well used

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.370 
but well well-placed like well used
trigger<00:06:03.940> arrows<00:06:04.330> are<00:06:04.510> rad<00:06:04.840> because<00:06:05.229> you

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
trigger arrows are rad because you

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.900 
trigger arrows are rad because you
they're<00:06:05.620> basically<00:06:05.950> like<00:06:06.160> Goldeneye<00:06:06.580> remote

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
they're basically like Goldeneye remote

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.570 
they're basically like Goldeneye remote
mines<00:06:07.150> there<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:08.349> there's<00:06:08.500> sort<00:06:09.130> of<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.340> hidden

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
mines there and there's sort of a hidden

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.159 
mines there and there's sort of a hidden
mechanic<00:06:10.120> with<00:06:10.240> them<00:06:10.389> too<00:06:10.570> where<00:06:10.810> if<00:06:10.990> you

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
mechanic with them too where if you

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.150 
mechanic with them too where if you
press<00:06:11.560> B<00:06:12.400> you<00:06:13.300> can<00:06:13.539> still<00:06:13.990> fire<00:06:14.349> arrows<00:06:14.889> while

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
press B you can still fire arrows while

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.890 
press B you can still fire arrows while
waiting<00:06:15.490> to<00:06:15.669> detonate<00:06:16.270> them<00:06:16.479> yeah<00:06:16.690> there's

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
waiting to detonate them yeah there's

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.080 
waiting to detonate them yeah there's
there's<00:06:17.110> discrete<00:06:18.070> that's<00:06:18.760> something<00:06:19.030> I

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
there's discrete that's something I

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.950 
there's discrete that's something I
haven't<00:06:19.210> quite<00:06:19.389> figured<00:06:19.539> out<00:06:19.720> but<00:06:19.780> there's

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
haven't quite figured out but there's

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.260 
haven't quite figured out but there's
just<00:06:20.080> greet<00:06:20.380> fire<00:06:20.710> and<00:06:20.979> blow<00:06:21.220> up<00:06:21.430> buttons<00:06:22.030> so

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
just greet fire and blow up buttons so
