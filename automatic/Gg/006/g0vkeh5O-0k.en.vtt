00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.040
 I'm fine I'm fine You're exhausted 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.139
 parasite took more power than even 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.240
 you have thermal vision I have the 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.320
 genetic potential for this I think that 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.320
 it was enough for him 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.890
 I will manage 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.570
 it's not a total debacle registers you the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.570
 pocket parasite I got this memory 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.470
 it seems that parasite works for inter 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.350
 gang everything he has stolen all are 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.900
 pieces of something assemble a weapon that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.300
 generate 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.770
 black holes to build that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.600
 need is an accelerator 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.150
 particles like the big collider of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.430
 bosons of gin the next stop 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.710
 of the circus but now parasite can 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.350
 fly brings us a great advantage what 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.990
 I feel 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.170
 it's not your fault but this could destroy 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.270
 whole cities let's hurry you and me 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.670
 we must hurry us without power 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.300
 this would be traced hey you are the only 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.450
 with a spare bow 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.190
 and my powers returned like the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.620
 Christians we recover faster 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.910
 that humans and Martians do not even 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.910
 think about leaving me behind 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.450
 and while December 24 12 37 l 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.450
 trail of destruction is over there 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.740
 this would be much easier with me 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.740
 memory the laptop 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.450
 now let's light this baby 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.110
 and let's see what's left of gin when 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.110
 I finished 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.090
 we have to knock it down or at least 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.090
 bring it here to be able to bring down 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.120
 and they did not die 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.470
 but what happens the place 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.310
 do not 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.640
 a lot like you do it boy even 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.640
 superman relay goes so fast 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.370
 salgado only a couple of minutes so that 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.030
 this one should warm up is like 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.010
 gin which is a big risk to follow by 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.010
 do a theory do we go 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.800
 what do you have against gin I never 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.800
 liked the food but at least it follows 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.800
 improving I'm just the appetizer remember 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.400
 has is the political dish 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.820
 the foam can find me 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.670
 that crushes you with a thought I have 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.470
 Martian and Kryptonian powers combined 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.450
 and some of those to liberate before 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.590
 that I sabotage your destruction device 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.590
 be in guard 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.090
 very ingenious to deceive me to turn 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.090
 who cheats
