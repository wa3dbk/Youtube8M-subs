you want to partition for me it's this 8

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.120 
you want to partition for me it's this 8
gigabytes<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.590> X<00:00:19.830> cruiser<00:00:20.990> this<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.859> far

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
gigabytes and X cruiser this is so far

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.460 
gigabytes and X cruiser this is so far
only<00:00:23.310> has<00:00:23.580> one<00:00:23.880> partition<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:25.019> want<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
only has one partition we want it to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.950 
only has one partition we want it to
have<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.400> go<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> main<00:00:27.150> flash<00:00:27.599> drive

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
have more so go to the main flash drive

one before 4 and 4
well<00:01:22.020> almost<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:24.299> another<00:01:24.570> instance

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
well almost and then another instance

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
well almost and then another instance
you<00:01:25.259> might<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.490> want

you might want to do this if you want
this<00:01:26.790> flash<00:01:27.630> drive<00:01:27.659> or<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.470> partition<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
this flash drive or this partition to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.359 
this flash drive or this partition to
run<00:01:29.520> Mac<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> Mac<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.619> partition<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
run Mac on a Mac and this partition to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.539 
run Mac on a Mac and this partition to
run<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.990> windows<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.470> windows<00:01:34.500> format<00:01:35.280> is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
run on windows the windows format is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.719 
run on windows the windows format is
emboss<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.470> click<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.340> Windows

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
emboss you can click on that for Windows

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.760 
emboss you can click on that for Windows
so<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.630> Mac<00:01:40.170> partition

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so then you can have one Mac partition

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.069 
so then you can have one Mac partition
one<00:01:41.040> Windows<00:01:41.460> partition<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.600> case<00:01:42.810> I

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
one Windows partition in this case I

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.139 
one Windows partition in this case I
want<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.680> max<00:01:45.890> then<00:01:46.890> after<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> select<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
want to max then after you select the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.899 
want to max then after you select the
size<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.930> name<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.649> what<00:01:50.100> format<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.579> want

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
