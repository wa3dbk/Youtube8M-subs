there's been such advancements in the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.719 
there's been such advancements in the
equipment<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.720> then<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.770> whole<00:01:14.920> safety<00:01:15.460> side

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
equipment and then the whole safety side

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.670 
equipment and then the whole safety side
of<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:16.060> has<00:01:16.479> been<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.720> little<00:01:16.869> slow<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.229> catch<00:01:17.470> up

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
of it has been a little slow to catch up

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.190 
of it has been a little slow to catch up
to<00:01:17.860> where<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.490> know<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.060> think<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.720> sport<00:01:20.020> is

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
to where you know I think the sport is

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.920 
to where you know I think the sport is
out<00:01:20.350> right<00:01:20.590> now<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:20.909> another<00:01:21.909> weak<00:01:22.479> link<00:01:22.780> in

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
out right now and another weak link in

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.680 
out right now and another weak link in
our<00:01:23.050> whole<00:01:23.400> safety<00:01:24.400> chain<00:01:25.030> has<00:01:25.360> been<00:01:25.540> the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
our whole safety chain has been the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.780 
our whole safety chain has been the
leashes<00:01:25.930> because<00:01:26.550> essentially<00:01:27.550> that's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
leashes because essentially that's

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.280 
leashes because essentially that's
that's<00:01:28.119> your<00:01:28.270> lifeline<00:01:28.659> he<00:01:28.840> was<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.080> top

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
that's your lifeline he was the top

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.480 
that's your lifeline he was the top
where<00:01:29.710> people<00:01:30.009> were<00:01:30.070> going<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.250> be<00:01:30.310> able<00:01:30.369> to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
where people were going to be able to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.340 
where people were going to be able to
immediately<00:01:30.759> distinguish<00:01:31.509> where<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.170> are

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
immediately distinguish where you are

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.710

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
for my leash that didn't break the guys

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.210 
for my leash that didn't break the guys
wouldn't<00:01:37.450> have<00:01:37.570> been<00:01:37.750> finding<00:01:38.440> my<00:01:38.560> body

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
wouldn't have been finding my body

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.910 
wouldn't have been finding my body
unconscious<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.720> was<00:01:40.929> still<00:01:41.140> attached<00:01:41.679> my
