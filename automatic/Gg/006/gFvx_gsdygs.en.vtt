 for the empanadas as flour 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.460

 water with vanilla 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.280
 Vanilla flavor and good this we proceed 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.530
 to integrate them all in a blender that 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.839

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.540
 that crunchy mass that gives us the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.460
 empanadas the delicious taste and the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.979
 time friends do not arrive and you have 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.380
 the plate of the little sisters and it was very 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.420

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.310

 time to prepare them but if we want 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.100

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.120
 mix the ingredients and since you 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.760
 how is this dough going to be that's why 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.620
 who already has everything ready and prepared 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.580
 DNER check what they will do and 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.200
 despite an expression of certain weight 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.690
 Now he's going to extend it and he's going to 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.150
 deposit on this tray and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.640
 extended so that to put it to a 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.459
 machine that is the cutter and cut 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.520
 all the portions of exactly one 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.110
 only one size and one weight of that 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.750
 way they are making sure that the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.230
 all patties are the same size 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.290

 we are already seeing how well you comment 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.150
 that puts her in this mold they have to 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.920
 press very well for then 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.570
 later to cut it to the 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.650
 cutter but look what's going to 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.810
 put freight 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.549
 at the top so it does not 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.430
 stick at the time of cutting the portions 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.209
 Look there that machine you're seeing is 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.730
 the cutter flame there will oppress you and 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.030
 that is making sure that all 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.659
 portions were exactly the same 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.760
 size and the same weight see all the 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.530
 expert to make the empanadas that is 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.269
 what are you doing look geronimo 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.060
 let's make the distal and it's a 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.769
 little round but we put a bag 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.160
 in a plastic bag so you do not 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:15.130
 stick only the pearl we are 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.900
 and if it is a little bit crooked, we turn it to 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.900
 see and we oppress it again 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.070
 the plastic and this time I'm going 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.290
 to make pineapple but 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.480
 put a little pineapple here I say no 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.180
 I have the skill as they are 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.229
 so fast 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.199
 the same plastic side cousin a little bit 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.389
 and it's ready where you've hired 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.430
 there is no doubt that you are good at doing 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.100
 empanadas but look what you're going to do 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.190
 afterwards and since you put the empanada 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.979
 on the tray with this fork that 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.229
 they turned the tips you are going to oppress all 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.690
 the edges of the empanada with the 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.880
 purpose of pressing the edges and 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.960
 make sure that the filling does not come off 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.949
 First 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.949
 it's not like that look 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.479
 that's why the fork is crooked so that 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.690
 you can do it and that's where the 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.910
 completely sealed pie of the 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.729
 edges so you can make sure that the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.439
 stuffing is not going to come out 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.509
 Mariana today is 30 empanadas in one hour 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:34.309

 already so much to the needs that the mood 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.009
 but now the lady tells me before 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:52.249
 that the next process is to varnish 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:56.180
 is to varnish them with eggs not in 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:59.180
 varnish I wanted to bring varnish to egg 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.290
 to see how you get the varnish that 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.300
 dices 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.280
 excellent is with less so that you do not 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.640
 throw the egg and do not stick by the part 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.800
 from below this this varnish and what 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.380
 is going to give us a finish that is called 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.260
 a gloss finish to take a little 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.510
 coffee color golden but apart 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.180
 that the empanada is shiny 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.780
