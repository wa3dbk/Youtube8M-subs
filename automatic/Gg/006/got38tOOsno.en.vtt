00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.039
 Hello, welcome to the class I paid for. 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.250
 talk about genetic counseling 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:28.329
 of these human diseases are hereditary 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:34.260
 so there is chance some disease can 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:37.350
 be carried out for example like this 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.510
 then remembering that the program is a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.480
 graphic representation of the evolution of a 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:49.109
 disease in a family where women 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.109
 are represented by circles men 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.859
 horizontal indicates the marriage between them 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.289
 are the couple's children when the 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.350
 symbol is filled indicates that a 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:06.550
 individual is the disease 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:11.020
 good then evaluating programs like this 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:14.560
 a geneticist can advise a couple 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.299
 about the risks of having a child 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.939
 affected 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.990
 and then we call it counseling 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:26.159
 genetic 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.500
 we call cheerful promotes some 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.290
 disease or decrease the rates of 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.549
 survival and reproduction in 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:40.320
 individuals 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:52.049
 really this is normal that you have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:53.829
 usually more normal 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.520
 bearers 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:04.600
 in fact the majority of individuals are 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:08.979
 carriers already nello's deleterious is in 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.819
 dose for some diseases is possible 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:18.220
 to detect these carriers is an example 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:21.160
 sickle cell anemia Blood 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.610
 to detect sickle-shaped red blood cells 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.670
 which characterizes this disease 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.340
 the probability of an individual being as 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.460
 the recessive drops for an allele 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.370
 deleterious increases with marriages 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.750
 consanguineous as represented 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.330
 drama mess 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.700
 I have two brothers, his sons. 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.070
 They married and had a good child. 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.830
 then you must give this kinship 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:59.740
 these successive alerts were inherited 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:02.920
 grandfather in many cultures 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.090
 practice in consanguineous marriage is 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.120
 forbidden 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.360
 precisely by the empirical observation of 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:16.120
 that marriage between relatives has greater 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:24.700
 chance of resulting in good and 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:26.950
 currently it is possible that we call 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.120
 of prenatal diagnosis 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.800
 one of these methods is known as the 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.860
 stone is a fast and safe technique 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:44.860
 both for the mother and the child and 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:49.290
 can be performed between 15th and 18th month 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:53.290
 good gestation in this technique is 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.370
 a fulfilled inserted the needle into the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:01.450
 the amniotic pouch thus performing the 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.980
 collection of amniotic fluid and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.350
 to avoid risks 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.110
 the entire operation is monitored by a 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.620
 ultrasound equipment that are 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.019
 required only 20 milliliters of 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.890
 the amniotic silicone to be 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:22.720
 carried out the biochemical tests that 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.070
 can detect the diseases or can be 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.030
 accomplished 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.030
 cell culture and father present 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:41.189
 it is possible to do the analysis 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:46.120
 we are from that child to evaluate 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:49.840
 structural or numerical changes and 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.509
 diseases related to these 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.599
 with this technique, the parents 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:58.840
 prepared to receive a child who is 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.509
 possibly have some disease 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.590
 but a controversy about this 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:09.039
 technique is the so-called therapeutic abortion and 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.550
 has ethical and moral consequences 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.860
 before the good society I hope that you 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.750
 have understood between this class 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.750
 good studies and even more
