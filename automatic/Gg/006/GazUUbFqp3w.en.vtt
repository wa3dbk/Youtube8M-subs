00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.859 
get down from I'd recommend downloading
it<00:05:31.860> from<00:05:31.889> app<00:05:32.279> seen<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:33.029> seems<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.539> be<00:05:33.569> the

00:05:33.859 --> 00:05:33.869 
it from app seen that seems to be the

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:50.610 
it from app seen that seems to be the
most<00:05:34.110> reliable<00:05:34.379> and<00:05:36.679> yeah

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.740 

I'll<00:05:51.100> let<00:05:51.340> me<00:05:51.490> recommend<00:05:51.790> downloading<00:05:52.150> you

I'll let me recommend downloading you

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.860 
I'll let me recommend downloading you
trials<00:05:53.470> because<00:05:54.100> it<00:05:54.490> will<00:05:54.610> take<00:05:54.850> forever<00:05:55.090> to

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
trials because it will take forever to

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.670 
trials because it will take forever to
download<00:05:56.050> as<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:57.310> did<00:05:57.460> for<00:05:57.610> me<00:05:58.350> so<00:05:59.350> I<00:05:59.380> don't

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
download as it did for me so I don't

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.150 
download as it did for me so I don't
even<00:05:59.800> download<00:06:00.430> extremely<00:06:01.150> big<00:06:01.389> files<00:06:02.160> if

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
even download extremely big files if

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.600 
even download extremely big files if
you're<00:06:03.880> going<00:06:04.030> to<00:06:04.120> do<00:06:04.270> that<00:06:08.100> then<00:06:09.100> you<00:06:09.430> would

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
you're going to do that then you would

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.840 
you're going to do that then you would
have<00:06:09.639> to<00:06:09.850> download<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:11.139> off<00:06:11.560> a<00:06:11.590> torrent<00:06:12.430> site

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
have to download it off a torrent site

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.150 
have to download it off a torrent site
and<00:06:13.120> put<00:06:13.840> it<00:06:13.960> on<00:06:14.080> here<00:06:14.380> I'll<00:06:14.590> probably<00:06:14.919> do

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
and put it on here I'll probably do

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.659 
and put it on here I'll probably do
another<00:06:15.190> tutorial<00:06:15.880> on<00:06:16.240> that<00:06:17.130> all<00:06:18.130> right<00:06:18.250> so
