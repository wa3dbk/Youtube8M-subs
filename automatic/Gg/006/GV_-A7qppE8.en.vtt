00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910 

what<00:00:26.790> I<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:26.940> is<00:00:27.450> something<00:00:27.780> that<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.620> very

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
what I do is something that was a very

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.310 
what I do is something that was a very
traditional<00:00:29.160> Japanese<00:00:30.120> art<00:00:30.150> form<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.170> had

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
traditional Japanese art form and had

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.890 
traditional Japanese art form and had
its<00:00:31.940> organization<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.210> its<00:00:33.330> way<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.540> doing

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
its organization and its way of doing

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.740 
its organization and its way of doing
things<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.310> I<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.760> played<00:00:36.240> with<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
things and and I I played with it and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.540 
things and and I I played with it and
tweaked<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.590> modern<00:00:37.800> world<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.310> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
tweaked it for the modern world but I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.020 
tweaked it for the modern world but I
think<00:00:39.060> it's<00:00:39.300> good<00:00:39.650> to<00:00:40.650> have<00:00:40.890> sets<00:00:41.880> of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
think it's good to have sets of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.630 
think it's good to have sets of
restrictions<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.840> disciplines<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.860> impose

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
restrictions and disciplines that impose

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.430 
restrictions and disciplines that impose
some<00:00:44.910> sort<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.270> limits<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.320> want

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
some sort of limits on you if you want

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.280 
some sort of limits on you if you want
to<00:00:46.590> master<00:00:47.040> something<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.670> imposed<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.809> myself

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
to master something I imposed to myself

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.290 
to master something I imposed to myself
that<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.760> things<00:00:51.059> like

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that I was going to do things like

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.049 
that I was going to do things like
hokusai<00:00:51.870> did<00:00:52.170> landscapes<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.220> Hokusai<00:00:53.790> I

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.549 
hokusai did landscapes like Hokusai I
was<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.540> to<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.660> them<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:54.989> drawings

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
was going to do them from drawings

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.310 
was going to do them from drawings
because<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.640> were<00:00:56.730> no<00:00:56.879> cameras<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.809> was

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
because there were no cameras then I was

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
do it that way took me years to figure

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.960 
do it that way took me years to figure
out<00:01:06.990> how<00:01:07.230> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.070> Japanese<00:01:08.280> key<00:01:08.700> block

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.260 
out how to do the Japanese key block
technique<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.250> along<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> way<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:12.000> all

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
carving all but single colored blocks I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.830 
carving all but single colored blocks I
got<00:01:14.190> very<00:01:14.430> fast<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.180> good<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.570> carving

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
got very fast and very good at carving

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
got very fast and very good at carving
wood<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.010> if<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.250> want<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
wood you have to be if you want to do it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:32.680 
wood you have to be if you want to do it
all<00:01:17.820> yourself

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.720 

color<00:01:33.690> is<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> most<00:01:34.380> interesting<00:01:35.010> thing<00:01:35.370> for

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
color is the most interesting thing for

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.060 
color is the most interesting thing for
me<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> last<00:01:36.600> few<00:01:36.780> years<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.380> something

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
me in the last few years it's something

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.850 
me in the last few years it's something
I<00:01:38.160> didn't<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.550> it<00:01:38.700> first<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.480> and<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.440> make<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
I didn't do it first and and I make it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.490 
I didn't do it first and and I make it
all<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.480> because<00:01:42.480> if<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.050> look<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.410> my

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
all up because if you look at my

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.650 
all up because if you look at my
sketches<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.160> there's<00:01:44.760> notes<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.390> over

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
sketches they there's notes all over

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.630 
sketches they there's notes all over
them<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.200> color<00:01:46.410> but<00:01:46.980> I<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.370> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
them about the color but I don't I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.240 
them about the color but I don't I
almost<00:01:48.390> never<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.080> camera<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.710> me<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
almost never have a camera with me I

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.820 
almost never have a camera with me I
don't<00:01:50.850> take<00:01:51.390> photographs<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> place<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
don't take photographs of the place and

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.830 
don't take photographs of the place and
I<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.550> colors<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> camera<00:01:54.660> makes

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
I don't like the colors the camera makes

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.260 
I don't like the colors the camera makes
anyway<00:01:55.290> because<00:01:56.160> what<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.880> isn't<00:01:57.150> always

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
anyway because what we see isn't always

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.760 
anyway because what we see isn't always
like<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:58.820> and<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:01.380> thing<00:02:01.590> about

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
like that and the thing about

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.890 
like that and the thing about
printmaking<00:02:02.220> that's<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.150> wonderful

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
printmaking that's so wonderful

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.050 
printmaking that's so wonderful
is<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.979> never<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.430> what's<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.970> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
is that you never know what's going to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.790 
is that you never know what's going to
look<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.570> very<00:02:06.869> end<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.500> can't

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
look like the very end and you can't

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.190 
look like the very end and you can't
prove<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.260 

you
