be a little bit tricky but yeah I'm
gonna<00:00:22.109> start<00:00:22.320> taping<00:00:22.560> right<00:00:22.800> now<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> usually

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
gonna start taping right now I usually

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.330 
gonna start taping right now I usually
start<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:24.050> don't<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.230> mean<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> ball<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
start I don't I mean I I ball it but I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.390 
start I don't I mean I I ball it but I
guess<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.760> around<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.599> two<00:00:28.109> fingers<00:00:28.400> from

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
guess it's around like two fingers from

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.880 
guess it's around like two fingers from
the<00:00:29.490> heel<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.880> I'd<00:00:29.970> always<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.480> heel<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> toe

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the heel and I'd always go heel the toe

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.760 
the heel and I'd always go heel the toe
I<00:00:31.920> never<00:00:32.669> go<00:00:32.850> toe<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> heel<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.290> I'll<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.530> do

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I never go toe to heel so I'll just do

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.729 
I never go toe to heel so I'll just do
this<00:00:34.890> real<00:00:35.100> quick<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:36.050> speed<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> I'll

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
this real quick and speed it up and I'll

00:00:37.739 --> 00:01:01.320 
this real quick and speed it up and I'll
talk<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> say

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.229 

all<00:01:02.330> right<00:01:02.450> so<00:01:02.720> about<00:01:03.200> here<00:01:03.970> is<00:01:04.970> where<00:01:05.150> it

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
all right so about here is where it

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.130 
all right so about here is where it
starts<00:01:05.540> getting<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:06.020> little<00:01:06.110> bit<00:01:06.350> tricky<00:01:08.140> some

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
starts getting a little bit tricky some

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.760 
starts getting a little bit tricky some
people<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.500> stop<00:01:09.800> here<00:01:09.830> that's<00:01:10.370> fine<00:01:11.770> but

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
people like to stop here that's fine but

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.750 
people like to stop here that's fine but
for<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.070> over<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.400> toe<00:01:13.550> you<00:01:13.580> keep<00:01:13.910> going<00:01:14.180> and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
for the over the toe you keep going and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.980 
for the over the toe you keep going and
it<00:01:16.760> gets<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.030> little<00:01:17.120> bit<00:01:17.330> tricky<00:01:17.600> right<00:01:17.720> here

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
it gets a little bit tricky right here

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.830 
it gets a little bit tricky right here
so<00:01:18.560> what<00:01:18.650> I<00:01:18.680> do<00:01:18.800> is<00:01:19.310> I<00:01:19.490> just<00:01:19.520> tape<00:01:19.880> extra<00:01:20.540> you'll

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
so what I do is I just tape extra you'll

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.340 
so what I do is I just tape extra you'll
see<00:01:21.790> I'll<00:01:22.790> show<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.150> that<00:01:23.300> next<00:01:23.690> but<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.140> just

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
see I'll show you that next but you just

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.400 
see I'll show you that next but you just
tape<00:01:24.560> extra-long<00:01:25.400> fold<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.229> you're<00:01:27.350> gonna

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
tape extra-long fold it so you're gonna

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.530 
tape extra-long fold it so you're gonna
have<00:01:27.530> like<00:01:27.800> a<00:01:27.830> big<00:01:28.130> thing<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.180> end<00:01:29.270> like

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
have like a big thing on the end like

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.760 
have like a big thing on the end like
this<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.990> then<00:01:30.080> you're<00:01:30.200> just<00:01:30.290> gonna<00:01:30.410> cut<00:01:30.740> it

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
this and then you're just gonna cut it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.210 
this and then you're just gonna cut it
out

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
out

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.870 
out
so<00:01:31.640> I'll<00:01:32.090> speed<00:01:32.330> that<00:01:32.479> up<00:01:32.600> right<00:01:32.750> now<00:01:32.930> but<00:01:33.410> um

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
so I'll speed that up right now but um

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.790 
so I'll speed that up right now but um
this<00:01:34.880> works<00:01:35.119> right<00:01:35.360> here<00:01:35.600> if<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:36.080> don't<00:01:36.619> want

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
this works right here if you don't want

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.910 
this works right here if you don't want
the<00:01:36.979> over<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.310> toe<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.759> can<00:01:38.300> just<00:01:38.830> go<00:01:39.830> around

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
the over the toe you can just go around

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:52.100 
the over the toe you can just go around
back<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.630> finish<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.720> up

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.450 

so<00:01:53.110> now<00:01:53.230> your<00:01:53.410> tape<00:01:53.590> should<00:01:53.770> be<00:01:53.860> done<00:01:54.040> it's<00:01:54.220> cut

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
so now your tape should be done it's cut

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
so now your tape should be done it's cut
everything<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.070> can<00:01:57.220> see<00:01:57.400> like<00:01:57.430> me<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.150> like

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
everything if you can see like me I like

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.440 
everything if you can see like me I like
to<00:01:58.630> go<00:01:59.220> each<00:02:00.220> time<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.520> go<00:02:00.640> over<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.910> just<00:02:01.210> cover

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
to go each time I go over I just cover

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.320 
to go each time I go over I just cover
half<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.560> last<00:02:02.770> tape<00:02:03.100> like<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:03.940> said<00:02:04.120> I<00:02:04.150> go

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
half of the last tape like I said I go

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.730 
half of the last tape like I said I go
from<00:02:04.480> heel<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.690> toe<00:02:04.870> it<00:02:05.230> just<00:02:05.410> makes<00:02:05.590> more

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
from heel to toe it just makes more

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.920 
from heel to toe it just makes more
sense<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.130> me<00:02:06.220> once<00:02:07.120> you're<00:02:07.270> done<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.750> take

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
sense to me once you're done you take

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.800 
sense to me once you're done you take
the<00:02:08.050> tape<00:02:08.290> I<00:02:08.850> like<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.000> run<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.240> over<00:02:10.330> like<00:02:10.570> that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
the tape I like to run it over like that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.170 
the tape I like to run it over like that
just<00:02:11.080> make<00:02:11.260> sure<00:02:11.380> everything's<00:02:12.180> flattened

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
just make sure everything's flattened

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.710 
just make sure everything's flattened
out<00:02:13.270> smoothed<00:02:13.810> out<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.910> nothing's<00:02:16.300> coming

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
out smoothed out like nothing's coming

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.280 
out smoothed out like nothing's coming
out<00:02:16.900> no<00:02:17.140> rolls<00:02:17.410> or<00:02:17.620> anything<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.990> said<00:02:20.170> I'm

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
out no rolls or anything like I said I'm

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.960 
out no rolls or anything like I said I'm
kind<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.500> picky<00:02:20.860> about<00:02:21.010> how<00:02:21.400> mine<00:02:21.550> looks<00:02:21.580> like

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
kind of picky about how mine looks like

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.650 
kind of picky about how mine looks like
that's<00:02:22.690> why<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.900> takes<00:02:23.050> me<00:02:23.230> longer<00:02:24.660> you'll

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
that's why it takes me longer you'll

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.180 
that's why it takes me longer you'll
have<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:27.630> excess<00:02:28.630> thing<00:02:28.960> here<00:02:29.320> what<00:02:30.070> I'd

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
have this excess thing here what I'd
