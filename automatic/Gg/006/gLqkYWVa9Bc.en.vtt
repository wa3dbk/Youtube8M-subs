headboard I fell in love with it but

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.969 
headboard I fell in love with it but
unfortunately<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.050> was<00:01:32.140> for<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.350> king-size<00:01:32.740> bed

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
unfortunately it was for a king-size bed

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.370 
unfortunately it was for a king-size bed
and<00:01:33.550> I<00:01:33.610> have<00:01:33.760> a<00:01:33.790> clean<00:01:34.150> so<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.990> was<00:01:35.170> another

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
and I have a clean so that was another

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.810 
and I have a clean so that was another
thing<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.920> then<00:01:36.010> I<00:01:36.070> just<00:01:36.310> had<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.640> walk<00:01:36.759> away

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.210 
from but I think the biggest tragedy of
today<00:01:39.820> was<00:01:40.270> not<00:01:40.600> getting<00:01:41.080> that<00:01:41.410> fish<00:01:41.650> purse<00:01:41.920> I

the handle inside

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.190 
the handle inside
Simar<00:03:21.700> not<00:03:21.879> handle<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.480> strap<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:23.019> has<00:03:23.049> a

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
strap inside and one of the attachments

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.869 
strap inside and one of the attachments
for<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.349> strap<00:03:26.650> is<00:03:26.860> kind<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.159> falling<00:03:27.489> off<00:03:27.640> but

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
for the strap is kind of falling off but

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.479 
for the strap is kind of falling off but
I<00:03:27.909> can<00:03:28.090> easily<00:03:28.269> sew<00:03:28.569> that<00:03:28.720> back<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.530> use

this<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.510> was<00:03:31.599> only<00:03:31.810> $7.99<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.829> think<00:03:33.069> that's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
this so it was only $7.99 I think that's

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.130 
this so it was only $7.99 I think that's
definitely<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.760> steal<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.359> I<00:03:34.510> can't<00:03:34.750> wait<00:03:34.930> to

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
definitely a steal and I can't wait to

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.380 
definitely a steal and I can't wait to
add<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> my<00:03:35.980> closet<00:03:36.159> so<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.849> got<00:03:37.000> three

apothecary<00:04:54.460> bottle<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.060> I'm<00:04:55.419> not<00:04:55.659> familiar

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
apothecary bottle and I'm not familiar

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
with the chemical on the label but I

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.360 
with the chemical on the label but I
just<00:04:58.810> thought<00:04:58.930> it<00:04:59.169> looked<00:04:59.199> really<00:04:59.620> old<00:04:59.860> and

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
just thought it looked really old and

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.399 
just thought it looked really old and
worn<00:05:00.789> and<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.150> love<00:05:01.389> pairing<00:05:01.870> things<00:05:02.110> that<00:05:02.320> are

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
worn and I love pairing things that are

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.560 
worn and I love pairing things that are
kind<00:05:02.590> of<00:05:02.620> old<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.099> gross<00:05:03.310> with<00:05:03.940> things<00:05:04.210> that

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
kind of old and gross with things that

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.050 
kind of old and gross with things that
are<00:05:04.870> new<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.560> fresh<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.190> modern<00:05:06.310> so<00:05:07.030> I

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
are new and fresh and modern so I

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.090 
are new and fresh and modern so I
thought<00:05:07.330> this<00:05:07.449> would<00:05:07.570> look<00:05:07.630> good

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100

knickknacks on my bedside table and on
my<00:05:16.800> desk<00:05:17.100> so<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.580> haven't<00:05:18.030> figured<00:05:18.240> out<00:05:18.300> where

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
my desk so I haven't figured out where

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.970 
my desk so I haven't figured out where
this<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.750> gonna<00:05:18.870> go<00:05:19.110> yet<00:05:19.350> but<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.590> thought<00:05:19.800> this

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
this is gonna go yet but I thought this

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.620 
this is gonna go yet but I thought this
looked<00:05:20.220> really<00:05:20.430> cool<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.270> last<00:05:21.450> item

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
looked really cool and the last item

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.690 
looked really cool and the last item
that<00:05:21.840> I<00:05:21.900> picked<00:05:22.110> up<00:05:22.230> was<00:05:22.410> this<00:05:22.950> picture<00:05:23.460> frame

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
that I picked up was this picture frame

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.910 
that I picked up was this picture frame
and<00:05:24.030> I<00:05:24.450> love<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.810> art<00:05:25.050> that's<00:05:25.260> inside<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.710> it

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
and I love the art that's inside of it

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.680 
and I love the art that's inside of it
I'm<00:05:26.100> not<00:05:26.340> familiar<00:05:26.550> with<00:05:26.820> Donald<00:05:27.300> Hendricks

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
I'm not familiar with Donald Hendricks

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.510 
I'm not familiar with Donald Hendricks
so<00:05:27.900> if<00:05:28.020> any<00:05:28.170> of<00:05:28.290> you<00:05:28.470> know<00:05:28.650> who<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:28.920> is<00:05:28.980> leave

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
so if any of you know who that is leave

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.060 
so if any of you know who that is leave
me<00:05:29.640> a<00:05:29.670> comment<00:05:29.940> down<00:05:30.120> below<00:05:30.330> but<00:05:31.170> I<00:05:31.410> think<00:05:31.860> I

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
me a comment down below but I think I

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.490 
me a comment down below but I think I
gravitated<00:05:33.060> toward<00:05:33.420> this<00:05:33.570> because<00:05:33.960> I<00:05:34.140> used<00:05:34.200> to

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
gravitated toward this because I used to

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.140 
gravitated toward this because I used to
play<00:05:34.710> with<00:05:34.800> paper<00:05:35.070> dolls<00:05:35.340> all<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.730> time<00:05:35.940> when

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
play with paper dolls all the time when

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.300 
play with paper dolls all the time when
I<00:05:36.180> was<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.390> kid<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.840> so<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:37.080> felt<00:05:37.830> a<00:05:37.950> sense<00:05:38.100> of

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
I was a kid and so I felt a sense of

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.030 
I was a kid and so I felt a sense of
nostalgia<00:05:38.610> looking<00:05:39.210> at<00:05:39.330> this<00:05:39.620> this<00:05:40.620> piece<00:05:40.980> of

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
nostalgia looking at this this piece of

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.010 
nostalgia looking at this this piece of
art<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:41.880> even<00:05:42.150> though<00:05:42.210> I'm<00:05:42.300> probably<00:05:42.570> going<00:05:42.900> to

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
art so even though I'm probably going to

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.410 
art so even though I'm probably going to
replace<00:05:43.380> it<00:05:43.620> with<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.920> family<00:05:44.370> photo<00:05:44.610> I'm<00:05:44.940> gonna

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
replace it with a family photo I'm gonna

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.510 
replace it with a family photo I'm gonna
keep<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.840> art<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.380> try<00:05:46.980> to<00:05:47.040> use<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.250> elsewhere

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
keep the art and try to use it elsewhere

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.610 
keep the art and try to use it elsewhere
and<00:05:48.150> those<00:05:48.840> are<00:05:48.990> all<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.230> things<00:05:49.440> that<00:05:49.530> I
