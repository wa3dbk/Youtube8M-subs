00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
here we go so we're testing this

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130 
here we go so we're testing this
Victorinox<00:00:53.340> knife<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.940> three<00:00:54.300> things<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
Victorinox knife for three things the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.790 
Victorinox knife for three things the
first<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.590> dishwasher-safe<00:00:57.379> nasir<00:00:58.379> knife<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
first is dishwasher-safe nasir knife in

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.380 
first is dishwasher-safe nasir knife in
the<00:00:58.859> dishwasher<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.520> oftentimes<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.149> finds

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the dishwasher but oftentimes it finds

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.360 
the dishwasher but oftentimes it finds
its<00:01:00.510> way<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.590> sure<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.160> keep

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
its way there just be sure that you keep

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.740 
its way there just be sure that you keep
it<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> stable<00:01:02.969> condition<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.540> way<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it in a stable condition so that way the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.240 
it in a stable condition so that way the
blade<00:01:07.020> doesn't<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.439> knocked<00:01:07.650> around<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
blade doesn't get knocked around and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.649 
blade doesn't get knocked around and
flaw<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> integrity<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> edge

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.230 

so<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.649> we<00:01:16.829> all<00:01:16.890> know<00:01:17.189> big<00:01:17.610> reasons<00:01:17.939> why<00:01:18.000> we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so as we all know big reasons why we

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.029 
so as we all know big reasons why we
don't<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.600> blades<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> dishwasher<00:01:19.829> is

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
don't put blades in the dishwasher is

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.340 
don't put blades in the dishwasher is
one<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> safety<00:01:20.729> concern

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.430 

grabbing<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.370> blade<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> very<00:01:27.300> dangerous

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.969 

but<00:01:33.370> also<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.940> high<00:01:34.180> temperature

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.690 

the<00:01:41.670> chemicals<00:01:42.149> and<00:01:42.299> sanitation<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.020> soap

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.289 

and<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.910> agitation<00:01:48.510> of<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.600> machine<00:01:48.990> itself

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:04.310 

creates<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.229> lot<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.619> harm<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.189> fine<00:01:56.430> edge

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080 

so<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.190> second<00:02:05.550> thing<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> we're<00:02:05.970> testing

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
so the second thing that we're testing

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.510 
so the second thing that we're testing
for<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.690> how<00:02:07.140> well<00:02:07.440> your<00:02:07.710> blade<00:02:07.950> holds<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
for is how well your blade holds up to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.310 
for is how well your blade holds up to
cutting<00:02:08.790> technique<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> poor<00:02:09.690> use<00:02:15.320> always

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
cutting technique and poor use always

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.860 
cutting technique and poor use always
remember<00:02:16.950> as<00:02:17.130> previously<00:02:17.640> stated<00:02:17.880> never<00:02:18.630> use

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
remember as previously stated never use

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.570 
remember as previously stated never use
a<00:02:18.900> complete<00:02:19.380> straight<00:02:19.710> down<00:02:19.980> motion<00:02:20.430> with

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
a complete straight down motion with

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.250 
a complete straight down motion with
your<00:02:20.730> blade<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.420> very<00:02:21.780> harmful<00:02:22.140> to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
your blade as that is very harmful to

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.540 
your blade as that is very harmful to
its<00:02:22.500> edge<00:02:24.590> also<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.920> sure<00:02:26.100> what<00:02:26.280> kind<00:02:26.460> of

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
its edge also be sure what kind of

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.390 
its edge also be sure what kind of
cutting<00:02:26.820> board<00:02:27.030> you're<00:02:27.180> using<00:02:31.100> never<00:02:32.100> use<00:02:32.370> a

glass cutting board as those are just

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.070 
glass cutting board as those are just
for<00:02:34.020> decoration<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.970> often<00:02:42.390> though<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.810> wood

that you notice the difference between

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.340 
that you notice the difference between
endgrain<00:02:52.740> versus<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> side<00:02:53.580> grain<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:57.350> grain

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
is what you want to use sign grain is
