dumbasses out there ready to be guided

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.290 
dumbasses out there ready to be guided
it's<00:02:28.010> just<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.370> matter<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.640> who<00:02:28.820> gets<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.090> them

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
first so it seems like the water is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.979 
first so it seems like the water is
limiting<00:02:33.260> if<00:02:33.860> that's<00:02:34.130> true<00:02:34.400> then<00:02:35.090> what<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.870> the

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
limiting if that's true then what is the

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.990 
limiting if that's true then what is the
sound<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.410> pouring<00:02:36.770> water<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.580> what<00:02:37.850> if

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
sound of the pouring water and what if

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.300 
sound of the pouring water and what if
water<00:02:38.570> is<00:02:38.810> going<00:02:38.959> down<00:02:39.050> my<00:02:39.350> brain<00:02:39.620> huh

hand like this
well<00:02:52.640> actually<00:02:53.000> much<00:02:53.120> faster<00:02:53.150> something<00:02:53.810> that

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
well actually much faster something that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
well actually much faster something that
is<00:02:55.420> now<00:02:56.420> imagine<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.989> camera<00:02:57.290> takes<00:02:57.560> shots<00:02:57.830> only

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
is now imagine a camera takes shots only

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.520 
is now imagine a camera takes shots only
when<00:02:58.340> my<00:02:58.370> hand<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:58.820> in<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.150> position<00:02:59.530> snap

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
when my hand is in this position snap

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.410 
when my hand is in this position snap
snap<00:03:01.459> snap

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
snap snap

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.509 
snap snap
so<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.110> play<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:03.590> bag<00:03:03.769> if<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.160> look<00:03:04.310> like

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
so if I play this bag if you look like

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.280 
so if I play this bag if you look like
that<00:03:04.790> my<00:03:04.940> hand<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.269> only<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.810> position

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
that my hand is only in this position

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.930 
that my hand is only in this position
while<00:03:06.650> it's<00:03:06.890> actually<00:03:07.310> moving<00:03:07.519> back<00:03:07.790> the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
while it's actually moving back the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.390 
while it's actually moving back the
board<00:03:08.209> same<00:03:08.959> goes<00:03:09.260> for<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.590> water<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:10.010> set<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
board same goes for the water I set the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.190 
board same goes for the water I set the
frequency<00:03:10.549> of<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.030> vibration<00:03:11.570> exactly<00:03:12.080> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
frequency of the vibration exactly the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.420 
frequency of the vibration exactly the
same<00:03:12.410> as<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.709> frame<00:03:12.950> rate<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.310> camera

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
same as the frame rate of the camera

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.000 
same as the frame rate of the camera
which<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.180> 30<00:03:14.450> frames<00:03:14.750> per<00:03:14.840> second<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:15.560> the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
which is 30 frames per second so the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.949 
which is 30 frames per second so the
camera<00:03:16.310> takes<00:03:16.610> shots<00:03:16.850> exactly<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.720> same

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
camera takes shots exactly the same

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.080 
camera takes shots exactly the same
things<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> water<00:03:18.860> vibration<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.730> if<00:03:19.970> you

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
things of the water vibration and if you

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.210 
things of the water vibration and if you
look<00:03:20.269> like<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.989> water<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.500> hanging<00:03:22.010> in

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
look like that the water is hanging in

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.880 
look like that the water is hanging in
there<00:03:22.600> if<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.780> change<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.200> frequency<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
there if I change the frequency of the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.770 
there if I change the frequency of the
vibration<00:03:25.489> higher<00:03:25.730> or<00:03:26.030> lower<00:03:26.180> than<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.510> frame

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
vibration higher or lower than the frame

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.690 
vibration higher or lower than the frame
rate<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.320> look<00:03:27.500> like<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.010> water

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
rate if you look like that the water

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.180 
rate if you look like that the water
but<00:03:30.210> that's<00:03:30.480> not<00:03:30.720> all<00:03:30.960> in<00:03:31.260> order<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.680> get<00:03:31.890> clear

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
but that's not all in order to get clear

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.370 
but that's not all in order to get clear
shots<00:03:32.490> you<00:03:32.910> need<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.210> have<00:03:33.390> lots<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.810> life<00:03:34.080> to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
shots you need to have lots of life to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.380 
shots you need to have lots of life to
be<00:03:34.500> able<00:03:34.710> to<00:03:34.890> set<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.460> shutter<00:03:35.640> speed<00:03:35.790> very

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
be able to set the shutter speed very

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.600 
be able to set the shutter speed very
fast<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.990> that's<00:03:37.410> why<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:37.980> two<00:03:38.160> lights<00:03:38.430> in

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
fast and that's why I have two lights in

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.300 
fast and that's why I have two lights in
this<00:03:38.730> role<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.870> shutter<00:03:40.320> speed<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.800> one

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
this role this is a shutter speed of one

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.730 
this role this is a shutter speed of one
six<00:03:41.640> hundredth<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.330> second<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:43.380> three

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
six hundredth of a second one three

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.150 
six hundredth of a second one three
hundredth<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.460> second<00:03:45.470> 1/100<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.830> second

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
hundredth of a second 1/100 of a second

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.810 
hundredth of a second 1/100 of a second
and<00:03:47.310> one<00:03:48.060> thirtieth<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.960> a<00:03:49.080> second<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.820> thought

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
and one thirtieth of a second I thought

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.370 
and one thirtieth of a second I thought
that<00:03:50.880> out<00:03:51.090> for<00:03:51.240> one<00:03:51.420> video<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:52.050> still<00:03:52.260> have

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
that out for one video and I still have

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.780 
that out for one video and I still have
to<00:03:52.500> make<00:03:52.620> two<00:03:52.830> more<00:03:53.010> interesting<00:03:53.520> videos

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
to make two more interesting videos

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.820 
to make two more interesting videos
around<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.240> same<00:03:54.420> subject<00:03:54.870> but<00:03:55.020> I<00:03:55.290> still<00:03:55.620> feel

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
around the same subject but I still feel

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.670 
around the same subject but I still feel
like<00:03:56.040> I'm<00:03:56.220> missing<00:03:56.430> something
