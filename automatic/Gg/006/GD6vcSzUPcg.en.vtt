00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.000
 this time if I come up with something that 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.070
 I have more accustomed and these are two 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 beautiful bridal bouquets 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.940
 good 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.420
 this is and I'm sure it 's a bouquet 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.550
 but I leave this to decision 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 of each one because this was already with the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.739
 remains of an entire improvisation but 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.120
 final was very nice and good because no 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.860
 like a bridal bouquet not compact but 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.860
 yes spring and very nice 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.890
 this is the first one is a bridal bouquet 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:54.500
 compact 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:57.800
 with rangel anemones 3 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.660
 fifth row and the finishing of sheets of 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.660
 sadam that's compact 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.180
 and serve them and this 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.940
 good this is 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.380
 with the remains of the flowers that I just 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.159
 to mention everything that was left over 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.110
 here use it good the truth is that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.960
 I did it with the idea of ​​showing is such 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.600
 once an idea for the ladies but 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.149
 really is the decision of capybara 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.030
 like to know the model well with the 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.119
 little flowers that broke me 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.350
 I did what the buttons are they see it 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.040
 be this is the button and use for 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.470
 men in the party 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.460
 either for the companions of the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.770
 ladies or for the groom 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.090
 this is the button and he 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.899
 this is another guy with 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.100
 what is a very simple procedure very 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.409
 easy to make and very beautiful here are the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.890
 left 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.460
 and good 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.460
 well 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.020
 nothing more than leave them with the step by step 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.620
 I hope you like them and they serve you the ideas 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.620
 of these 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.660
 you know if you like my videos 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.770
 above comment share and do not forget 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.620
 subscribe thank you and see you next time 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.050
 well this is more of the same than what 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.370
 we have done previously but it is a 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.940
 complacency is in spiral technique 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.400
 for those who already know her 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.380
 and for those who do not use those who are 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.030
 new ones that so far see my channel 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.760
 this is the spiral technique if they want 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.950
 see in more detail how everything is done 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.660
 this I recommend you to see my other 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.600
 videos 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.110
 so they are not confused by the 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.620
 explanation this is only showing 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.200
 the idea of ​​flower combination because 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.710
 not always bridal bouquets have to 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.620
 be with roses this is against never he is 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.600
 a compact spring bouquet in technique 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:21.550
 to climb something with rne never the white 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.260
 anemones in dark lilac lilac the idea was 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.200
 use another type of green but do not 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.080
 I got the one that was on hand was fifth 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.410
 row the foliage I would say at this time 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.500
 filling 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.790
 floor row then is what there is that was 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.270
 what you use but you can 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.580
 use any other amount like the 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.530
 so asetum that is being like that 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.600
 flower d 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:51.930
 of chamomile they tell you and there's also 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.900
 several types of this type of filling of 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.270
 such equally accept now the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.020
 I write in the description so that what 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.319
 can search and well there is an infinity 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.390
 of filler material that you neither 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.970
 imagine then it does not have to be 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.250
 necessarily gipsófilas we are 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.810
 also using prices 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.450
 a little clearer this is to please 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.040
 to the erika pink friends I wanted 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.830
 a bridal bouquet with an idea of ​​how 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.620
 makes a bouquet with anemones, good here 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.840
 one this is part number 1 of this 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.320
 series of videos for me another little friend 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.320
 Patricia Sanchez 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.050
 this to each time as you see 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.350
 lilac strawberry freesias in lilac 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.750
 a little more lighter than the anemones and 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.550
 compact this bouquet is more than you 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.960
 You asked me hope you like and serve 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.400
 the idea is not with roses but it serves 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.340
 always and simply we are putting 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.790
 the flowers very very very stuck following 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.900
 the spiral technique 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.880
 and paying attention that we are not going to 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.660
 deform the part of what is the part 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.760
 from above the dome I in the part of 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.580
 down I'm doing a finish with 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.830
 its row and leaves Saddam because it was 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.780
 what I had but you can 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.260
 use any other type of foliage 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.840
 It looks beautiful with leaves 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.840
 of large light can also use 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.350
 eucalyptus you can use 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.180
 an incredible amount of material in the 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.919
 bottom part and doing it the way 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.660
 I better just like them 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.210
 I'm leaving the idea of ​​what they can 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.710
 do and that really looks very nice 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.530
 you fix it either with hoist 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.360
 with grass with ribbons with whatever 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.880
 they tie well well well that they are not 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.520
 go to let go but do not go to 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.259
 hurt the flowers now there we are going to 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.289
 cut depending on the proportion of 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:02.080
 bouquet and it's ready the finish can 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:05.970
 see in the other videos I hope you like it 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.160
