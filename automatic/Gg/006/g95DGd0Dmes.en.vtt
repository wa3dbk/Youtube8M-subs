false files being downloaded there are
two<00:00:11.730> ways<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.000> doing<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> looked<00:00:12.840> up

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
two ways of doing this one I looked up

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.320 
two ways of doing this one I looked up
it<00:00:13.559> doesn't<00:00:13.740> work<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> godaddy<00:00:14.519> service<00:00:15.089> so

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
it doesn't work on a godaddy service so

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.420 
it doesn't work on a godaddy service so
I'm<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.020> ignore<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.190> other<00:00:17.310> way<00:00:17.400> I

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
I'm going to ignore that the other way I

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.910 
I'm going to ignore that the other way I
found<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.000> using<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.359> farm<00:00:18.720> match<00:00:19.080> which

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
found is using a farm match which

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070 
found is using a farm match which
matches<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.430> extension<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.480> if<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.779> meets<00:00:21.930> at

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
matches the extension as if it meets at

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.609 
matches the extension as if it meets at

helpful piece of blog post here which

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
helpful piece of blog post here which
the<00:00:44.280> normal<00:00:44.489> side<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> used<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the normal side I used for these the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.869 
the normal side I used for these the
htaccess<00:00:46.469> guides<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.309> bad<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
htaccess guides it's not bad but the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.150 
htaccess guides it's not bad but the
piece<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> code<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> had<00:00:49.079> doesn't<00:00:49.980> seem<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
piece of code it had doesn't seem to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
piece of code it had doesn't seem to
work<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.969> what<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:52.140> uses<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:54.260> fart

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
work so what this is is it uses a fart

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.170 
work so what this is is it uses a fart
matches<00:00:55.890> files<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.640> what<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.820> basically<00:00:56.850> does

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
matches files and what it basically does

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
matches files and what it basically does
it<00:00:57.480> matches<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> extension<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it matches the extension and then it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.200 
it matches the extension and then it
forced<00:00:59.910> types<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> sets<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
forced types of that and then it sets it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.350 
forced types of that and then it sets it
tells<00:01:04.250> browser<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.610> thinks<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
tells browser and thinks that's the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.810 
tells browser and thinks that's the
header<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.990> must<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.439> downloaded<00:01:08.130> says<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
header so it must be downloaded says it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.429 
header so it must be downloaded says it
is<00:01:08.909> an<00:01:09.000> attachment<00:01:09.330> sort<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.960> thing<00:01:10.140> but

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is an attachment sort of thing but

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.450 
is an attachment sort of thing but
otherwise<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.369> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
otherwise you can just you can do this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.450 
otherwise you can just you can do this
PHP<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.869> forced<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> same<00:01:13.860> things<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.430> you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
PHP have forced the same things so you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.120 
PHP have forced the same things so you
force<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> header<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> tell<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.130> browser

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
force the header to tell the browser

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
force the header to tell the browser
this<00:01:17.640> must<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:17.970> downloaded<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.750> opens<00:01:18.990> up

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
this must be downloaded then it opens up

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
this must be downloaded then it opens up

thought the fun

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.850 
thought the fun
over<00:02:10.060> whatever<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.509> unless<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.319> sets<00:02:11.560> up

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
over whatever it is unless it sets up

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.550 
over whatever it is unless it sets up
for<00:02:12.430> different<00:02:12.879> things<00:02:13.170> take<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> little<00:02:14.349> while

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
for different things take a little while

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.220 
for different things take a little while
actually<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.819> can<00:02:16.030> just<00:02:16.239> change<00:02:16.599> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
actually you can just change the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.470 
actually you can just change the
approach<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.189> post<00:02:18.370> over<00:02:18.610> here<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:19.329> could

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
approach to post over here you could

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.339 
approach to post over here you could
change<00:02:19.629> it<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.110> an<00:02:20.379> mp3<00:02:21.629> other<00:02:22.629> types<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.079> media

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
that MP fan zips although they should

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.460 
that MP fan zips although they should
download<00:02:28.510> automatically<00:02:29.019> anyway<00:02:29.319> for

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470
