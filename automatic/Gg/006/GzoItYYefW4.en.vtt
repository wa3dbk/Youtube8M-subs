00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 speaks kings and is here in the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.870
 grandson in inÃªs garage and the time drift 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.830
 Santos to talk to you about 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.830
 tour covers 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.109
 the rangers 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.029
 I'll explain to you a little bit 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.400
 How does a turbine hood work? 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.609
 extreme of the ozzy metal the principle of 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.439
 cover determines what is to keep what is 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.230
 hot the hot tap box and the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.449
 It is cold cold to the waterfall turbines 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.189
 which improves performance 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.710
 you will concentrate the temperature of the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.809
 band and will also prevent the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.399
 hot rate warm the cold rate 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 there's no use in voting an intercooler 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.719
 Giants if your front box trying 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.770
 attack shaath on tour 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.320
 good as the chapel is developed and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.469
 extreme of the metalvales it is made in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.550
 basalt fiber on the outside and the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.399
 inner part 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.920
 it is coated with ceramic fiber and with 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.890
 a steel screen that keeps the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.739
 integrity and structure of capoeira 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.350
 Now we are going to install the car and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.090
 take the test for today's test come on 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.640
 to use a car that is a drift classic 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.220
 unicel 247 x 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.030
 it is equipped with 20 sr turbo engine and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.350
 intercooler with approximately 400 hp 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.500
 we first measured the box temperature 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.650
 that is 178 degrees 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.180
 we measured the cold box that is 50 degrees 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.369
 measures are being taken with 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.200
 open capital under normal conditions of use 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.360
 temperatures are much higher 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.890
 now let's install the turbine cover 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.840
 metal hours extreme 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.640
 the installation is simple just command the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.290
 cover the case and secure with the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.930
 fashion accompanies let's measure the temperature 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.880
 Turbine now to cover the box 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.920
 measures about 60 degrees 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.049
 reduction of 68% 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.610
 already the cold box measures 40 degrees a 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.439
 reduction of 20% 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.270
 this cold box gain is much higher 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.520
 when the hood is closed because a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 safe engine temperature decreases 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.240
 I'm going to stay here or discuss the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.950
 tests the layers determines metal wars 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.600
 to talk to us to send you email 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.000
 to contact the metal clothing risk 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.069
 Verri and enjoy it and follow it on facebook 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.080
 he these and the garage took him out of our room 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.440
 friend grandson the kingdom group of scientists 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 thanks
