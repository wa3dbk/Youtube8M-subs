see here at these coordinates and it has

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.469 
see here at these coordinates and it has
an<00:01:06.509> attribute<00:01:06.920> called<00:01:08.300> generic<00:01:09.300> movement<00:01:11.479> as

an attribute called generic movement as
you<00:01:12.660> see<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.259> generic<00:01:13.740> movement<00:01:14.070> speed

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you see here in generic movement speed

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.340 
you see here in generic movement speed
and<00:01:14.550> it's<00:01:14.789> very<00:01:15.030> low<00:01:15.300> so<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> animal<00:01:16.170> doesn't

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and it's very low so the animal doesn't

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.340 
and it's very low so the animal doesn't
move<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.490> custom<00:01:17.880> name<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> Frank<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
move this custom name is Frank and this

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.810 
move this custom name is Frank and this
custom<00:01:19.770> name<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.160> visible<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> you'll<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.670> his

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
custom name is visible so you'll see his

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
custom name is visible so you'll see his
name<00:01:24.000> above<00:01:24.270> his<00:01:24.420> head<00:01:24.539> it<00:01:25.140> has<00:01:25.289> an<00:01:25.380> active

effect<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.789> 11<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:28.970> resistance<00:01:29.970> so

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
effect of 11 and that's resistance so

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.680 
effect of 11 and that's resistance so
you<00:01:30.360> can't<00:01:30.690> kill<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.050> pig<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:33.030> next<00:01:33.330> command

fire resistance fact I don't know why I

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.740 
fire resistance fact I don't know why I
put<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.340> there

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.370 

this<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.900> a<00:02:10.930> very<00:02:11.200> fast<00:02:11.650> clock<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:13.120> lower

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
this is a very fast clock the lower

it this command block summons a redstone
block<00:02:21.880> beneath<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:25.000> deleting<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
block beneath it so it's deleting the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.680
