to<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.779> big<00:00:28.080> waves<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.470> last<00:00:28.680> amazing<00:00:29.460> I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
to get big waves that last amazing I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.919 
to get big waves that last amazing I
think<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> need<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> use<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> curling

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
think that you need to use a curling

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.359 
think that you need to use a curling
iron<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.320> need<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> break<00:00:31.800> down<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
iron because you need to break down the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
iron because you need to break down the
hydrogen<00:00:32.969> bonds<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> things<00:00:34.290> that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
hydrogen bonds which are the things that

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.139 
hydrogen bonds which are the things that
are<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.309> hair<00:00:35.460> hold<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
are going to make your hair hold so you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
are going to make your hair hold so you
need<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> break<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.840> down<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> curling

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
need to break it down with the curling

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
need to break it down with the curling
iron<00:00:37.710> first<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.280> heat<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> hair<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.000> then

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
iron first to heat the hair up and then

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240 
iron first to heat the hair up and then
you<00:00:39.540> wrap<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.780> hair<00:00:40.170> around<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.649> roller<00:00:40.950> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
you wrap that hair around a roller so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.500 
you wrap that hair around a roller so
the<00:00:41.370> hare<00:00:41.489> cools<00:00:41.760> down<00:00:41.969> around<00:00:42.239> around

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the hare cools down around around

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.139 
the hare cools down around around
surface<00:00:42.989> great<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.430> barrel<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.879> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
surface great the barrel on this

and<00:00:47.610> narrow<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> use<00:00:48.930> any<00:00:49.110> size<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and narrow can you use any size if you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
and narrow can you use any size if you
just<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> big<00:00:50.670> barrel<00:00:50.969> curling<00:00:51.239> iron<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
medium-sized one it would all depend on

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.790 
medium-sized one it would all depend on
longevity<00:00:54.420> okay<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.620> large

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
longevity okay just a really large

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410 
longevity okay just a really large
barrel<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.760> gonna<00:00:56.879> last<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.390> long

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
barrel then it's not gonna last as long

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
barrel then it's not gonna last as long
if<00:00:57.899> use<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> small<00:00:58.530> barrel<00:00:58.949> you're<00:00:59.129> still<00:00:59.370> cause

if use a small barrel you're still cause

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
if use a small barrel you're still cause
the<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.300> roller<00:01:00.600> determines<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.440> curl<00:01:01.770> size

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039

onto the barrel as possible I make sure

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
onto the barrel as possible I make sure
that<00:01:22.320> I'm<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> way<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> the

that I'm not going all the way to the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.950 
that I'm not going all the way to the
roots<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.570> flatter

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
roots because it's now about a flatter

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
to put moisture in at the finishing
phase<00:01:37.320> okay<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.700> more<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
phase okay and this would be more of a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.109 
phase okay and this would be more of a
modern<00:01:39.390> beachy<00:01:40.229> wave<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.860> opposed<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.640> yeah

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
modern beachy wave as opposed to yeah

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
modern beachy wave as opposed to yeah
it's<00:01:42.570> more<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> 80s<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's more we have the 80s with the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.310 
it's more we have the 80s with the
spiral<00:01:44.880> perm<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> spiral<00:01:46.049> perm<00:01:46.229> at

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
spiral perm it's not a spiral perm at

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
spiral perm it's not a spiral perm at
all<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.860> quite<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> horizontal<00:01:47.909> wave

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
all what is it's quite a horizontal wave

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.420 
all what is it's quite a horizontal wave
so<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.049> probably<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.829> bit<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.220> sort

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
so it's probably a little bit more sort

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.039 
so it's probably a little bit more sort
of<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.579> movie<00:01:50.939> star<00:01:51.180> maybe<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.810> sort

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
of like movie star maybe a bit more sort

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.740 
of like movie star maybe a bit more sort
of<00:01:52.079> screen<00:01:52.350> siren<00:01:52.790> but<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.850> does<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> loser

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
of screen siren but it does have a loser

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
of screen siren but it does have a loser
look<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.680> lot<00:01:55.860> more<00:01:55.890> undone<00:01:56.549> now

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
look to it so it's a lot more undone now

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.240 
look to it so it's a lot more undone now
I'm<00:01:57.240> noticing<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.229> rollers<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
I'm noticing with these rollers is that

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.530 
I'm noticing with these rollers is that
they're<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.430> different<00:01:59.880> from<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.210> velcro

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
they're very different from a velcro

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.030 
they're very different from a velcro
roller<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> bowl<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.829> really

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
roller I think that the bowl is really

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.440 
roller I think that the bowl is really
good<00:02:02.159> cuz<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> balls<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.850> easy<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.270> hold

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
good cuz the balls really easy to hold

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.850 
good cuz the balls really easy to hold
so<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.259> roll<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
so what you can do is you can roll the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.590 
so what you can do is you can roll the
ball<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.549> your<00:02:05.700> hand<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.329> what<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
ball up in your hand and then what you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.869 
ball up in your hand and then what you
do<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.899> keep<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.290> stationary<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.489> then

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
do is you keep that stationary and then

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.910 
do is you keep that stationary and then
you<00:02:08.970> roll<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.810> hair<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.259> I've<00:02:10.500> always<00:02:10.649> got<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
you roll the hair up I've always got the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.040 
you roll the hair up I've always got the
ball<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.129> my<00:02:11.370> hand

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
ball in my hand

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.600 
ball in my hand
and<00:02:12.170> then<00:02:12.350> bang<00:02:12.620> you're<00:02:12.920> done<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:13.520> you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
and then bang you're done and then you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.830 
and then bang you're done and then you
can<00:02:13.670> go<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.970> run<00:02:14.210> around<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.510> house<00:02:14.660> and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
can go and run around the house and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.300 
can go and run around the house and
they're<00:02:14.960> not<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.470> fall<00:02:15.650> out<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:16.070> like

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
they're not going to fall out I like

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.280 
they're not going to fall out I like
that<00:02:16.520> how<00:02:17.000> long<00:02:17.270> should<00:02:17.660> we<00:02:17.900> leave<00:02:18.170> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
that how long should we leave the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.110 
that how long should we leave the
rollers<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.070> would<00:02:19.430> leave<00:02:19.610> them<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.880> for

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
rollers in for I would leave them in for

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.060 
rollers in for I would leave them in for
about<00:02:20.330> say<00:02:20.570> ten<00:02:20.870> minutes<00:02:21.230> okay<00:02:21.530> perfect<00:02:21.920> time

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
about say ten minutes okay perfect time

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.020 
about say ten minutes okay perfect time
to<00:02:22.220> go<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.430> put<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.550> little<00:02:22.640> bit<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.820> light

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
to go and put a little bit of light

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.060 
to go and put a little bit of light
makeup<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.630> brush<00:02:24.050> your<00:02:24.200> teeth<00:02:24.440> have<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> little

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
makeup on brush your teeth have a little

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.800 
makeup on brush your teeth have a little
coffee<00:02:25.310> what<00:02:25.790> if<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.000> had<00:02:26.150> medium<00:02:26.600> length

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
coffee what if you had medium length

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.690 
coffee what if you had medium length
hair<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.620> still<00:02:27.920> wanted<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.430> waves

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
hair and you still wanted to have waves

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.220 
hair and you still wanted to have waves
but<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.060> wanted<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.420> keep<00:02:29.600> your<00:02:29.780> length<00:02:29.990> I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
but you wanted to keep your length I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.690 
but you wanted to keep your length I
think<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.800> most<00:02:30.980> important<00:02:31.430> thing<00:02:31.550> is

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
think that the most important thing is

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.970 
think that the most important thing is
to<00:02:31.730> drop<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.870> down<00:02:32.990> from<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.410> scalp<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:33.830> well

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
to drop it down from the scalp as well

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.440 
to drop it down from the scalp as well
like<00:02:34.160> make<00:02:34.340> sure<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.760> don't<00:02:34.940> kill<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
like make sure that you don't kill the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.090 
like make sure that you don't kill the
top<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.930> head<00:02:36.080> because<00:02:36.350> when<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.950> hair

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
top of the head because when the hair

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.040 
top of the head because when the hair
shoulder<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.550> can<00:02:37.700> get<00:02:37.850> quite<00:02:38.240> crazy<00:02:38.600> they

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
shoulder it can get quite crazy they

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.140 
shoulder it can get quite crazy they
keep<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.410> very<00:02:39.560> sort<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.220> flattered<00:02:40.580> silhouette

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
keep a very sort of flattered silhouette

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.960 
keep a very sort of flattered silhouette
around<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.510> top<00:02:41.720> never<00:02:42.650> curl<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.250> fringe<00:02:43.580> or

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
around the top never curl the fringe or

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.340 
around the top never curl the fringe or
the<00:02:44.120> bang<00:02:44.300> as<00:02:44.540> long<00:02:44.690> as<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.900> wrap<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.140> around

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
the bang as long as you wrap it around

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.200 
the bang as long as you wrap it around
that<00:02:45.620> little<00:02:45.830> barrel<00:02:46.220> three<00:02:46.550> times<00:02:46.850> that's

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
that little barrel three times that's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.390 
that little barrel three times that's
enough<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.660> give<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.590> way<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.130> would

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
enough to give you that way so I would

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.920 
enough to give you that way so I would
just<00:02:49.550> curl<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.970> middlings<00:02:50.390> how<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:50.810> were

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
just curl the middlings how we were

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.480 
just curl the middlings how we were
doing<00:02:50.960> it<00:02:51.230> before<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.770> then<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.220> would<00:02:52.340> just

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
doing it before and then I would just

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.980 
doing it before and then I would just
wrap<00:02:52.700> those<00:02:52.850> ends<00:02:53.330> into<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.630> role<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.900> then

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
wrap those ends into the role and then

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.780 
wrap those ends into the role and then
you'll<00:02:54.110> get<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> slight<00:02:54.620> Bend<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> ends<00:02:55.640> but

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
you'll get a slight Bend on the ends but

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.850 
you'll get a slight Bend on the ends but
more<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.120> your<00:02:56.210> wave<00:02:56.480> will<00:02:56.720> be<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:57.230> here<00:02:57.650> which

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
more of your wave will be in here which

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.080 
more of your wave will be in here which
is<00:02:57.980> where<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.220> want<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.580> they're<00:02:58.850> really<00:02:59.030> easy

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
to get out so you just go bang I thought

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.620 
to get out so you just go bang I thought
you<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.430> see<00:03:01.520> we've<00:03:01.610> got<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.730> nice<00:03:01.910> make<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> big

you can see we've got a nice make a big

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.570 
you can see we've got a nice make a big
wave<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.860> good<00:03:04.010> thing<00:03:04.040> about<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.490> is

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
wave and the good thing about it is

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.390 
wave and the good thing about it is
we've<00:03:04.730> got<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.940> wave<00:03:05.330> with<00:03:05.660> longevity<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:07.130> as

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
we've got a wave with longevity so as

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.830 
we've got a wave with longevity so as
well<00:03:07.580> which<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.790> really<00:03:07.940> good<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.720> best

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
why'd you want to go straight through

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.590 
why'd you want to go straight through
with<00:03:48.410> your<00:03:48.500> comb<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.190> just<00:03:50.060> comb<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.450> hair

with your comb and just comb the hair

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.410 
with your comb and just comb the hair
through<00:03:50.840> until<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.739> started<00:03:52.070> en<00:03:52.459> fr<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.030> hair

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
through until you started en fr the hair

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.690 
through until you started en fr the hair
appearing<00:03:53.989> in<00:03:54.080> a<00:03:54.200> way<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:54.440> what<00:03:55.310> we've<00:03:55.489> done<00:03:55.520> is

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
appearing in a way so what we've done is

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.570 
appearing in a way so what we've done is
we've<00:03:55.970> normalize<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:57.380> hair<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:58.160> we've<00:03:58.340> given

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
we've normalize the hair and we've given

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.670 
we've normalize the hair and we've given
it<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.850> same<00:03:59.120> size<00:03:59.600> curl<00:04:00.080> all<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.560> way

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
it the same size curl all the way

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.260 
it the same size curl all the way
through<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.160> then<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.400> ways<00:04:01.550> we'll<00:04:01.850> just<00:04:02.030> kick

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
through so then the ways we'll just kick

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.330 
through so then the ways we'll just kick
in<00:04:02.480> on<00:04:02.660> their<00:04:03.320> own<00:04:03.470> there<00:04:03.920> are<00:04:04.010> still<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.250> few

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
in on their own there are still a few

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.610 
in on their own there are still a few
little<00:04:05.180> flyaway<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:05.840> what<00:04:06.110> we<00:04:06.200> need<00:04:06.350> to<00:04:06.500> do<00:04:06.560> is

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
little flyaway so what we need to do is

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.520 
little flyaway so what we need to do is
we<00:04:06.709> need<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:06.950> finish<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.580> with<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.530> molding

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
we need to finish that with a molding

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.710 
we need to finish that with a molding
resin<00:04:09.560> we<00:04:10.160> happen<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.430> have<00:04:10.700> our<00:04:10.940> can<00:04:11.690> of

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
resin we happen to have our can of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.420 
resin we happen to have our can of
hairspray<00:04:11.959> with<00:04:12.290> molding<00:04:12.650> resins<00:04:12.950> in<00:04:13.070> it<00:04:13.160> I'm

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
hairspray with molding resins in it I'm

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.210 
hairspray with molding resins in it I'm
just<00:04:13.519> going<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.760> give<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.970> light<00:04:14.239> spray<00:04:15.220> now

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
just going to give it a light spray now

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.610 
just going to give it a light spray now
because<00:04:16.519> it's<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.760> load<00:04:17.000> v<00:04:17.330> OC<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:18.049> cfc-free

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
because it's a load v OC and cfc-free

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.099 
because it's a load v OC and cfc-free
you<00:04:19.130> have<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.430> wait<00:04:19.609> about<00:04:19.790> two<00:04:20.180> seconds<00:04:20.690> just

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
you have to wait about two seconds just

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.540 
you have to wait about two seconds just
takes<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.410> moment<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.830> actually<00:04:22.100> absorb<00:04:22.310> into

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
takes a moment to actually absorb into

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.190 
takes a moment to actually absorb into
the<00:04:22.640> hair

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the hair

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.020 
the hair
you<00:04:23.380> can<00:04:23.530> see<00:04:23.710> how<00:04:23.920> now<00:04:24.220> once<00:04:24.610> it's<00:04:24.790> got<00:04:24.910> the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
you can see how now once it's got the
