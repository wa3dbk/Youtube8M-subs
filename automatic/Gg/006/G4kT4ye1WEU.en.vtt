you<00:00:20.949> were<00:00:21.070> younger<00:00:21.489> now<00:00:21.939> I<00:00:21.970> don't<00:00:22.179> know<00:00:22.390> very

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
you were younger now I don't know very

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.609 
you were younger now I don't know very
difficult<00:00:24.009> question<00:00:24.929> you<00:00:25.929> have<00:00:26.019> so<00:00:26.199> many<00:00:26.349> a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
difficult question you have so many a

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.679 
difficult question you have so many a
lot<00:00:26.650> of<00:00:26.949> options<00:00:27.839> but<00:00:28.839> I<00:00:28.899> think<00:00:29.169> Pele<00:00:30.069> was<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
lot of options but I think Pele was the

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.330 
lot of options but I think Pele was the
king<00:00:31.929> and<00:00:32.619> that's<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.640> think<00:00:34.030> is<00:00:34.420> normal<00:00:35.340> after

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
king and that's I think is normal after

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
king and that's I think is normal after
that<00:00:37.469> Ronaldo<00:00:38.469> for<00:00:39.039> me<00:00:39.219> it's<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.300> top

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that Ronaldo for me it's the top

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.700 
that Ronaldo for me it's the top
phenomenon

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
phenomenon

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.360 
phenomenon
is<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:42.879> fair<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.120> say<00:00:43.269> look<00:00:44.260> that<00:00:44.530> Ronaldo

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
is it fair to say look that Ronaldo

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.939 
is it fair to say look that Ronaldo
Ronaldo<00:00:45.789> who<00:00:45.879> achieved<00:00:46.210> so<00:00:46.510> so<00:00:46.780> so<00:00:47.019> much<00:00:47.289> yet

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
Ronaldo who achieved so so so much yet

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.849 
Ronaldo who achieved so so so much yet
at<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.309> end<00:00:48.359> we<00:00:49.359> still<00:00:49.629> felt<00:00:49.809> like<00:00:50.050> there

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
at the end we still felt like there

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.740 
at the end we still felt like there
could<00:00:51.100> have<00:00:51.160> been<00:00:51.309> even<00:00:51.670> more<00:00:51.850> because<00:00:52.660> he<00:00:52.719> was

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
could have been even more because he was

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.239 
could have been even more because he was
such<00:00:52.929> an<00:00:53.050> incredible<00:00:53.649> talent<00:00:53.829> they<00:00:54.010> could

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
such an incredible talent they could

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:56.729 
such an incredible talent they could
have<00:00:54.370> been<00:00:54.489> maybe<00:00:54.699> even<00:00:55.120> more<00:00:55.300> yeah<00:00:56.019> but<00:00:56.710> I

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
have been maybe even more yeah but I

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.479 
have been maybe even more yeah but I
think<00:00:57.539> he<00:00:58.539> has<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.690> lot<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.170> injuries<00:00:59.859> in<00:01:00.100> his

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
think he has a lot of injuries in his

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.860 
think he has a lot of injuries in his
life<00:01:00.699> and<00:01:01.179> but<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:03.550> me<00:01:03.670> he<00:01:03.820> was<00:01:03.999> the<00:01:04.449> greatest

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
life and but for me he was the greatest

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.040 
life and but for me he was the greatest
players<00:01:05.110> when<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:05.560> saw<00:01:06.160> with<00:01:06.460> my<00:01:06.490> eyes<00:01:07.050> because

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.300 
we have four things we're missing one
when<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.110> are<00:02:35.260> young<00:02:35.500> that's<00:02:35.830> when<00:02:36.100> he<00:02:36.190> were

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
when you are young that's when he were

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.370 
when you are young that's when he were
as<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> kid<00:02:37.060> Zico<00:02:37.740> Zico<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.550> top<00:02:39.940> maybe<00:02:40.330> he<00:02:41.170> can

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
as a kid Zico Zico so top maybe he can

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.000 
as a kid Zico Zico so top maybe he can
be<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.590> third<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:43.360> difficult<00:02:43.870> because<00:02:44.260> he's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
be the third it's difficult because he's

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.390 
be the third it's difficult because he's
from<00:02:45.160> Rio<00:02:45.370> right<00:02:45.700> that's<00:02:46.210> why<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.890> difficult

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
from Rio right that's why it's difficult

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.260 
from Rio right that's why it's difficult
to<00:02:48.520> recognize<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.900> top<00:02:50.380> five<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.920> I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
to recognize that the top five is I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.120 
to recognize that the top five is I
think<00:02:52.270> everyone<00:02:52.810> can<00:02:52.990> be<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.260> first<00:02:53.470> what<00:02:53.980> was

think everyone can be the first what was

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.580 
think everyone can be the first what was
the<00:02:54.280> best<00:02:54.490> national<00:02:55.330> team<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.750> grassy
