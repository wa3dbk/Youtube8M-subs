 the server I just rebooted it and 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.890
 he didn't work all day for some reason 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.440
 I know some bugs soon and I will remove all 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.660
 it's a hundred percent in general i just 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.110
 account people fit why are you not a 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.480
 Now we will do the review as you

 just noticed on spawn no longer two 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.830
 their house 4 but one for a little bit 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.740
 broken down a little all by Own 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.010
 a little bit all unfinished is ours 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.770
 pvp kit and this is our rbg this is our b 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.310
 palace now you can see beta 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.740
 in this beta version of my server would 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.259
 the twentieth while I have a lot of flaws a lot 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.880
 all sorts of bugs plum not completed but it 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.530
 only beta don't forget about it you 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.030
 you can just run around to be killed 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.090
 to develop this business here 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.799
 look I hope to rate which one 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.619
 card at all like whether the thread 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.799
 play there kill lpg 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.429
 This is our r. Ie three archive 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.950
 this is our real so create drop 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.469
 real height means it in translation 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.600
 and that's not exactly what you think it is. 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.249
 a little different game I hope it myself 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.670
 did and maybe they did it yes not 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.149
 important 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.840
 let me make a game mod mole like this 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.090
 so to 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.579
 because this game cannot be played 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.259
 first gay fashion and it will not be interesting 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.940
 in general, so here we will soon have a shop 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.620
 then we will not have anything here we 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.650
 here is a premium shop here is an ordinary shop 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.360
 people and here you have the choice of the level while we 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.430
 in general it will be only 42 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 but so far we only have the first one available 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.940
 give it a little play 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.240
 we appear here right here we 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.820
 There is a choice of level etc. in both the main and 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.290
 actually start the game what is 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.370
 the essence of the game is that you need to be 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.840
 fall and not crash like this 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.230
 jump sound full 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.630
 so good, that is, we jump, jump 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.540
 Here it was a show and we are the main essence 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.840
 don't break here these we break the pelvis 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.730
 on you and start here in the store with us 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.650
 all kinds of potions will be sold 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.890
 there is how to say business we will be there 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.750
 sold to guide us that acceded 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.510
 given the type of different effect is valid 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.820
 can there damage resistance were on 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.290
 as stupidity, you will speak carefully 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.530
 and everything became neat well good all 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.520
 master poisons master of everything when a little bit 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.540
 did not fall forika 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.430
 so on the second level we have there more everything 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.269
 hard so let's say it really 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.450
 generally from the floor and 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.489
 a long time ago the second level is about everything 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.760
 left guys now let's go pass 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.680
 Pass Pass here there's also a good 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.540
 so when you go down we have here 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.840
 I have my own new gear fit 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.090
 joined and went out immediately joking not 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.269
 come running out here we have a choice 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:28.120
 that is, for some reason , to take water printing 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:30.640
 corrected can take prize 5 and leave son 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.370
 up and or take the second answer 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.739
 supplement and drink the present that is 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.450
 either we take 5 mushrooms or go 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.280
 On the trail of a person, that is, if we take 5 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.200
 mushroom we leave here and all 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.030
 and you have to go through it again 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.620
 we take additions go to the man then 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.530
 we take the supplement going on 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.360
 the next level I like there obviously what 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.460
 same drove 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.790
 on turned out to be a watermelon kim and teleported 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.290
 to his next so here we all have 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.900
 harder that is u look much 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.270
 more height much more distance 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.040
 between the blocks but we have a watermelon and what 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.310
 this watermelon does i think many people know 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.620
 she who does not know will see now and yes 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.690
 guys it gives us a regeneration 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.240
 awesome and while she goes with us 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.040
 better jump faster and if we don't 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.690
 we will kill jump here in general 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.579
 better not bounce high otherwise you 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.260
 you'll break the formula a lot 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.570
 there is the point is that you need to fall 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.570
 and don't jump before i 'll just fall down 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.640
 so here so here so so so so so 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.380
 so here i am i hope i will pass from 1 time 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.950
 and he sits we have to replay but 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.950
 I 'll be there 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.500
 died ok let's go a little 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.360
 again and then we'll continue and here 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.060
 I and passed to the second level let's 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.270
 take my watermelon so she jumps and I jump 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.919
 I think I drove here for some reason all 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.280
 life full nidal not even know why 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.930
 okay, we drove on oh I mean 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.180
 watermelon there it is still possible then it will be 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.190
 devour the Che is there in fact in 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.410
 Generally bugs there are bugs I do not argue they 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.630
 here everywhere i mean i gradually them 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.240
 correcting everything for now 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.040
 I can't find people here 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.290

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.520
 project pixel there fix paw paw i 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.910
 I think it is necessary to eat watermelon already 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.160
 Now we are quickly so crooked 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.380

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.270
 time why not and on this we and 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.979

 I will go for the third time for sure 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.770
 go straight here on another way and that 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.470
 something, something, something, something, I didn't even think about myself 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.700
 that it will take a long time 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.010
 she's up and now we only have two 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.260
 level and here is the abbreviated which this 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.880
 grant in church i hope i'm the first who her 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.310
 came up with who did not invent so create and 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.530
 if not then yes and okay I just somehow 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.440
 what is wrong with us is going on in the world 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.790
 minecraft don't know everything 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.140
 only on your server is generally more 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.780
 day play decks 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.790
 almost fell again sheet sometimes playing on 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.010
 abcd sometimes on a computer of scientists 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.770
 kristalikse'll play here well, that is not 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:18.730
 I know on the crystallix such a garbage like 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.620

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.230
 need that is to fall again and not 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.850
 hurt all sorts of places and here we have 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.790
 In another way, on the contrary, I will fall exactly 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:34.690
 on such things as I have already said here 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:37.300

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:41.830
 developing and with us let's take the prize 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.260
 15 mushrooms and go with his hi then they gave us 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:49.670
 15 mushrooms we can check this by writing 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:52.340
 on tuning from views so 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:58.820
