00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.750
 using a user certificate and with 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.790
 using a preliminary key if 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.890
 Your network does not have a domain controller 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.110
 users do not have valid 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 certificates should be used 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.509
 authentication method using 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.509
 password 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.390
 wife button next after this creation 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.250
 policies can be considered complete further 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.860
 need to create security rules 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.930
 filter for this rule and determine 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.330
 filter action for this click 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.690
 the button is ready and a window appears 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.090
 security policy properties and for 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.350
 creating a new rule is necessary 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.360
 uncheck the box to use 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.360
 wizard and click add 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.159
 if the custom connection is 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.080
 work transport mode then in 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.869
 There are no tabs for tunnel parameters 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.209
 need to change bookmarks 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.680
 connection type you can determine the type 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.350
 connections for which will be 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.060
 apply the created rule it can 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.430
 be all network connections 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.700
 local network connections or 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.110
 remote network connections 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.900
 Next, go to the verification methods tab. 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.650
 authenticity where we can add a method 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.650
 authentication 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.590
 and change the order 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.760
 authentication methods 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.510
 further for the created rule it is necessary 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.489
 create default filter created two 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.709
 filter list is full and blue 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.870
 full ip traffic to 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.660
 create a new ip filter list 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.470
 you must click add add set 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.470
 filter name 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.010
 create on removing the checkbox to use 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.620
 wizard click add next 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.370
 you must specify the ip address of the source 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.370
 values 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.480
 you can also select a protocol 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.590
 and set destination and source ports 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.230
 press the ok button 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.390
 further for the created filter it is necessary 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.319
 define the action come to the tab 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.810
 default actions and filter created 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.239
 three actions is a security query 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.370
 which allow unsafe communication on 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.330
 requires the client to apply methods 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.299
 trust security permit allows 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.739
 unsafe connection without any conditions 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.440
 need security breaking the connection 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.720
 with him spare clients if we want 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.220
 add new pre action 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.200
 need to uncheck use 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.200
 master click add 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.390
 further it is necessary to decide whether 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.579
 allow traffic blocking 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.430
 passing traffic for align 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.530
 security when choosing an item 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.070
 agree on security push the button 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.550
 add 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.100
 Further it is necessary to decide such 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.740
 the protocol will be used is ph 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.570
 or configure security manually when 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.690
 setting security options manually 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.820
 there is an opportunity to choose 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.320
 protocol combination your sec 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.090
 as well as various options and combinations 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.639
 integrity check algorithms and 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.570
 encryption is also possible 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:52.060
 set the key change parameters and 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.060
 session which is already set by default 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.910
 press the ok button after that our 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.400
 policy fully created work 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.320
 need to complete 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.320
 pressing the buttons apply and ok 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.520
 Daria need to assign our policy 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.080
 security for this choose the right 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.510
 click in the policy list 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.850
 security 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.720
 select the item to assign after this 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.890
 our security policy is assigned 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.720
 the same actions are necessary 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.690
 on all computers involved 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.540
 connections tools in windows server 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.800
 allows you to do this centrally on 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.800
 all domain computers
