00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 the road police department 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.639
 has acquired new weapons so that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.130
 inspectors can work 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.630
 and the great northern river was contemplated 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.990
 with these weapons 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.410
 today in mossoró a team came from 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.380
 to provide training 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.260
 when it should be used and which weapons 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.630
 are being brought here to the police 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.570
 I'll talk to the bus driver. 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.090
 inspector the osvaldo came from the 1st 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.530
 station and is ministering to the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.460
 training here in the city of mossoró 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.010
 pointed out that weapons are coming to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.489
 federal highway police are the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 Taurus point 40 submachine guns are 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 are weapons that were acquired in the year 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 passed by the police department 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.250
 federal highway are being 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.449
 distributed to the entire staff of both the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.760
 regional here of the great northern river 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.039
 like all over Brazil and since the year 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.320
 past the network has been 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.390
 federal highway police to do 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.799
 use of this weaponry and now it 's time to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 of us doing the training here at 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.420
 river and that mossoró and there 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.130
 we will enable all the effective and 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 I believe that at most in a month people 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.549
 will be with that weapon already available 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.170
 for colleagues worked in the south in the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.720
 your day to day service 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.330
 the inspector junced what the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.970
 characteristics of that weapon that 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.560
 these weapons come to work 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.170
 federal highway police 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.040
 we know it's an increase 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.130
 and crime and is an important 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.530
 and there is a demand of the forces 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.909
 police officers to acquire more 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.380
 efficient and safe 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.820
 even because it is a collection of the own 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.950
 society that police institutions 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.250
 acquired this type of equipment 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.670
 then in this sense is this weapon the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.310
 submachine gun point 40 she comes is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 bring this benefit is a weapon 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.960
 really try one has one 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.119
 greater portability 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.630
 she is a lighter one is a 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.759
 shooting capacity really is enough 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.860
 then it is a weapon to use 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.620
 day-to-day cop that really goes 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.830
 ease will improve 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.360
 is the coping of crime is going 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.700
 to make us really be 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.379
 more qualified and qualified to 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.459
 whether the provision of service to the 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.810
 society 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.390
 I do not know if this information can be 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.140
 provided but this weapon she has 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.230
 autonomy for how many shots without 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.069
 need to change the openphoto charger 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.709
 it is only she comes from the factory already with 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:45.980
 Chargers 30 able to try 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:48.590
 three ammunition and one and a half sound of 33 kaka is 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.420
 charger and let the weapons then 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.010
 it really gives you an autonomy for the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.720
 for coping well 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.760
 is quite reasonable that need and 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.040
 gauge how our our 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.340
 standard gauge which is the 40th point 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.750
 eucalyptus patterns of the police both 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.530
