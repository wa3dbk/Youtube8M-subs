not sure if you can see but I'm going to
just<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:44.960> yeah<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.380> fact<00:01:46.430> it's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
kind of warm so I don't think we should

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.249 
kind of warm so I don't think we should
ground<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> too<00:01:50.850> long<00:01:51.150> maybe<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.080> little

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
ground it too long maybe it's a little

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.700 
ground it too long maybe it's a little
bit<00:01:52.560> too<00:01:53.550> long<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.720> yeah<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.350> my<00:01:55.500> first

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
bit too long but yeah this is my first

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.090 
bit too long but yeah this is my first
time<00:01:56.040> experiment<00:01:56.880> using<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.630> 32<00:01:58.530> ounce<00:01:58.740> dry

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
time experiment using this 32 ounce dry

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.350 
time experiment using this 32 ounce dry
container<00:02:00.740> ground<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.979> coffee<00:02:02.280> bean<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.940> think

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
container ground my coffee bean I think

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.910 
container ground my coffee bean I think
the<00:02:03.420> result<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.899> pretty<00:02:04.759> pretty<00:02:05.759> unbelievable

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
the result is pretty pretty unbelievable

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.650 
the result is pretty pretty unbelievable
so<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> guess<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:08.519> gonna<00:02:08.670> use<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.330> grab<00:02:09.539> my
