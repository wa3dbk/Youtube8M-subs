00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
temple as you do have three diamonds

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.710 
temple as you do have three diamonds
inside<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.100> some<00:01:44.310> horse<00:01:44.579> armor<00:01:44.850> not<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
inside of it and some horse armor not to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.109 
inside of it and some horse armor not to
mention<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.820> dungeon<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:47.970> is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
mention you do have the dungeon which is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.670 
mention you do have the dungeon which is
located<00:01:48.600> right<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.530> maybe

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
located right there so you can maybe

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
located right there so you can maybe
make<00:01:49.950> an<00:01:50.100> XP<00:01:50.520> farm<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.030> something<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
make an XP farm or something like that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.240 
make an XP farm or something like that
so<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:51.930> pretty<00:01:52.229> unique<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:52.860> opinion

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
so that's pretty unique in my opinion

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.760 
so that's pretty unique in my opinion
now<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> final<00:01:54.450> thing<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.110> seed<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.680> the
