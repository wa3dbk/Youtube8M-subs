00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.969
 this was my first engine that hit 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.510
 1,800 rpm what has already been seen in the others 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:15.070
 videos then I made a new engine 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.480
 to make some new experiences 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.039
 similar with all measures of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.939
 course all it all totally equal to 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.630
 this motor here for a test of 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.630
 how is it working 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.099
 hence the initial match 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.750
 but motor demanded that the 1834 beak 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.750
 team maintains in 1550 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.820
 and now it's stopped working because 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.229
 You 're out of flames. 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.229
 underneath the flamingo 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.250
 good people made a hole with this exchange of 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:03.490
 one and a half millimeter cold to show 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.780
 that the engine works even with this leak 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:12.940
 of air with this role I provoke the flight of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.820
 air that the motor has a hole with the drill bit 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.160
 one and a half millimeters 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.410
 notice the movement of the piston how much 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.590
 that this paper moves from the place with 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.590
 a piece of furniture with the air flow through the hole 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.100
 see engine operation 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.530
 even removing 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.670
 with this engine air thing yet 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.670
 so it works very well 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.310
 this air leak is only allowed 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.760
 engine model here in which you use 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.099
 a steel wool piston inside 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.019
 why precisely because he is not so 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:05.159
 critical areas of dead or even 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.159
 with air leakage 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.170
 not being the same case for this same 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.560
 engine model here in which you use the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.829
 an internal piston with a red bull can 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.870
 and if you do not allow anything with dead 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.819
 much less shortness of breath 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.870
 if you have escaped area and this model does not 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.510
 it works 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.819
 however when they are to spin it 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.000
 to really function and have little 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.989
 power the motor works with this leak 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.470
 air 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.859
 but for that the engine on the board does not 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.870
 may have practically no friction 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.510
 see how they are working now 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.049
 from the crankshaft and without 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.810
 flame on it to rotate the shaft 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.940
 notice that it remains generating for a 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.930
 long time and before stopping 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.180
 completely it stays in this coming and going 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.549
 before stopping completely 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.599
 this means that the piston moves 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.440
 that is connected to the crankshaft has 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.440
 low friction 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:16.349
 only in this way that the motor 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.349
 will work with this air leak 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.240
 the next change I intend 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.479
 to do is to replace this balloon with 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.840
 option but this in which I cut to a 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:34.800
 50 ml syringe which will use this 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:41.310
 are graffited made by my friend 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:45.810
 nerd that will be introduced inside 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.819
 cylinders and so I will test for 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.289
 see how the engine will look like performance 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.289
 they conquer massive 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.949
 the cylinder of this engine has eight 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.719
 inches and a half in length 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.580
 this can said of the system of 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:03.409
 cooling system is four centimeters 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.050
 half length 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.990
 this pvc knee he is glued 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.499
 directly into that aluminum can that is 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:16.370
 the cylinder where I made that hole and put it 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:17.360
 with durepox glue was not used in his 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.340
 interior 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:25.180
 already the cold center is a can lid of 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:30.379
 spray is glued directly on top of this 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.879
 pvc knee on the inside with a 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.250
 bit of silicone glue to 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:37.490
 ensure the perfect seal on the 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.599
 outside I collaborated boxing so that he 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.339
 do not have an offset at the time of your 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.520
 job 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:49.669
 I even introduced a small 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.370
 20 mm pvc pipe inside the 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.189
 knee so that it had a 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.080
 half a centimeter where cached remember 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.819
 on top and I passed around as 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.949
 the operation of this engine with this 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.490
 leakage is only possible because the 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:06.560
 motor pull has low friction example 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.610
 an issue that whenever I always 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.849
 raised the simple displacement of the 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.180
 piston displaced inside the cylinder 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:20.120
 can move that can of the place or see 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.240
 that only the weight of that same can 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.699
 moving it does not move from the place 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.819
 another important detail in generating the 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.430
 the piston inside the cylinder. 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:36.289
 cylinder must remain in place 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:38.810
 this represents low friction but as 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:42.430
 can see in this video the piston does not 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.430
 has clearance inside the cylinder
