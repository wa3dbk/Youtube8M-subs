with<00:00:06.400> where<00:00:06.910> to<00:00:06.940> start

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 
with where to start

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.990 
with where to start
while<00:00:08.440> others<00:00:08.830> struggled<00:00:09.280> to<00:00:09.400> explain<00:00:09.790> what

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
while others struggled to explain what

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500 
while others struggled to explain what
they<00:00:10.120> believe<00:00:10.390> is<00:00:10.570> just<00:00:10.599> plain<00:00:10.990> obvious<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:13.389> in

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
they believe is just plain obvious so in

this means that if it is stated in the

then<00:01:00.190> we<00:01:00.310> can<00:01:00.460> automatically<00:01:01.380> definitively

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
then we can automatically definitively

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.829 
then we can automatically definitively
conclude<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:03.700> two<00:01:03.910> adjacent<00:01:04.449> angles

conclude that the two adjacent angles
that<00:01:05.649> it<00:01:05.859> forms<00:01:06.219> are<00:01:06.429> congruent<00:01:07.619> congruent

that it forms are congruent congruent

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.709 
that it forms are congruent congruent
angles<00:01:09.039> are<00:01:09.429> defined<00:01:09.819> as<00:01:09.999> angles<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.539> have

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
angles are defined as angles that have

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.590 
angles are defined as angles that have
equal<00:01:10.990> measures<00:01:11.999> again<00:01:12.999> this<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.479> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
equal measures again this is the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.469 
equal measures again this is the
definition<00:01:14.399> so<00:01:15.399> if<00:01:15.579> we<00:01:15.789> conclude<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.420> a

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
definition so if we conclude that a

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.499 
definition so if we conclude that a
couple<00:01:16.869> angles<00:01:17.380> are<00:01:17.530> congruent<00:01:17.679> then<00:01:18.369> we<00:01:19.329> can

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
couple angles are congruent then we can

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.440 
couple angles are congruent then we can
definitively<00:01:20.460> conclude<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:22.090> they<00:01:22.240> must

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
definitively conclude that they must

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.629 
definitively conclude that they must
have<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.020> same<00:01:23.229> measure<00:01:23.619> through<00:01:24.609> the

have the same measure through the
definition<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.719> congruent<00:01:26.200> angles

which<00:02:30.510> states<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.110> if<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.530> equals<00:02:31.920> B<00:02:32.160> and

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
which states that if a equals B and

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.900 
which states that if a equals B and
either<00:02:33.060> A<00:02:33.450> or<00:02:33.480> B<00:02:33.780> may<00:02:34.620> be<00:02:34.950> substituted<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.849> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
either A or B may be substituted for the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.180 
either A or B may be substituted for the
other<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.660> any<00:02:37.080> equation<00:02:37.590> or<00:02:38.160> inequality<00:02:38.959> and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
other in any equation or inequality and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.070 
other in any equation or inequality and
the<00:02:41.190> other<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.790> transitive<00:02:42.510> property<00:02:42.540> of

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
the other is the transitive property of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.559 
the other is the transitive property of
equality<00:02:43.349> which<00:02:43.980> looks<00:02:44.580> frankly<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> lot<00:02:45.390> like

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
equality which looks frankly a lot like

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.630 
equality which looks frankly a lot like
the<00:02:45.690> substitution<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.340> little<00:02:47.549> bit

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the substitution one it's a little bit

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.410 
the substitution one it's a little bit
different<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:48.630> states<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.430> equals<00:02:51.239> B

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
different it states that if a equals B

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.339 
different it states that if a equals B
and<00:02:51.690> B<00:02:52.370> equals<00:02:53.370> C<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.989> must<00:02:55.920> equal<00:02:56.220> C<00:02:57.349> the

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
and B equals C then a must equal C the

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.960 
and B equals C then a must equal C the
distinction<00:02:58.769> here<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.519> we're<00:02:59.700> talking

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
distinction here is that we're talking

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.610 
distinction here is that we're talking
about<00:03:00.090> an<00:03:00.299> entire<00:03:00.750> side<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.319> an<00:03:01.410> equation

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
about an entire side of an equation

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.970 
about an entire side of an equation
equaling<00:03:02.430> another<00:03:02.730> side<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.650> same<00:03:04.650> side

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
equaling another side that same side

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.009 
equaling another side that same side
equaling<00:03:05.459> 1/3<00:03:05.760> side<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.810> then<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:06.989> can

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
equaling 1/3 side and then we can

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.960 
equaling 1/3 side and then we can
basically<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.620> out<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.920> middleman<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.610> just

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
basically get out the middleman and just

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.520 
basically get out the middleman and just
say<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.390> first<00:03:09.630> thing<00:03:09.840> equal<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.319> last

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
say that the first thing equal the last

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.800 
say that the first thing equal the last
thing<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.640> that's<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.940> transitive<00:03:12.569> property

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
thing and that's the transitive property

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.120 
thing and that's the transitive property
of<00:03:13.349> equality<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.530> now<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.709> we've<00:03:16.950> reviewed

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
of equality so now that we've reviewed

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.039 
of equality so now that we've reviewed
all<00:03:17.400> these<00:03:17.670> properties<00:03:18.180> let's<00:03:18.480> take<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> look

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
all these properties let's take a look

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.729 
all these properties let's take a look
at<00:03:19.139> a<00:03:19.170> common<00:03:19.709> problem<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:22.950> diagram<00:03:23.540> X

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
at a common problem so in this diagram X

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.240 
at a common problem so in this diagram X
z-ray<00:03:25.739> X<00:03:26.040> Z<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.329> angle<00:03:27.840> bisector<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.829> angle

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
z-ray X Z is the angle bisector of angle

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.390 
z-ray X Z is the angle bisector of angle
Y<00:03:30.030> X<00:03:30.359> B<00:03:31.730> we<00:03:32.730> also<00:03:32.880> know<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.510> measure<00:03:33.840> of

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
Y X B we also know that the measure of

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.900 
Y X B we also know that the measure of
YX<00:03:35.400> z<00:03:36.120> equals<00:03:36.840> 58<00:03:37.290> degrees<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.190> we're

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
YX z equals 58 degrees and we're

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.640 
YX z equals 58 degrees and we're
supposed<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.239> find<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.930> measure<00:03:40.139> of<00:03:40.319> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
supposed to find the measure of the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.710 
supposed to find the measure of the
larger<00:03:41.010> angle<00:03:41.370> Y<00:03:42.209> X<00:03:42.510> B<00:03:44.299> now<00:03:45.299> if<00:03:45.480> you

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
larger angle Y X B now if you

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.509 
larger angle Y X B now if you
encountered<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.530> problem<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.160> quiz<00:03:47.489> or

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
encountered this problem on a quiz or

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.530 
encountered this problem on a quiz or
test<00:03:48.350> he<00:03:49.350> would<00:03:49.470> be<00:03:49.620> like<00:03:49.799> this<00:03:50.280> one<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.120> pretty

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
test he would be like this one is pretty

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.030 
test he would be like this one is pretty
pretty<00:03:51.840> easy<00:03:53.450> basically<00:03:54.450> since<00:03:54.959> Ray<00:03:55.500> XE<00:03:55.980> is

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
pretty easy basically since Ray XE is

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.059 
pretty easy basically since Ray XE is
the<00:03:56.220> bisector<00:03:56.910> then<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.200> larger<00:03:58.620> angle<00:03:58.980> is

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
the bisector then the larger angle is

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.610 
the bisector then the larger angle is
twice<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.819> smaller<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.750> if<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.170> take<00:04:01.349> 2

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
twice that of the smaller so if I take 2

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.449 
twice that of the smaller so if I take 2
times<00:04:02.040> 58<00:04:02.549> degrees<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.239> would<00:04:03.299> get<00:04:03.650> 116<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.950> I'm

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
times 58 degrees I would get 116 and I'm

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.979 
times 58 degrees I would get 116 and I'm
done<00:04:06.709> well<00:04:07.709> with<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.730> proof<00:04:09.000> it's<00:04:09.480> not<00:04:09.569> about

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
done well with the proof it's not about

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.140 
done well with the proof it's not about

right kind of make our way across so
what<00:04:38.949> concepts<00:04:39.430> did<00:04:39.639> we<00:04:39.729> use<00:04:40.029> to<00:04:40.270> get<00:04:40.419> from

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
what concepts did we use to get from

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:44.010 
what concepts did we use to get from
here<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:40.990> there<00:04:42.300> well<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.389> first<00:04:43.599> thing<00:04:43.810> is

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
here to there well the first thing is

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.709 
here to there well the first thing is
this<00:04:44.169> idea<00:04:44.349> of<00:04:44.590> an<00:04:44.710> angle<00:04:44.979> bisector<00:04:45.539> we<00:04:46.539> know

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:46.719 
this idea of an angle bisector we know

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.379 
this idea of an angle bisector we know
through<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.229> definition<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:48.639> it<00:04:49.029> creates

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
through the definition that it creates

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.980 
through the definition that it creates
two<00:04:49.689> adjacent<00:04:50.379> congruent<00:04:50.860> angles<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:52.360> we<00:04:52.749> can

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
two adjacent congruent angles so we can

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.439 
two adjacent congruent angles so we can
write<00:04:53.289> this<00:04:56.189> now<00:04:57.189> that<00:04:57.430> we<00:04:57.550> know<00:04:57.729> that<00:04:58.090> we<00:04:58.330> have

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
write this now that we know that we have

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.629 
write this now that we know that we have
two<00:04:58.689> congruent<00:04:58.960> angles<00:04:59.620> we<00:04:59.979> can<00:05:00.009> use<00:05:00.490> the

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
two congruent angles we can use the

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.279 
two congruent angles we can use the
definition<00:05:00.849> of<00:05:01.389> what<00:05:01.629> it<00:05:01.719> means<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:02.169> be

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
definition of what it means to be

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.649 
definition of what it means to be
congruent<00:05:02.710> to<00:05:03.550> conclude<00:05:03.969> that<00:05:04.180> these<00:05:04.360> two

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
congruent to conclude that these two

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:11.249 
congruent to conclude that these two
angles<00:05:05.110> have<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.349> same<00:05:05.650> measure<00:05:09.659> then<00:05:10.659> if<00:05:11.139> you

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
angles have the same measure then if you

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.260 
angles have the same measure then if you
take<00:05:11.439> a<00:05:11.469> look<00:05:11.650> at<00:05:11.800> this<00:05:11.889> other<00:05:12.159> given<00:05:12.759> piece<00:05:13.120> of

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
take a look at this other given piece of

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.140 
take a look at this other given piece of
information<00:05:14.189> we<00:05:15.189> can<00:05:15.219> combine<00:05:15.849> these<00:05:16.089> two

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
information we can combine these two

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.600 
information we can combine these two
things<00:05:16.629> and<00:05:17.050> use<00:05:17.379> the<00:05:17.650> transitive<00:05:18.430> property

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
things and use the transitive property

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:25.950 
things and use the transitive property
of<00:05:19.089> equality<00:05:19.389> to<00:05:20.349> conclude<00:05:20.830> this<00:05:24.659> and<00:05:25.659> now

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
of equality to conclude this and now

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.230 
of equality to conclude this and now
we're<00:05:26.650> gonna<00:05:26.740> go<00:05:26.949> to<00:05:27.009> our<00:05:27.069> postulate<00:05:27.819> and

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
we're gonna go to our postulate and

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.600 
we're gonna go to our postulate and
through<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.020> angle<00:05:29.409> addition<00:05:29.620> postulate<00:05:30.430> we

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
through the angle addition postulate we

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.339 
through the angle addition postulate we
know<00:05:30.789> that<00:05:30.969> we<00:05:31.060> can<00:05:31.240> add<00:05:31.509> these<00:05:31.839> two<00:05:31.900> angles

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
know that we can add these two angles

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.749 
know that we can add these two angles
and<00:05:33.870> have<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.080> sum<00:05:35.319> of<00:05:35.349> their<00:05:35.620> measures<00:05:35.759> equal

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
and have the sum of their measures equal

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.429 
and have the sum of their measures equal
the<00:05:36.909> measure<00:05:37.120> of<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.449> larger<00:05:37.810> angle<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:40.439> then

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:41.439 
the measure of the larger angle and then

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.010 
the measure of the larger angle and then
finally<00:05:42.189> with<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.879> substitution<00:05:43.719> property

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
finally with the substitution property

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.529 
finally with the substitution property
of<00:05:44.349> equality<00:05:44.649> we<00:05:45.550> know<00:05:45.729> that<00:05:45.939> we<00:05:46.060> can<00:05:46.240> replace

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
of equality we know that we can replace

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.059 
of equality we know that we can replace
these<00:05:47.080> two<00:05:47.379> values<00:05:48.270> for<00:05:49.270> these<00:05:49.389> two<00:05:49.659> angles

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
these two values for these two angles

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.719 
these two values for these two angles
and<00:05:51.360> then<00:05:52.360> through<00:05:52.689> simple<00:05:53.080> addition<00:05:53.620> we<00:05:54.460> have

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
and then through simple addition we have

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:02.040 
and then through simple addition we have
our<00:05:55.120> answer<00:05:57.659> whew<00:05:59.969> I'm<00:06:00.969> gonna<00:06:01.180> translate<00:06:01.629> this

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
our answer whew I'm gonna translate this

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.740 
our answer whew I'm gonna translate this
into<00:06:02.500> a<00:06:02.649> two<00:06:02.860> column<00:06:03.250> proof<00:06:03.460> by<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.300> way<00:06:04.479> that

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
one's called a flow proof what we want

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.959 
one's called a flow proof what we want
to<00:06:08.229> do<00:06:08.379> is<00:06:08.560> we<00:06:08.710> want<00:06:08.889> to<00:06:08.919> create<00:06:09.069> two<00:06:09.430> columns

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
to do is we want to create two columns

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.510 
to do is we want to create two columns
the<00:06:10.629> left<00:06:10.870> one<00:06:11.110> marked<00:06:11.469> statements<00:06:12.279> and<00:06:12.460> the

column and we're gonna number them in
logical<00:06:22.449> order<00:06:22.770> and<00:06:23.770> then<00:06:24.039> we're<00:06:24.219> going<00:06:24.370> to

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
logical order and then we're going to

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.639 
logical order and then we're going to
put<00:06:24.729> the<00:06:24.819> names<00:06:25.029> of<00:06:25.300> definitions<00:06:25.990> postulates

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:26.649 
put the names of definitions postulates

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:29.040 
put the names of definitions postulates
properties<00:06:27.099> and<00:06:27.279> theorems<00:06:27.460> that<00:06:27.669> we<00:06:27.879> used<00:06:28.360> to

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
properties and theorems that we used to

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.040 
properties and theorems that we used to
make<00:06:29.199> those<00:06:29.439> conclusions<00:06:30.189> on<00:06:30.399> the<00:06:30.460> right<00:06:31.060> and

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
make those conclusions on the right and

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.059 
make those conclusions on the right and
it's<00:06:32.169> very<00:06:32.229> important<00:06:33.009> that<00:06:34.050> you<00:06:35.050> keep<00:06:35.709> the

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.069 
it's very important that you keep the

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:37.490 
it's very important that you keep the
numbers

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
numbers

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.029 
numbers
so<00:06:37.830> any<00:06:38.189> anything<00:06:38.970> that<00:06:39.150> you've<00:06:39.330> concluded<00:06:40.039> so

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
so any anything that you've concluded so

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.800 
so any anything that you've concluded so
let's<00:06:41.250> say<00:06:41.370> we<00:06:41.490> concluded<00:06:41.970> this<00:06:42.210> in<00:06:42.569> step

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
let's say we concluded this in step

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.339 
let's say we concluded this in step
three<00:06:43.229> we<00:06:44.220> need<00:06:44.430> to<00:06:44.639> say<00:06:44.909> what<00:06:45.180> definition<00:06:46.020> or

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
three we need to say what definition or

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.740 
three we need to say what definition or
postulate<00:06:46.919> that<00:06:47.129> we<00:06:47.280> use<00:06:47.699> to<00:06:48.180> make<00:06:48.479> that

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
postulate that we use to make that

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.499 
postulate that we use to make that
conclusion<00:06:48.990> on<00:06:49.500> step<00:06:50.340> three<00:06:50.699> on<00:06:50.909> the<00:06:51.150> reasons

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:51.509 
conclusion on step three on the reasons

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:55.969 
conclusion on step three on the reasons
aside<00:06:52.849> and<00:06:53.849> another<00:06:54.840> rule<00:06:55.110> is<00:06:55.139> that<00:06:55.469> you<00:06:55.620> your

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
aside and another rule is that you your

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.730 
aside and another rule is that you your
logic<00:06:56.340> should<00:06:56.490> progress<00:06:56.699> from<00:06:57.150> top<00:06:57.389> to<00:06:57.419> bottom

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
logic should progress from top to bottom

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.469 
logic should progress from top to bottom
so<00:06:58.740> if<00:06:59.009> you<00:06:59.189> want<00:06:59.430> to<00:06:59.490> use<00:06:59.669> a<00:06:59.699> piece<00:07:00.030> of<00:07:00.060> given

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
so if you want to use a piece of given

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.659 
so if you want to use a piece of given
information<00:07:00.719> to<00:07:01.289> make<00:07:01.469> a<00:07:01.530> conclusion<00:07:02.159> you

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
information to make a conclusion you

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:04.480 
information to make a conclusion you
have<00:07:02.699> to<00:07:03.150> make<00:07:03.300> sure<00:07:03.479> that<00:07:03.659> you<00:07:03.780> state<00:07:04.199> it

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
have to make sure that you state it

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.200 
have to make sure that you state it
before<00:07:05.490> you<00:07:05.729> use<00:07:05.969> it<00:07:07.430> now<00:07:08.430> why<00:07:08.759> do<00:07:08.819> we<00:07:09.030> go

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
before you use it now why do we go

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.029 
before you use it now why do we go
through<00:07:09.240> all<00:07:09.629> of<00:07:09.659> this<00:07:09.960> what<00:07:10.349> what<00:07:10.620> are<00:07:10.740> proofs

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
through all of this what what are proofs

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.610 
through all of this what what are proofs
all<00:07:11.280> about<00:07:11.550> and<00:07:12.539> why<00:07:12.780> do<00:07:12.840> we<00:07:13.050> really<00:07:13.349> have<00:07:13.500> to

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
all about and why do we really have to

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.439 
all about and why do we really have to
justify<00:07:14.009> our<00:07:14.250> logic<00:07:14.610> in<00:07:14.729> this<00:07:14.879> way<00:07:15.030> when<00:07:15.300> the

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:15.449 
justify our logic in this way when the

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.369 
justify our logic in this way when the
solution<00:07:15.870> frankly<00:07:16.319> is<00:07:16.440> pretty<00:07:16.979> obvious<00:07:18.379> well

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:19.379 
solution frankly is pretty obvious well

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:22.550 
solution frankly is pretty obvious well
we're<00:07:20.159> practicing<00:07:20.789> like<00:07:21.000> any<00:07:21.180> skill<00:07:21.560> because

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
we're practicing like any skill because

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.140 
we're practicing like any skill because
when<00:07:23.009> you<00:07:23.129> get<00:07:23.310> into<00:07:23.460> higher<00:07:23.759> level

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
when you get into higher level

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.059 
when you get into higher level
mathematics<00:07:24.330> and<00:07:25.259> you<00:07:25.409> develop<00:07:25.800> all<00:07:25.949> these

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:26.069 
mathematics and you develop all these

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:27.830 
mathematics and you develop all these
brilliant<00:07:26.490> theories<00:07:27.180> that<00:07:27.360> no<00:07:27.539> one's<00:07:27.719> ever

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 
brilliant theories that no one's ever

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.830 
brilliant theories that no one's ever
thought<00:07:28.139> of<00:07:28.349> and<00:07:28.849> you<00:07:29.849> turn<00:07:30.120> around<00:07:30.150> and<00:07:30.719> you

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 
thought of and you turn around and you

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.689 
thought of and you turn around and you
need<00:07:30.990> to<00:07:31.110> explain<00:07:31.590> them<00:07:31.830> and<00:07:31.979> justify<00:07:32.400> them<00:07:32.580> to

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 
need to explain them and justify them to

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:34.670 
need to explain them and justify them to
your<00:07:32.819> peers<00:07:33.150> who<00:07:33.449> have<00:07:33.479> you<00:07:33.779> not<00:07:34.110> yet<00:07:34.409> thought

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
your peers who have you not yet thought

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.999 
your peers who have you not yet thought
of<00:07:34.740> them<00:07:35.629> if<00:07:36.629> you<00:07:36.870> can't<00:07:37.139> justify<00:07:37.590> them

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:38.009 
of them if you can't justify them

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:40.219 
of them if you can't justify them
through<00:07:38.400> accepted<00:07:39.180> definitions<00:07:39.960> and

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:40.229 
through accepted definitions and

through accepted definitions and
theorems<00:07:40.500> and<00:07:41.099> and<00:07:41.400> methods<00:07:42.180> then<00:07:42.629> they're

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
theorems and and methods then they're

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.069 
theorems and and methods then they're
just<00:07:42.930> gonna<00:07:43.259> think<00:07:43.590> you're<00:07:43.740> crazy
