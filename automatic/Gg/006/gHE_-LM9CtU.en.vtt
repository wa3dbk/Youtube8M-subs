continue talking a little bit about 2012
I<00:00:04.410> know<00:00:04.830> there's<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.279> lot<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.549> UFO<00:00:06.500> enthusiasts

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
I know there's a lot of UFO enthusiasts

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.890 
I know there's a lot of UFO enthusiasts
out<00:00:07.589> there<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.120> just<00:00:09.300> wanted<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.599> share

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
what I learned in the rainforest when i

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.419 
what I learned in the rainforest when i
was<00:00:12.240> there<00:00:12.269> were<00:00:12.509> terence<00:00:12.840> mckenna<00:00:13.429> alexander

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
shulgin i was there with epinal botanist

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.390 
shulgin i was there with epinal botanist
and<00:00:17.250> shamans<00:00:18.090> from<00:00:18.330> all<00:00:18.510> over<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> world<00:00:18.840> and

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
and shamans from all over the world and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
and shamans from all over the world and
i<00:00:20.400> really<00:00:21.710> didn't<00:00:22.710> think<00:00:22.949> about<00:00:23.310> UFOs<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.140> know

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
i really didn't think about UFOs or know

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140 
i really didn't think about UFOs or know
anything<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:25.590> UFOs<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.760> they<00:00:26.970> all

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
anything about UFOs but they all

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
anything about UFOs but they all
believed<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.630> UFOs<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.380> also<00:00:28.560> believe

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
believed in UFOs and they also believe

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
believed in UFOs and they also believe
that<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.310> Mayan<00:00:29.609> calendar<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:30.420> directly

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that the Mayan calendar was directly

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.930 
that the Mayan calendar was directly
related<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.830> us<00:00:32.540> communicating<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:34.200> other

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
related to us communicating with other

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
related to us communicating with other
conscious<00:00:35.940> beings<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> universe<00:00:37.100> they

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
conscious beings in the universe they

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.910 
conscious beings in the universe they
believe<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.360> Mayan<00:00:39.570> calendar<00:00:39.920> was

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
believe that the Mayan calendar was

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.540 
believe that the Mayan calendar was
actually<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.489> universal<00:00:42.239> timing<00:00:43.079> system<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
actually a universal timing system that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.430 
actually a universal timing system that
would<00:00:44.670> enable<00:00:45.030> beings<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.989> across<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
would enable beings from across the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.709 
would enable beings from across the
universe<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.340> communicate<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.300> each<00:00:48.450> other

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
universe to communicate with each other

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.740 
universe to communicate with each other
in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> same<00:00:49.860> time<00:00:50.309> realm<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:51.480> instance

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
in the same time realm for instance

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
in the same time realm for instance
we're<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> third<00:00:52.289> dimension<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.980> there

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
we're in the third dimension but there

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.340 
we're in the third dimension but there
are<00:00:53.309> beings<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:53.910> dimensions<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> also

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
are beings and other dimensions and also

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.420 
are beings and other dimensions and also
you<00:00:55.980> know<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.309> does<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:56.969> April<00:00:57.420> 11

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
you know what does you know April 11

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.380 
you know what does you know April 11
2011<00:00:59.430> mean<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.449> somebody<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.649> instance<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
2011 mean to somebody for instance in

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.820 
2011 mean to somebody for instance in
octos<00:01:03.390> ok<00:01:04.019> they're<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.650> their<00:01:04.799> own

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
octos ok they're going to have their own

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.890 
octos ok they're going to have their own
if<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.909> conscious<00:01:06.390> beings<00:01:06.720> there

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
if there is conscious beings there

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.820 
if there is conscious beings there
they're<00:01:07.080> gonna<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.290> their<00:01:07.320> own<00:01:07.439> timing

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
they're gonna have their own timing

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.350 
they're gonna have their own timing
system<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> they're<00:01:08.700> dealing<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.090> in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
system that they're dealing with in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
system that they're dealing with in
their<00:01:09.479> solar<00:01:09.750> system<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.229> relates<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.740> them

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
their solar system that relates to them

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399 
their solar system that relates to them
well<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.930> scientists

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
well the one thing that the scientists

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.030 
well the one thing that the scientists
thought<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.380> where<00:01:16.380> everybody

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
thought was that where everybody

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.219 
thought was that where everybody
connected<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:17.880> through<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> 13th<00:01:18.659> frequency

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
connected was through the 13th frequency

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.980 
connected was through the 13th frequency
or<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> space<00:01:20.100> frequency<00:01:20.820> which<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.720> lot<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
or the space frequency which a lot of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.469 
or the space frequency which a lot of
people<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.130> Einstein<00:01:23.610> even<00:01:24.060> mentioned

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
people you know Einstein even mentioned

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450 
people you know Einstein even mentioned
he<00:01:24.600> thought<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> space<00:01:25.799> could<00:01:26.070> possibly

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
he thought that the space could possibly

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.929 
he thought that the space could possibly
be<00:01:26.729> God<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.750> space<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.229> 99.9<00:01:29.130> percent

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
be God because of space is 99.9 percent

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.270 
be God because of space is 99.9 percent
of<00:01:30.030> everything<00:01:30.380> yet<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.560> don't<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.950> anything

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
of everything yet we don't know anything

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.069 
of everything yet we don't know anything
about<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.729> except<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.450> has<00:01:33.720> amazing

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
about it except that it has amazing

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.600 
about it except that it has amazing
energy<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.900> orgo<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.320> chi<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:38.040> life

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
energy in it and orgo or chi or life

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.310 
energy in it and orgo or chi or life
force<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.799> I<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.640> found<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.320> very

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
force and I really found that very

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.130 
force and I really found that very
interesting<00:01:43.590> because<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.250> 4<00:01:44.399> 99.99<00:01:45.140> percent

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
interesting because of 4 99.99 percent

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.120 
interesting because of 4 99.99 percent
space<00:01:46.890> or<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.700> connecting<00:01:48.329> force<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.619> mean

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
space or this connecting force that mean

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.289 
space or this connecting force that mean
some<00:01:50.790> people<00:01:51.149> might<00:01:51.329> refer<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.259> divine

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
some people might refer to as divine

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
some people might refer to as divine
then<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.570> means<00:01:54.810> we're<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.799> little<00:01:56.520> bit

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
then that means we're just a little bit

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.359 
then that means we're just a little bit
material<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.680> much<00:01:59.040> more

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
material so we have much more

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.700 
material so we have much more
possibilities<00:02:00.240> available<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:01.079> us<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.530> mean

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
possibilities available to us and I mean

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.440 
possibilities available to us and I mean
half<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.219> don't<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.520> most<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.090> our<00:02:03.210> brain

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
half we don't have most of our brain

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.280 
half we don't have most of our brain
turned<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.960> or<00:02:04.290> DNA<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:05.070> connected<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:05.850> so

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
turned on or DNA all connected right so

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.779 
turned on or DNA all connected right so
anything's<00:02:07.290> possible<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:07.799> anyway<00:02:08.220> back<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
anything's possible but anyway back to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.540 
anything's possible but anyway back to
their<00:02:09.060> theories<00:02:09.450> on

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
their theories on

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.240 
their theories on
aliens<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.780> Mayan<00:02:11.990> calendar<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.010> they

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
aliens and the Mayan calendar so they

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.940 
aliens and the Mayan calendar so they
believe<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.990> Mayans<00:02:14.990> had<00:02:15.080> actually<00:02:15.680> come

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
believe that Mayans had actually come

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.230 
believe that Mayans had actually come
from<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:17.240> planetary<00:02:18.700> solar<00:02:19.700> system<00:02:20.060> rather

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
from the planetary solar system rather

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.570 
from the planetary solar system rather
the<00:02:20.600> solar<00:02:20.780> system<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.260> tourists<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.070> from

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
the solar system of tourists and from

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.300 
the solar system of tourists and from
the<00:02:22.700> planet<00:02:23.090> Maya<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.620> closest

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
the planet Maya that is the closest

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.270 
the planet Maya that is the closest
planet<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.970> Sun<00:02:26.330> up<00:02:26.540> cork<00:02:26.930> taurus<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.680> the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
planet to the Sun up cork taurus and the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.360 
planet to the Sun up cork taurus and the
way<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.730> mines<00:02:28.940> talked<00:02:29.240> about<00:02:30.040> 2012<00:02:31.040> was<00:02:31.220> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
way the mines talked about 2012 was that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.790 
way the mines talked about 2012 was that
we<00:02:31.490> were<00:02:31.610> going<00:02:31.820> online<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.990> we<00:02:33.410> were<00:02:33.620> going

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
we were going online that we were going

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.700 
we were going online that we were going
to<00:02:33.950> hook<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.330> much<00:02:35.660> larger<00:02:35.960> base<00:02:36.440> of

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
to hook up to a much larger base of

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.530 
to hook up to a much larger base of
conscious<00:02:37.190> beings<00:02:37.670> because<00:02:38.240> we'd<00:02:38.510> been

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
conscious beings because we'd been

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.050 
conscious beings because we'd been
separated<00:02:39.050> in<00:02:39.530> our<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.160> know<00:02:40.190> linear<00:02:40.730> time

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
separated in our you know linear time

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.180 
separated in our you know linear time
third<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.810> know<00:02:41.930> third<00:02:42.140> dimension<00:02:42.650> where

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
third you know third dimension where

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.500 
third you know third dimension where
they<00:02:43.370> had<00:02:43.490> been<00:02:43.670> communicating<00:02:44.240> on<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.330> much

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
they had been communicating on a much

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.080 
they had been communicating on a much
higher<00:02:44.750> level<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.220> 2012<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.940> going

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
higher level and that so 2012 is going

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.240 
higher level and that so 2012 is going
to<00:02:47.150> be<00:02:47.210> a<00:02:47.240> consciousness<00:02:47.960> shift<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.920> also

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
to be a consciousness shift that also

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.460 
to be a consciousness shift that also
involved<00:02:49.490> us<00:02:49.820> getting<00:02:50.180> more<00:02:50.420> divine<00:02:51.110> and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
involved us getting more divine and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.970 
involved us getting more divine and
loving<00:02:51.890> because<00:02:52.420> according<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.720> them<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.260> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
loving because according to them if the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.700 
loving because according to them if the
connection<00:02:55.250> was<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.360> frequency<00:02:56.990> or<00:02:57.470> this

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
connection was this frequency or this

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.060 
connection was this frequency or this
that<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.370> also<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.750> consciousness<00:02:59.750> right<00:03:00.440> then

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
that is also a consciousness right then

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.610 
that is also a consciousness right then
they<00:03:01.880> wouldn't<00:03:02.180> let<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.360> warring<00:03:02.870> planet<00:03:03.020> like

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
they wouldn't let a warring planet like

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.420 
they wouldn't let a warring planet like
Earth<00:03:03.890> get<00:03:04.520> into<00:03:04.820> any<00:03:05.180> more<00:03:06.160> connection<00:03:07.160> with

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
Earth get into any more connection with

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.790 
Earth get into any more connection with
more<00:03:07.640> beings<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.300> in<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.840> way<00:03:09.170> they're

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
more beings and in that way they're

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.250 
more beings and in that way they're
protected<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.390> know<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.720> hear<00:03:11.990> a<00:03:12.020> lot<00:03:12.080> of

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
protected so I you know I hear a lot of

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260 
protected so I you know I hear a lot of
people<00:03:12.380> talking<00:03:12.710> about<00:03:12.920> UFOs<00:03:13.460> in<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.090> negative

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
people talking about UFOs in a negative

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.930 
people talking about UFOs in a negative
way<00:03:14.830> or<00:03:15.830> aliens<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.850> negative<00:03:17.000> way<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:19.610> I'm

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
way or aliens in a negative way so I'm

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.670 
way or aliens in a negative way so I'm
not<00:03:19.970> really<00:03:20.090> sure<00:03:20.300> how<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.840> relates<00:03:21.230> because

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
not really sure how that relates because

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.620 
not really sure how that relates because
from<00:03:21.890> what<00:03:22.130> they're<00:03:22.340> talking<00:03:22.760> about<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.420> have

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
from what they're talking about you have

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.870 
from what they're talking about you have
to<00:03:23.750> be<00:03:23.840> more<00:03:23.989> conscious<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.920> even<00:03:25.280> get

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
to be more conscious to even get

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.490 
to be more conscious to even get
connected<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:26.450> maybe<00:03:26.660> they're<00:03:26.930> not<00:03:27.140> connected

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
connected so maybe they're not connected

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.979 
connected so maybe they're not connected
to<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.890> mind<00:03:28.160> like<00:03:28.640> whole<00:03:29.090> but<00:03:29.420> basically

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
to the mind like whole but basically

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.440 
to the mind like whole but basically
they<00:03:30.800> thought<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.459> was<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.610> timing<00:03:32.030> system

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
they thought that it was a timing system

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.130 
they thought that it was a timing system
so<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:34.100> know<00:03:35.560> like<00:03:36.560> i<00:03:36.680> said<00:03:36.709> april

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
so that you know like i said april

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.310 
so that you know like i said april
eleventh<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.410> in<00:03:40.040> Mayan<00:03:40.820> maybe<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.900> know<00:03:41.989> like

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
eleventh in in Mayan maybe you know like

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.750 
eleventh in in Mayan maybe you know like
thirteenth<00:03:43.310> frequency<00:03:44.980> akbar<00:03:45.980> or<00:03:46.340> something

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
thirteenth frequency akbar or something

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.220 
thirteenth frequency akbar or something
you<00:03:46.940> know<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.270> could<00:03:47.450> be<00:03:47.570> totally<00:03:47.780> something

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
you know it could be totally something

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.949 
you know it could be totally something
different<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:49.340> anyway<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.300> thought<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:50.840> guys

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
different so anyway I thought you guys

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.560 
different so anyway I thought you guys
might<00:03:51.170> be<00:03:51.230> interested<00:03:51.380> in<00:03:51.890> that<00:03:52.040> because<00:03:52.250> hey

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
might be interested in that because hey

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.850 
might be interested in that because hey
um<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:54.700> lot<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.820> people<00:03:56.090> think<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.860> there's

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
um a lot of people think that there's

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.380 
um a lot of people think that there's
other<00:03:58.220> beings<00:03:58.820> out<00:03:59.000> there<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.360> are

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
other beings out there that are

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.600 
other beings out there that are
conscious<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.410> UFOs<00:04:00.830> might<00:04:01.100> be<00:04:01.250> showing

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
conscious and that UFOs might be showing

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.350 
conscious and that UFOs might be showing
up<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:03.080> just<00:04:03.980> wanted<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.459> say<00:04:04.550> the

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
up and I just wanted to say the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.930 
up and I just wanted to say the
scientists<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.020> I<00:04:06.170> was<00:04:06.440> there<00:04:06.680> with

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
scientists that I was there with

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.870 
scientists that I was there with
surprisingly<00:04:07.959> also<00:04:08.959> thought<00:04:09.260> that<00:04:09.920> aliens

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
surprisingly also thought that aliens

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.470 
surprisingly also thought that aliens
could<00:04:11.300> show<00:04:11.540> up<00:04:11.720> in<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.709> around<00:04:12.860> 2012<00:04:13.459> or<00:04:13.760> that

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
could show up in and around 2012 or that

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.539 
could show up in and around 2012 or that
they<00:04:14.600> were<00:04:14.660> already<00:04:15.080> around<00:04:15.470> us<00:04:15.709> in<00:04:15.890> other
