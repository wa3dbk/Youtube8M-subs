00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.319 
the oven those tiny bit of water to very
quickly<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:41.340> steam<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:41.820> helps<00:01:42.180> them

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
quickly into steam which helps them

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.929 
quickly into steam which helps them
actually<00:01:42.450> pull<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.110> rise<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:44.549> mixture<00:01:44.880> is

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
actually pull up and rise the mixture is

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.789 
actually pull up and rise the mixture is
obviously<00:01:45.299> still<00:01:45.390> warm<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.470> hold<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
obviously still warm but we can hold it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.100 
obviously still warm but we can hold it
for<00:01:46.829> 10<00:01:47.070> seconds<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:47.939> fine<00:01:48.119> we<00:01:48.840> need<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
for 10 seconds so it's fine we need to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.430 
for 10 seconds so it's fine we need to
know<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.950> three<00:01:50.430> eggs

start<00:02:08.450> beating<00:02:08.930> it<00:02:09.530> goes<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:10.640> mix<00:02:10.820> ego<00:02:11.090> is

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
start beating it goes the mix ego is

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.210 
start beating it goes the mix ego is
weird<00:02:11.420> because<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.930> going<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.290> looks<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:13.130> you

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
weird because it going to looks but you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.550 
weird because it going to looks but you
want<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.430> keep<00:02:13.570> keep<00:02:14.570> going<00:02:14.870> at<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.380> it'll

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
want to keep keep going at it and it'll

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.320 
want to keep keep going at it and it'll
eventually<00:02:15.800> all<00:02:16.370> come<00:02:16.610> together<00:02:16.790> into<00:02:17.780> one

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
eventually all come together into one

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.510 
eventually all come together into one
Bess<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.900> know<00:02:21.020> one<00:02:21.230> lump<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.740> mixture<00:02:24.520> to

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
Bess you know one lump of mixture to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.550 
Bess you know one lump of mixture to
give<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.700> an<00:02:25.760> example<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.210> how<00:02:26.450> thick<00:02:27.380> it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
give you an example of how thick it

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.530 
give you an example of how thick it
should<00:02:27.770> be<00:02:27.980> it's<00:02:28.970> all<00:02:29.270> going<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.480> come

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
should be it's all going to come

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.000 
should be it's all going to come
together<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:30.020> should<00:02:30.170> be<00:02:30.230> nice<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.410> shiny<00:02:30.800> at

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
together it should be nice and shiny at

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.510 
together it should be nice and shiny at
this<00:02:31.130> point<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.000> then<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.270> drops<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:33.520> about

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
this point but then it drops to about

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.250 
this point but then it drops to about
that<00:02:34.760> consistency<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.720> retaining<00:02:36.110> a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
that consistency so it is retaining a

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.770 
that consistency so it is retaining a
bit<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.530> its<00:02:36.650> shape<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:38.030> obviously<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.660> will

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
bit of its shape but obviously it will

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.710 
bit of its shape but obviously it will
be<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.960> bit<00:02:39.110> winning<00:02:39.350> that's<00:02:39.950> perfect<00:02:40.640> need<00:02:41.600> to

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
be a bit winning that's perfect need to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.920 
be a bit winning that's perfect need to
get<00:02:41.840> packing<00:02:42.170> bag<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.720> Ricky's<00:02:44.720> made

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
get packing bag of it Ricky's made

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.320 
get packing bag of it Ricky's made
filling<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.290> piping<00:02:45.650> bag<00:02:45.760> pull<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.790> bit<00:02:47.000> slightly

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
filling a piping bag pull a bit slightly

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.070 
filling a piping bag pull a bit slightly
back<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:48.140> get<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.350> cup<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:50.600> then<00:02:50.720> obviously

probably won't all fit in now on to the
very<00:03:01.040> concrete<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:04.370> want<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.610> pipe<00:03:04.820> just

very concrete you want to pipe just

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.830 
very concrete you want to pipe just
slightly<00:03:05.989> bigger<00:03:06.260> than<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.739> 2p<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:08.480> straight

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
slightly bigger than a 2p just straight

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.479 
slightly bigger than a 2p just straight
up<00:03:10.120> if<00:03:11.120> i<00:03:11.239> were<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.540> spike<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.989> on<00:03:12.110> top<00:03:12.489> just

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
the top and then i'll make them nice and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.740 
the top and then i'll make them nice and
even<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.160> oven<00:03:19.400> instead<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.390> having<00:03:20.540> other

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
even in the oven instead of having other

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.190 
even in the oven instead of having other
piece<00:03:21.430> now<00:03:22.430> they're<00:03:22.670> ready<00:03:22.790> into<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.239> oven<00:03:23.360> so

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
piece now they're ready into the oven so

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.290 
piece now they're ready into the oven so
we've<00:03:24.530> got<00:03:24.680> an<00:03:24.769> oven<00:03:25.100> that's<00:03:25.370> pre<00:03:25.760> heated<00:03:26.090> to

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
we've got an oven that's pre heated to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.479 
we've got an oven that's pre heated to
200<00:03:26.690> degrees<00:03:27.230> c<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.860> then<00:03:28.010> they<00:03:28.160> need<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.400> go

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
200 degrees c and then they need to go

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:40.730 
200 degrees c and then they need to go
straight<00:03:29.090> in

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.520 

so<00:03:41.370> they've<00:03:41.610> been<00:03:41.730> open<00:03:42.330> 15<00:03:42.600> minutes<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.410> you

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
so they've been open 15 minutes and you

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.350 
so they've been open 15 minutes and you
should<00:03:43.770> be<00:03:43.800> able<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.190> shake<00:03:44.400> them<00:03:44.580> off<00:03:44.670> then

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
should be able to shake them off then

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.260 
should be able to shake them off then
the<00:03:45.540> bottom<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.050> all<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.230> them<00:03:46.560> make<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> hole
