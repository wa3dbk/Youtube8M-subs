 sautéed and so here is that 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.229
 I sauteed ingredients on this here 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.640
 from the now that is the aromatic herbs I am 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.649
 for saute that is fantastic is 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.229
 really practical parmesan 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.840
 grated reggiano or so or classic 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.189
 however you tell us you extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 olive me on this bio here 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.369
 salfino stracchino i always do that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.850
 the colors and the rest of the organic brand are 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.490
 here bio biological growth then 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.259
 of course the broccoli then you can 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.939
 choose two types of bread that 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.939
 both bread are good here 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.950
 Mediterranean because dad is six pieces 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.770
 inclining to the lidl or else this here 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.799
 Mediterranean bread ropes but a family 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.560
 which is found in the copy of the baskets of the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.420
 bread are you choose a little you are to say the least 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.229
 little the same then what you find 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.780
 ok take your piadine sandwiches 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.010
 call them whatever you want and put them 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.340
 on the baking sheet with a card outside 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.410
 then you do take the crescenza 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.190
 cut into slices with the show 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.620
 so go and put so on the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.180
 victim we put ours 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.420
 in short, the same stracchino growth 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.310
 identical house then we take ours 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.840
 nag roio locates before I did 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.280
 soothe me I recommend provided 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.290
 dedicated to say it I did it on vuol 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.380
 say I made it soften and now it 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.370
 I'm going to put it on, I don't need that 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.060
 cool it is fine even hot 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.730
 our broccoli is indifferent and fair 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.910
 now let's go get the sauté 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.040
 because it gives us something more than it is 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.020
 color both of visual aspect and of 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.820
 taste and I like it a lot 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.430
 there is a dish not just good 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.870
 but it must also be beautiful to the eye 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:07.780
 for me of course then tastes look 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:10.090
 what a beautiful colored plate now 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.709
 we take the Parmesan cheese and there 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.480
 let's go and give a light dusting 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.130
 above then they go if you want it more 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.980
 plenty of it so put it now one 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.550
 sprinkled there is a poverty not a pinch 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.550
 of salt is a little oil 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.650
 here it is 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.570
 done and now not enough salt 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.990
 we exaggerate because however the salt is not 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.420
 that does so well but neither 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.030
 eat the tasteless and just things here 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.310
 done now 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.440
 fire we were forgetting about 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.120
 lines also put this if it is of 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.120
 your liking I like it a lot 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.460
 and 15 lovato add only on two the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.550
 chili pepper and gives us a particular taste 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.880
 I love that so many savona I really like it 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.770
 so let's fire 200 degrees until the 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.900
 growth will not be dissolved and of atel 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.060
 and here she is very good girls there 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.730
 I guarantee try it and let me know 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.730
