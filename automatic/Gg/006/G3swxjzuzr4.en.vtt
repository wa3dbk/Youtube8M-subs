the<00:00:18.750> touchpad<00:00:19.109> has<00:00:19.470> been<00:00:19.619> redesigned<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the touchpad has been redesigned a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.220 
the touchpad has been redesigned a
little<00:00:20.430> bit<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.760> still<00:00:21.300> features<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.930> thing

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
little bit it still features one thing

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.480 
little bit it still features one thing
that's<00:00:22.470> very<00:00:22.590> similar<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> original

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that's very similar to the original

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.009 
that's very similar to the original
touchpad<00:00:24.180> which<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.600> there<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.840> no

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
touchpad which is that there are no

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.230 
touchpad which is that there are no
distinct<00:00:25.619> buttons<00:00:25.949> neither<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> left<00:00:27.119> or

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
distinct buttons neither on the left or

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450 
distinct buttons neither on the left or
right<00:00:27.359> side<00:00:27.599> or<00:00:27.990> underneath<00:00:28.140> instead<00:00:29.130> those

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
right side or underneath instead those

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.849 
right side or underneath instead those
buttons<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:30.090> actually<00:00:30.630> integrated<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
buttons are actually integrated so you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.660 
buttons are actually integrated so you
can<00:00:32.130> left<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.940> right<00:00:33.510> click<00:00:33.930> by<00:00:34.800> pushing<00:00:35.309> down

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
can left and right click by pushing down

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.940 
can left and right click by pushing down
on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.940> touchpad<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> while<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> actually

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
on the touchpad and while this actually

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430 
on the touchpad and while this actually
lets<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> save<00:00:38.460> space<00:00:39.079> it<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> little

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
lets you save space it can be a little

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.220 
lets you save space it can be a little
bit<00:00:40.590> difficult<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.010> use<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.329> some<00:00:42.329> respects<00:00:42.690> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
bit difficult to use in some respects so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.029 
bit difficult to use in some respects so
for<00:00:44.010> example<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.329> typing<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
for example if I'm typing and I want to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.420 
for example if I'm typing and I want to
move<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> mouse<00:00:47.610> around<00:00:48.649> or<00:00:49.649> move<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.039> cursor

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
move the mouse around or move the cursor

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.700 
move the mouse around or move the cursor
to<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> certain<00:00:51.239> point<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.809> works<00:00:51.989> fine<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.590> I'm

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
to a certain point it works fine if I'm

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.260 
to a certain point it works fine if I'm
doing<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.039> one-handed<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.789> move<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> cursor

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
doing it one-handed you move the cursor

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.930 
doing it one-handed you move the cursor
you<00:00:55.260> click<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> point<00:00:56.190> where<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.489> want<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
you click to the point where you want to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.340 
you click to the point where you want to
and<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.600> ahead<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> adjust<00:00:57.960> things

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and you can go ahead and adjust things

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.040 
and you can go ahead and adjust things
but<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.969> you're<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> sort<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> person<00:01:00.510> who

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
but if you're the sort of person who

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.709 
but if you're the sort of person who
tends<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.760> finger<00:01:03.000> hovering<00:01:03.539> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
tends to have one finger hovering so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.390 
tends to have one finger hovering so
that<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.019> click<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:05.010> happens<00:01:05.280> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that you can click what happens is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.039 
that you can click what happens is
you'll<00:01:05.519> move<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.060> mouse<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> certain<00:01:06.840> point

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
you'll move the mouse to a certain point

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.490 
you'll move the mouse to a certain point
and<00:01:07.260> suddenly<00:01:07.740> it'll<00:01:08.100> jump<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:09.500> your

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and suddenly it'll jump because your

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.580 
and suddenly it'll jump because your
finger<00:01:10.890> might<00:01:11.250> push<00:01:11.970> down<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.689> slide<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
finger might push down or slide on the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
finger might push down or slide on the
screen<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.610> too<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.390> not

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
screen a little bit too much if it's not

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.710 
screen a little bit too much if it's not
in<00:01:15.810> exactly<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.409> right<00:01:16.530> location<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
in exactly the right location so you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
in exactly the right location so you
mean<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.110> click<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.830> instead<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.820> move<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
mean to click and instead you move the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.170 
mean to click and instead you move the
mouse<00:01:22.189> that<00:01:23.189> said<00:01:23.640> its

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
mouse that said its

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.450

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
overall it's got a nice texture to it I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850 
overall it's got a nice texture to it I
don't<00:01:27.390> knows<00:01:27.869> myself<00:01:28.170> having<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.500> problem
