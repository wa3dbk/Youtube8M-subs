years<00:05:33.630> yes<00:05:34.380> we've<00:05:35.040> talked<00:05:35.250> a<00:05:35.370> little<00:05:35.520> bit

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
years yes we've talked a little bit

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.400 
years yes we've talked a little bit
about<00:05:35.820> that<00:05:36.000> on<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.150> podcast<00:05:36.420> and<00:05:37.020> it's<00:05:37.200> like

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
about that on the podcast and it's like

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.770 
about that on the podcast and it's like
when<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.010> if<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.640> really<00:05:39.090> want<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.390> get<00:05:39.540> rid

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
when the if you really want to get rid

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.710 
when the if you really want to get rid
of<00:05:39.810> drugs<00:05:40.350> you<00:05:41.010> have<00:05:41.220> to<00:05:41.400> make<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.700> so<00:05:41.730> bad<00:05:42.270> that

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
of drugs you have to make it so bad that

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.260 
of drugs you have to make it so bad that
they<00:05:42.960> people<00:05:43.440> go<00:05:43.560> it's<00:05:43.800> just<00:05:44.490> not<00:05:44.670> worth<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:45.090> if

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
they people go it's just not worth it if

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.210 
they people go it's just not worth it if
it's<00:05:45.480> not<00:05:45.750> that<00:05:45.990> bad<00:05:46.200> it's<00:05:46.530> like<00:05:46.710> well<00:05:46.980> I<00:05:47.010> think

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
it's not that bad it's like well I think

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.770 
it's not that bad it's like well I think
he<00:05:47.640> might<00:05:47.820> be<00:05:47.880> on<00:05:48.090> it<00:05:48.210> because<00:05:48.330> he<00:05:48.450> has<00:05:48.540> a<00:05:48.570> good

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
he might be on it because he has a good

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.990 
he might be on it because he has a good
doctor<00:05:49.170> and<00:05:49.290> I<00:05:49.920> might<00:05:50.130> make<00:05:50.280> more<00:05:50.460> money<00:05:50.640> and

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
doctor and I might make more money and

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.330 
doctor and I might make more money and
it's<00:05:51.570> probably<00:05:51.900> worth<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.290> now<00:05:52.800> it's<00:05:53.070> like<00:05:53.190> the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
it's probably worth it now it's like the

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.220 
it's probably worth it now it's like the
tests<00:05:53.820> are<00:05:53.940> stringent<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.810> penalties

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
tests are stringent and the penalties

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.320 
tests are stringent and the penalties
are<00:05:55.260> brutal<00:05:55.620> it's<00:05:56.040> not<00:05:56.310> worth<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:56.700> you<00:05:57.090> are

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
are brutal it's not worth it you are

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.850 
are brutal it's not worth it you are
going<00:05:57.510> to<00:05:57.570> notice<00:05:57.750> if<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.170> really<00:05:58.530> watch<00:05:58.710> a

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
going to notice if you really watch a

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.830 
going to notice if you really watch a
lot<00:05:58.950> of<00:05:59.010> fights<00:05:59.310> a<00:05:59.580> lot<00:05:59.760> of<00:06:00.150> guys<00:06:00.300> even<00:06:00.570> ones

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
lot of fights a lot of guys even ones

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.630 
lot of fights a lot of guys even ones
that<00:06:00.990> you<00:06:01.350> don't<00:06:01.530> think<00:06:01.770> are<00:06:01.950> on<00:06:02.040> steroids<00:06:02.250> I

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
that you don't think are on steroids I

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.100 
that you don't think are on steroids I
suddenly<00:06:03.000> look<00:06:03.270> at<00:06:03.390> a<00:06:03.420> little<00:06:03.600> smaller<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:04.020> a

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
suddenly look at a little smaller and a

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.390 
suddenly look at a little smaller and a
little<00:06:04.320> softer<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:04.860> that's<00:06:05.010> probably<00:06:05.130> going

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
little softer and that's probably going

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.820 
little softer and that's probably going
to<00:06:05.490> be<00:06:05.550> 15<00:06:06.540> to<00:06:06.570> 20<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:07.170> drop<00:06:07.380> weight<00:06:07.590> classes

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
to be 15 to 20 the drop weight classes

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.740 
to be 15 to 20 the drop weight classes
in<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.190> next<00:06:08.490> year<00:06:08.760> and<00:06:08.910> that's<00:06:09.420> not<00:06:09.720> a

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
in the next year and that's not a

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.480 
in the next year and that's not a
judgment<00:06:10.050> on<00:06:10.410> him<00:06:10.590> this<00:06:10.740> was<00:06:10.950> an<00:06:11.040> environment

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
judgment on him this was an environment

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.160 
judgment on him this was an environment
to<00:06:11.640> be<00:06:11.670> a<00:06:11.850> judge<00:06:12.120> me<00:06:12.450> but<00:06:12.660> there<00:06:12.840> was<00:06:12.960> an

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
to be a judge me but there was an

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.990 
to be a judge me but there was an
environment<00:06:13.920> that<00:06:13.950> was<00:06:14.100> created<00:06:14.400> where<00:06:14.940> it

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
environment that was created where it

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.510 
environment that was created where it
was<00:06:15.380> safer<00:06:16.380> for<00:06:16.620> these<00:06:16.740> people<00:06:16.920> to<00:06:17.040> do<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.370> than

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
was safer for these people to do it than

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.430 
was safer for these people to do it than
not<00:06:17.640> do<00:06:17.850> it<00:06:17.970> that's<00:06:18.360> been<00:06:18.570> taken<00:06:18.900> away<00:06:18.990> now<00:06:19.230> and

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
not do it that's been taken away now and

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.230 
not do it that's been taken away now and

good on the UFC / doing that that's the

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.970 
good on the UFC / doing that that's the
way<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.390> do<00:06:21.540> it<00:06:21.690> for<00:06:21.900> all<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.200> talk<00:06:22.410> about<00:06:22.800> you

way to do it for all the talk about you

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.340 
way to do it for all the talk about you
know<00:06:23.100> we<00:06:23.280> need<00:06:23.550> more<00:06:23.910> stringent<00:06:24.360> drug<00:06:24.750> testing

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
know we need more stringent drug testing

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.760 
know we need more stringent drug testing
when<00:06:25.770> there's<00:06:25.980> an<00:06:26.130> actual<00:06:26.930> face<00:06:27.930> attached<00:06:28.530> to
