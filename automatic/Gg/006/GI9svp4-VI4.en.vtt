00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
matured or a striker but that would

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
matured or a striker but that would
never<00:00:46.079> work<00:00:46.200> out<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.250> his<00:00:47.280> work<00:00:47.550> rates

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
