millimeters

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:52.610 

you<00:00:51.989> can't<00:00:52.260> hit<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.470> hole

-<00:01:53.620> cutter<00:01:57.990> cutter<00:01:59.610> yeah<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.880> sure<00:02:01.270> told<00:02:01.570> me<00:02:01.720> to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
- cutter cutter yeah I sure told me to

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
- cutter cutter yeah I sure told me to
put<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.200> cup<00:02:02.500> mm-hmm<00:02:03.900> changing<00:02:04.900> doing<00:02:07.800> it

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
put in the cup mm-hmm changing doing it

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.640 
put in the cup mm-hmm changing doing it
didn't<00:02:09.160> tell<00:02:09.340> me<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.640> change<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.060> color<00:02:10.650> you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
didn't tell me to change the color you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.000 
didn't tell me to change the color you
just<00:02:11.710> have<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.280> know<00:02:13.770> one<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
just have to know one of the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:40.059 
just have to know one of the
instructions

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:53.570 

okay<00:02:47.480> when<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.569> decode<00:02:49.430> he<00:02:50.430> has<00:02:50.700> 180<00:02:52.580> DSP

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
okay when the decode he has 180 DSP

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:13.800 
okay when the decode he has 180 DSP
regularly

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:26.460 

don't<00:03:14.440> even<00:03:14.650> work<00:03:16.290> with<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.440> shoulder

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.890 

let's<00:03:27.100> change<00:03:27.490> this<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.760> three<00:03:28.360> millimeter

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
let's change this to three millimeter

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:55.210 
let's change this to three millimeter
3.5

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:12.000 

okay<00:03:59.330> standard

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
start to fart in the shoulder - let's

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.679 
start to fart in the shoulder - let's
try<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:14.949> again

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:18.689 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:28.859 

it's<00:05:19.689> too<00:05:19.930> far<00:05:20.199> over<00:05:27.360> that's<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.599> shoulder

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:28.869 
it's too far over that's the shoulder

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:34.320 
it's too far over that's the shoulder
step<00:05:32.849> ok

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
step ok

00:05:34.330 --> 00:06:32.879 
step ok
nah<00:05:34.990> that's<00:05:35.349> the<00:05:35.529> shoulder<00:05:36.509> can't<00:05:37.509> be<00:05:37.719> anymore

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889

mmm-hmm compared to the original no I
didn't<00:07:20.479> cut<00:07:20.809> all<00:07:20.930> the<00:07:21.080> way<00:07:21.259> into<00:07:21.439> the<00:07:21.650> cut<00:07:21.889> yeah

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:22.189 
didn't cut all the way into the cut yeah

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:24.820 
didn't cut all the way into the cut yeah
yeah<00:07:22.879> not<00:07:23.419> compared<00:07:23.809> to<00:07:23.840> the<00:07:23.960> original<00:07:24.050> but<00:07:24.559> it

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:26.659 
can't compare you can't compare and

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:30.129 
can't compare you can't compare and
didn't<00:07:26.960> cut<00:07:27.110> the<00:07:27.199> key<00:07:28.180> other<00:07:29.180> cuts<00:07:29.749> correct

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:30.139 
didn't cut the key other cuts correct

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:38.979 
didn't cut the key other cuts correct
looking<00:07:30.680> on<00:07:30.830> though<00:07:32.680> yeah<00:07:35.080> good<00:07:36.080> me
