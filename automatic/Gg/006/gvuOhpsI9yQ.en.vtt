a<00:00:10.410> little<00:00:10.800> liquid<00:00:11.250> nitrogen<00:00:15.500> the<00:00:16.500> reaction<00:00:17.039> we

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
a little liquid nitrogen the reaction we

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.880 
a little liquid nitrogen the reaction we
sometimes<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.359> did<00:00:19.230> they<00:00:19.350> did<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.650> liquid

sometimes get is did they did for liquid

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.540 
sometimes get is did they did for liquid
nitrogen<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> floor<00:00:20.720> yes<00:00:21.720> yes<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.500> did<00:00:22.550> one

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
nitrogen on the floor yes yes we did one

nitrogen on the floor yes yes we did one
thing<00:00:23.789> people<00:00:24.060> seem<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> problem<00:00:24.840> with

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
thing people seem to have a problem with

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.550 
thing people seem to have a problem with
is<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.859> mess<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.400> liquid<00:00:26.730> nitrogen<00:00:26.760> makes

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
is the mess that liquid nitrogen makes

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.120 
is the mess that liquid nitrogen makes
happily<00:00:28.580> there<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.789> no<00:00:30.090> mess<00:00:30.769> liquid<00:00:31.769> nitrogen

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
happily there is no mess liquid nitrogen

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.139 
happily there is no mess liquid nitrogen
boils<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.730> 77<00:00:33.660> Kelvin<00:00:33.840> that's<00:00:34.820> 196<00:00:35.820> degrees

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
boils at 77 Kelvin that's 196 degrees

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.889 
boils at 77 Kelvin that's 196 degrees
below<00:00:36.390> zero<00:00:36.870> Celsius<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:38.360> 321<00:00:39.360> degrees<00:00:39.510> below

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
below zero Celsius or 321 degrees below

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.799 
below zero Celsius or 321 degrees below
zero<00:00:40.260> Fahrenheit<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.760> room<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.180> way<00:00:42.480> hotter

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
zero Fahrenheit the room is way hotter

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
zero Fahrenheit the room is way hotter
when<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> nitrogen<00:00:44.129> touches<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> rug<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
when the nitrogen touches the rug it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.119 
when the nitrogen touches the rug it
boils<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> changes<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> gas

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
boils and changes to a gas

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.479 
boils and changes to a gas
so<00:00:47.579> no<00:00:48.210> mess<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.140> rug<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> also<00:00:49.890> useful<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
so no mess the rug is also useful and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.040 
so no mess the rug is also useful and
that<00:00:50.579> keeps<00:00:50.850> liquid<00:00:51.239> nitrogen<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.750> spot

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that keeps liquid nitrogen in one spot

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
that keeps liquid nitrogen in one spot
if<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:53.039> pour<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> liquid<00:00:53.489> nitrogen<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.030> smooth

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
if we pour the liquid nitrogen on smooth

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
if we pour the liquid nitrogen on smooth
surface<00:00:54.750> skinners<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.680> over<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> place<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
surface skinners all over the place it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.610 
surface skinners all over the place it
could<00:00:56.789> cause<00:00:56.940> trouble<00:00:57.300> elsewhere<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:58.379> does

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
could cause trouble elsewhere it does

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
could cause trouble elsewhere it does
this<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.399> liquid<00:00:59.550> ends<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.000> floating

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
this because the liquid ends up floating

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
this because the liquid ends up floating
on<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.840> layer<00:01:00.989> gas<00:01:01.260> due<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> the

people<00:01:04.530> raise<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.339> call<00:01:05.580> odh<00:01:06.090> or

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
people raise is what we call odh or

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.590 
people raise is what we call odh or

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.170 
nitrogen boils the gas that's made takes

up a lot more space the gas then mixes

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.390 
up a lot more space the gas then mixes

of oxygen that's available reduce it too
much<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.640> we're<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.509> problems

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
much and we're going to have problems

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.820 
much and we're going to have problems

19.5%<00:01:28.939> if<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> take<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> look<00:01:30.509> around<00:01:30.630> you'll

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
19.5% if you take a look around you'll

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.649 
19.5% if you take a look around you'll
see<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.619> we're<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> fairly<00:01:32.100> big<00:01:32.400> space<00:01:32.659> we

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
see that we're in a fairly big space we

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.149 
see that we're in a fairly big space we
know<00:01:33.840> how<00:01:34.049> much<00:01:34.200> nitrogen<00:01:34.439> expands<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
know how much nitrogen expands when it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.429 
know how much nitrogen expands when it
changes<00:01:35.520> from<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> liquid<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> gas<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.600> we

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
changes from a liquid to a gas and we

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.020 
changes from a liquid to a gas and we
know<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> volume<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> room<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.909> can

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
know the volume of the room so we can

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.520 
know the volume of the room so we can
calculate<00:01:39.240> how<00:01:39.600> much<00:01:39.720> nitrogen<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.350> bring

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
calculate how much nitrogen we can bring

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.830 
calculate how much nitrogen we can bring
in<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.700> room<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.030> works<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> 30

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
in here for this room it works out to 30

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
in here for this room it works out to 30
liters<00:01:43.430> typically<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.670> don't<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.000> more<00:01:45.119> than

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
liters typically we don't have more than

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960 
liters typically we don't have more than
10<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.530> were<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> spill<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.610> nice<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
10 if we were to spill all the nice we

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.340 
10 if we were to spill all the nice we
brought<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.079> time

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
brought in here all at one time

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.069 
brought in here all at one time
we'd<00:01:50.040> still<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.369> well<00:01:50.759> above<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.360> odh<00:01:51.810> alarm

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
we'd still be well above the odh alarm

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.219 
we'd still be well above the odh alarm
threshold<00:01:53.180> thanks<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.360> watching<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.930> hope

threshold thanks for watching I hope
you'll<00:01:55.409> join<00:01:55.439> us<00:01:55.619> again<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> what's<00:01:57.810> next

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you'll join us again so what's next

you'll join us again so what's next
well<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.130> was<00:01:59.399> thinking<00:01:59.790> we<00:01:59.909> could<00:02:00.030> do
