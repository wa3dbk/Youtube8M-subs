00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
the race is going to get started it's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.090 
the race is going to get started it's
pretty<00:01:59.690> intense<00:02:00.020> race<00:02:00.320> it's<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.800> lot<00:02:01.040> shorter

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
pretty intense race it's a lot shorter

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.370 
pretty intense race it's a lot shorter
than<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.820> other<00:02:01.850> one<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:02.750> think<00:02:02.870> it's<00:02:03.170> all

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
than the other one so I think it's all

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.260 
than the other one so I think it's all
going<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.620> come<00:02:03.680> down<00:02:04.010> to<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.250> few<00:02:04.550> seconds<00:02:05.180> I

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
going to come down to a few seconds I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.120 
going to come down to a few seconds I
just<00:02:05.990> long<00:02:06.200> jump<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.590> cross<00:02:06.770> because<00:02:06.950> I

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
just long jump the cross because I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.680 
just long jump the cross because I
thought<00:02:07.310> it'd<00:02:07.430> be<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> better<00:02:07.760> idea<00:02:07.910> especially

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
thought it'd be a better idea especially
