00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
sweating some stuff because he does have

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.450 
sweating some stuff because he does have
an<00:01:18.630> 87<00:01:19.140> pace<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.650> maybe<00:01:20.220> not<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
an 87 pace and then maybe not the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
an 87 pace and then maybe not the
greatest<00:01:20.670> defensive<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.299> heading<00:01:21.600> stats<00:01:21.840> but

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
greatest defensive and heading stats but

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
greatest defensive and heading stats but
it's<00:01:22.170> still<00:01:22.350> not<00:01:22.590> too<00:01:22.650> bad<00:01:23.009> either<00:01:23.220> Vincent

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it's still not too bad either Vincent

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.510 
it's still not too bad either Vincent
Kompany<00:01:24.360> who<00:01:24.810> had<00:01:25.020> an<00:01:25.200> ok<00:01:25.890> season<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> be

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Kompany who had an ok season to be

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.499 
Kompany who had an ok season to be
honestly<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:27.090> why<00:01:27.210> he's<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.420> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
honestly that's why he's got that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.960 
honestly that's why he's got that
overall<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.930> greater<00:01:28.290> plus<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.189> there<00:01:29.729> he

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
overall a greater plus one and there he

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.359 
overall a greater plus one and there he
fits<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.659> 37<00:01:31.110> games<00:01:31.350> five<00:01:31.740> goals<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
fits in with out 37 games five goals and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.490 
fits in with out 37 games five goals and
106<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.150> actually<00:01:33.270> not<00:01:33.479> too<00:01:33.659> bad<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
106 which is actually not too bad for a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.649 
106 which is actually not too bad for a

and got one goal and four assists which
is<00:01:58.079> still<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.649> amazing<00:01:59.130> compared<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> his

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

is still not amazing compared to his
previous<00:01:59.909> season<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
previous season I don't think now the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.170 
previous season I don't think now the
other<00:02:02.219> center<00:02:02.579> back<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> pinch<00:02:03.090> that

other center back to pinch that
defensive<00:02:03.780> line<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.590> Gary<00:02:04.890> Cahill

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
defensive line just it is Gary Cahill

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.280 
defensive line just it is Gary Cahill
and<00:02:05.520> he<00:02:06.060> had<00:02:06.180> again<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.719> really<00:02:07.020> good<00:02:07.170> season

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and he had again a really good season

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.589 
and he had again a really good season
could<00:02:07.680> possibly<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.310> been<00:02:08.489> 84<00:02:09.149> rated

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
could possibly have been 84 rated

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.690 
could possibly have been 84 rated
overall<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.560> opinion<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.220> I've<00:02:11.310> kept<00:02:11.550> him

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
overall in my opinion but I've kept him

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.750 
overall in my opinion but I've kept him
low<00:02:11.879> enough<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.420> because

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
low enough just because

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.460 
low enough just because
you<00:02:13.269> know<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.599> could<00:02:13.780> be<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.080> young<00:02:14.290> and

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
you know it could be a young and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.530 
you know it could be a young and
upgrading<00:02:14.860> by<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.189> much<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:15.939> you<00:02:16.060> scrubs

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
upgrading by that much but you scrubs

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.110 
upgrading by that much but you scrubs
two<00:02:16.780> goals<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:17.230> two<00:02:17.349> assists<00:02:17.709> in<00:02:17.829> his<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.129> 47

one<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.500> going<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.769> be<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.980> left<00:02:42.220> mid<00:02:42.489> hazard

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
one is going to be the left mid hazard

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.509 
one is going to be the left mid hazard
left<00:02:43.750> wing<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.260> course<00:02:44.680> he's<00:02:44.950> obviously<00:02:45.190> a

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
left wing of course he's obviously a

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.130 
left wing of course he's obviously a
doubtful<00:02:45.879> Kevin<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.390> left<00:02:46.659> wing<00:02:46.900> position

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
incredibly bad girls to game ratio and

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.839 
incredibly bad girls to game ratio and
his<00:03:17.530> assist<00:03:17.859> is<00:03:18.010> still<00:03:18.220> quite<00:03:18.549> good<00:03:18.730> the

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
you know is I think that's all he's

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.059 
you know is I think that's all he's
going<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> get<00:03:22.930> off<00:03:23.139> you'll<00:03:23.379> be<00:03:23.410> upgraded<00:03:23.919> or

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.470 
going to get off you'll be upgraded or
downgraded<00:03:24.730> he<00:03:24.819> probably<00:03:25.060> stayed<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.449> same

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
downgraded he probably stayed the same

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.080 
downgraded he probably stayed the same

and you've got decent stats Oscar you

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.909 
and you've got decent stats Oscar you
again<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.510> think<00:03:28.720> will<00:03:29.019> be<00:03:29.139> upgraded<00:03:29.530> by<00:03:29.650> one
