00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.850
 hi this is fabien support for 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.139
 point com families so I'm 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.920
 always in my rock trip of three 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.199
 weeks in the American West 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.080
 today i am in portland a little 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.710
 sector not very known but very nice 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.980
 and I take advantage of his last rays of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.480
 Sun 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.270
 this beautiful end of the day for you 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 do a little video on how to lift 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.199
 agree mo5 years to all so the mode 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 backpack is what use the most 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.489
 the Americans here me I do more the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.930
 butterfly method I showed you that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.280
 in another video 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.010
 the backpack method is pretty healthy and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.030
 it's very convenient everything starts with the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 end of the rope so far so good 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.780
 I'm doing 2 big arm length like 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.699
 it e2 and I leave the taste of canton 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 but eventually I'll use it later 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.780
 from there I will lift the map 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.639
 as follows usually ie 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.999
 I take a tÃ©oz from the bass behind 

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:01.620
 my neck and had my right hand with a 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.350
 kid I come to get the banquet from 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.030
 right hand on slides so 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.820
 it's with a right to pick it up and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.979
 wind 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.700
 h had I slid and at each 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:17.910
 time I go from a left manuk and that's 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.910
 all the agreement 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.720
 now I have a shell is good 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.670
 bad that bending his middle and there I 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.980
 come get both of them both ends 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.940
 this one is the one of just now 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:39.500
 and this is this here so I leave 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.800
 there too a good length of rope 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.800
 under each arm 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.289
 that's what I'm going to do is that 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.289
 I will catch both 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.509
 and I'm going to come close the bag or those 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.509
 this 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.930
 Once 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.930
 two times 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.909
 Oh 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.710
 once I do that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:23.299
 I kill you well term we note accor I 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.299
 come and pass the rope inside 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.090
 omar 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.450
 shot and I come to cap the tack like 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.450
 Yes Yes 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.720
 here 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.250
 this cognac where I serve more I serve more 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.140
 fire 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:58.010
 and I 'm moving here I have a record 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.560
 hold it's less pretty than you have but 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.730
 finally it's very convenient because 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.600
 that's where the new bag comes from 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.800
 back 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.870
 you can put it in the water 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.590
 by who 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.099
 and with these two points there I come 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.099
 closed 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.620
 ok here I'm doing a little flat knot 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.620
 all stupid 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.069
 and I have a nice backpack 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.760
 again 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.639
 which allows to wear it very 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.230
 practical and if I have a backpack is 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:40.450
 over backpack just enough just 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.450
 to have a little bit longer to see 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.159
