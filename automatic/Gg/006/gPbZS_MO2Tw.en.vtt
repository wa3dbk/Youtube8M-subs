40s<00:00:55.680> Adam<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> them<00:00:56.730> did<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.600> I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
40s Adam and some of them did not so I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.459 
40s Adam and some of them did not so I
have<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.170> researched<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.850> yet<00:01:00.469> also

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
have not researched that as of yet also

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.280 
have not researched that as of yet also
I<00:01:01.500> believe<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.180> sunshade<00:01:03.750> doesn't

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
I believe that the sunshade doesn't

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
I believe that the sunshade doesn't
belong<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.680> either<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.430> again<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> haven't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
belong there either but again I haven't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.700 
belong there either but again I haven't
researched<00:01:06.750> these<00:01:07.110> yeah<00:01:07.350> also<00:01:08.310> look<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
researched these yeah also look at the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.810 
researched these yeah also look at the
this<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:11.010> nub<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.670> sticks<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
this little nub that sticks out and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.840 
this little nub that sticks out and
messes<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> number<00:01:15.360> scheme<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.960> slightly<00:01:16.320> I

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
messes the number scheme up slightly I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
messes the number scheme up slightly I
believe<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> vent<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> cab<00:01:20.310> but

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
believe that is a vent for the cab but

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.410 
believe that is a vent for the cab but
I'm<00:01:20.729> not<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:24.200> close-up<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> trucks<00:01:26.420> fuel

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:27.280 

these<00:03:14.720> run<00:03:15.049> really<00:03:15.440> smooth<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.129> slow

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.589 

when<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:27.950> get<00:03:28.189> the<00:03:28.310> last<00:03:28.579> unit<00:03:29.120> in<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.360> light

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
when I get the last unit in the light

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:39.880 
when I get the last unit in the light
here<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:34.810> on<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:36.019> last<00:03:36.260> unit<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:39.590> has<00:03:39.859> the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
here so and on the last unit it has the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:50.620 
here so and on the last unit it has the
pump-action<00:03:40.579> brake<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:43.239> front

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.630 

they<00:03:51.170> did<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.350> nice<00:03:51.620> job<00:03:51.650> with<00:03:52.130> this<00:03:52.280> paint

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
they did a nice job with this paint

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.490 
they did a nice job with this paint
scheme<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.150> only<00:03:53.360> problem<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.020> they<00:03:54.230> goofed

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
scheme the only problem is they goofed

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.120 
scheme the only problem is they goofed
on<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.920> numbers<00:03:55.310> as<00:03:55.670> usual<00:03:56.560> they're<00:03:57.560> too<00:03:57.890> big

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
on the numbers as usual they're too big

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.390 
on the numbers as usual they're too big
this<00:03:58.790> particular<00:03:59.060> unit<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:01.070> look<00:04:01.250> at

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
this particular unit if you look at

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.970 
this particular unit if you look at
prototype<00:04:02.000> pictures<00:04:02.510> have<00:04:02.810> very<00:04:03.140> very<00:04:03.530> small

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
prototype pictures have very very small

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.670 
prototype pictures have very very small
unique<00:04:04.730> numbers<00:04:05.270> to<00:04:05.540> conrail<00:04:06.080> i'm<00:04:06.290> not<00:04:06.500> sure

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
unique numbers to conrail i'm not sure

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.820 
unique numbers to conrail i'm not sure
why<00:04:06.920> but<00:04:07.540> yeah<00:04:08.540> i'm<00:04:09.020> just<00:04:09.350> going<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.560> leave<00:04:09.800> it

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
why but yeah i'm just going to leave it

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:18.640 
why but yeah i'm just going to leave it
like<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.190> is<00:04:10.490> because<00:04:10.880> it<00:04:11.060> looks<00:04:11.270> good

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.050

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
and you can see the Selective power good

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.320 
and you can see the Selective power good

don't like about these units everything
looks<00:04:53.690> good<00:04:53.960> on<00:04:54.199> them<00:04:54.380> except<00:04:55.010> for<00:04:55.220> one<00:04:55.400> thing

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729

the<00:04:56.120> dynamic<00:04:56.720> brakes<00:04:57.050> i'm<00:04:57.380> disappointed

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
the dynamic brakes i'm disappointed

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.279 
the dynamic brakes i'm disappointed
these<00:05:00.500> were<00:05:00.830> ex<00:05:01.100> rail<00:05:01.910> power<00:05:03.820> shells<00:05:05.289> that

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
these were ex rail power shells that

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.029 
these were ex rail power shells that
they<00:05:06.530> used<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.780> dynamic<00:05:09.410> brakes<00:05:09.740> could

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
they used and the dynamic brakes could

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.760 
they used and the dynamic brakes could
look<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.370> lot<00:05:10.580> better<00:05:10.849> than<00:05:11.210> they<00:05:11.360> do<00:05:11.770> the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
look a lot better than they do the

look a lot better than they do the
radiators<00:05:13.460> look<00:05:13.760> good<00:05:14.000> on<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.330> back<00:05:14.599> the<00:05:15.380> fans

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
a few minutes but this dynamic brake is

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.670 
a few minutes but this dynamic brake is
disappointing<00:05:22.490> because<00:05:22.639> it<00:05:22.849> is<00:05:22.970> not<00:05:23.180> correct

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
disappointing because it is not correct

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.370 
disappointing because it is not correct
it's<00:05:24.680> close<00:05:25.099> but<00:05:25.460> it's<00:05:25.639> not<00:05:25.849> correct<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:26.599> it

just irritates me but not enough to not

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.240 
just irritates me but not enough to not
buy<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.560> units<00:05:31.190> because<00:05:31.849> they<00:05:32.030> do<00:05:32.090> look<00:05:32.479> good

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250
