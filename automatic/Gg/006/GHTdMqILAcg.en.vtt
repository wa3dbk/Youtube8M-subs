00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 After a little guide on Holi in y 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.360
 holly fell of course this is not her strength 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.970
 Of course most of this is the target of forces 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.980
 but oh e he can heal a lot 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.240
 calm thanks to that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.800
 and he comes out on top gps and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:33.810
 so first see those characteristics 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 who need to swing floor holly 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.400
 and the most important characteristic is 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.870
 intelligence meaning power 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.670
 ohila increases 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.680
 spell critical strike 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.460
 i.e 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.550
 you can 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:58.540
 inflict crit and thereby drive off large 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.540
 the amount of hp second important 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:10.560
 stud is the spirit that is 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.560
 mana combat is a very important thing 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.350
 After all, sometimes a man may not be enough to fight 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.350
 since there is a very big damage on the raid 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.380
 and mana replenishment but necessary 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.590
 this time in 5 seconds is replenished means 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.659
 additional stats 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.510
 does this speed mean which is mine 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.070
 now not pumped 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.380
 mastery 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.060
 skill she puts a shield on the player 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.000
 who constantly saw off the character 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.560
 such a gradual speed off it 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.960
 casting speed here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.159
 nothing like that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.159
 crit is not particularly important 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.500
 spell power is understandable 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.350
 here we are 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.270
 Here I have a speed of 20 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.650
 so 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.650
 further we go talents 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.340
 I have talents but simple that is 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.340
 first dash 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.080
 there are no important talents there is no who you 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.350
 like to choose 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.250
 no difference 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.550
 the second through the same there is no difference and it is 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.000
 t in e maybe here I will ask is not useful 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.000
 pavia 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:47.240
 his friend chose to stun mobs 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.760
 farther 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.380
 Here I had a choice between these 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.480
 by three 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:00.880
 at first I chose the eternal flame so very 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.880
 much otshilivat but it targeted everyone 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.750
 and 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.470
 sacred shield of laziness and he took but he to me 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.170
 not useful 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.080
 and here selfless healer passive 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.129
 ability i mean look like this 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.359
 happens 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:20.440
 successful justice applied 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.819
 justice with us here it is from justice 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.319
 so you 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.220
 apply justice to you 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.910
 one energy charge accumulates 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.910
 light energy 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.170
 thereby 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.150
 ditch ring sweaters that is all but still 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.260
 one plus of this talent 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.819
 what if this is passivka works 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.439
 that 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.099
 fascinate you will increase speed 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.990
 casting spells holy radiance 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:55.060
 divine light and some kind there 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.060
 a flash of light 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.250
 it was he 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.710
 is useful 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:07.250
 I have him further well 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.960
 I do not know how these two 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.730
 thanks to this talent we can 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.760
 use a plan 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.710
 twice to see the salvation of the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.710
 counted 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.710
 femininity 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.310
 farther 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.780
 there is a divine plan and us the most 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.460
 useful 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.470
 as when using the light of dawn 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.060
 about rings divine purpose and we 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.270
 several times we can use it 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.270
 spell 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.070
 here 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.569
 the last tier of talents 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:58.010
 that's it for even just this 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:01.320
 for the village you can but it is a target hill 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.840
 when there is a big damage well, just 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.420
 as if 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:10.080
 she practically does not throw back 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.900
 use a prism on a tank 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.229
 and the tank from the tank moves away healing 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.340
 there he will drive off next to each other in radius 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.580
 15 meters but little color 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.260
 those 14 seconds well heal inflicts 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.420
 damage 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:32.000
 a radius of 10 meters is a very useful talent 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:35.380
 I advise you, but I will show you how 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.300
 acts sampling divine purpose and 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.570
 selfless healer so 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.570
 look 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.920
 here we are for example 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.760
 means 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.760
 do so 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.120
 shock of heaven that's about you out 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.630
 and here work selfless 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.270
 healer 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.790
 his holy radiance speed increases 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.370
 we have three energy charges 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.580
 used by kings and he is divine 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.580
 plan 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.560
 and on the same principle 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.340
 we work further of course sometimes with us 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:21.130
 divine intent may not pro kats 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.400
 this is the probability of his prophet 25 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.169
 percent 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.760
 this way works sometimes 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.980
 support divine light 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.639
 flash of light 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.999
 and of course 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.999
 few 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.700
 characters will not show but 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:45.380
 Well, although look 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.380
 yes here is a symbol of divinity 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:55.580
 reduce reduces the spell flow 

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:55.580
 laying hands on is also a useful symbol 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.139
 so what else 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.350
 wow that is when using 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.860
 light of dawn 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.930
 you can move out 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.720
 fewer people but less 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.300
 ohilit a few percent hp 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.980
 more those whom the excretory is very 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:23.870
 useful talent 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.870
 which means here is a dollar of activity 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:33.300
 I do not see the utility just put 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.300
 and he 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.420
 there are no more symbols here but how would you be 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.360
 small guide 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.960
 plowed floor 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.500
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.500
 see you all
