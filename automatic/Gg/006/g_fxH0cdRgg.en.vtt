00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.780
 an app for usc that i do not care anymore 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.809

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.540
 the top club and the power 1 shows 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.090
 you could have specific features if 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.980
 her text marks similar to her 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.779
 on ios but already knows long talk 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.880
 short sense I have the app ever 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.460
 started and the first thing she needed 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.680
 is in the access to auxiliary objects the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.419
 I allow the app and I say it 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.610
 should start at login 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.489
 the access to hills objects finds 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.199
 By the way, in the system settings 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.489
 tools and here the hook 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.769
 was set 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.050

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.969

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.620
 I change the appearance synonymous 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.600

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.249

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.019
 I'll show you right away I'll start 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.149

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.470
 comes the content specific suggestion 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.540
 what I can do with it 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.640
 I have the opportunity to cut it out 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.290
 I want to copy it and copy it 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.390
 I can go anywhere anytime I want 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.890
 to use clique say 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.080
 that means even if I'm going to finish 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.630
 and use it here so it comes 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.670
 really when I need it comes 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.680
 the content specific suggestion 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.030

 Context specific menu and you see 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.950
 I can not say cut out here 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.810
 because a website can not 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.480
 cut it out but I could do it now 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.610
 tweet directly or search for it 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.530
 which is now a bit bigger 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.630
 You see, I'll do one now 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.060
 Stage bigger then I get this here 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.070
 a bit bigger depending on your own 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.700
 Taste you can do this here like 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.650
 one likes to 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.840
 I can still do that in the pop clip 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.580
 adjust that the some 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.380
 Applications are excluded 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.750
 now, for example, special applications 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.090
 where this fade in from the one 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.010
 known menu is undesirable then can 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.890
 I simply add this app here 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.180
 Under info the version can do that 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.669
 Whole tweets can support you 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.500
 contact and call the help 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.940
 as well as proven in the app store rather 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.470
 you can not stop there 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.240
 rather you do not have to adjust 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.810

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.120
