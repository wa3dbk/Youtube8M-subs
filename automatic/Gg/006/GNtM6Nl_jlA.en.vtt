what<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.879> want<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.320> is<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
what you want to do is you're going to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.979 
what you want to do is you're going to
want<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> pull<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.719> when<00:00:42.719> you're<00:00:42.840> first

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
want to pull up and when you're first

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.470 
want to pull up and when you're first
start<00:00:43.320> doing<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:44.000> kind<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> lean<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> one

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
start doing them kind of lean to one

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
start doing them kind of lean to one
side<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:46.260> whichever<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
side like whichever way you're going to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.630 
side like whichever way you're going to
spit<00:00:47.640> leave<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> way<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.489> like

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
spit leave it that way so you can like

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.619 
spit leave it that way so you can like
get<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.960> rotation<00:00:51.960> started<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.629> that's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
get the rotation started and that's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.360 
get the rotation started and that's
pretty<00:00:54.930> much<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> basic<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.800> how<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
pretty much the basic of how to do it I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.709 
pretty much the basic of how to do it I
don't<00:00:56.520> really<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.879> too<00:00:57.090> much<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.329> say<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
don't really have too much to say on it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
don't really have too much to say on it
you<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.530> gotta<00:00:58.739> learn<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> manual<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you just gotta learn how to manual and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.090 
you just gotta learn how to manual and
the<00:00:59.789> other<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> 180<00:01:00.719> pretty<00:01:00.960> much<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.980> then

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the other not a 180 pretty much and then

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.950 
the other not a 180 pretty much and then
you<00:01:02.340> combine<00:01:02.520> them<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.809> guess

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
you combine them but it's like I guess

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.750 
you combine them but it's like I guess
it's<00:01:04.110> hard<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.350> hop<00:01:04.500> off<00:01:04.680> your<00:01:04.860> back<00:01:04.979> tired<00:01:05.280> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it's hard to hop off your back tired but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.609 
it's hard to hop off your back tired but
you<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

already<00:01:42.970> going<00:01:43.150> too<00:01:43.300> fast<00:01:43.480> we<00:01:43.750> don't<00:01:43.900> want<00:01:44.020> to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
already going too fast we don't want to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.980 
already going too fast we don't want to
go<00:01:44.230> in<00:01:44.350> my<00:01:44.440> gut<00:01:44.680> slow<00:01:44.980> so<00:01:45.550> try<00:01:46.480> to<00:01:46.510> keep<00:01:46.660> like<00:01:46.960> a

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
go in my gut slow so try to keep like a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.900 
go in my gut slow so try to keep like a
decent<00:01:47.200> speed<00:01:47.590> going<00:01:47.890> it'll<00:01:48.010> make<00:01:48.220> like<00:01:48.400> the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
decent speed going it'll make like the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.640 
decent speed going it'll make like the
manual<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.480> little<00:01:49.810> bit<00:01:49.900> easier<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.380> get<00:01:50.500> the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
manual a little bit easier to get the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.510 
manual a little bit easier to get the
hop<00:01:50.800> out<00:01:50.980> of<00:01:51.010> it<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.230> that's<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.310> person

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
hop out of it do that that's the person

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.190
