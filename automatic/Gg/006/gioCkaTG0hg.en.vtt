00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.830
 it is in fact still possible to work on the management of the roberto del couple 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.160
 engine thanks to the differential between the hydraulic that still maintains some

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.060
 the possibility if limited in the number of functions to transfer the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.600
 motility in a fragmented asymmetrical way on the driving wheels allows 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.280
 to improve it dynamite of attitude in function of the characteristics of the

 raising of disc temperatures by 900 degrees

 front wheels the possibility of intervening on the braking distribution 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.809
 on 2 axles it allows to balance heat load and braking action on the wheels

 front and back ones condition that promotes a better 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.650
 trim angle in corners 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:17.019
 heat dissipation through the wheel rim allows you to keep the
