00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hey there YouTube this is cut was later

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.360 
hey there YouTube this is cut was later
and<00:00:03.210> I<00:00:03.330> have<00:00:03.480> built<00:00:03.780> them<00:00:04.020> massive<00:00:04.740> pit<00:00:05.130> in

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
and I have built them massive pit in

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.419 
and I have built them massive pit in
Minecraft<00:00:06.020> starts<00:00:07.020> well<00:00:07.230> above<00:00:07.589> cloud<00:00:08.130> level

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
Minecraft starts well above cloud level

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.120 
Minecraft starts well above cloud level
so<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.510> can<00:00:09.630> reconstruct<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.650> mines<00:00:10.920> of

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
so that I can reconstruct the mines of

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.520 
so that I can reconstruct the mines of
moria<00:00:11.580> i'm<00:00:12.420> going<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> put<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> columns

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
moria i'm going to put in the columns

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.340 
moria i'm going to put in the columns
and<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.000> ceiling<00:00:15.000> later<00:00:15.920> but<00:00:16.920> uh<00:00:17.960> it's<00:00:18.960> really

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
and the ceiling later but uh it's really

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.170 
and the ceiling later but uh it's really
big<00:00:19.560> when<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.949> stand<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> bottom<00:00:20.820> you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
big when you stand at the bottom you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.019 
big when you stand at the bottom you
can't<00:00:21.660> see<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.080> four<00:00:22.500> walls<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.580> once<00:00:23.789> it's

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
can't see all four walls at once it's

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.540 
can't see all four walls at once it's
impossible<00:00:24.830> these<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> new<00:00:26.189> green

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
impossible these are the new green

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.880 
impossible these are the new green
things<00:00:26.789> from<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> 1.4<00:00:27.630> update<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:28.199> i'll<00:00:28.439> show

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
things from the 1.4 update but i'll show

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.080 
things from the 1.4 update but i'll show
you<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> columns<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> columns<00:00:32.790> in

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you the columns so for the columns in

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.660 
you the columns so for the columns in
the<00:00:33.260> mind<00:00:34.260> i<00:00:35.420> started<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.570> some<00:00:36.840> random<00:00:37.020> map

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the mind i started on some random map

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.979 
the mind i started on some random map
this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.910> i<00:00:38.940> think<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.780> 14<00:00:40.440> wide<00:00:41.809> not<00:00:42.809> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this is i think like 14 wide not that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.459 
this is i think like 14 wide not that
big<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.640> just<00:00:44.640> wanted<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.020> idea<00:00:46.379> for

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
big I just wanted to get an idea for

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.010 
big I just wanted to get an idea for
what<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.890> wanted<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.430> eventually<00:00:48.020> this

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
what I wanted to do eventually this

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.670 
what I wanted to do eventually this
one's<00:00:50.030> no<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.180> near<00:00:51.390> complete<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.199> I've

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
one's no one near complete because I've

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610 
one's no one near complete because I've
already<00:00:52.890> started<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.399> several<00:00:53.789> others<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.620> I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
already started on several others and I

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.069 
already started on several others and I
like<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:56.070> better<00:00:57.620> over<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.280> one's

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
like them better over here this one's

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.929 
like them better over here this one's
think<00:01:01.079> 18<00:01:01.800> wide<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.530> it's<00:01:04.530> I've<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.700> these

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
think 18 wide and it's I've got these

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.820 
think 18 wide and it's I've got these
little<00:01:06.330> small<00:01:06.750> ones<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
little small ones down here and then I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.310 
little small ones down here and then I
was<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.280> big<00:01:08.520> ones<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:08.939> there<00:01:09.229> but<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
was going to do big ones up there but it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
was going to do big ones up there but it
doesn't<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.650> look<00:01:10.920> very<00:01:11.189> good<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> small

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
doesn't really look very good and small

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.390 
doesn't really look very good and small
scale<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:14.330> came<00:01:15.330> over<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:16.070> did<00:01:17.070> basically

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
scale so I came over here did basically

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.100 
scale so I came over here did basically
the<00:01:17.909> same<00:01:18.180> thing<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:19.380> bigger<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.549> better

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
the same thing this bigger and better

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.359 
the same thing this bigger and better
goes<00:01:22.110> way<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:24.950> almost<00:01:25.950> died<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
goes way up there and almost died a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.420 
goes way up there and almost died a
couple<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.820> times<00:01:27.060> while<00:01:27.360> building<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> top

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
couple of times while building the top

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.410 
couple of times while building the top
and<00:01:30.770> no<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.920> comes<00:01:32.159> down<00:01:32.759> right<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and no it comes down right here at the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.130 
and no it comes down right here at the
corners<00:01:34.159> looks<00:01:35.159> pretty<00:01:35.520> nice<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.960> is

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
corners looks pretty nice this is

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.109 
corners looks pretty nice this is
probably<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.460> with

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
probably what I'm going to go with with

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.620 
probably what I'm going to go with with
some<00:01:42.509> rings<00:01:43.369> right<00:01:44.369> about<00:01:45.000> where<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> top<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
some rings right about where the top is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.469 
some rings right about where the top is
that<00:01:46.369> go<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.549> way<00:01:47.670> around<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.060> columns

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that go all the way around the columns

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.469 
that go all the way around the columns
stick<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:48.990> three<00:01:49.439> blocks<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.479> then

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
stick out like three blocks and then

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.330 
stick out like three blocks and then
just<00:01:51.780> extend<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> way<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
just extend it all the way to the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
just extend it all the way to the
ceiling<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> mind<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.170> basically

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
ceiling of the mind which is basically

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.959 
ceiling of the mind which is basically
cloud<00:01:56.310> level<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.439> inside<00:02:00.229> but<00:02:01.229> yeah<00:02:01.969> looks

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
cloud level is the inside but yeah looks

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.219 
cloud level is the inside but yeah looks
like<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> mines<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.049> pretty

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
like the mines are going to be pretty

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.119 
like the mines are going to be pretty
sweet<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:05.009> massive<00:02:05.490> things<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.969> them
