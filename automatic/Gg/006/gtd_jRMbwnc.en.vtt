00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
connected so your carburetor should be

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.539 
connected so your carburetor should be
down<00:00:10.500> on<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.710> ground<00:00:12.860> if<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.070> not<00:00:14.280> loose

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549

here<00:00:19.400> I'm<00:00:20.400> going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.029> because<00:00:21.210> not

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
here I'm going to do that because not

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:33.160 
here I'm going to do that because not
quite<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.350> enough<00:00:24.199> oops

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.810 

I<00:00:33.230> also<00:00:33.440> have<00:00:33.649> my<00:00:33.800> handlebars<00:00:34.250> flipped<00:00:34.519> around

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
I also have my handlebars flipped around

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.919 
I also have my handlebars flipped around
I<00:00:35.000> just<00:00:35.030> thought<00:00:35.269> it<00:00:35.420> would<00:00:35.539> look<00:00:35.660> kind<00:00:35.839> of

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:35.929 
I just thought it would look kind of

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:39.729 
I just thought it would look kind of
cool<00:00:36.820> just<00:00:37.820> because<00:00:38.149> it<00:00:39.140> does<00:00:39.289> not<00:00:39.469> want<00:00:39.679> to

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
cool just because it does not want to

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:51.319 
cool just because it does not want to
slow<00:00:39.890> down<00:00:40.100> there

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.900 

you

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910

and<00:00:58.910> down<00:00:59.360> good<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.750> tight<00:01:01.630> there's<00:01:02.630> nothing

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
and down good and tight there's nothing

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.960 
and down good and tight there's nothing
moving

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:18.399 

five<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.210> now<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.660> came<00:01:11.080> loose

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:26.080 

this<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.640> most<00:01:20.649> aggravating<00:01:21.649> nut

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.149 

main<00:01:26.600> thing<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:27.049> what<00:01:27.170> these<00:01:27.320> thing<00:01:27.590> goes<00:01:27.799> is

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
main thing is what these thing goes is

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.550 
main thing is what these thing goes is
be<00:01:28.609> patient<00:01:30.579> it<00:01:31.579> can<00:01:31.759> be<00:01:31.909> very<00:01:33.579> problematic

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
be patient it can be very problematic

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.410 
be patient it can be very problematic
you<00:01:36.560> don't<00:01:36.770> know<00:01:36.859> what<00:01:36.979> you're<00:01:37.130> doing<00:01:37.460> are<00:01:38.299> you

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
doing it for the first time just be

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.709 
doing it for the first time just be
patient<00:01:41.329> with<00:01:41.539> it<00:01:41.829> keep<00:01:42.829> at<00:01:43.039> it<00:01:43.569> you'll<00:01:44.569> get

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
patient with it keep at it you'll get

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.749 
patient with it keep at it you'll get
them<00:01:44.990> running<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.439> no<00:01:45.590> time

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.219 

this<00:01:49.759> does<00:01:49.969> take<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.270> long<00:01:50.539> time<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:51.049> put

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
this does take a long time to put

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.859 
this does take a long time to put
together<00:01:52.810> there<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:53.899> go

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.850 

exactly<00:02:01.869> that's<00:02:02.869> why<00:02:02.989> I<00:02:03.020> say<00:02:03.229> give<00:02:03.470> yourself

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
exactly that's why I say give yourself

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.880 
exactly that's why I say give yourself
the<00:02:04.009> better<00:02:04.280> part<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.840> two<00:02:05.840> days<00:02:06.079> put<00:02:06.649> one<00:02:06.799> of

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
the better part of two days put one of

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.130 
the better part of two days put one of
these<00:02:06.950> together<00:02:10.629> and<00:02:11.629> if<00:02:11.780> you're<00:02:11.930> new<00:02:12.110> and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.430 
these together and if you're new and
you're<00:02:12.590> working<00:02:13.190> with<00:02:13.569> bad<00:02:14.569> tools<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:17.440> can

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
you're working with bad tools and I can

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:26.570 
you're working with bad tools and I can
have<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.709> time<00:02:19.040> factor<00:02:19.310> cube

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.900 

that's<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.630> there<00:02:28.370> go<00:02:29.370> ahead<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.700> mount<00:02:29.790> your

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
that's on there go ahead and mount your

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.910 
that's on there go ahead and mount your
carburetor<00:02:35.930> again<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.170> doesn't<00:02:37.470> fit<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
carburetor again if it doesn't fit and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.790 
carburetor again if it doesn't fit and
you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.160> loosen<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.640> screw<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.300> there<00:02:42.800> it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
you can loosen up the screw on there it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.910 
you can loosen up the screw on there it
should<00:02:44.040> fit<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.460> on<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.440> intake

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
should fit just on to the intake

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.300 
should fit just on to the intake
manifold

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.070 

it<00:02:54.880> was<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.090> there's<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.390> gasket<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:56.140> here

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it was like there's a gasket in here

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.059 
it was like there's a gasket in here
kind<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.140> holding<00:02:59.470> across<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.890> needs

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
kind of holding across this but it needs

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.630 
kind of holding across this but it needs
to<00:03:03.190> be<00:03:03.370> in<00:03:03.489> there<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.880> make<00:03:04.030> sure<00:03:04.060> everything's

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
to be in there to make sure everything's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.559 
to be in there to make sure everything's
sealed<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.760> tight<00:03:09.030> might<00:03:10.030> need<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.270> little<00:03:10.569> I

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
sealed up tight might need a little I

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:21.180 
sealed up tight might need a little I
call<00:03:13.569> muscle<00:03:14.319> persuasion<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.930> kind<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.260> work

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
call muscle persuasion just kind of work

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:34.380 
call muscle persuasion just kind of work
it<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.519> there<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:32.850> might<00:03:33.850> take<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> little<00:03:34.299> bit

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
it on there so might take a little bit

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.460 
it on there so might take a little bit
more<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.230> we're<00:03:35.470> gonna<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.860> use<00:03:36.160> a

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
more so we're gonna have to use a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.990 
more so we're gonna have to use a
flathead<00:03:38.470> screwdriver<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.430> kind<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.700> pry<00:03:39.940> it

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
flathead screwdriver and kind of pry it

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.630 
flathead screwdriver and kind of pry it
open<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.450> little<00:03:40.630> bit<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:44.010> I'll<00:03:45.010> get<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.430> fit
