 2 Hisama Good evening time snack o'clock chest midnight today we have been doing 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:14.160
 Thank you for your work 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.340
 It's like putting together Yamazaki's low aa and donut found by FamilyMart 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.020
 What new Sakkuri feeling Wow 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.350
 Caramel &amp; Air 131 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.140
 I do not think it is a great product or this feeling 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:32.740
 A croissant and a donut is not 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.740
 It's getting to be like that, I want to introduce you here 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.829
 Cormorant is 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.929
 I'm too addicted a little like Sasaki-sama to be outrageous 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.649
 I 've got something dissolved or something 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.649
 I am a dog 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.170
 U 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.170
 A very dangerous situation like this 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 return 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.250
 We certainly Nokka' in this way I caramel chocolate and almonds are Nokka' 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.140
 But it is a little hard to see 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.140
 I can say 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.159
 Say certainly I Chukin has become like a likely this croissant run 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.180
 things like this 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:49.500
 Kedomo I tried I eat a fairy tale now 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.960
 I'm fine you are firmly on Almond gold accent that is riding on 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.620
 It's okay but I'm a little 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.370
 It is a little above whether it was this payment 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.420
 It's melted in my body, so I felt a little nervous about it 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.750
 If it's a little firmer and it's a little crispy caramel sauce More 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.010
 I think it was delicious but 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.729
 Hey hey 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.420
 I did not know hey the Tteyuu ne new Sakkuri sense wrote in package 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.650
 But 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:20.850
 The croissant dough was received felt roof, such as moist Nechotto 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.850
 So I recommend that you try to eat it with bitterness 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.690
 Eat here to Patty 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.530
 In recommended that immediately sleep 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.530
 You are welcome 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.280
 Go 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.280

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.280
