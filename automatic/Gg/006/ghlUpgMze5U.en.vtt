00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello to all dear friends of me 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.380
 name is Sergey and we continue to do 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.920
 skyrim mods reviews 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.560
 and today we will have just stupidly a whole 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.600
 armor pack 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.760
 book the word cheese i even have 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.750
 helmet which is taken issued guards go 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.250
 he is father to the tzarev words to say 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.489
 communism day one author but for now not 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.149
 very similar style as I surveyed 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.079
 before there is a set of imperial battle there 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.180
 it was also up to figs but here's how 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.930
 all the armor because so far yes yes yes no 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.640
 be surprised 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:55.079
 it's all one pack just stupidly life duck 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:01.079
 Che wanted to say something like 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.210
 the style of what looks like tears 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580
 so that they are a fig I and in fact she 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.560
 reflects some kind of your own style i.e. 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.310
 rummage that there was an imperial then I will give 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.310
 can credit or now you can see in 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.610
 anyway on these continue like 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.920
 see here there are 2 2 armor 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.710
 as for armor two variations of armor even 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.080
 three kind of first bard there 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.470
 helmet 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.710
 also there is a heavy helmet slam were going found 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.710
 few 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.930
 also have heavy armor and light 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.119
 armor for example this heavy 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.360
 armor and this is our light armor then 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.369
 let's do it here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.560
 something more or less with easy dialing 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.720
 and in fact there is still a sword 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.970
 bastard and one-handed own of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.220
 keeping one-handed well and accounts here 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.229
 variety too i would say no 5 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.880
 lyuley dofiga 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.070
 generally not even said it can cause 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.479
 designer knights because well 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.130
 Naturally if those who love 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.159
 that 's it that it was not all at all 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.659
 equally with different drawings up can 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.289
 imagine some kind of original 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:15.959
 knights create from all available 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:19.080
 actually in the reaction of the helmet armor as well 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.420
 repeat heavy lungs so teutonic 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.790
 easy by the way from the video simple shield but 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.290
 nevertheless so here is the knight's sword 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:34.290
 Templar looks cool is forged around 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.410
 the rest well there look looks 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.060
 I think very very cool but again 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.430
 not for everyone those who love knight 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.269
 subject under the lie of the Skyrim suit that straight 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.590
 very suitable but for an amateur marik 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.670
 again to the knight's word 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.260
 agate here expired coming and in my opinion 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.209
 Masonic order to whom from what time 2 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.470
 warfare if i'm not mistaken type sending 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.340
 and of course the armor of the standard 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.390
 Crusader our beloved 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.800
 the templar of our sworn opponents 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.510
 helmets I already showed you the way 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.950
 heavy did not see sorry what is not 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.840
 show just hard not yet 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.640
 saw i think they are not computable 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.310
 be different actually well here 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.099
 and all in general with today's mod in 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.629
 basically everything is quite original cool i 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.099
 I know how you but I personally liked 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.110
 keep ailment will not be as 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.390
 just chivalry do not really respect how well 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.540
 no respect respect but not much you say 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.110

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.860
