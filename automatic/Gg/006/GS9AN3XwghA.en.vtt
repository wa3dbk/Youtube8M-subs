piles and I'm going to deal the deck out
by<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.920> way<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> went<00:00:20.699> back<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.300> old<00:00:21.570> camera

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
by the way I went back to my old camera

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.870 
by the way I went back to my old camera
I<00:00:22.410> tried<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> couple<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.369> high<00:00:23.490> definition

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
I tried a couple of high definition

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.910 
I tried a couple of high definition
cameras<00:00:24.539> although<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.350> picture<00:00:25.710> may<00:00:25.859> be

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
cameras although the picture may be

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
cameras although the picture may be
better<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.460> was<00:00:26.880> having<00:00:27.150> problems<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
better I was having problems with the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.620 
better I was having problems with the
audio<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.220> camera<00:00:29.640> angle<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.090> too<00:00:30.269> close

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
audio and the camera angle was too close

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.830 
audio and the camera angle was too close
if<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.890> close<00:00:32.189> enough<00:00:32.520> already<00:00:32.840> anyway

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
if it's not close enough already anyway

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.889 
if it's not close enough already anyway
here<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.739> go<00:00:34.980> we've<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:35.370> got<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> cards<00:00:36.120> mixed

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
here we go we've now got the cards mixed

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.420 
here we go we've now got the cards mixed
up<00:00:37.020> again<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.559> could<00:00:37.680> show<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> spectator

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
up again we could show the spectator

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.190 
up again we could show the spectator
that<00:00:38.640> they're<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.000> completely<00:00:39.750> mixed<00:00:40.050> up

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that they're all completely mixed up

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.130 
that they're all completely mixed up
there's<00:00:40.579> no<00:00:41.579> rhyme<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.059> reason<00:00:42.300> everything<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
there's no rhyme or reason everything is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.680 
there's no rhyme or reason everything is
in<00:00:43.290> complete<00:00:43.649> disarray<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
in complete disarray will have the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
in complete disarray will have the
spectator<00:00:46.170> cut<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> cards<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:46.920> many<00:00:47.100> times<00:00:47.399> as

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
spectator cut the cards as many times as

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
spectator cut the cards as many times as
they<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.180> we'll<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:49.289> final

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
they like and we'll do this one final

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.430 
they like and we'll do this one final
time<00:00:49.920> where<00:00:50.700> we'll<00:00:51.000> deal<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> cards<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.199> into

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
time where we'll deal the cards out into

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.209 
time where we'll deal the cards out into
three<00:00:52.620> piles<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:54.230> then<00:00:55.230> we'll<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.010> can

three piles and then we'll see if we can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.450 
three piles and then we'll see if we can
make<00:00:56.430> something<00:00:57.360> good<00:00:57.570> happen<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.620> you

amazing trick but it's only mathematic
let<00:02:14.460> me<00:02:14.550> show<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.330> setup<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.870> how<00:02:16.410> this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
let me show you the setup and how this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.770 
let me show you the setup and how this
trick<00:02:16.860> works<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.790> want<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.060> take<00:02:18.210> all<00:02:18.450> your

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
trick works you want to take all your

trick works you want to take all your
cards<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> set<00:02:20.100> them<00:02:20.280> ace<00:02:20.520> through<00:02:20.790> King<00:02:20.850> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
cards and set them ace through King and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.390 
cards and set them ace through King and
it<00:02:21.930> doesn't<00:02:22.230> matter<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> suits<00:02:23.070> are<00:02:23.310> on

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
it doesn't matter if the suits are on

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.160 
it doesn't matter if the suits are on
the<00:02:23.490> right<00:02:23.640> order<00:02:23.970> or<00:02:24.000> not<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.140> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the right order or not but if you have a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.080 
the right order or not but if you have a
new<00:02:25.350> deck<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.400> way<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.550> want<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.880> set

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
new deck this is the way you want to set

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.600 
new deck this is the way you want to set
them<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.780> have<00:02:27.930> all<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> kings<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.950> top

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
them and you have all the kings on top

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.060 
them and you have all the kings on top
just<00:02:30.420> like<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.560> could<00:02:31.740> just<00:02:31.860> set

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
just like this and you could just set

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.030 
just like this and you could just set
them<00:02:32.280> black<00:02:33.270> red<00:02:33.570> black<00:02:33.990> red<00:02:34.020> just<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.800> that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
them black red black red just like that

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.630 
them black red black red just like that
now<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:36.630> setup<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.260> trick<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.980> count

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
now the setup for the trick is you count

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.550 
now the setup for the trick is you count
out<00:02:38.880> three<00:02:39.180> piles<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.840> yourself<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.440> that's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
out three piles for yourself and that's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.410 
out three piles for yourself and that's
how<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.770> setup<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.400> go<00:02:41.640> one<00:02:41.850> two<00:02:42.090> three

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
how the setup so you go one two three

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.210 
how the setup so you go one two three
and<00:02:42.630> you're<00:02:43.080> doing<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.440> before<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.010> trick

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
and you're doing this before the trick

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.580 
and you're doing this before the trick
starts<00:02:44.730> because<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.930> your<00:02:46.110> setup<00:02:46.440> you

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
starts because this is your setup you

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.530 
starts because this is your setup you
get<00:02:46.740> all<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> cards<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.430> order<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.880> now<00:02:47.940> your

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
get all the cards in order and now your

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.680 
get all the cards in order and now your
setup<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:48.960> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.530> three<00:02:49.860> piles<00:02:50.690> because

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
setup is going to be three piles because

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.620 
setup is going to be three piles because
this<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.740> mathematical<00:02:53.640> formula<00:02:54.450> which

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
this is a mathematical formula which

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.900 
this is a mathematical formula which
works<00:02:54.870> every<00:02:55.260> time<00:02:55.500> now<00:02:56.100> there's<00:02:56.640> going<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.820> be

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
works every time now there's going to be

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.120 
works every time now there's going to be
one<00:02:57.180> two<00:02:57.570> three<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.260> then<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> odd<00:02:58.680> card

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
one two three and then the odd card

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.250 
one two three and then the odd card
because<00:02:59.550> there's<00:02:59.790> three<00:03:00.060> piles<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.600> 17<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
because there's three piles of 17 and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.190 
because there's three piles of 17 and
this<00:03:01.740> is<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.100> odd<00:03:02.670> card<00:03:03.150> right<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:04.020> pick

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
this is the odd card right here you pick

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.890 
this is the odd card right here you pick
up<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.560> pile<00:03:04.800> with<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> extra<00:03:05.700> card<00:03:06.150> put<00:03:06.870> it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
up the pile with the extra card put it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.380 
up the pile with the extra card put it
on<00:03:07.050> top<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.130> top<00:03:08.340> now<00:03:08.970> you're<00:03:09.240> ready

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
on top and then on top now you're ready

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.060 
on top and then on top now you're ready
to<00:03:09.570> go<00:03:09.720> you're<00:03:10.080> set<00:03:10.350> up<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.710> you<00:03:10.770> show<00:03:10.920> the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
to go you're set up and you show the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.440 
to go you're set up and you show the
spectator<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.670> all<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> cards<00:03:12.270> are

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
spectator that all the cards are

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.810 
spectator that all the cards are
completely<00:03:12.990> different<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.160> exactly<00:03:14.610> what

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
completely different you do exactly what

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.940 
completely different you do exactly what
I<00:03:14.880> did<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.630> can<00:03:15.810> cut<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.140> cards<00:03:16.500> as<00:03:16.590> long<00:03:16.620> as

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
I did you can cut the cards as long as

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.460 
I did you can cut the cards as long as
you<00:03:17.070> cut<00:03:17.340> them<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.540> top<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.959> bottom<00:03:19.110> as

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
you cut them with going top to bottom as

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.500 
you cut them with going top to bottom as
many<00:03:19.860> times<00:03:20.160> as<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.520> want<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.970> won't<00:03:21.120> disturb

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
many times as you want it won't disturb

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.730 
many times as you want it won't disturb
the<00:03:21.720> order<00:03:22.050> then<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.190> deal<00:03:23.610> out<00:03:23.640> three<00:03:24.060> piles

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
the order then you deal out three piles

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.710 
the order then you deal out three piles
just<00:03:25.740> like<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.190> until<00:03:26.970> all<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.300> cards<00:03:27.600> are

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
just like that until all the cards are

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.470 
just like that until all the cards are
dealt<00:03:27.870> out<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> second<00:03:30.300> time<00:03:30.450> that

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
dealt out this is the second time that

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.420 
dealt out this is the second time that
it's<00:03:30.780> being<00:03:30.990> done<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.860> as<00:03:31.980> far<00:03:32.160> as<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
it's being done but as far as the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.090 
it's being done but as far as the
spectator<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.270> concerned<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.860> first

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
spectator is concerned this is the first

up this pile this pile and then this
pile<00:03:44.130> show<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.910> spectator<00:03:45.390> now<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:46.260> for<00:03:46.470> the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
pile show the spectator now that for the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.050 
pile show the spectator now that for the
second<00:03:46.950> time<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.340> all<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.610> cards<00:03:47.850> are
