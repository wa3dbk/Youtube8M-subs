00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
may we're scarce and I thought was

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.250 
may we're scarce and I thought was
interesting<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.420> then<00:00:09.690> I'd<00:00:09.809> share<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.110> with

you one of them takes her a longer scarf
we<00:00:14.639> put<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.940> over<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.420> we've<00:00:15.719> normally<00:00:16.080> would

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
we put it over as we've normally would

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800 
we put it over as we've normally would
we<00:00:16.830> keep<00:00:17.010> one<00:00:17.220> end<00:00:17.400> reasonably<00:00:18.180> short<00:00:18.449> than

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
we keep one end reasonably short than

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.320 
we keep one end reasonably short than
the<00:00:18.930> other<00:00:19.140> longer<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:20.520> throw<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.060> short

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the other longer we throw the short

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.929 
the other longer we throw the short
plant<00:00:21.600> over<00:00:21.960> our<00:00:22.109> shoulder<00:00:22.590> first<00:00:22.859> then<00:00:23.789> we

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
plant over our shoulder first then we

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.540 
plant over our shoulder first then we
throw<00:00:24.210> over<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> long<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.260> then<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.340> bring

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
throw over the long one then we bring

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.000

back<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> short<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.800> sits

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
back the short one and it just sits

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160 
back the short one and it just sits
there<00:00:29.420> I'll<00:00:30.420> show<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> different

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
there I'll show you with a different

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.299 
there I'll show you with a different
type<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.650> scarf<00:00:33.170> this<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
type of scarf this one is more of a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.260 
type of scarf this one is more of a
pashmina<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> once<00:00:38.610> again<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.940> put<00:00:39.149> this

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
pashmina so once again we put this

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.350 
pashmina so once again we put this
around<00:00:40.370> as<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.610> normally<00:00:41.760> would

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
around as we normally would

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.319 
around as we normally would
and<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:43.469> keep<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.920> inch<00:00:44.250> shorter<00:00:44.640> than<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
and we keep one inch shorter than the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.200 
and we keep one inch shorter than the
other<00:00:45.800> just<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> adjust<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:48.710> all<00:00:49.710> right

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
other just have to adjust this all right

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.209 
other just have to adjust this all right
that's<00:00:51.210> about<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:51.989> length<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:53.070> can

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that's about the right length we can

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.819 
that's about the right length we can
make<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> little<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:54.989> see<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.410> link<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
make a little so you can see the link is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.040 
make a little so you can see the link is
here<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:56.730> right<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.239> put<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> short<00:00:57.809> one

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
here all right so we put the short one

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.369 
here all right so we put the short one
over<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> tional<00:00:58.920> reduced<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.050> then<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.170> put

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
over a tional reduced and then we put

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.340 
over a tional reduced and then we put
the<00:01:01.890> long<00:01:02.070> wait<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.370> over<00:01:03.110> just<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> there

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the long wait up over just have it there

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
the long wait up over just have it there
where<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> wear<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.729> pull

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
where we going to wear it and then pull

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.960 
where we going to wear it and then pull
the<00:01:08.880> short<00:01:09.119> run<00:01:09.330> back<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.400> sits<00:01:11.729> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the short run back and it just sits like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.109 
the short run back and it just sits like
that<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.680> some<00:01:13.920> sort<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> makes<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that and that just some sort of makes it

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
that and that just some sort of makes it
small<00:01:15.360> knot<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.320> keeps<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.680> stable

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
small knot and it just keeps it stable

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.100 
small knot and it just keeps it stable
they're<00:01:17.390> quite<00:01:18.390> nice<00:01:18.540> isn't<00:01:18.780> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
they're quite nice isn't it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.980 
they're quite nice isn't it
another<00:01:19.979> method<00:01:20.220> which<00:01:20.640> looks<00:01:21.180> great<00:01:21.570> it's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
another method which looks great it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.370 
another method which looks great it's
bricks<00:01:22.290> pierced<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> sinner<00:01:23.189> scarf<00:01:24.380> I'll

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
bricks pierced on a sinner scarf I'll

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.230 
bricks pierced on a sinner scarf I'll
show<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.009> one<00:01:26.070> another<00:01:26.729> scarf<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.210> bought

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
show you this one another scarf I bought

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.179 
show you this one another scarf I bought
in<00:01:27.540> India<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:28.020> lots<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.470> beautiful<00:01:28.650> colored

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
in India with lots of beautiful colored

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.719 
in India with lots of beautiful colored
scabs<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.070> how<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
scabs and you know how when we have a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
scabs and you know how when we have a
long<00:01:32.939> scarf<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.810> loop<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> middle

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
long scarf from we loop it in the middle

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.039 
long scarf from we loop it in the middle
so<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.820> normally<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.810> way<00:01:36.930> we

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so we just do that normally the way we

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
so we just do that normally the way we
normally<00:01:37.140> would<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:38.130> how<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.400> would

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
normally would you know how we would

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.730 
normally would you know how we would
pull<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> through<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.960> loop<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.530> pull

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
pull it through the loop and just pull

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.950 
pull it through the loop and just pull
it<00:01:40.860> tight<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.509> which<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.689> an<00:01:42.810> old

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it tight like that which is an old

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.510 
it tight like that which is an old
method<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.590> take<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
method this one we just take one of the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.389 
method this one we just take one of the
strands<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.869> pull<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.350> through<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.979> we

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
strands and we pull it through as we

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.590 
strands and we pull it through as we
would<00:01:50.579> normally<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:52.200> keep<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> loop<00:01:52.770> open

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
would normally you keep the loop open

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.000 
would normally you keep the loop open
stead<00:01:53.900> of<00:01:54.020> putting<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.470> other<00:01:54.530> one<00:01:54.770> through

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
stead of putting the other one through

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.690 
stead of putting the other one through
we<00:01:55.790> put<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.119> through<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.689> quits<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.070> then<00:01:58.549> we

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
we put it through that quits and then we

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.990 
we put it through that quits and then we
just<00:01:58.909> tighten<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.810> up<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:01.189> called<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
just tighten it up and it's called the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.630 
just tighten it up and it's called the
Marco<00:02:02.479> Polo<00:02:02.950> quite<00:02:03.950> nice<00:02:04.100> isn't<00:02:04.340> it

I'll<00:02:04.700> show<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.000> one<00:02:05.150> more<00:02:05.240> time<00:02:06.399> so<00:02:07.399> undo<00:02:07.970> that

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
I'll show you one more time so undo that

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.790 
I'll show you one more time so undo that
and<00:02:10.580> as<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.569> remember<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.200> normal<00:02:12.319> way<00:02:12.590> word

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
and as you remember the normal way word

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.330 
and as you remember the normal way word
up<00:02:13.010> it's<00:02:13.459> just<00:02:13.520> with<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.000> loop<00:02:14.600> staff<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:16.130> put

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
up it's just with the loop staff we put

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.830 
up it's just with the loop staff we put
that<00:02:16.459> around<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.910> normally<00:02:17.300> we'd<00:02:17.450> pull<00:02:17.690> them

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
that around and normally we'd pull them

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.930 
that around and normally we'd pull them
both<00:02:18.020> through<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.770> go<00:02:18.890> like<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.280> but

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
both through and we go like that but

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.190 
both through and we go like that but
instead<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.450> pulling<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.750> we're<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:21.050> going

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
instead of pulling it we're just going

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.320 
instead of pulling it we're just going
to<00:02:21.230> take<00:02:21.380> one<00:02:21.440> end<00:02:21.950> put<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.700> through<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.300> loop

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
to take one end put it through the loop

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.559 
to take one end put it through the loop
keep<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.410> loop<00:02:24.590> open<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.220> take<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> other<00:02:26.150> in

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
keep the loop open and take the other in

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.530 
keep the loop open and take the other in
and<00:02:26.900> put<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.350> through<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.190> other<00:02:28.310> way<00:02:28.540> and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
and put it through the other way and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.330 
and put it through the other way and
then<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:29.840> pull<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:31.330> just<00:02:32.330> stuck<00:02:32.540> make<00:02:32.720> bit<00:02:33.340> and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
then we pull it just stuck make bit and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.920 
then we pull it just stuck make bit and
you've<00:02:34.459> got<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.150> will<00:02:35.239> sit<00:02:35.510> nice<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
you've got it and it will sit nice and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.780 
you've got it and it will sit nice and
tight<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.260> can<00:02:36.380> have<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.680> up<00:02:36.980> high<00:02:37.250> or<00:02:37.610> down

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
tight you can have it up high or down

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.130 
tight you can have it up high or down
low<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:38.989> just<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:40.250> looking<00:02:40.790> great
