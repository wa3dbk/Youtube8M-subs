00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.040
 hello and good day with 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.990
 you still max today I would like to 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.210
 tell you about one interesting thing in 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.980
 the game battlefield 4 on which recently 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.080
 stumbled across the internet 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.450
 maybe some of you to this 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.060
 amateur mods in battlefield 3 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.550
 for example, the modification makes the night on 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.770
 Some cards or mod improving 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.380
 the graphics in the game are finally similar 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.200
 modifications got a total battlefield 4 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.059
 Today I will tell about one of them and if 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.530
 to be more specific as clear by name 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.440
 video this zombie mod 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.290
 zombie mod is an unofficial modification. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.810
 and you will not find a list of game modes 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.730
 but in fact it is not even a mod but just 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.850
 a set of plug-ins and presets on 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.210
 server so what is this game rule 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.809
 extremely simple zombie violence and ordinary 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.880
 the players 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.070
 the game begins with the fact that there is one 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.829
 infected player who turn 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.490
 should fix all the others how 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.880
 way 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.710
 zombie player has a knife 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.860
 defibrillator and burner as well as smoke 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.320
 and stun grenades using it all 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.810
 zombie player must kill ordinary player 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.600
 who can use everything except 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.210
 c4 explosives while grenades and so on 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.820
 and shotguns when an ordinary player 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.220
 kills zombies after rebirth he too 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.140
 getting infected and so on for now 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.970
 players won't become zombies or same 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.250
 infected will not infect anyone 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.080
 maybe it doesn't sound very clear but 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.330
 having played a couple of rounds you exactly 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.700
 understand the rules of the game which 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.830
 may seem a little dishonest because 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.790
 zombies carry only a knife 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.430
 ordinary players 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.040
 full arsenal as if not so first 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.770
 an infected player has as many as 10 thousand 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.260
 units of health which is 100 times more than 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.930
 usually to kill such a player to you 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.600
 It needs about 400 rounds of ammunition and floor 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.580
 4 store Pechenegs therefore will survive 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.650
 not so easy but with every 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.269
 an infected player the amount of their lives 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.030
 will proportionally decrease 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.099
 for example if on server 10 zombie 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.040
 everyone will have no poet 10,000 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.739
 health and 10 times less than it is 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.810
 the more zombies the easier it is to kill them 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.520
 it will seem a little dishonest but 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.620
 just such amendments created 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.740
 made solely for balance in the game 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.930
 so that both zombies and players have real 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 chances of winning how to play this 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.340
 server links to some of them you 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.950
 can find in the description of the video 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.570
 I have a lot of such servers and even 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.910
 at night they are packed with players 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.820
 therefore have to show patience and 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.280
 stand in a queue for a bit, sorry all 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.710
 of these servers are located in america 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.660
 and some of you may have problems 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.030
 with connection in case you have 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.160
 slow internet but surprisingly everything 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.350
 not as sad as it seems to me 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.050
 Internet speed is about 5 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.630
 megabits per second which is not very much and 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.310
 quickly in my surprise I could without 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.460
 problems play on american 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.070
 servers with ping 150 and even get 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.170
 a no pleasure is also worth 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.330
 to mention that all the zombies of the server are not 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.550
 rated so you can not 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.650
 worry because of a bad bill he's not 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.370
 will go statistics on this i am with you 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.380
 say goodbye 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.170

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.270
