00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
into the lower crease so it transitions

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:26.050 
into the lower crease so it transitions
up<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.500> those<00:01:17.650> lighter<00:01:18.010> brown<00:01:18.280> colors

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
again when working with dark colors you

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.030 
again when working with dark colors you
need<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.930> gradually<00:02:24.319> build<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
need to gradually build up to the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.430 
need to gradually build up to the
darkest<00:02:25.519> shadows<00:02:25.819> as<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.209> can<00:02:26.420> get<00:02:26.750> really

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
darkest shadows as it can get really

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.280 
darkest shadows as it can get really
messy<00:02:27.980> real<00:02:28.430> quick<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.690> best<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.110> start

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
messy real quick so it's best to start

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.530 
messy real quick so it's best to start
off<00:02:30.470> lights<00:02:30.769> then<00:02:31.160> add<00:02:31.340> more<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.880> more<00:02:32.180> if<00:02:32.390> you

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
off lights then add more and more if you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.650 
off lights then add more and more if you
want<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.900> be<00:02:33.019> darker<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> wing<00:02:35.360> and
