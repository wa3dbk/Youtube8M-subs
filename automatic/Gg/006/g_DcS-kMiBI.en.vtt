anything<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.670> bit<00:01:14.939> different<00:01:15.560> I've

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
anything a little bit different I've

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.690 
anything a little bit different I've
recently<00:01:16.890> upgraded<00:01:17.429> my<00:01:19.189> webcam<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:20.609> not

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
recently upgraded my webcam so I'm not

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
software just a bit so if things look a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760 
software just a bit so if things look a
little<00:01:26.490> different<00:01:26.960> it's<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.109> of<00:01:28.649> that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
little different it's because of that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
turquoise yellow black was actually a

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.039 
turquoise yellow black was actually a
possible<00:03:12.659> design<00:03:13.109> for<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.739> j2<00:03:14.400> Grimlock<00:03:15.049> it

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049

ultimately<00:03:16.620> never<00:03:16.919> saw<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> release<00:03:17.669> because<00:03:18.209> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
ultimately never saw a release because I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.599 
ultimately never saw a release because I
think<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.500> story<00:03:19.769> was<00:03:19.829> they<00:03:20.159> figured<00:03:20.519> they

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
think the story was they figured they

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.030 
think the story was they figured they
already<00:03:20.819> did<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.389> blue<00:03:21.840> Grimlock<00:03:22.439> there<00:03:22.859> really

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
already did a blue Grimlock there really

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.430 
already did a blue Grimlock there really
was<00:03:23.340> no<00:03:23.549> point<00:03:23.849> since<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.180> shades<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.139> color

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
was no point since the shades of color

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.979 
was no point since the shades of color
were<00:03:25.650> close<00:03:25.919> enough<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:27.239> other<00:03:27.419> than<00:03:27.629> that<00:03:27.780> I

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
were close enough but other than that I

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.680 
were close enough but other than that I
think<00:03:28.199> it<00:03:28.290> looks<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:29.129> nice<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.419> shame

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
think it looks really nice it's a shame

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.430 
think it looks really nice it's a shame
this<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.109> like<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.319> version<00:03:31.650> we<00:03:32.400> won't<00:03:32.729> see<00:03:33.440> in

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
this is like a version we won't see in

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.420 
this is like a version we won't see in
the<00:03:34.829> movie<00:03:35.250> because<00:03:36.000> he'll<00:03:36.329> be<00:03:36.359> a<00:03:36.510> very<00:03:36.840> flash

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the movie because he'll be a very flash

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.280 
the movie because he'll be a very flash
