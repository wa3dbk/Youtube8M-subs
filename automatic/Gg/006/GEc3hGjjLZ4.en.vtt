00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
it is about 3:15 a.m. I'm in my PJs and

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.690 
it is about 3:15 a.m. I'm in my PJs and
I<00:02:04.420> drank<00:02:04.660> way<00:02:04.810> too<00:02:04.840> much<00:02:04.990> coffee<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.800> figured

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
I drank way too much coffee so figured

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.540 
I drank way too much coffee so figured
I'd<00:02:06.760> do<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:06.970> video<00:02:07.150> for<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:08.190> why<00:02:09.190> don't<00:02:09.250> we<00:02:09.400> do<00:02:09.520> a

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
I'd do a video for you why don't we do a

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.900 
I'd do a video for you why don't we do a
lesson<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.200> picking<00:02:11.200> patterns<00:02:11.640> actually<00:02:12.640> I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
lesson on picking patterns actually I

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.310 
lesson on picking patterns actually I
thought<00:02:13.120> about<00:02:13.270> doing<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> long<00:02:13.810> time<00:02:13.870> ago

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
thought about doing that a long time ago

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.580 
thought about doing that a long time ago
but<00:02:14.500> presenting<00:02:15.460> it<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.580> now<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:17.350> am

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
but presenting it to now and what I am

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.430 
but presenting it to now and what I am
doing<00:02:17.620> here<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:19.390> pattern<00:02:19.900> which<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.350> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
doing here is a pattern which I like to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.590 
doing here is a pattern which I like to
call<00:02:20.820> 1/3<00:02:21.840> 1/3<00:02:22.840> 1/3<00:02:23.850> let<00:02:24.850> me<00:02:25.060> tell<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.480> about

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
call 1/3 1/3 1/3 let me tell you about

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.110 
call 1/3 1/3 1/3 let me tell you about
it<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.800> I'm<00:02:26.950> starting<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.580> e-string

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
it so I'm starting on the e-string

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.000 
it so I'm starting on the e-string
the<00:02:28.360> fatty<00:02:28.690> string<00:02:29.080> remember<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> 7

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
the fatty string remember I have a 7

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.730 
the fatty string remember I have a 7
string<00:02:30.250> guitar<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.880> I'm<00:02:31.600> not<00:02:31.750> using<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.230> guy

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
string guitar so I'm not using this guy

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.760 
string guitar so I'm not using this guy
right<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.040> yet

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770

b<00:02:45.459> 1<00:02:45.700> e<00:02:46.440> 3<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.120> sounds<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.050> looks<00:02:50.140> like

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
b 1 e 3 so that sounds and looks like

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.790 
b 1 e 3 so that sounds and looks like
this<00:02:53.430> there<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.550> are<00:02:54.930> using<00:02:55.930> an<00:02:56.170> economy

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
this there you are using an economy

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.090 
this there you are using an economy
picking<00:02:57.280> pattern<00:02:58.410> meaning<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.709> when<00:02:59.950> I'm

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
picking pattern meaning that when I'm

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.750 
picking pattern meaning that when I'm
ascending<00:03:01.350> no<00:03:02.350> matter<00:03:02.530> where<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:02.920> leave<00:03:03.220> off<00:03:03.400> on

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
ascending no matter where I leave off on

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.280 
ascending no matter where I leave off on
a<00:03:03.820> stroke<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.330> I'm<00:03:04.420> going<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.110> next

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
a stroke and I'm going to the next

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.979 
a stroke and I'm going to the next
string<00:03:05.560> down<00:03:06.040> ascending<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.660> go<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:07.870> the

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
string down ascending I will go with the

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.270 
string down ascending I will go with the
down<00:03:08.110> stroke<00:03:08.440> no<00:03:08.800> matter<00:03:08.980> what<00:03:09.190> if<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:10.239> am

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
down stroke no matter what if I am

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.250 
down stroke no matter what if I am
descending<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.550> I'm<00:03:13.420> going<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.690> way

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
descending and I'm going this way

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.290 
descending and I'm going this way
no<00:03:14.620> matter<00:03:14.800> where<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.040> leave<00:03:15.310> off<00:03:15.459> I'm<00:03:15.970> hitting

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
no matter where I leave off I'm hitting

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.030 
no matter where I leave off I'm hitting
the<00:03:16.450> next<00:03:16.600> string<00:03:16.840> with<00:03:16.989> an<00:03:17.110> upstroke<00:03:17.500> that's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
the next string with an upstroke that's

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.949 
the next string with an upstroke that's
the<00:03:18.190> idea<00:03:18.459> I'm<00:03:18.880> gonna<00:03:19.000> play<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.360> same<00:03:19.600> pattern

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
the idea I'm gonna play the same pattern

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.110 
the idea I'm gonna play the same pattern
again<00:03:20.050> using<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.070> economy<00:03:21.550> picking<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:22.030> I

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
again using this economy picking and I

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.090 
again using this economy picking and I
will<00:03:22.420> be<00:03:22.630> doing<00:03:22.810> doing<00:03:23.440> ascending<00:03:23.920> and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
will be doing doing ascending and

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:40.199 
will be doing doing ascending and
descending<00:03:24.300> watch

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.820 

there<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.330> have<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:44.440> as<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.620> probably

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
there you have it and as you probably

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.070 
there you have it and as you probably
have<00:03:46.100> realized<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:47.120> time<00:03:47.480> signatures<00:03:47.959> on

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
have realized the time signatures on

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.280 
have realized the time signatures on
that<00:03:48.230> video<00:03:48.500> are<00:03:48.650> all<00:03:48.830> over<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.220> place

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
that video are all over the place

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.480 
that video are all over the place
basically<00:03:51.290> I'm<00:03:51.530> letting<00:03:51.920> my<00:03:52.070> picking

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
basically I'm letting my picking

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.340 
basically I'm letting my picking
patterns<00:03:52.880> dictate<00:03:53.300> the<00:03:53.450> time<00:03:53.660> signature<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.290> I

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
patterns dictate the time signature so I

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.490 
patterns dictate the time signature so I
wrote<00:03:54.680> out<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.950> guitar<00:03:55.220> parts<00:03:55.550> beforehand

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
wrote out the guitar parts beforehand

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.870 
wrote out the guitar parts beforehand
and<00:03:57.500> just<00:03:57.560> kind<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.010> program<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.489> drums<00:03:58.730> that

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
and just kind of program the drums that

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.860 
and just kind of program the drums that
you<00:03:59.030> heard<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:01.160> main<00:04:01.489> idea

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
you heard to it and so the main idea

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.900 
you heard to it and so the main idea
pretty<00:04:02.870> much<00:04:03.020> on<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.200> beginning<00:04:03.530> it's<00:04:04.160> in<00:04:04.430> 11

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
pretty much on the beginning it's in 11

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.690 
pretty much on the beginning it's in 11
so<00:04:05.300> 11<00:04:05.330> 16<00:04:06.050> 11<00:04:06.290> 8<00:04:06.560> hungry<00:04:06.980> 1<00:04:07.130> accounting<00:04:07.519> but

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
so 11 16 11 8 hungry 1 accounting but

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.509 
so 11 16 11 8 hungry 1 accounting but
one<00:04:08.540> two<00:04:09.080> three<00:04:09.530> four<00:04:09.950> five<00:04:10.489> six<00:04:12.489> seven<00:04:13.489> one

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
one two three four five six seven one

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:20.729 
one two three four five six seven one
two<00:04:17.260> there<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.320> go<00:04:18.380> beat<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:18.980> guess<00:04:19.250> eliminate

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
two there you go beat I guess eliminate

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.760 
two there you go beat I guess eliminate
so<00:04:22.540> that<00:04:23.540> parent<00:04:23.990> do<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.230> is<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.350> pentatonic

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
so that parent do that is a pentatonic

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.320 
so that parent do that is a pentatonic
pattern<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.520> remember<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:25.910> have<00:04:26.150> this

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
pattern and remember I have this

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.310 
pattern and remember I have this
transcribed<00:04:27.320> for<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.480> you<00:04:29.510> can<00:04:29.870> see

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
transcribed for you so that you can see

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.770 
transcribed for you so that you can see
it<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.770> don't<00:04:31.730> have<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.940> guess<00:04:32.120> what<00:04:32.540> all<00:04:32.660> I'm

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
it and don't have to guess what all I'm

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.960 
it and don't have to guess what all I'm
doing<00:04:33.050> but<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:33.230> am<00:04:33.380> using<00:04:33.700> pentatonic<00:04:34.700> scales

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
doing but I am using pentatonic scales

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.070 
doing but I am using pentatonic scales
I'm<00:04:35.240> also<00:04:35.450> using<00:04:35.919> kind<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:36.979> hybrid<00:04:37.490> major

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
I'm also using kind of hybrid major

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.590 
I'm also using kind of hybrid major
minor<00:04:39.080> scales<00:04:39.410> along<00:04:39.860> with<00:04:40.250> lots<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:41.030> modal

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
minor scales along with lots of modal

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.110 
minor scales along with lots of modal
ideas<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.919> so<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.550> this<00:04:43.640> is<00:04:43.790> kind<00:04:43.970> of<00:04:44.000> the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
ideas and so and this is kind of the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.100 
ideas and so and this is kind of the
idea<00:04:44.510> I'll<00:04:44.750> play<00:04:44.990> through<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:46.160> beginning

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
idea I'll play through the beginning

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.530 
idea I'll play through the beginning
economy<00:04:48.110> picked<00:04:48.400> weird<00:04:49.400> pattern<00:04:49.820> licks<00:04:50.090> so

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
economy picked weird pattern licks so

00:04:50.540 --> 00:05:17.170 
economy picked weird pattern licks so
looks<00:04:51.169> a<00:04:51.229> little<00:04:51.320> like<00:04:51.560> of<00:04:51.710> this

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.630 

something<00:05:18.180> like<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.540> I<00:05:19.430> hate<00:05:20.430> playing<00:05:20.760> slow

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
something like that I hate playing slow

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.840 
something like that I hate playing slow
yeah

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
yeah

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.090 
yeah
and<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.390> that<00:05:24.960> goes<00:05:25.110> on<00:05:25.350> for<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.530> while<00:05:25.650> and<00:05:25.860> then

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
and so that goes on for a while and then

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.580 
and so that goes on for a while and then
there's<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.730> lot<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:27.300> there's<00:05:28.200> this<00:05:28.350> riff

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
there's a lot of there's this riff

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.340 
there's a lot of there's this riff
that's<00:05:28.770> in<00:05:29.010> five<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:29.970> then<00:05:30.780> four<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.110> then

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
that's in five and then four and then

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:38.330 
that's in five and then four and then
two<00:05:31.740> all<00:05:32.010> kinds<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.340> fun<00:05:32.550> stuff<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:37.340> whole

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
two all kinds of fun stuff that whole

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.780 
two all kinds of fun stuff that whole
thing<00:05:38.520> then<00:05:38.970> it<00:05:39.060> goes<00:05:39.240> into<00:05:39.950> what<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:40.980> did<00:05:41.340> for<00:05:41.550> a

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
thing then it goes into what I did for a

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.760 
thing then it goes into what I did for a
lesson<00:05:42.360> of<00:05:42.630> day<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.050> give<00:05:43.410> this<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.650> my

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
lesson of day and I give this to my

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.190 
lesson of day and I give this to my
students<00:05:44.100> a<00:05:44.190> lot<00:05:44.220> too<00:05:44.550> it's<00:05:45.270> basically<00:05:45.960> going

students a lot too it's basically going
through<00:05:46.290> every<00:05:46.620> mode<00:05:46.800> start<00:05:47.100> with<00:05:47.300> your

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
through every mode start with your

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.960 
through every mode start with your
Ionian<00:05:48.810> Dorian<00:05:49.250> Phrygian<00:05:50.250> all<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.880> way

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.510 
Ionian Dorian Phrygian all the way
through<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:52.680> I'm<00:05:52.770> doing<00:05:52.950> this<00:05:53.040> on<00:05:53.160> a<00:05:53.190> seven

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
through and I'm doing this on a seven

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.610 
through and I'm doing this on a seven
string<00:05:53.700> and<00:05:54.030> what<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:54.390> have<00:05:54.630> transcribed<00:05:55.440> for

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
string and what I have transcribed for

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.010 
string and what I have transcribed for
you<00:05:55.850> it's<00:05:56.850> kind<00:05:57.450> of<00:05:57.480> the<00:05:57.600> same<00:05:57.720> thing<00:05:57.930> that

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
you it's kind of the same thing that

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.450 
you it's kind of the same thing that
it's<00:05:58.140> worked<00:05:58.290> out<00:05:58.410> on<00:05:58.590> a<00:05:58.620> six<00:05:58.920> string<00:05:59.100> just<00:05:59.310> in

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
it's worked out on a six string just in

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.830 
it's worked out on a six string just in
case<00:05:59.580> you<00:05:59.670> don't<00:05:59.850> have<00:05:59.910> a<00:06:00.030> 7<00:06:00.330> string<00:06:00.420> whole

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
case you don't have a 7 string whole

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.950 
case you don't have a 7 string whole
lotta<00:06:01.020> me<00:06:01.640> but<00:06:02.640> anyway<00:06:03.000> this<00:06:03.390> looks<00:06:03.660> like<00:06:03.780> this

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
lotta me but anyway this looks like this

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.180 
lotta me but anyway this looks like this
instead<00:06:04.290> of<00:06:04.470> doing<00:06:04.710> a<00:06:04.920> 1<00:06:05.400> on<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.880> E<00:06:06.360> string<00:06:06.620> 3<00:06:07.620> 1

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
instead of doing a 1 on the E string 3 1

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.550 
instead of doing a 1 on the E string 3 1
3<00:06:08.430> 1<00:06:08.940> 3<00:06:09.000> so<00:06:09.570> 1<00:06:10.140> on<00:06:10.290> the<00:06:10.440> 3<00:06:11.010> on<00:06:11.160> a<00:06:11.370> 1<00:06:11.940> on<00:06:12.060> D<00:06:12.270> 3<00:06:12.990> mg<00:06:13.290> 1

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
3 1 3 so 1 on the 3 on a 1 on D 3 mg 1

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.640 
3 1 3 so 1 on the 3 on a 1 on D 3 mg 1
on<00:06:13.680> B<00:06:13.860> 3<00:06:14.730> on<00:06:14.850> E<00:06:15.060> I'm<00:06:15.270> doing<00:06:16.050> that<00:06:16.200> whole<00:06:16.440> thing

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
on B 3 on E I'm doing that whole thing

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.940 
on B 3 on E I'm doing that whole thing
but<00:06:16.920> with<00:06:17.130> 3<00:06:17.610> on<00:06:17.850> the<00:06:17.970> B<00:06:18.150> string<00:06:18.210> so<00:06:18.840> it's<00:06:19.050> 3<00:06:19.290> 1<00:06:19.500> 3

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
but with 3 on the B string so it's 3 1 3

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.780 
but with 3 on the B string so it's 3 1 3
1<00:06:20.580> 3<00:06:20.970> 1<00:06:21.510> 3<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.530> it<00:06:23.160> looks<00:06:23.310> a<00:06:23.400> little<00:06:23.490> bit<00:06:23.670> like

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
1 3 1 3 and it looks a little bit like

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:55.020 
1 3 1 3 and it looks a little bit like
this

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.210 

that's<00:06:56.030> pretty<00:06:56.180> much<00:06:56.330> it<00:06:56.569> and<00:06:57.039> once<00:06:58.039> again

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
that's pretty much it and once again

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.589 
that's pretty much it and once again
those<00:06:58.370> are<00:06:58.490> all<00:06:58.610> modal<00:06:59.000> that's<00:06:59.240> your<00:06:59.360> major

00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 
those are all modal that's your major

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.719 
those are all modal that's your major
minor<00:07:00.379> scales<00:07:00.879> plate<00:07:01.879> modally<00:07:02.360> and<00:07:02.810> I<00:07:03.169> am<00:07:03.729> kind

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:04.729 
minor scales plate modally and I am kind

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.790 
minor scales plate modally and I am kind
of<00:07:04.849> picking<00:07:05.270> and<00:07:05.389> choosing<00:07:05.449> my<00:07:06.080> notes<00:07:06.379> in<00:07:06.680> a

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
of picking and choosing my notes in a

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.909 
of picking and choosing my notes in a
predetermined<00:07:07.789> pattern<00:07:08.180> but<00:07:08.870> instead<00:07:09.770> of

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
predetermined pattern but instead of

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.170 
predetermined pattern but instead of
just<00:07:10.099> going<00:07:10.250> up<00:07:10.400> and<00:07:10.550> down<00:07:10.669> your<00:07:10.909> scale

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180 
just going up and down your scale

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.270 
just going up and down your scale
patterns<00:07:11.569> it<00:07:11.750> sounds<00:07:12.289> a<00:07:12.349> little<00:07:12.710> bit<00:07:12.979> more

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 
patterns it sounds a little bit more
