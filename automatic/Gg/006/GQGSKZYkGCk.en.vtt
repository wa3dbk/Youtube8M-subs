00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
point it's just tidying up and really

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.589 
point it's just tidying up and really
laborious<00:02:52.019> Lee<00:02:52.640> you've<00:02:53.640> got<00:02:53.819> my<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.090> credit<00:02:54.450> of

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
laborious Lee you've got my a credit of

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.100 
laborious Lee you've got my a credit of
39<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.890> score<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.400> 9<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.420> timer

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
39 a score of 9 and a timer

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.410 
39 a score of 9 and a timer
I<00:02:58.140> think<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.709> timer<00:02:58.920> resets<00:02:59.280> each<00:02:59.489> go<00:02:59.849> none<00:03:00.299> of

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
I think the timer resets each go none of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.390 
I think the timer resets each go none of
these<00:03:00.480> numbers<00:03:00.720> mean<00:03:00.989> anything<00:03:01.019> Yeah<00:03:01.560> right

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
