money<00:04:49.240> making<00:04:49.540> guide<00:04:49.570> just<00:04:50.290> from<00:04:50.530> doing<00:04:50.680> two

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
money making guide just from doing two

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.510 
money making guide just from doing two
runs<00:04:51.280> which<00:04:51.580> was<00:04:51.910> not<00:04:52.270> that<00:04:52.510> long<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.810> time

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
runs which was not that long a time

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.770 
runs which was not that long a time
realistically<00:04:54.520> if<00:04:54.670> I<00:04:54.790> did<00:04:54.970> at<00:04:55.090> full<00:04:55.330> speed<00:04:55.600> it

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
realistically if I did at full speed it

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.290 
realistically if I did at full speed it
probably<00:04:56.110> took<00:04:56.320> maybe<00:04:56.620> two<00:04:57.040> minutes<00:04:57.190> at<00:04:57.820> a

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
probably took maybe two minutes at a

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.810 
probably took maybe two minutes at a
maximum<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.440> do<00:04:59.560> those<00:04:59.770> two<00:05:00.040> runs<00:05:00.280> if<00:05:00.580> you<00:05:00.700> do

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
maximum to do those two runs if you do

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.730 
maximum to do those two runs if you do
it<00:05:00.940> fast<00:05:01.180> probably<00:05:01.720> one<00:05:01.900> minute<00:05:02.140> 30<00:05:02.350> seconds

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
it fast probably one minute 30 seconds

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.660 
it fast probably one minute 30 seconds
and<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.880> made<00:05:04.150> at<00:05:04.360> least<00:05:04.830> 121<00:05:05.830> k<00:05:06.040> these<00:05:06.280> actually

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
and I made at least 121 k these actually
