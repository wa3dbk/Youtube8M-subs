I do use an external microphone and you
guys<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.149> ask<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.600> using<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.989> zoom<00:01:04.229> h1<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
guys that ask I'm using a zoom h1 you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.050 
guys that ask I'm using a zoom h1 you
guys<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.489> right<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.939> actually

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
guys can see right here this is actually

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.390 
guys can see right here this is actually
a<00:01:06.299> portable<00:01:06.810> recorder<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> reason<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
a portable recorder but the reason I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
a portable recorder but the reason I
like<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.790> maybe<00:01:09.060> over<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.840> rode

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like this maybe over like the rode

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.780 
like this maybe over like the rode
videomic<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.280> maneuver<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
videomic is you can actually maneuver it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
videomic is you can actually maneuver it
so<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.000> guys<00:01:12.119> don't<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:12.810> but

been an awesome piece of gear as far as

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
been an awesome piece of gear as far as
bringing<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.399> CES<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.479> loud<00:01:51.720> so

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
bringing it to CES I know it was loud so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
bringing it to CES I know it was loud so
I<00:01:52.049> could<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.290> double<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.950> take<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> off

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
I could actually double this take it off

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.370 
I could actually double this take it off
there<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> mic<00:01:54.899> stand<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.350> here

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
there have it on a mic stand right here

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.480 
there have it on a mic stand right here
but<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.890> actually<00:01:56.219> doubles<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> hand

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
but this actually doubles like a hand

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.609 
but this actually doubles like a hand
so<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.270> can<00:01:58.390> get<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.630> up<00:01:58.720> for<00:01:59.049> CES<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.530> was

video out showing you how I sync up the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.400 
video out showing you how I sync up the
audio<00:02:24.970> between<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.360> 60d<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.050> zoom<00:02:26.230> h1

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
audio between the 60d and the zoom h1

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.530 
audio between the 60d and the zoom h1
and<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.489> will<00:02:27.640> work<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:28.060> anything<00:02:28.239> if

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and this will work for anything if

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.530 
and this will work for anything if
you're<00:02:28.660> using<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.959> 5d<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.440> 7d<00:02:29.920> at<00:02:30.040> t2i<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:31.300> really

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
you're using a 5d a 7d at t2i and really

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660 
you're using a 5d a 7d at t2i and really
any<00:02:31.690> other<00:02:31.780> external<00:02:32.110> sound<00:02:32.620> recorder<00:02:33.370> so

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
any other external sound recorder so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.979 
any other external sound recorder so
essentially<00:02:34.420> what<00:02:34.510> you're<00:02:34.570> going<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.750> do<00:02:34.900> is

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
essentially what you're going to do is

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.540 
essentially what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:35.110> going<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.260> mimic<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.680> sync<00:02:36.040> slate<00:02:36.340> or

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
you're going to mimic the sync slate or

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.949 
you're going to mimic the sync slate or
the<00:02:36.700> movie<00:02:37.030> clapper<00:02:37.360> what<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.600> see<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.840> movies

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
the movie clapper what you see in movies

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.840 
the movie clapper what you see in movies
when<00:02:38.230> they<00:02:38.290> go<00:02:38.380> take<00:02:38.620> one<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.640> hear<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
when they go take one and you hear the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.150 
when they go take one and you hear the
clap<00:02:40.060> or<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.660> whatever<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.230> sound<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.890> what

clean<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.430> organized<00:04:20.820> what<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.209> can<00:04:21.389> do<00:04:21.570> is

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
clean and organized what you can do is

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.879 
clean and organized what you can do is
unlink<00:04:23.190> these<00:04:23.430> two<00:04:23.639> clips<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:25.230> 60d<00:04:25.770> so

unlink these two clips on the 60d so

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.320 
unlink these two clips on the 60d so
we're<00:04:26.010> going<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.160> command<00:04:26.490> L<00:04:26.790> that's<00:04:27.090> going<00:04:27.270> to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
we're going to command L that's going to

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.030 
we're going to command L that's going to
generate<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.810> link<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.230> now<00:04:28.650> we<00:04:28.710> can<00:04:28.919> just

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
generate the link and now we can just

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.360 
generate the link and now we can just
delete<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.580> audio<00:04:29.700> there<00:04:30.120> move<00:04:30.660> this<00:04:30.870> up<00:04:31.080> and

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
to go one step further make sure those

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.530 
to go one step further make sure those
are<00:04:34.410> there<00:04:34.650> select<00:04:35.370> them<00:04:35.550> both<00:04:35.669> hit<00:04:36.000> command<00:04:36.330> L
