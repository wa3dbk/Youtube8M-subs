00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
delicious and so you just added a very

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.460 
delicious and so you just added a very
small<00:02:16.390> amount<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.840> water<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.170> make<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.440> very

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
small amount of water to make it very

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.770 
small amount of water to make it very
thick<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.970> wonderful<00:02:19.660> it's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
just as good as sir daily cream I think

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.030 
just as good as sir daily cream I think
hmm<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.540> course<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.959> can<00:02:29.140> use<00:02:29.320> any<00:02:29.590> nut<00:02:29.830> so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
hmm and of course you can use any nut so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.000 
hmm and of course you can use any nut so
you<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.280> use<00:02:30.430> Brazil's<00:02:30.880> cashews<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:32.709> very

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
you can use Brazil's cashews it's very

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.100 
you can use Brazil's cashews it's very
versatile<00:02:33.580> sometimes<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.209> put<00:02:34.420> seeds<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:34.870> there

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
versatile sometimes I put seeds in there

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:50.360 
versatile sometimes I put seeds in there
as<00:02:35.200> well<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.680> be<00:02:36.520> really<00:02:37.030> nutritious<00:02:37.420> as<00:02:38.140> well

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.410 

almonds<00:02:51.370> are<00:02:51.489> nice<00:02:51.640> because<00:02:51.940> they<00:02:52.180> are

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
almonds are nice because they are

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.710 
almonds are nice because they are
alkalizing<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.970> could<00:02:55.209> use<00:02:55.420> sunflower

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
alkalizing and you could use sunflower

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.310 
alkalizing and you could use sunflower
seeds<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:57.330> pumpkin<00:02:58.330> seeds<00:02:58.360> for<00:02:58.810> some<00:02:58.959> extra

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
seeds and pumpkin seeds for some extra

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.100 
seeds and pumpkin seeds for some extra
selenium<00:02:59.940> but<00:03:00.940> they're<00:03:01.090> all<00:03:01.299> really<00:03:01.630> packed

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
selenium but they're all really packed

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.740 
selenium but they're all really packed
with<00:03:02.470> nutrients<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.430> think<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.299> nice<00:03:04.480> thing

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
with nutrients I think the nice thing

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.780 
with nutrients I think the nice thing
about<00:03:04.780> almond<00:03:05.350> milk<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:06.549> know<00:03:06.670> it

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
about almond milk is that you know it

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.210 
about almond milk is that you know it
looks<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.299> little<00:03:07.600> bit<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.290> cow's<00:03:08.860> milk

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
looks a little bit like a cow's milk

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.000 
looks a little bit like a cow's milk
it's<00:03:09.519> got<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.850> white<00:03:10.090> quality<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.410> so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
it's got that white quality of it and so

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.729 
it's got that white quality of it and so
and<00:03:12.280> yet<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:12.880> got<00:03:13.030> more<00:03:13.239> calcium<00:03:13.750> than<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
and yet it's got more calcium than the

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.729 
and yet it's got more calcium than the
cow's<00:03:15.100> milk<00:03:15.400> will<00:03:15.640> give<00:03:15.820> you<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.900> under<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.650> lot

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
cow's milk will give you and under a lot

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.830 
cow's milk will give you and under a lot
of<00:03:17.769> protein<00:03:18.280> too<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.630> really

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
of protein too so it's a really

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.190 
of protein too so it's a really
fantastic<00:03:20.680> alternative<00:03:21.610> isn't<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:22.780> it

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
fantastic alternative isn't it and it

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.140 
fantastic alternative isn't it and it
has<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.560> magnesium<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.370> need<00:03:24.549> two<00:03:24.730> bulbs<00:03:24.940> or

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
has the magnesium you need two bulbs or

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.140 
has the magnesium you need two bulbs or
bin<00:03:25.360> your<00:03:25.510> calcium<00:03:25.780> as<00:03:26.200> well<00:03:26.380> Jerry<00:03:26.799> doesn't

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
bin your calcium as well Jerry doesn't

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.850 
bin your calcium as well Jerry doesn't
usually<00:03:28.150> have<00:03:28.540> enough<00:03:28.810> magnesium<00:03:29.290> for<00:03:29.680> us<00:03:29.739> to

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
usually have enough magnesium for us to

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.280 
usually have enough magnesium for us to
be<00:03:29.950> really<00:03:30.190> absorbing<00:03:30.730> now<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.750> is<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:31.989> double

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
be really absorbing now this is a double

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.500 
be really absorbing now this is a double
muslin<00:03:32.860> cloth<00:03:33.160> as<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.850> can<00:03:34.000> see<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.299> well

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
muslin cloth as you can see it's well

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.509 
muslin cloth as you can see it's well
used<00:03:34.780> over<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.230> years<00:03:35.320> but<00:03:35.709> what<00:03:35.860> I<00:03:35.890> do<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.340> I

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
used over the years but what I do is I

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.110 
used over the years but what I do is I
boil<00:03:36.880> wash<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.360> with<00:03:37.480> some<00:03:37.720> sodium<00:03:38.110> bicarb<00:03:38.739> and

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
boil wash it with some sodium bicarb and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.069 
boil wash it with some sodium bicarb and
between<00:03:40.120> uses<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.130> this<00:03:42.820> is<00:03:43.060> just<00:03:43.900> to

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
between uses and and this is just to

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.020 
between uses and and this is just to
make<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.290> into<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.799> final<00:03:45.250> stage<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.640> making

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
make it into the final stage of making

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.810 
make it into the final stage of making
it<00:03:46.150> into<00:03:46.329> milk<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.560> pour<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.070> in<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.280> bit<00:03:48.610> at

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
it into milk so you pour it in a bit at

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.710 
it into milk so you pour it in a bit at
a<00:03:48.940> time<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:54.070> then<00:03:54.130> just<00:03:55.030> squeeze<00:03:55.329> it<00:03:55.690> through

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
a time and then just squeeze it through

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.990 
a time and then just squeeze it through
I<00:03:56.290> some<00:03:57.040> time<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.730> like<00:03:57.850> you're
