00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.819
 well this is where some friends 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:10.679
 is that this question is at a place called 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.440
 gameplay was untenable that looks 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.100
 a lot to that owen dragunov to lift 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.090
 3 on the 1st it's a bit the same as the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.400
 same days at dijon 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.400
 the white man one shot not 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:32.460
 maybe of course our neighbors so 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:34.050
 it's a small problem it was also 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.140
 but I wanted a little video 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.610
 that three songs just the output of the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.309
 side but had completely governed 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.739
 mediation and then here I am very very 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.900
 very angry compared to the normals that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.300
 I lost 3 is a man who is 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.900
 third huge and gameplay because of the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.489
 studio mode 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.879
 so I'm just quoting you a donation then 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.220
 I lost 1,51 to 1,500 convinced and and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.560
 only once died and I lost that which 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:12.020
 lets 65.0 was past the guys I 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.020
 lost 1 107 4 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:24.140
 1 4 j do you have situations like 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:27.260
 if I was really a call box in 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.270
 domination long time knows it's a 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.580
 meaning 4 to 5 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.160
 and that's where optics so a big steam 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.700
 optical who put that and me the tube 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.800
 remy that is 1,107 kg not the gameplay 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.330
 jack was a cable 10 m from the gameplay 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:59.930
 or two minutes they intersect they have 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:02:02.090
 says that already 2 0 so there is there I play 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.160
 with the athletes following the drone she 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.040
 to put what are the enemy the lot 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.990
 of stars like the little bit of an mp3 and 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.280
 hunters groups 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.140
 the chase group of mines were known 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.520
 all that is in relation to doing everything 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.170
 lots of videos stay in the sky 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.360
 it's all small hunting drones 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.860
 except that there they are a million and his 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.050
 life is destroyed or local councils 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 they will attack costs if a drone 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.340
 sees it in which john if a macbook 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.080
 air is they will attack hold back she 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.150
 in talking about it there was less destroyed everything 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.470
 and here it is the lot of stars but I 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.790
 think it's the one who knows that my 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.620
 topic 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.270
 if the enemies who because if they 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.470
 leave time frankly it's the dock 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.150
 it's the deadliest in denial 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.400
 you are leaving iron and steel storm 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.770
 approach i guess they 'll do 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.260
 they will camp 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.670
 people make a lot of stars on 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.190
 any maps 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.170
 except on hand a little social maps 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.540
 but frankly it's huge 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.970
 carnage he knows well that today you 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.520
 do a little trick of the rate she 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.440
 is ridiculed and which ones not to 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.630
 use then I advise you 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.580
 following text kills nuclear I felt 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.830
 that now I find more then 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.650
 so I advise you why it's 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.180
 in relation to the number of points he 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.030
 must to unlock them 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.230
 example the lot of stars undeserved points 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.340
 because this thing is a real thing 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.720
 carnage 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.700
 the hunting group already a bit of 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.800
 flesh I find it frankly he would have 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.720
 set to 1700 tonight was what 1900 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.180
 well, it's not much nba but 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.890
 even so it's already that so I 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.660
 I suggest therefore you 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.880
 make up your best but I will 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.880
 advise the turret drone 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.770
 automatic 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.770
 the terrestrial combo the hérault 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.209
 the fighting adf the hunting group the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.269
 mycologist the blackbird and so is called 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.620
 microbes ratio gold pitch not what and I 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.150
 think that's all and what I'm doing 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.670
 have considered that mm 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.000
 here are the seedlings our means but this game 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.909
 now tells us what I advise 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.400
 the least the pressure that dogs neither 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.780
 dog are cats for dogs 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:12.879
 are the chirac to lead to the level 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:13.180
 crisis one learns the prospective of the 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.519
 revenge 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.440
 we are going to say the word doc does not block it 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.789
 costs it was my painting there is a 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.859
 unknown kills me learn killed 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.590
 I'm not twenty now not 1 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.570
 h 15 with one or even double-game you 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.570
 want to fight me 2 6 4 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.479
 I am from cac 40 and one to two months 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.949
 nonetheless still bones 9 at first I 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.090
 to show the beginning of quotation marks 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.680
 because I can not with this 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.680
 army I was doing the 1 3 or 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.380
 and video wii so the dogs during 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.360
 strongly discourages its warthog 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.880
 spend the markets we learn what is it 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.120
 which is not good it's the funny thing 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.120
 sport 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.220
 mega little a little girl 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.220
 and below the map 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.590
 put constructive year places of 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.590
 scores 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.820
 so this did not forget me and is who goes 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.820
 to arrive near the car 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.710
 so frankly messi in the law of 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.710
 ropes 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.270
 finally, I have the biggest pot 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:34.110
 terrestrial but in addition we approach that 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.130
 we do it all the time 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.229
 interest if you desire me I do not 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.419
 not my love I do all the time and 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.430
 he makes these massacres I promise you 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.430
 we who came to control 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.640
 just reward is to take the robot 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.140
 we learn it used because 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.170
 frankly it is very very hard to cook 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.710
 a rpg he died but good between 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:01.390
 two radios and he's doing massacres of 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.550
 powers of a motorcycle with a little three 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.350
 minutes 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.350
 really what can do and 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.170
 right at the beginning to start well I 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.570
 put lightning ground robots 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.540
 manpower is the fern 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:25.820
 now I put more go to the little 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:27.910
 hunting prodigy or turrets 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.910
 automatic 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.410
 I left you my class koi 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:44.450
 automatic turrets in the stealth sewer 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:48.470
 and the stars frankly promise and 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:51.340
 that's the big thing to say i'm j 4 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:56.650
 and a half years a lot of trouble commented 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.650
 really a lot of trouble and 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.060
 full support to faults cbl i 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.539
 think a little carnage and I want 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.680
 carnage how am I going to call it but 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:11.680
 as noted 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:27.740
 in short, here is almost nothing to say you 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.969
 enjoy my videos are not like he 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.259
 there was no letting go of a small gesture 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:37.499
 I like to share a match because I 

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:39.449
 say yeah I was not known anymore I 

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.409
 do not know good if you want to help me 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:42.840
 we are more known and guys 

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:48.690
 move more subscribers 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:51.210
 I'm not scared or the break would be the same 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.400
 time because here I like 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:58.639
 show what I'm so cool 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:01.169
 fabrèges ending in process from 54 to 5 s 

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:04.580
 went hard plus I make a 

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:07.139
 beautiful killcam I warn that we 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.680
 killed three of the men who cam him 

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:09.680
 first who
