00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
Enzo it's more purpose-built I mean the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
Enzo it's more purpose-built I mean the
McLaren<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> purpose-built<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.570> don't

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.300 
know it just feels like the Enzo has
more<00:01:50.970> into<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.509> than<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.320> car<00:01:52.619> looks<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.189> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
more into it than this car looks like it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.660 
more into it than this car looks like it
was<00:01:53.399> built<00:01:53.460> more<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.360> actual<00:01:54.780> track<00:01:55.670> just

seen so far at least keeping up at the
end<00:02:14.930> zone<00:02:15.110> ever<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.800> know<00:02:15.920> couple<00:02:16.340> of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
end zone ever so you know couple of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.570 
end zone ever so you know couple of
points<00:02:16.820> down<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.500> got<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:21.920> huge<00:02:22.250> as

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
points down so you got that huge as

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.080 
points down so you got that huge as
visto<00:02:23.000> versus<00:02:23.750> little<00:02:24.110> v8<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.910> looks<00:02:25.910> like

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
visto versus little v8 and looks like

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.260 
visto versus little v8 and looks like
his<00:02:26.270> boost<00:02:26.540> finally<00:02:26.959> kicked<00:02:27.170> in<00:02:27.350> but<00:02:28.270> yeah
