00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.670 
figured out by what i have for knowledge
so<00:00:17.310> far<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.270> i<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.320> gonna<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
so far so i think this is gonna be a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.859 
so far so i think this is gonna be a
sequel<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> precook<00:00:20.970> since<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> last<00:00:21.600> one

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
back together like they was in the first

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.030 
back together like they was in the first
one<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.360> y'all<00:01:24.810> seen<00:01:25.020> under<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> new<00:01:25.590> people

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
one and y'all seen under the new people

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
one and y'all seen under the new people
you<00:01:26.220> only<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.670> them<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> box<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.990> what<00:01:28.229> I'm

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you only see them in the box so what I'm

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.679 
you only see them in the box so what I'm
thinking<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:28.950> happening<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
thinking that's happening is is that

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
thinking that's happening is is that
since<00:01:31.049> they<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.340> things<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
since they have all the things in the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.249 
since they have all the things in the
box<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.540> gonna<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> worry<00:01:34.140> about

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
box you're not gonna have to worry about

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.749 
box you're not gonna have to worry about
them<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.770> gonna<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> main<00:01:35.460> three

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
them it's just gonna be the main three

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
them it's just gonna be the main three
people<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.329> i<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.650> bunny<00:01:37.979> has

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
people and i think that the bunny has

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.910 
people and i think that the bunny has
gotten<00:01:38.700> loose<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.540> he<00:01:39.840> still<00:01:40.140> possessed

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

though<00:01:50.159> we're<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> guessing<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.450> right

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
though we're all the guessing but right

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.350 
though we're all the guessing but right
now<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:52.649> most<00:01:53.070> people<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
now what most people think it is is that

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510 
now what most people think it is is that
he<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.960> an<00:01:55.079> old<00:01:55.290> band<00:01:55.590> member<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.219> Freddie

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and Bonnie and chica wasn't involved but

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.240 
and Bonnie and chica wasn't involved but
then<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.790> bring<00:02:00.149> chica<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.950> get

were<00:03:23.910> only<00:03:24.150> empty<00:03:24.720> shells<00:03:25.079> I<00:03:25.410> had<00:03:25.889> a<00:03:25.919> hook<00:03:26.459> old

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940

has<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:35.099> animatronic<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.379> only<00:03:38.220> think<00:03:38.760> that

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
has one animatronic so I only think that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.240 
has one animatronic so I only think that
I<00:03:39.449> don't<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.199> are<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> don't<00:03:40.979> know<00:03:41.159> if

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
you're gonna be a security guard or if

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.089 
you're gonna be a security guard or if
you're<00:03:42.840> gonna<00:03:42.989> be<00:03:43.199> somebody<00:03:43.590> that's<00:03:43.769> walking

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
you're gonna be somebody that's walking

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.270 
you're gonna be somebody that's walking
around<00:03:44.669> in<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.690> room<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:46.799> since<00:03:47.069> there's

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
around in the room but since there's

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.159 
around in the room but since there's
only<00:03:47.430> one<00:03:47.849> attraction<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:48.690> leaves<00:03:48.959> me

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
only one attraction that leaves me

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.339 
only one attraction that leaves me
wondering<00:03:49.609> will<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.819> other<00:03:51.349> animatronics

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
wondering will the other animatronics

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.039 
wondering will the other animatronics
come<00:03:52.530> out<00:03:52.709> or<00:03:52.889> will<00:03:53.069> it<00:03:53.099> only<00:03:53.430> be<00:03:53.909> that<00:03:54.629> one

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
come out or will it only be that one

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.819 
come out or will it only be that one
golden<00:03:55.590> bunny<00:03:55.889> that's<00:03:56.579> my<00:03:56.760> question<00:03:57.150> but<00:03:58.049> as

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
golden bunny that's my question but as

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.800 
golden bunny that's my question but as
you<00:03:59.010> can<00:03:59.159> see<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.729> don't<00:04:00.000> think<00:04:00.359> there's<00:04:00.540> any

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
you can see I don't think there's any

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.869 
you can see I don't think there's any
doors<00:04:01.229> that<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.590> can<00:04:01.769> shut<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.310> keep<00:04:02.340> him<00:04:02.669> out

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
doors that you can shut to keep him out

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.089 
doors that you can shut to keep him out
and<00:04:03.030> he<00:04:03.180> could<00:04:03.359> just<00:04:03.540> come<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:03.810> at<00:04:04.079> any<00:04:04.109> time<00:04:04.379> or

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
and he could just come in at any time or

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.949 
and he could just come in at any time or
if<00:04:05.459> there<00:04:05.639> are<00:04:05.819> doors<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.299> believe<00:04:06.599> that<00:04:06.780> he<00:04:06.930> may

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
if there are doors I believe that he may

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.680 
if there are doors I believe that he may
be<00:04:07.169> able<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.590> bust<00:04:07.859> down<00:04:07.979> the<00:04:08.250> door<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:09.419> that's

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
be able to bust down the door so that's

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.420 
be able to bust down the door so that's
just<00:04:09.780> my<00:04:09.989> opinion<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.739> game<00:04:10.979> I<00:04:11.010> really
