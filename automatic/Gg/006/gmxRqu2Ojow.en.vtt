now<00:00:16.480> what<00:00:16.570> I've<00:00:16.689> got<00:00:16.720> here<00:00:17.140> is<00:00:17.289> a<00:00:17.320> sample<00:00:18.119> list

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
now what I've got here is a sample list

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.919 
now what I've got here is a sample list
of<00:00:19.330> sales<00:00:19.749> employees<00:00:20.380> with<00:00:20.919> their<00:00:21.130> sales<00:00:21.400> for

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:21.929 
of sales employees with their sales for

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.779 
of sales employees with their sales for
2008<00:00:22.929> and<00:00:23.169> I'd<00:00:23.800> like<00:00:24.009> to<00:00:24.130> calculate<00:00:24.579> if

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
2008 and I'd like to calculate if

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.179 
2008 and I'd like to calculate if
they're<00:00:25.449> going<00:00:25.599> to<00:00:25.720> get<00:00:25.779> a<00:00:25.839> bonus<00:00:26.050> or<00:00:26.320> not<00:00:26.470> so

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
they're going to get a bonus or not so

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.649 
they're going to get a bonus or not so
what<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.369> want<00:00:27.550> to<00:00:27.640> do<00:00:27.759> is<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.150> use<00:00:28.300> an<00:00:28.449> if

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:28.659 
what I want to do is to use an if

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.589 
what I want to do is to use an if
statement<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:30.150> determine<00:00:31.150> whether<00:00:31.419> or<00:00:31.509> not

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
statement to determine whether or not

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.030 
statement to determine whether or not
their<00:00:31.869> sales<00:00:32.110> amount<00:00:32.380> was<00:00:32.500> high<00:00:32.680> enough<00:00:32.890> to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
their sales amount was high enough to

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.560 
their sales amount was high enough to
get<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.160> bonus<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:33.700> basically<00:00:34.150> it's<00:00:34.360> going<00:00:34.510> to

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
get a bonus so basically it's going to

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.040 
get a bonus so basically it's going to
go<00:00:34.720> if<00:00:35.340> their<00:00:36.340> sales<00:00:36.730> were<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:37.630> hundred

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
go if their sales were a hundred

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.590 
go if their sales were a hundred
thousand<00:00:38.470> or<00:00:38.590> more<00:00:38.890> they<00:00:39.820> get<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:39.970> bonus<00:00:40.150> and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
thousand or more they get a bonus and

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.230 
thousand or more they get a bonus and
here<00:00:41.080> I<00:00:41.110> want<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.350> put<00:00:41.470> a<00:00:41.530> note<00:00:41.740> so<00:00:42.040> say<00:00:42.340> Michael

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
here I want to put a note so say Michael

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.100 
here I want to put a note so say Michael
Scott<00:00:43.510> gets<00:00:44.140> bonus<00:00:44.560> or<00:00:44.950> something<00:00:45.340> like<00:00:45.430> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
Scott gets bonus or something like that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.390 
Scott gets bonus or something like that
we're<00:00:47.110> actually<00:00:47.320> I'm<00:00:47.530> not<00:00:47.620> sure<00:00:47.680> if<00:00:48.010> he<00:00:48.220> would

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
we're actually I'm not sure if he would

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.480 
we're actually I'm not sure if he would
make<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.390> sales<00:00:49.660> or<00:00:49.900> not<00:00:50.170> or<00:00:50.560> get<00:00:51.010> Commission

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
make the sales or not or get Commission

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.720 
make the sales or not or get Commission
so<00:00:52.240> we'll<00:00:52.360> take<00:00:52.570> them<00:00:52.690> off<00:00:52.870> there<00:00:53.110> but<00:00:54.010> anyway

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
so we'll take them off there but anyway

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.260 
so we'll take them off there but anyway
now<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.720> we've<00:00:56.020> fixed<00:00:56.560> that<00:00:56.860> here<00:00:57.520> is<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:58.060> if

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
now that we've fixed that here is the if

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.820 
now that we've fixed that here is the if
statement<00:00:58.870> syntax<00:00:59.050> right<00:00:59.470> here

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
statement syntax right here

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.580 
statement syntax right here
so<00:01:00.580> it's<00:01:00.760> if<00:01:00.910> open<00:01:01.330> parentheses<00:01:01.360> then<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.350> have

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
so it's if open parentheses then we have

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.999 
so it's if open parentheses then we have
what's<00:01:03.070> called<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.400> logical<00:01:04.150> test<00:01:04.859> then<00:01:05.859> if

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
what's called a logical test then if

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.550 
what's called a logical test then if
that<00:01:06.159> logical<00:01:06.700> test<00:01:06.909> evaluates<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.600> true<00:01:07.630> do

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
that logical test evaluates to true do

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.889 
that logical test evaluates to true do
this<00:01:08.920> if<00:01:09.340> that<00:01:09.640> logical<00:01:10.060> test<00:01:10.240> evaluates<00:01:10.689> to

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
this if that logical test evaluates to

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.580 
this if that logical test evaluates to
false<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:12.189> this<00:01:12.549> now<00:01:13.479> all<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.079> logical<00:01:14.530> test

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
false do this now all the logical test

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.020 
false do this now all the logical test
is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
is

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.300 
is
is<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.990> value<00:01:17.979> or<00:01:18.659> expression<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.799> anything

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
is a value or expression or anything

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.210 
is a value or expression or anything
basically<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:22.270> can<00:01:22.750> be<00:01:23.380> evaluated<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:24.070> true

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
basically that can be evaluated to true

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.609 
basically that can be evaluated to true
or<00:01:24.909> false<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.950> yes<00:01:27.310> or<00:01:27.820> no<00:01:28.030> 1<00:01:28.600> or<00:01:28.630> 0<00:01:29.080> pretty<00:01:29.440> much

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
or false so yes or no 1 or 0 pretty much

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.490 
or false so yes or no 1 or 0 pretty much
that's<00:01:30.159> really<00:01:30.640> all<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.409> can

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
that's really all that it is and it can

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.760 
that's really all that it is and it can
be<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.979> whole<00:01:33.460> host<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.940> things<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:35.500> one<00:01:35.710> is

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
be a whole host of things this one is

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.590 
be a whole host of things this one is
going<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.040> be<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.190> very<00:01:36.460> simple<00:01:36.880> comparison<00:01:37.509> of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
going to be a very simple comparison of

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.800 
going to be a very simple comparison of
numbers<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:39.330> let's<00:01:40.330> start<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.659> out<00:01:40.750> with

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
numbers so let's start it out with

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.469 
numbers so let's start it out with
equals<00:01:41.409> if<00:01:43.020> open<00:01:44.020> parenthesis<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:46.149> I<00:01:46.180> want<00:01:46.420> to

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
equals if open parenthesis now I want to

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.930 
equals if open parenthesis now I want to
use<00:01:46.600> my<00:01:46.780> logical<00:01:47.259> test<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.310> want<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.580> see<00:01:48.729> if

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
use my logical test so I want to see if

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.469 
use my logical test so I want to see if
the<00:01:49.479> number<00:01:49.869> in<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.619> cell<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:51.670> I'm<00:01:52.270> going<00:01:52.420> to

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
the number in this cell so I'm going to

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.960 
the number in this cell so I'm going to
click<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.909> greater<00:01:54.909> than<00:01:55.330> or<00:01:56.190> equals<00:01:57.190> to

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.919 

100,000<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.140> could<00:02:02.470> also<00:02:02.619> have<00:02:03.009> this<00:02:03.929> point

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
100,000 now I could also have this point

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.840 
100,000 now I could also have this point
to<00:02:05.170> another<00:02:05.560> cell<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:05.950> our<00:02:06.130> worksheet<00:02:06.640> and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
to another cell in our worksheet and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.540 
to another cell in our worksheet and
then<00:02:07.600> we<00:02:07.780> could<00:02:07.929> simply<00:02:08.259> type<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.619> 100,000

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
then we could simply type the 100,000

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.090 
then we could simply type the 100,000
within<00:02:09.789> that<00:02:10.030> cell

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
within that cell

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.440 
within that cell
but<00:02:13.100> for<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.460> time<00:02:13.700> I'm<00:02:13.850> going<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.030> hard-code

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
but for this time I'm going to hard-code

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.990 
but for this time I'm going to hard-code
it<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:14.960> not<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.470> best<00:02:15.650> practice<00:02:15.860> I'm<00:02:16.760> just

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
it in not the best practice I'm just

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.720 
it in not the best practice I'm just
going<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.150> do<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.360> for<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.570> tutorial<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:18.800> if

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
going to do it for this tutorial so if

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.640 
going to do it for this tutorial so if
this<00:02:20.330> sales<00:02:20.600> number<00:02:20.960> or<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.260> number<00:02:21.410> is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
this sales number or this number is

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.060 
this sales number or this number is
greater<00:02:21.860> than<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.190> hundred<00:02:22.400> thousand<00:02:23.150> ,<00:02:24.070> what

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
greater than a hundred thousand , what

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.550 
greater than a hundred thousand , what
do<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.280> want<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.550> do<00:02:25.700> well<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.110> case<00:02:27.320> I'd

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
do I want to do well in this case I'd

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.100 
do I want to do well in this case I'd
like<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.830> output<00:02:28.220> some<00:02:28.459> text<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.840> order<00:02:29.990> to

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
like to output some text now in order to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.650 
like to output some text now in order to
output<00:02:30.590> text<00:02:30.920> from<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.640> formula<00:02:32.150> or<00:02:32.240> function

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
output text from a formula or function

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.960 
output text from a formula or function
you<00:02:33.230> need<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.709> put<00:02:33.950> quotation<00:02:34.580> marks<00:02:34.610> around

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
you need to put quotation marks around

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.350 
you need to put quotation marks around
it<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.440> if<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:37.520> sales<00:02:37.730> number<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.120> greater

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
it so if the sales number is greater

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.190 
it so if the sales number is greater
than<00:02:38.600> 100<00:02:39.020> grand<00:02:39.370> I'd<00:02:40.370> like<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.760> say<00:02:42.970> simply

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
than 100 grand I'd like to say simply

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.540 
than 100 grand I'd like to say simply
gets<00:02:45.310> bonus<00:02:49.450> comma<00:02:50.450> but<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:52.070> number<00:02:52.400> is

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
gets bonus comma but if that number is

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.229 
gets bonus comma but if that number is
not<00:02:52.940> greater<00:02:53.360> than<00:02:53.660> or<00:02:53.900> equals<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.340> hundred

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.840 
not greater than or equals to a hundred
thousand<00:02:56.870> then<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:58.040> would<00:02:58.190> like<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.489> say<00:02:59.620> no

remember<00:03:08.060> you're<00:03:08.209> entering<00:03:08.480> them<00:03:08.690> into<00:03:08.900> cells

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
remember you're entering them into cells

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.670 
remember you're entering them into cells
and<00:03:09.890> cells<00:03:10.250> usually<00:03:10.520> don't<00:03:11.530> provide<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.650> a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
and cells usually don't provide you a

and cells usually don't provide you a
lot<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.890> space<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.550> write<00:03:13.670> stuff<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:15.290> once<00:03:15.440> I'm

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
lot of space to write stuff so once I'm

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.090 
lot of space to write stuff so once I'm
done<00:03:15.709> with<00:03:15.769> that<00:03:16.010> close<00:03:16.489> parentheses<00:03:17.150> and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
done with that close parentheses and

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.690 
done with that close parentheses and
let's<00:03:19.100> hit<00:03:19.340> enter<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:20.860> poor<00:03:21.860> Andy<00:03:22.400> Bernard

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
Phyllis pam does not so that's how you

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.190 
Phyllis pam does not so that's how you
can<00:03:51.820> use<00:03:51.850> an<00:03:52.120> if<00:03:52.240> statement<00:03:52.450> now<00:03:52.840> I'm<00:03:52.990> going<00:03:53.140> to

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
can use an if statement now I'm going to

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.330 
can use an if statement now I'm going to
put<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.380> few<00:03:53.650> other<00:03:53.830> things<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.190> this

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
put a few other things in this

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.680 
put a few other things in this
spreadsheet<00:03:54.610> too<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.090> can<00:03:55.180> see<00:03:55.270> what<00:03:55.570> they

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
spreadsheet too so you can see what they

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.840 
spreadsheet too so you can see what they
are<00:03:55.810> particularly<00:03:56.380> these<00:03:57.010> comparison

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
are particularly these comparison

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.460 
are particularly these comparison
operators<00:03:58.420> that's<00:03:58.690> what<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:58.930> guy<00:03:59.110> is<00:03:59.140> called

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
operators that's what this guy is called

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.710 
operators that's what this guy is called
right<00:03:59.800> here<00:04:00.160> now<00:04:00.880> there<00:04:01.090> are<00:04:01.210> a<00:04:01.240> number<00:04:01.300> of

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
right here now there are a number of

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.630 
right here now there are a number of
those<00:04:02.050> you<00:04:02.290> can<00:04:02.470> actually<00:04:02.650> use<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:03.280> let<00:04:03.430> me<00:04:03.520> go

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
those you can actually use so let me go

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.760 
those you can actually use so let me go
ahead<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.880> list<00:04:04.270> those<00:04:04.540> really<00:04:05.200> quickly<00:04:05.530> now

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
ahead and list those really quickly now

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.620 
ahead and list those really quickly now
these<00:04:08.770> are<00:04:09.070> all<00:04:09.460> of<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.940> comparison

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
these are all of the comparison

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.350 
these are all of the comparison
operators<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.680> can<00:04:11.710> use<00:04:11.980> within<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.550> logical

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
operators you can use within the logical

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.250 
operators you can use within the logical
test<00:04:13.830> so<00:04:14.830> equals<00:04:15.460> to<00:04:15.730> greater<00:04:16.270> than<00:04:16.630> less<00:04:17.230> than

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
test so equals to greater than less than

now<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.660> is<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.020> pretty<00:04:36.380> quick<00:04:36.620> introduction

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
now that is a pretty quick introduction

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.870 
now that is a pretty quick introduction
to<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.490> if<00:04:37.820> statement<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.130> there's<00:04:40.130> one<00:04:40.460> more

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
to the if statement and there's one more

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.090 
to the if statement and there's one more
quick<00:04:41.240> thing<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.570> want<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.780> show<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:41.990> before<00:04:42.860> I

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
quick thing I want to show you before I

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.850 
quick thing I want to show you before I
let<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.430> go<00:04:43.699> in<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:43.940> tutorial<00:04:44.449> so<00:04:45.110> what<00:04:45.830> I

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
let you go in this tutorial so what I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.980 
let you go in this tutorial so what I
did<00:04:45.949> here<00:04:46.100> was<00:04:46.310> output<00:04:46.820> text<00:04:47.300> now<00:04:47.660> if<00:04:47.870> you

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
did here was output text now if you

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.529 
did here was output text now if you
wanted<00:04:48.169> to<00:04:48.289> output<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.919> number<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:50.060> do<00:04:50.389> not

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
wanted to output a number you do not

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.080 
wanted to output a number you do not
need<00:04:50.810> quotation<00:04:51.560> marks<00:04:51.889> so<00:04:52.460> simply<00:04:52.850> put<00:04:53.060> a

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
need quotation marks so simply put a

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.210 
need quotation marks so simply put a
number<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:57.259> don't<00:04:57.500> need<00:04:57.680> quotation

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
number in and you don't need quotation

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.480 
number in and you don't need quotation
marks<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:59.780> just<00:04:59.960> take<00:05:00.080> note<00:05:00.110> numbers<00:05:00.860> no

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
marks so just take note numbers no

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.980 
marks so just take note numbers no
quotation<00:05:02.090> marks<00:05:02.449> as<00:05:03.190> well<00:05:04.780> let's<00:05:05.780> create

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
quotation marks as well let's create

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.540 
quotation marks as well let's create
another<00:05:06.050> if<00:05:06.470> statement<00:05:06.500> right<00:05:07.070> here<00:05:07.310> that

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
another if statement right here that

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.760 
another if statement right here that
calculates<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.210> actual<00:05:08.750> bonus<00:05:09.289> amount<00:05:11.080> so

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.420 

let's<00:05:15.770> do<00:05:15.919> that

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
let's do that

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.080 
let's do that
and<00:05:16.990> equals<00:05:19.510> if<00:05:20.620> open<00:05:21.620> parentheses<00:05:21.880> let's<00:05:22.880> do

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
and equals if open parentheses let's do

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.260 
and equals if open parentheses let's do
our<00:05:23.120> logical<00:05:23.780> test<00:05:24.050> if<00:05:24.260> this<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:25.150> greater<00:05:26.150> than

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
our logical test if this is greater than

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.629 
our logical test if this is greater than
or<00:05:26.599> equal<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:28.570> 100,000<00:05:29.800> now<00:05:30.800> I'd<00:05:31.099> like<00:05:31.250> to<00:05:31.310> put

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
or equal to 100,000 now I'd like to put

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.230 
or equal to 100,000 now I'd like to put
a<00:05:31.669> formula<00:05:32.120> in<00:05:32.660> here<00:05:32.990> so<00:05:33.650> you<00:05:33.740> can<00:05:33.860> put<00:05:34.370> in<00:05:34.610> the

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
a formula in here so you can put in the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.420 
a formula in here so you can put in the
value<00:05:35.630> of<00:05:35.660> true<00:05:35.960> or<00:05:36.050> value<00:05:36.380> if<00:05:36.530> false<00:05:36.560> argument

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
value of true or value if false argument

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.810 
value of true or value if false argument
you<00:05:37.520> can<00:05:37.669> put<00:05:37.910> text<00:05:38.560> numbers<00:05:39.669> formulas<00:05:40.669> and

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
you can put text numbers formulas and

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.629 
you can put text numbers formulas and
functions<00:05:41.830> now<00:05:42.830> I'm<00:05:42.919> going<00:05:43.039> to<00:05:43.099> do<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.220> formula

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
functions now I'm going to do a formula

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.120 
functions now I'm going to do a formula
so<00:05:44.000> if<00:05:44.449> he<00:05:44.570> gets<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.810> bonus<00:05:44.990> how<00:05:45.560> much<00:05:45.830> does<00:05:46.099> he

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
so if he gets a bonus how much does he

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.230 
so if he gets a bonus how much does he
get<00:05:46.370> so<00:05:47.300> let's<00:05:47.389> say<00:05:47.659> he<00:05:47.870> gets<00:05:49.180> 0.05<00:05:50.180> so<00:05:50.530> 5%<00:05:51.530> of

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
get so let's say he gets 0.05 so 5% of

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.900 
get so let's say he gets 0.05 so 5% of
sales

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
sales

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.670 
sales
maybe<00:05:55.910> that's<00:05:56.150> high<00:05:56.330> but<00:05:56.660> just<00:05:56.840> a<00:05:57.050> sample

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
maybe that's high but just a sample

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.560 
maybe that's high but just a sample

enter<00:06:43.250> so<00:06:43.750> Andy<00:06:44.750> doesn't<00:06:44.930> get<00:06:45.110> a<00:06:45.140> bonus<00:06:45.350> so<00:06:45.950> it

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
enter so Andy doesn't get a bonus so it

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.840 
enter so Andy doesn't get a bonus so it
evaluates<00:06:46.460> to<00:06:46.640> false<00:06:46.669> and<00:06:47.419> outputs<00:06:48.200> false<00:06:48.850> now

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
evaluates to false and outputs false now

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.159 
evaluates to false and outputs false now
if<00:06:50.120> you<00:06:50.270> want<00:06:50.419> to<00:06:50.480> make<00:06:50.570> it<00:06:50.690> so<00:06:50.810> that<00:06:50.840> false

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
if you want to make it so that false

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.090 
if you want to make it so that false
does<00:06:51.560> not<00:06:51.740> appear<00:06:52.190> here<00:06:52.430> simply<00:06:53.180> double<00:06:53.510> click

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
does not appear here simply double click

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.820 
does not appear here simply double click
go<00:06:55.100> to<00:06:55.160> the<00:06:55.430> end<00:06:55.990> now<00:06:56.990> what<00:06:57.350> would<00:06:57.470> we<00:06:57.530> like<00:06:57.800> to

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
go to the end now what would we like to

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.520 
go to the end now what would we like to
put<00:06:58.220> if<00:06:58.370> the<00:06:59.330> if<00:06:59.570> function<00:06:59.840> turns<00:07:00.229> out<00:07:00.380> to<00:07:00.470> be

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
put if the if function turns out to be

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.390 
put if the if function turns out to be
false<00:07:00.910> nothing<00:07:01.910> so<00:07:02.180> two<00:07:02.260> quotation<00:07:03.260> marks<00:07:03.560> two

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
false nothing so two quotation marks two

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.280 
false nothing so two quotation marks two
quotation<00:07:04.970> marks<00:07:05.240> is<00:07:05.360> going<00:07:05.510> to<00:07:05.570> output<00:07:05.960> no

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
quotation marks is going to output no

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.920 
quotation marks is going to output no
text<00:07:07.000> just<00:07:08.000> like<00:07:08.120> that

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
text just like that

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.659 
text just like that
copy<00:07:10.680> this<00:07:10.979> down<00:07:11.220> and<00:07:13.070> we<00:07:14.070> can<00:07:14.220> see<00:07:14.340> how<00:07:14.490> much

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
copy this down and we can see how much

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:16.670 
copy this down and we can see how much
each<00:07:15.240> of<00:07:15.270> the<00:07:15.570> employee<00:07:15.840> is<00:07:15.960> going<00:07:16.139> to<00:07:16.350> get<00:07:16.500> as

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
each of the employee is going to get as

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.860 
each of the employee is going to get as
a<00:07:16.790> bonus<00:07:17.790> amount

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.620 

so<00:07:22.740> that<00:07:22.889> is<00:07:23.040> another<00:07:23.370> application<00:07:23.639> of<00:07:24.240> how<00:07:24.570> to

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
so that is another application of how to

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.480 
so that is another application of how to
use<00:07:24.840> the<00:07:25.080> if<00:07:25.290> statement<00:07:25.860> just<00:07:26.010> a<00:07:26.130> little<00:07:26.400> bit

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.490 
use the if statement just a little bit

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.250 
use the if statement just a little bit
different<00:07:26.850> but<00:07:26.940> instead<00:07:27.180> of<00:07:27.300> text<00:07:27.690> we<00:07:27.810> put<00:07:28.110> a

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
different but instead of text we put a

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.080 
different but instead of text we put a
formula<00:07:29.010> right<00:07:29.610> there<00:07:31.760> so<00:07:32.760> I'm<00:07:32.910> going<00:07:33.060> to

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090 
formula right there so I'm going to

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.820 
formula right there so I'm going to
leave<00:07:33.330> you<00:07:33.510> with<00:07:33.540> that<00:07:33.960> and<00:07:34.320> if<00:07:34.530> you'd<00:07:34.650> like<00:07:34.680> to
