00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.000
 in these days the password 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.560
 downsizing smaller car engines more 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.210
 read but also a downsizing of 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.400
 image you want to appear less in 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:17.599
 these moments of crisis and thus the bmw x6 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.970
 has a younger sister in the four winds 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.740
 centimeters less than the x6 not 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.230
 they are few but the unmistakable shape 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.570
 from the SUV coupe with low roof and wheels 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.179
 however, larger at the rear came 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.859
 the former quota is difficult to camouflage better 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.480
 choose the hicks line setup that 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.640
 makes it leaner with some profiles 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.440
 aluminum color and miniskirts less 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.840
 exaggerated compared to the four that it is 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.770
 he kept sports not even naked compared to 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.270
 four base between x4 remains 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.460
 a social climber like al 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.530
 sister excel but also a real gust 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.629
 trici is equipped in all its versions 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.699
 the xdrive all-wheel drive of a 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.039
 entire range of twinpower turbo engines 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.039
 between petrol and diesel 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.060
 the driving position is a little 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.680
 vertical from sv but vertical as far as 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.900
 can be vertical 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.400
 the driving position of a BMW is being 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.040
 above but the high center of gravity is made 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.350
 feel little with the former 4 that you really don't 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.240
 succubi precise and direct in throwing himself 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.070
 in the curves and without hinting a bow 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.750
 respect of its two tons of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.750
 weight also between curve and counter-bend 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.190
 sport between the treatments but turns around 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.990
 like an iron rod you will think for 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.759
 nothing x4 surprises me for his 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.860
 ability to float on the holes 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.860
 even if you wear 20-inch wheels 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.810
 if the 35's engine helps to put 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.000
 to test the frame with his 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.160
 exuberance deserves new attention 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.190
 2000 engine with a new crankcase 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.510
 lighter than two kilograms and with 190 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.330
 horses and the balanced charge choice 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.090
 115 kg less on the front wheels 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.190
 it is up to if cylinders and to power and torque 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.920
 enough to move the four more 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.900
 I would easily say as fast as I can 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.010
 enough to fully enjoy the excellent 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.010
 x4 chassis
