00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
how did Falco I had I thought I was dead

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
how did Falco I had I thought I was dead
over<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.180> back<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.600> now<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> knew<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
over that back here now I knew it the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.170 
over that back here now I knew it the
best<00:01:02.280> thing<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.520> could<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.699> done<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.120> he

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
best thing we could have done is what he

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.939 
best thing we could have done is what he
did<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.359> forward<00:01:03.719> me<00:01:03.750> immediately<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.439> think

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
did just forward me immediately I think

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.770 
did just forward me immediately I think
he<00:01:05.010> probably<00:01:05.040> died<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.210> back<00:01:06.570> here

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
he probably died up to the back here

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.870 
he probably died up to the back here
after<00:01:07.350> naked<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.010> next<00:01:08.340> level<00:01:08.490> pro

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
after naked that's that next level pro

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
after naked that's that next level pro
so<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:10.049> take<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.710> take<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> hip<00:01:11.159> we

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so you take you see like take the hip we

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.770 
so you take you see like take the hip we
smash<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> perfectly<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.750> just
