00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
but he was given the time and room

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.580 
but he was given the time and room
initially<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.570> hold<00:04:21.780> on<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.170> ball<00:04:22.380> but

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
initially to hold on to the ball but

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.260 
initially to hold on to the ball but
eventually<00:04:23.070> he<00:04:23.370> was<00:04:23.490> squeezed<00:04:23.790> that<00:04:24.060> bit

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270

eventually he was squeezed that bit
harder<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.930> task<00:04:25.170> became<00:04:25.500> too<00:04:25.770> much<00:04:25.800> I

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
harder and the task became too much I

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.010 
harder and the task became too much I
think<00:04:26.640> he's<00:04:26.820> got<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> little<00:04:27.450> quicker<00:04:27.810> in

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020
