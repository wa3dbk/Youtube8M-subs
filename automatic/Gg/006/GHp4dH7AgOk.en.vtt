the other pot let's put our butter so
this<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.740> same<00:01:45.920> formula<00:01:46.429> as<00:01:46.610> for<00:01:46.789> making

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
this is the same formula as for making

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.289 
this is the same formula as for making
your<00:01:47.569> sauteed<00:01:48.319> rice<00:01:48.590> if<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.369> recall<00:01:49.729> for

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
your sauteed rice if you recall for

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.120 
your sauteed rice if you recall for
every<00:01:50.509> one<00:01:50.659> cup<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:50.990> rice<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.200> use<00:01:51.619> two<00:01:51.890> cups

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
every one cup of rice you use two cups

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.660 
every one cup of rice you use two cups
of<00:01:52.280> water

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
of water

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.490 
of water
so<00:01:52.850> similarly<00:01:53.359> for<00:01:53.959> every<00:01:54.020> one<00:01:54.259> cup<00:01:54.469> of

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
so similarly for every one cup of

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.050 
so similarly for every one cup of
similarly<00:01:54.950> now<00:01:55.100> we're<00:01:55.250> using<00:01:55.399> two<00:01:55.700> cups<00:01:55.909> of

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
similarly now we're using two cups of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.209 
similarly now we're using two cups of
water<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.959> without<00:01:57.200> two<00:01:57.380> cups<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.740> water<00:01:57.950> there

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
water so without two cups of water there

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.669 
water so without two cups of water there
we've<00:01:59.149> got<00:01:59.179> our<00:01:59.329> one<00:01:59.630> cup<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.990> semolina<00:02:00.200> here

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
we've got our one cup of semolina here

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.109 
we've got our one cup of semolina here
now<00:02:00.859> how<00:02:00.979> similarly<00:02:01.369> now<00:02:01.489> is<00:02:01.610> now<00:02:01.759> going<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.030> be

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
now how similarly now is now going to be

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.630 
now how similarly now is now going to be
added<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:03.020> our<00:02:03.049> melted<00:02:03.500> butter<00:02:06.459> into<00:02:07.459> our

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
added to our melted butter into our

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.479 
added to our melted butter into our
melted<00:02:07.969> butter<00:02:08.500> goes<00:02:09.500> our<00:02:09.679> semolina<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:13.340> when

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
melted butter goes our semolina so when

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.920 
melted butter goes our semolina so when
you<00:02:13.579> add<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.849> semolina<00:02:14.060> you'll<00:02:14.420> notice<00:02:14.750> that

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
you add the semolina you'll notice that

roasted<00:04:06.790> flavor<00:04:07.240> also<00:04:07.780> which<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.290> find<00:04:08.590> very

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
roasted flavor also which I find very

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.120 
roasted flavor also which I find very
nice<00:04:10.200> let's<00:04:11.200> have<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.350> check<00:04:11.530> on<00:04:11.620> our<00:04:11.740> liquid

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
nice let's have a check on our liquid

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.940 
nice let's have a check on our liquid
here<00:04:12.460> it's<00:04:13.350> simmering<00:04:14.350> away<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:17.260> lid<00:04:17.470> stops

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
here it's simmering away the lid stops

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.820 
here it's simmering away the lid stops
it<00:04:18.100> evaporating<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:18.880> we<00:04:18.970> have<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.299> correct

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
it evaporating so we have the correct

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.030 
it evaporating so we have the correct
amounts<00:04:21.060> now<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.390> think<00:04:23.080> this<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.590> practically

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
amounts now I think this is practically

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.940 
amounts now I think this is practically
done<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:25.330> I'm<00:04:25.510> gonna<00:04:25.630> now<00:04:25.870> add<00:04:26.080> my<00:04:26.320> walnuts<00:04:26.680> and

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
done so I'm gonna now add my walnuts and

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.830 
done so I'm gonna now add my walnuts and
roast<00:04:27.580> them<00:04:27.790> for<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.030> few<00:04:28.240> seconds<00:04:28.630> in<00:04:28.720> our

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
roast them for a few seconds in our

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:38.130 
roast them for a few seconds in our
however<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.990> I'm<00:04:35.470> gonna<00:04:35.700> toast<00:04:36.700> them<00:04:36.970> in<00:04:37.960> with

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
however and I'm gonna toast them in with

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.450 
however and I'm gonna toast them in with
a<00:04:38.169> semolina<00:04:38.620> just<00:04:38.919> for<00:04:39.070> about<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.280> minute<00:04:41.460> now

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
a semolina just for about a minute now

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.190 
a semolina just for about a minute now
at<00:04:42.669> this<00:04:42.850> critical<00:04:42.910> stage<00:04:43.570> we've<00:04:43.840> got<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.080> do

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
at this critical stage we've got to do

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.409 
at this critical stage we've got to do
two<00:04:44.410> things<00:04:44.460> we've<00:04:45.460> got<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.669> turn<00:04:45.910> our<00:04:46.120> flame

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
two things we've got to turn our flame

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.260 
two things we've got to turn our flame
to<00:04:46.690> low<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.590> grains<00:04:47.890> and<00:04:48.370> we<00:04:48.790> have<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.090> turn

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
to low on the grains and we have to turn

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.600 
to low on the grains and we have to turn
our<00:04:50.220> gas<00:04:51.220> full<00:04:52.180> underneath<00:04:52.930> our<00:04:53.080> liquid<00:04:53.610> bring

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
our gas full underneath our liquid bring

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.480 
our gas full underneath our liquid bring
your<00:04:54.730> liquid<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.180> boil<00:04:55.390> like<00:04:55.600> so<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:56.490> now

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
your liquid to the boil like so and now

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.940 
your liquid to the boil like so and now
we're<00:04:57.700> ready<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:57.970> add<00:04:58.180> our<00:04:58.210> liquid<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.830> our

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
we're ready to add our liquid to our

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:15.710 
we're ready to add our liquid to our
grains

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.790 

add<00:05:16.720> liquid<00:05:17.139> to<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.470> grains<00:05:18.510> one<00:05:19.510> go<00:05:19.780> now<00:05:20.620> this

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
add liquid to the grains one go now this

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.370 
add liquid to the grains one go now this
is<00:05:20.889> a<00:05:20.919> very<00:05:21.160> critical<00:05:21.550> stage<00:05:21.940> also<00:05:22.380> keep

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
is a very critical stage also keep

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.189 
is a very critical stage also keep
stirring<00:05:24.100> that's<00:05:25.000> semolina<00:05:25.600> and<00:05:25.900> water

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
stirring that's semolina and water

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.870 
stirring that's semolina and water
mixture<00:05:26.860> which<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.220> now<00:05:27.370> very<00:05:27.639> quickly

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
mixture which is now very quickly

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.090 
mixture which is now very quickly
turning<00:05:28.240> into<00:05:28.449> our<00:05:28.630> finished<00:05:28.960> product<00:05:29.410> the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
turning into our finished product the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.879 
turning into our finished product the
however<00:05:30.310> and<00:05:30.669> first<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:32.470> will<00:05:32.590> have<00:05:32.740> this

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
however and first it will have this

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.080 
however and first it will have this
soupy<00:05:33.460> consistency<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:35.699> will<00:05:36.699> start<00:05:36.940> to

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
soupy consistency and it will start to

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.540 
soupy consistency and it will start to
spit<00:05:37.479> by<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.750> way<00:05:38.020> so<00:05:38.080> step<00:05:38.620> back<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:39.430> know

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
spit by the way so step back you know

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:47.690 
spit by the way so step back you know
that<00:05:39.729> you<00:05:39.820> don't<00:05:40.030> burn<00:05:40.240> yourself<00:05:44.580> stir<00:05:45.580> very

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
that you don't burn yourself stir very

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.590 
that you don't burn yourself stir very
rapidly<00:05:48.960> keeping<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.050> moving<00:05:50.200> all<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.650> time

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.920 

and<00:05:55.600> you'll<00:05:55.780> notice<00:05:56.020> that<00:05:57.479> the<00:05:58.479> hover<00:05:58.690> will

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
and you'll notice that the hover will

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.420 
and you'll notice that the hover will
start<00:05:59.260> to<00:05:59.500> thicken<00:05:59.830> up<00:06:01.560> and<00:06:02.560> it<00:06:03.100> reaches<00:06:03.400> a

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
start to thicken up and it reaches a

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.110 
start to thicken up and it reaches a
certain<00:06:03.639> stage<00:06:04.229> where<00:06:05.229> it<00:06:05.380> leaves<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.789> side

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
certain stage where it leaves the side

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:15.029 
certain stage where it leaves the side
of<00:06:07.539> the<00:06:07.930> pan<00:06:13.169> it's<00:06:14.169> fast<00:06:14.440> approaching<00:06:14.919> that

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
of the pan it's fast approaching that

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.740 
of the pan it's fast approaching that
stage<00:06:15.310> now<00:06:15.340> you'll<00:06:16.150> find<00:06:16.449> that<00:06:16.539> it<00:06:16.660> becomes

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
stage now you'll find that it becomes

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
stage now you'll find that it becomes
stiffer<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:18.010> harder<00:06:18.400> to<00:06:18.550> stir<00:06:19.500> see<00:06:20.500> that<00:06:20.650> how

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
stiffer and harder to stir see that how

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.360 
stiffer and harder to stir see that how
it's<00:06:20.889> coming<00:06:21.190> away<00:06:21.370> from<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.820> pan<00:06:22.060> one<00:06:22.960> lump

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
it's coming away from the pan one lump

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.800 
it's coming away from the pan one lump
this<00:06:24.370> is<00:06:24.550> a<00:06:24.700> few<00:06:24.910> seconds<00:06:25.270> away<00:06:25.330> from<00:06:25.450> being

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
this is a few seconds away from being

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.620 
this is a few seconds away from being
done<00:06:26.580> it<00:06:27.580> is<00:06:27.669> it's<00:06:27.820> coming<00:06:28.120> away<00:06:28.330> from<00:06:28.419> the

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
done it is it's coming away from the

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.080 
done it is it's coming away from the
side<00:06:28.840> of<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:29.020> pan<00:06:29.260> now<00:06:31.800> so<00:06:32.800> that's<00:06:33.460> done<00:06:33.760> turn

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
side of the pan now so that's done turn

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.020 
side of the pan now so that's done turn
off<00:06:34.180> the<00:06:34.360> flame<00:06:38.070> put<00:06:39.070> a<00:06:39.130> lid<00:06:39.370> on<00:06:39.400> there<00:06:39.700> and<00:06:39.880> let

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
off the flame put a lid on there and let

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.469 
off the flame put a lid on there and let
it<00:06:40.060> steam<00:06:40.450> for<00:06:40.660> about<00:06:40.690> two<00:06:41.050> or<00:06:41.169> three<00:06:41.200> minutes

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
it steam for about two or three minutes

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.390 
it steam for about two or three minutes
so<00:06:43.479> it's<00:06:43.599> been<00:06:43.690> about<00:06:43.870> five<00:06:44.139> minutes<00:06:44.169> now<00:06:44.680> and

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
so it's been about five minutes now and

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.210 
so it's been about five minutes now and
our<00:06:45.580> halvah<00:06:45.910> should<00:06:46.090> be<00:06:46.210> nicely<00:06:46.770> steamed<00:06:47.770> yes

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
our halvah should be nicely steamed yes

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.430 
our halvah should be nicely steamed yes
there<00:06:48.460> it<00:06:48.610> is<00:06:48.700> hot<00:06:49.000> gold<00:06:49.599> and<00:06:49.840> however<00:06:50.169> I<00:06:50.260> don't

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
there it is hot gold and however I don't

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.750 
there it is hot gold and however I don't
think<00:06:50.650> it's<00:06:50.770> going<00:06:50.889> to<00:06:50.950> be<00:06:51.070> very<00:06:51.280> difficult<00:06:51.430> to

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
think it's going to be very difficult to

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.029 
think it's going to be very difficult to
give<00:06:51.880> this<00:06:52.030> away<00:06:54.960> however<00:06:55.960> can<00:06:56.289> be<00:06:56.380> served<00:06:56.680> on
