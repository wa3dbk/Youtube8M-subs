00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
really good at it the other option would

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.160 
really good at it the other option would
be<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.380> release<00:02:47.160> content<00:02:47.490> anyway<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.300> the

be to release content anyway and the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
be to release content anyway and the
advantage<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:49.860> would<00:02:50.220> be<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.610> could

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
advantage to that would be that I could

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.180 
advantage to that would be that I could
play<00:02:51.000> right<00:02:51.210> away<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.470> sooner<00:02:52.830> after<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
play right away and the sooner after a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.070 
play right away and the sooner after a
