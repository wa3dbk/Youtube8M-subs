because on this game and you didn't even

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.970 
because on this game and you didn't even
gravity<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.989> them<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> can

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
gravity to do them all but you can

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
gravity to do them all but you can
needed<00:00:47.340> some<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.539> had<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.289> top

up on the building and there's steam

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.490 
up on the building and there's steam
visible<00:01:34.140> volts<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.290> Tony<00:01:37.290> Hawk's
