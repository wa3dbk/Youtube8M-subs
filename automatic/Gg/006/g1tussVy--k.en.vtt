00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.240
 hello everyone welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.919
 video tutorial on photoshop 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.410
 today we will see how to transform a 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.880
 trivial image like this in 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.320
 a much more appealing image like 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.839
 this 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:25.490
 you want to see and it is clear that this is 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:28.400
 much more elaborate, more beautiful in my opinion 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.180
 let's start by opening our own 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.640
 image to duplicate the level 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.640
 background with control j 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.989
 let's go to image in the image menu 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:50.989
 agius men's and then shadow highlights ie 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:54.019
 shadows and other lights we set the value 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.870
 some shadows about 40 percent 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:04.339
 then it always depends on the images in 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:08.720
 so as to increase exposure in the high 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:14.200
 lights always between 40 and 50 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.060
 this case I'd say 50 look at the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.750
 levels section and change the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.229
 normal to soft blend mode 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:30.110
 light could see the resulting image 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.520
 much more contrasted first hand there 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.840
 we will stop here we go back up again 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.200
 image agius mans of the satura.it ie 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.909
 poured a here 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.030
 maybe see if it has an effect anymore 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:51.350
 more captivating ancient than the usual 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.159
 photos now duplicate again 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.159
 background 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:02.180
 but in this case we go on the lo 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:07.119
 lasso tool and we create a selection 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:12.009
 do not be around our subject 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.009
 so precise the right oar afterwards 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:24.480
 created the selection we go on the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.310
 exposure adjustments is created 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.490
 automatically a layer mask 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:35.820
 for which we will need to use 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.550
 this effect only in the selection 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.360
 that we have created before we increase 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.610
 exposure to give greater prominence 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.380
 to our subject not much 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.800
 because otherwise a photo would result a little 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.410
 strange we say well as you can see 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.050
 unfortunately the selection is not much 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:04.470
 so let's take a brush 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.030
 black color and we color the parts that do not 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.030
 we are interested in making them disappear 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.200
 be precise in this case 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:30.780
 here here is here that is ours 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.629
 image is much more beautiful than before 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.390
 you want to see our subject is 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.579
 stand out respects first you want to see 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.610
 here it was very dark and here it is a lot 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:47.790
 accentuated last two steps are 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.060
 that of duplicating new me no 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.590
 if you supplicate ours again 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:59.849
 background go on wild image 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.209
 smens and photo filters that is the filters of the 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:06.620
 photo to see what you want and set 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:10.319
 various filters based on the photo based on 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.819
 what you like best to give a 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:19.109
 touch your imagination 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:22.440
 let's prefer this one here you can 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.539
 increase the density to give it 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:34.080
 I would say more color in this case 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:35.400
 around 49 percent is fine 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.950
 and check from the house and appreciate from 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.770
 luminosity because otherwise a bad one comes 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.110
 photo 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.860
 last thing to exalt even more 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:53.910
 our subject we go on 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:58.010
 crop cutter tool and we cut the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:01.710
 our photo just above the subject for 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.840
 enhance and remove unnecessary parts that 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.750
 you want to see with respect to the image 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.410
 initial this photo is really a lot 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:16.199
 more enjoyable and more beautiful 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:19.910
 we can see how it was before and 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:24.900
 like now thanks this video tutorial 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.460
 you will be able to see your own stand out 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.400
 subject to make a picture that 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.949
 before it was trivial boring much prettier 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.830
 and enjoyable 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:40.240
