and it's it's kind of exciting because

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.320 
and it's it's kind of exciting because
you<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> use<00:00:43.980> each<00:00:44.280> previous<00:00:44.640> year<00:00:45.120> as

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
you know you use each previous year as

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.860 
you know you use each previous year as
as<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:46.140> learning<00:00:46.410> experience<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.510> numbers

played this tournament very well so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.460 
played this tournament very well so
something<00:00:53.880> needed<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.300> change<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.440> I

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
something needed to change you know I

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.229 
something needed to change you know I
finished<00:00:55.829> 30th<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.880> last<00:00:57.060> year

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
finished 30th and I think last year

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.620 
finished 30th and I think last year
right<00:00:57.480> around<00:00:57.770> 14<00:00:58.770> 13<00:00:59.220> 15<00:00:59.880> somewhere<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.420> there

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
right around 14 13 15 somewhere in there

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.170 
right around 14 13 15 somewhere in there
both<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.860> which<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.130> extremely<00:01:02.280> frustrating

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
both of which are extremely frustrating

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.969 
both of which are extremely frustrating
for<00:01:03.329> me<00:01:03.390> because<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.870> put<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.080> whole<00:01:04.410> year<00:01:04.800> into

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
for me because you put a whole year into

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.100 
for me because you put a whole year into
preparation<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:06.360> something<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> finish

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
preparation for something and to finish

preparation for something and to finish
where<00:01:07.410> you<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:07.649> really<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.220> finish<00:01:08.460> is

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
where you don't really want to finish is

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.680 
where you don't really want to finish is

spent a lot of time at home working in

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
spent a lot of time at home working in
the<00:01:32.340> field<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.909> every<00:01:33.390> morning<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:33.990> out

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the field up every morning going out

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.510 
the field up every morning going out
there<00:01:34.500> even<00:01:34.619> though<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.830> had<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.010> lot<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> things

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
there even though I had a lot of things

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.649 
there even though I had a lot of things
going<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.840> putting<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.320> time<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
going on just putting the time in and

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.630 
going on just putting the time in and
then<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:40.170> realizing<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.010> I'm<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> go

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
then just realizing that I'm going to go

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
then just realizing that I'm going to go
out<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:42.150> aggressive<00:01:42.720> throw<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> shots

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
out there be aggressive throw the shots

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.830 
out there be aggressive throw the shots
that<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.190> throw<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.299> works<00:01:45.570> out

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that I think I can throw if it works out

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.170 
that I think I can throw if it works out
and<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.440> chance<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.920> win<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> end<00:01:47.460> so

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
and I have a chance to win at the end so

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.690 
and I have a chance to win at the end so
be<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.549> be

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
be it if I don't it's going to be

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.510 
be it if I don't it's going to be
disappointing<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.830> kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.400> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
disappointing but you kind of got to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.770 
disappointing but you kind of got to
look<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.909> from<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.299> bright<00:01:54.479> side<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
look at it from the bright side of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.090 
look at it from the bright side of
things<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.320> at<00:01:55.500> least<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:55.830> out<00:01:55.890> there

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
things that at least you're out there

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.530 
things that at least you're out there
giving<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.580> all<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.030> giving<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.390> best

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
giving your all and giving it your best

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.830 
giving your all and giving it your best
shot<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.470> think<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.310> getting<00:02:00.119> older<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
shot so I think just getting older and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020 
shot so I think just getting older and
learning<00:02:01.409> becoming<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.490> mature<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
learning becoming more mature and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.820 
learning becoming more mature and
becoming<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.450> better<00:02:03.570> professional<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
becoming a better professional is is the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.789 
becoming a better professional is is the
main<00:02:05.009> thing<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:09.320> think<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.590> take<00:02:10.769> a

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
main thing I think it's going to take a

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.110 
main thing I think it's going to take a
little<00:02:10.920> bit<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.160> getting<00:02:11.340> used<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:11.850> we've

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
little bit of getting used to but we've

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.390 
little bit of getting used to but we've
been<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.630> four<00:02:12.840> days<00:02:12.989> now<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.400> really

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
been here for four days now and really

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.360 
been here for four days now and really
kind<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.880> gotten<00:02:15.269> used<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.540> those<00:02:15.690> areas<00:02:16.370> they

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
kind of gotten used to those areas they

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.729 
kind of gotten used to those areas they
are<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:17.910> some<00:02:18.299> weird<00:02:18.660> areas<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.410> they're<00:02:19.590> also

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
are in some weird areas but they're also

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.350 
are in some weird areas but they're also

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
trying to save a par and then you go to

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.849 
trying to save a par and then you go to
11<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:51.049> it's<00:03:52.049> just<00:03:52.290> one<00:03:52.409> of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> hardest

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
11 and it's just one of the hardest

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.289 
11 and it's just one of the hardest
holes<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.190> course<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:53.669> they've<00:03:53.849> chintan

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
holes in the course now they've chintan

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.689 
holes in the course now they've chintan
then<00:03:54.479> they've<00:03:54.659> changed<00:03:54.959> hole<00:03:55.530> 12<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.159> par<00:03:56.430> 4

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
then they've changed hole 12 to a par 4

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.939 
then they've changed hole 12 to a par 4
as<00:03:56.849> opposed<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.299> being<00:03:57.479> a<00:03:57.629> par<00:03:57.840> 5<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.349> I'm

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
as opposed to being a par 5 so I'm

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.530 
as opposed to being a par 5 so I'm
really<00:03:59.159> looking<00:03:59.519> forward<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.879> that<00:04:00.000> section

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019

which<00:04:15.359> is<00:04:15.540> what<00:04:15.900> we've<00:04:16.049> been<00:04:16.199> dealing<00:04:16.349> with<00:04:16.650> in

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
which is what we've been dealing with in

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.710 
which is what we've been dealing with in
the<00:04:16.889> last<00:04:16.919> couple<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.549> years<00:04:17.609> but<00:04:18.359> just<00:04:18.389> trying

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
the last couple of years but just trying

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.159 
the last couple of years but just trying
to<00:04:18.780> be<00:04:18.870> aggressive<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:20.370> avoid<00:04:21.150> throwing<00:04:21.870> out

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
to be aggressive and avoid throwing out

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.140 
to be aggressive and avoid throwing out
of<00:04:22.289> bounds<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:22.740> if<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:22.979> do<00:04:23.039> able<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.820> make<00:04:24.000> us

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
of bounds but if I do able to make us

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.540 
of bounds but if I do able to make us
safe<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:25.010> that's<00:04:26.010> really<00:04:26.190> what<00:04:26.430> I'm<00:04:26.520> looking

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
safe so that's really what I'm looking

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.439 
safe so that's really what I'm looking
for<00:04:26.970> as<00:04:27.090> far<00:04:27.120> as<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:28.289> holes<00:04:28.470> go<00:04:32.030> tonight<00:04:33.030> and

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
for as far as the holes go tonight and

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.719 
for as far as the holes go tonight and
even<00:04:34.229> previous<00:04:34.949> years<00:04:35.130> I've<00:04:35.280> always<00:04:35.400> looked

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
even previous years I've always looked

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.240 
even previous years I've always looked
historically<00:04:36.300> at<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:36.720> scores<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:38.009> if<00:04:38.130> you

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
historically at the scores and if you

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.490 
historically at the scores and if you
were<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.370> look<00:04:38.490> at<00:04:38.699> three<00:04:39.000> years<00:04:39.300> ago<00:04:39.449> or<00:04:40.080> two

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
were to look at three years ago or two

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.890 
were to look at three years ago or two
to<00:04:40.860> USD<00:04:41.310> gc's<00:04:41.639> ago<00:04:41.940> when<00:04:42.210> we<00:04:42.300> played<00:04:42.539> stroke

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
to USD gc's ago when we played stroke

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.649 
to USD gc's ago when we played stroke
and<00:04:43.080> distance<00:04:43.469> straight<00:04:44.370> up<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.760> score<00:04:45.450> in<00:04:45.570> the

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
and distance straight up a score in the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:46.610 
and distance straight up a score in the
50s<00:04:46.139> was

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
50s was

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.560 
50s was
pretty<00:04:47.220> difficult<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.820> get<00:04:48.000> in<00:04:48.150> fact<00:04:48.389> there

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
pretty difficult to get in fact there

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.570 
pretty difficult to get in fact there
was<00:04:48.690> only<00:04:48.810> just<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.320> few<00:04:49.560> of<00:04:49.680> them<00:04:49.830> throughout

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
was only just a few of them throughout

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.469 
was only just a few of them throughout
the<00:04:50.820> tournament<00:04:51.350> last<00:04:52.350> year<00:04:52.650> was<00:04:53.490> we<00:04:54.060> didn't

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
the tournament last year was we didn't

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.240 
the tournament last year was we didn't
have<00:04:54.630> any<00:04:54.900> penalty<00:04:55.440> strokes<00:04:55.740> we<00:04:55.919> just<00:04:56.100> had<00:04:56.220> to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
have any penalty strokes we just had to

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.070 
have any penalty strokes we just had to
lose<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.669> distance<00:04:57.060> where<00:04:57.240> we<00:04:57.360> reshot<00:04:57.870> from

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
lose the distance where we reshot from

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.219 
lose the distance where we reshot from
the<00:04:58.199> previous<00:04:58.560> lie<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.100> 50s<00:05:00.090> was<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.449> norm<00:05:00.750> if

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
the previous lie and 50s was the norm if

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.689 
the previous lie and 50s was the norm if
you<00:05:01.440> didn't<00:05:01.650> shoot<00:05:01.800> in<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:01.979> 50s<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.610> were

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
you didn't shoot in the 50s you were

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.280 
you didn't shoot in the 50s you were
really<00:05:02.910> losing<00:05:03.360> soaks<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.930> lead<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.229> you

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
really losing soaks to the lead and you

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.530 
really losing soaks to the lead and you
really<00:05:04.500> had<00:05:04.620> no<00:05:04.830> chance<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.250> win<00:05:05.580> so<00:05:06.389> I<00:05:06.419> think

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
really had no chance to win so I think

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.330 
really had no chance to win so I think
it's<00:05:06.840> going<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.050> go<00:05:07.139> back<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.800> being<00:05:08.010> right

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
it's going to go back to being right

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.870 
it's going to go back to being right
there<00:05:08.610> in<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.030> middle<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:10.290> where<00:05:10.790> rounds<00:05:11.790> and

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
there in the middle to where rounds and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.760 
there in the middle to where rounds and
the<00:05:11.970> 50s<00:05:12.389> are<00:05:12.540> really<00:05:12.930> going<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.350> help<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.710> I

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
the 50s are really going to help you I

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.840 
the 50s are really going to help you I
think<00:05:13.860> they're<00:05:14.100> going<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.280> move<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.639> up<00:05:14.669> the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
think they're going to move you up the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.640 
think they're going to move you up the
leaderboard<00:05:15.150> but<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.110> round<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.860> 60<00:05:17.340> 61<00:05:17.850> 62

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
leaderboard but a round of 60 61 62

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.680 
leaderboard but a round of 60 61 62
which<00:05:19.650> with<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.430> with<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:20.940> change<00:05:21.330> on<00:05:21.510> hole

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
which with the with the change on hole

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.189 
which with the with the change on hole
12<00:05:22.020> is<00:05:22.350> now<00:05:23.010> got<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.370> 5-under<00:05:24.090> is<00:05:24.630> still<00:05:25.020> going

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
12 is now got a 5-under is still going

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.250 
12 is now got a 5-under is still going
to<00:05:25.289> be<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.860> really<00:05:26.760> good<00:05:26.970> round<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.600> keep<00:05:28.110> your

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
to be a really good round and keep your

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.350 
to be a really good round and keep your
kind<00:05:28.500> of<00:05:28.590> right<00:05:28.770> where<00:05:28.979> you<00:05:29.010> need<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.430> be<00:05:29.460> but<00:05:30.330> I

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
kind of right where you need to be but I

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.310 
kind of right where you need to be but I
think<00:05:30.449> of<00:05:30.810> round<00:05:31.199> in<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.500> 50s<00:05:32.010> 59<00:05:32.940> 58<00:05:33.360> 57<00:05:33.600> is

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
think of round in the 50s 59 58 57 is

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.140 
think of round in the 50s 59 58 57 is
going<00:05:34.949> to<00:05:35.010> be<00:05:35.100> a<00:05:35.130> really<00:05:35.430> good<00:05:35.639> score<00:05:36.000> that's

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
going to be a really good score that's

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.670 
going to be a really good score that's
going<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.389> move<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.690> up<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.900> scoreboard<00:05:37.229> and

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
going to move you up the scoreboard and

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.120 
going to move you up the scoreboard and
keep<00:05:38.280> you<00:05:38.430> in<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.610> hunt<00:05:38.789> to<00:05:38.940> win
