00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.529
 well here we are to present you the 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.179
 Irrigation system project 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.950
 automated by the pressure this is the 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.469
 power stage 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.389
 The first thing we're going to show you now 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.420
 are the bars that the different stops 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.720
 which has the power stage that 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.660
 simulates the start of a shot in this 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.210
 case we have an engine that is 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.160
 5.5 hp 4 kilowatts 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.800
 the variable speed drive that is the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.410
 active at 71 from the mechanic 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.930
 altium brand engines and we have us 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.210
 a simulator of impulse or signals of 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.600
 entry that replaces what would be 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.290
 plc orders where they will be given 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.620
 the normal stop start commands 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.769
 of emergency stop and stop by 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.329
 on each indicated temperature 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.329
 its luminous spotlights 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.200
 very well then let's give it 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.050
 the first test that is normal when 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.600
 the plc 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.780
 this 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.250
 gives the order receives the order of missing 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.290
 Water 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.450
 in the crops then gives the order of 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.450
 start so that the pump is activated 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.070
 as we see 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.790
 the start is programmed with a 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.580
 5 seconds ramp in 5 seconds 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 the engine reached its cool speed 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.980
 the maximum frequency that it has is 25 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.930
 exercise therefore you are not reaching 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.650
 the thousand 500 revolutions the engine is 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.650
 two walls by 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.810
 and we see what startup is showing me 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.450
 that is at the speed of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.820
 racing if for some reason it occurs 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.520
 a normal stop either because watering 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.560
 has already concluded or because an operator 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.560
 cut manually we will stop you 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.320
 we see that it indicates the stop and the engine is 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.260
 stop with a quick word is a 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.720
 trap that has been programmed so that 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.930
 in five seconds it's over now let's 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.600
 to simulate a stop by over 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.510
 temperature 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.360
 if we can sign here we will see the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.400
 state 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.400
 how it changes a lot 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.840
 as I fear now the start 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.080
 when it says the rum has already reached its 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.560
 speed here we see that we indicate the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.680
 frequency and we indicate the frequency 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.959
 maximum and public rne in this part of 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.750
 that is already your speed regime and 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.300
 let's finish the current that we 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.780
 we put as the limit and thermal of the 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.020
 engine 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.030
 also called eight-engine 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.520
 we are below the nominal without 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.520
 problems then we simulate the stop 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.080
 which stops the engine indicates the engine 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.030
 stopped the freewheeling mode wants 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.750
 say that it takes away the food and the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.750
 engine stops 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.350
 very well 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.730
 now finally the emergency stop 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.800
 which is a push button in the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.540
 practice would be for example a blow of 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.550
 fist that opens the circuit 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.440
 in this case the motor the drive is going 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.590
 to inject a current into the motor 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.510
 continues to make us induce 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.630
 tensions and stopping the march of 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.530
 engine 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.530
 we hit the target 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.780
 do not 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.970
 Once I reach the speed 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.440
 for the emergency and the engine is 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.780
 stopped in daya metro 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.230
 good 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.230
 of power
