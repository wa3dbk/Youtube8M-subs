00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
and this year any thoughts about it if

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.990 
and this year any thoughts about it if
the<00:02:02.330> NCAA<00:02:02.690> decided<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.380> Cole<00:02:04.160> Taylor<00:02:04.610> would

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
be the last match I think there's

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.070 
be the last match I think there's
definitely<00:02:09.759> an<00:02:10.759> honor<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.300> be<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.630> last<00:02:11.780> match

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.480 
definitely an honor to be the last match
I<00:02:12.320> think<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:12.650> means<00:02:12.890> people<00:02:13.070> think<00:02:13.400> it's

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
I think that means people think it's

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.030 
I think that means people think it's
going<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.670> be<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.820> good<00:02:14.000> one<00:02:14.210> which<00:02:14.830> means<00:02:15.830> that

your preparation obviously you've gone a

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.260 
your preparation obviously you've gone a
long<00:04:47.320> time<00:04:47.380> without<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:48.009> loss<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.759> was<00:04:49.150> just

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
long time without a loss I was just

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.570 
long time without a loss I was just
curious<00:04:49.449> about<00:04:49.930> how<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.139> personally<00:04:50.650> dealt

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580

with<00:04:51.789> a<00:04:51.820> challenge<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:52.660> now<00:04:53.289> we're<00:04:53.949> able<00:04:54.039> to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
with a challenge and now we're able to

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.650 
with a challenge and now we're able to
turn<00:04:54.460> it<00:04:54.490> around<00:04:54.699> here<00:04:57.419> obviously<00:04:58.419> there<00:04:58.570> was

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
turn it around here obviously there was

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.659 
turn it around here obviously there was
some<00:04:58.810> weaknesses<00:04:59.139> that<00:04:59.320> he<00:04:59.560> explained<00:04:59.889> some

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
some weaknesses that he explained some
