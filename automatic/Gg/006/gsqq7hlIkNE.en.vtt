away<00:06:23.950> from<00:06:24.040> from<00:06:24.640> the<00:06:24.820> issue<00:06:25.030> it's<00:06:25.900> that<00:06:26.640> when

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
away from from the issue it's that when

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.210 
away from from the issue it's that when
people<00:06:27.910> are<00:06:28.000> dead<00:06:28.270> they<00:06:28.690> should<00:06:28.930> stay<00:06:29.200> dead<00:06:29.440> he

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
people are dead they should stay dead he

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.490 
people are dead they should stay dead he
tells<00:06:30.490> them<00:06:30.700> that<00:06:30.760> they<00:06:31.270> should<00:06:31.300> not<00:06:31.630> be<00:06:32.080> here

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
tells them that they should not be here

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.190 
tells them that they should not be here
and<00:06:32.770> I<00:06:33.610> believe<00:06:33.910> that's<00:06:34.120> going<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:34.900> be<00:06:35.050> the

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
and I believe that's going to be the

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.260 
and I believe that's going to be the
objective<00:06:35.410> of<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:35.919> black<00:06:36.100> mantas<00:06:36.550> they<00:06:37.150> are

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
objective of the black mantas they are

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.820 
objective of the black mantas they are
going<00:06:37.510> to<00:06:37.690> target<00:06:38.340> characters<00:06:39.360> who<00:06:40.360> have<00:06:40.830> died

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
going to target characters who have died

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.650 
going to target characters who have died
and

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
and

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.470 
and
you<00:06:43.260> know<00:06:43.410> probably<00:06:44.280> try<00:06:44.670> to<00:06:44.700> take<00:06:45.120> them<00:06:45.330> back

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480
