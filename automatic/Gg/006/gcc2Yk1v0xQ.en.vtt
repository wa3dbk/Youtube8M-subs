00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
 one who sat at the door at least once in his life 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.310
 in the doctor's office waiting for the diagnosis 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.799
 I agree 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.620
 most cases are not so bad 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.740
 illness as ignorance of what is with you 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.820
 the worst thing happened to man 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.820
 waiting process 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.509
 same with cars heart 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:19.829
 stopped when the light comes on 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.470
 chihanchin 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.730
 think not about work 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.359
 for household chores it is not yet clear 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.169
 maybe just 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.339
 can not be the best way on the tow truck 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.259
 in advance 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.089
 work again by the public and 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:34.130
 at a glance 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.620
 scan all weaknesses 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.880
 car concern help question 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.720
 you know the future has already come 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.590
 time he has his control acc this 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 device open eyes but what 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 happens 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.420
 my goal as it is known marks a lot so 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.590
 Here are some little functions 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.050
 in just minutes we learned that 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.049
 light bulb that's all 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.159
 Mount of one of the knock sensors 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.309
 and for the time being you can even repair and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.509
 go we learned that the car is disabled 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.440
 rear both 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.160
 so fuel consumption in this 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.290
 seconds of time is 17 liters 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.480
 100 kilometers away so much more have learned 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.570
 and the main thing that children do not happen to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.810
 we learn about it even earlier than 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.610
 look at the monitor screen because 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.750
 nice to report any changes 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.380
 female voice 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.570
 process 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.420
 now 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.979
 we gladly are not just comfortable 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.710
 the device will be created in order to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.070
 put on sentence 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 besides directly 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.750
 saving on diagnostics why 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.140
 state 9700 rubles, we can now 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.729
 check bad faith 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.890
 directly at risk will not see 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.619
 completely different 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.689
 and too bad the board will require 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.689
 much in the world of serious costs 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.759
 and here is the gas station only says 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.909
 god ordered took advantage 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.090
 instrument failure 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
 ten years of work 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.650
 everything 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.539
 well need 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.350
 I believe that these meters 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.240
 and fuel quality shown onboard 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.939
 computer also tell in which 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.020
 mode is traditionally more fuel rate 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.890
 recall that consumption varies from 8 to 20 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.160
 liters per 100 kilometers to 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.700
 depending on driving mode 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.200
 that is, we can trace how 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.759
 noted the minister 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:22.779
 interfax center as a whole comes out 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.129
 commander in chief 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.459
 there is no benefit from it depends on 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.989
 the amount of exposure will be 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.840
 work to all the same of course 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.840
 be sure to be dedicated house 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 so important 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.159
 boost 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.159
 anonymously 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.259
 worth such onboard computers is ridiculous 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.209
 say which is more expensive 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.819
 it's ordinary you can talk about what it is 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.430
 the most advanced model in 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.519
 car shops can pick up three years 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.290
 Confucius for example if you know for sure 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.379
 I don't remember cues 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.889
 but I would still advise 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.799
 it turns out at least because here 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.609
 according to him, Putin 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.489
 will need 1 less amplified 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.019
 free console space 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:17.330
 not 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.920
 the location of the computer may 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.289
 become nearby objects and areas 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:23.279
 and install any model not 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:25.079
 makes a lot of work would not hurt 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.149
 buy a couple extra 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.199
 Parktronic sensors when u 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.029
 you will also be a skilled valet 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.339
 last up to two hours 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.589
 danger 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:37.539
 agree how it would be great if 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.670
 similar device was not only for cars 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.099
 but for the title man please 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.529
 remember that always 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.189
 It remains only in the pharmacy necessary 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.599
 the medicine asked something is not entirely clear what 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.319
 high tech world 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.049
 sixteen
