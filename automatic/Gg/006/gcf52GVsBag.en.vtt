00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.470
 but 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.880
 very very good critics gamers youtube 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.290
 for extending the best and good are 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.480
 making very very special video since 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.189
 as they read the title of the video are 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.200
 public premium accounts for which the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.610
 They were waiting with much anticipation and 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.680
 Well, I've seen that they do a lot 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.270
 missing since many channels suffer from 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.920
 shortcomings because they are not premium and what 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.440
 unique that you can upload your color to your 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.470
 channel is minecraft or videos or games 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.329
 of skywork from vp etcétera good well no 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.609
 they have the prize or have bought everything 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.500
 so well after that are they 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.960
 I'm going to give public premium accounts every 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.329
 night every time I can upload packs 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 from 15 accounts to 20 accounts so 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 I hope and enjoy them and do not use caps and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.100
 make them want the ways they want 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.320
 is most of these accounts of which 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.149
 subo enters the cuvée craft olimpo cap 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 of large servers but sometimes 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.350
 asks you to restart the server and everything 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.090
 It's good that you restart the game and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 reasons why someone is inside the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 auto he is inside the server with a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.610
 account but good can also be 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 because you're going to send the same places it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.820
 him because I do not know if they have noticed 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.290
 they find there are different lobbies 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.470
 for example there is one that is ground 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.080
 today sand there is one that is the normal one of 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.180
 ice and there are several good servers there 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.770
 like that different lobbies so 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.450
 well when I'm going to send you 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.700
 lobby where a person is already hosted 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.230
 with that account if the person that what 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.670
 has greater internet connection is going to 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.470
 send it to hell and it will not leave you 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.570
 enter the position that asks you since 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.920
 server reviews so good everything 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.720
 It is a matter of being forever to you 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 wax in the hand and the disadvantage of having 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.979
 accounts have public but the advantage 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.260
 is that you can play and record games of 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.060
 once in a while so good the only thing that 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.740
 it means is that if you want a 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.729
 premium account personal good the only thing 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.190
 what you have to do is subscribe to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.810
 this channel since there are probably several 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.180
 raffles and it 's there I'm thinking about 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.190
 make a series that are going to be raffles and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.869
 good the draws will be available 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.759
 for people who have more than one 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.220
 week old subscribed to me 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.110
 calm channel there appear how many 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.550
 days have subscribers and all that 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.470
 so good if you're looking through 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.209
 first time one of my videos and you want 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.489
 Earn a personal premium account or already 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.989
 be a personal game as we could 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.430
 subscribe to my channel and well then 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.730
 make a draw when you have the money 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.159
 enough to make a draw 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.150
 and simply and simply to people 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.709
 have more than a week of 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.049
 old with those of each day those that 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.700
 have a day or two or an hour then 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.409
 unfortunately they will not participate until the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.900
 next draw so good friends already 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.610
 They know what to do and without saying 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.930
 I'll leave until next time there are comments 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.209
 before sharing studies and then 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.400
 it's much more than a gameplay and see you 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.799
 until next time and there was a lot of talk and very 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.290
 quick is because I'm super anxious about 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.239
 the looming series so 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.840
 I hope and they are passing it on 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.069
 top 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.069
 I wish you an excellent excellent day 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.030
 late excellent night and we'll see you until 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.420

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.420
