boss fights been in development since

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.879 
boss fights been in development since
2006<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.449> there's<00:00:13.900> always<00:00:14.080> been<00:00:14.349> a<00:00:14.410> road<00:00:14.650> map

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
2006 and there's always been a road map

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.480 
2006 and there's always been a road map
and<00:00:15.099> a<00:00:15.129> plan<00:00:15.400> for<00:00:16.090> gen<00:00:16.570> 4<00:00:16.900> and<00:00:17.140> beyond<00:00:17.770> so<00:00:18.189> I

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
and a plan for gen 4 and beyond so I

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.279 
and a plan for gen 4 and beyond so I
like<00:00:18.730> to<00:00:18.849> think<00:00:19.029> of<00:00:19.210> frostbite<00:00:19.720> as<00:00:20.050> an

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
like to think of frostbite as an

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.859 
like to think of frostbite as an
evolutionary<00:00:21.070> process<00:00:21.669> and<00:00:21.910> frostbite<00:00:22.300> 3<00:00:22.570> is

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
evolutionary process and frostbite 3 is

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.749 
evolutionary process and frostbite 3 is
the<00:00:23.230> next<00:00:23.560> step<00:00:23.770> in<00:00:23.980> that<00:00:24.009> evolution

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
the next step in that evolution

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.299 
the next step in that evolution
frostbite<00:00:25.689> 3<00:00:25.869> is<00:00:26.020> a<00:00:26.050> really<00:00:26.650> powerful<00:00:26.829> tool

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:27.309 
frostbite 3 is a really powerful tool

is<00:01:59.250> really<00:01:59.520> about<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> concept<00:02:00.210> how<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:00.390> can

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
is really about the concept how you can

is<00:03:13.010> better<00:03:13.640> than<00:03:13.819> ever<00:03:13.970> before<00:03:14.390> we're<00:03:14.690> doing

is better than ever before we're doing

is better than ever before we're doing
subsurface<00:03:15.349> scattering<00:03:15.590> models<00:03:16.220> we<00:03:16.340> have

parallax<00:03:17.030> animation<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.170> iris<00:03:18.560> you'll

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
parallax animation in the iris you'll

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.430 
parallax animation in the iris you'll
notice<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.819> looks<00:03:20.120> like<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.329> real<00:03:20.659> I<00:03:20.900> you'll

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
notice it looks like a real I you'll

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.520 
notice it looks like a real I you'll
back<00:03:21.620> me<00:03:21.650> up<00:03:21.799> right<00:03:22.420> frostbite<00:03:23.420> 3<00:03:23.689> is<00:03:24.049> so<00:03:24.319> much

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
back me up right frostbite 3 is so much

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.960 
back me up right frostbite 3 is so much
more<00:03:24.709> powerful<00:03:25.010> than<00:03:25.220> any<00:03:25.400> engine<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.819> ever

more powerful than any engine I ever

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.599 
more powerful than any engine I ever
used<00:03:26.180> before<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.470> not<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:28.069> the

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
used before and it's not just the

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
specific features in the framework it's

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.500 
specific features in the framework it's
the<00:03:30.890> fact<00:03:31.099> that<00:03:31.250> we're<00:03:31.519> collaborating<00:03:32.180> with

other teams around the world in the past
before<00:03:35.780> we<00:03:36.200> have<00:03:36.379> the<00:03:36.650> frostbite<00:03:37.069> team<00:03:37.310> we

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
before we have the frostbite team we

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.339 
before we have the frostbite team we
were<00:03:37.609> building<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.269> new<00:03:38.420> engine<00:03:38.810> every<00:03:39.139> time

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
were building a new engine every time

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.080 
were building a new engine every time
and<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.739> were<00:03:39.799> kind<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.099> stumbling<00:03:40.519> constantly

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
and we were kind of stumbling constantly

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.110 
and we were kind of stumbling constantly
now<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:42.109> have<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.769> team<00:03:42.980> here<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.280> focus<00:03:43.760> on

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
now to have the team here to focus on

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.809 
now to have the team here to focus on
